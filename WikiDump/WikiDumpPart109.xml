      <text xml:space="preserve">==Amino Acid==
[[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|Amino acids]] are the building blocks of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]]. an amino acid consists of alpha carbon, which linked to an amino group, a carboxylic acid group, a hydrogen atom and a distinctive R group.these R groups varying in size, shape, charge, [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding ]]capacities,  [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic character]]and chemical reactivity; these characteristics give rise to their distinctive properties and activities.For all proteins, only L isomer( S configuration) are constituents of proteins. 
Amino acid exists as dipolar ions(zwitterions)in neutral solution. amino acid has both amine group and carboxylic acid group,so it has an acid and base on different ends. in the dipolar form, the amino group is protonated and [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Carboxyl|carboxyl]]group is deprotonated. 
Besides proteins synthesis, amino acid also has other functions such as metabolic intermediates and neurotransmitters. 

==Nucleotides==
Nucleic acids DNA and RNA are macromolecules that are composed of monomer units called nucleotide.  A single nucleotide is formatted with sugar, phosphate, and a base.  These three components create nucleotide which can link up into a linear formation.  There are many aspects to nucleotides.  First, the sugar group in the DNA monomer is called deoxyribose where the 2’ carbon atom of the sugar doesn’t have a oxygen group.  The sugar group of nucleotide is the reason for the phosphodiester bridges because it can be esterified to a phosphate group, specifically the 3’ hydroxyl group of the sugar.  On the other hand, the RNA monomer is composed of same components with exception to the sugar group and the base.  First, unlike DNA, RNA’s sugar group has a hydroxyl group attached to the 2’ end of the carbon ring.  DNA contains bases called purines and pyrimidines.  There are three purine bases: purine, adenine, and guanine while there are four pyrimidines: pyrimidine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine.  In RNA specifically, thymine is absent while uracil is present.  Same goes for DNA, absence of uracil and presence of thymine.

==Carbohydrates==
As one of the four major classes of molecules in biochemistry, carbohydrates include small sugar molecules such as table sugar to large polysaccharides such as starch in potatoes. Carbohydrates make up the majority of the organic matter on Earth and are an important source of energy, fuel and metabolic intermediates.  It also play an important role in the structure of RNA, DNA and major structural components of the cell wall in living organisms.  Furthermore, it can be bonded to the proteins and lipids, playing a role in cell to cell communication.


'''Monosaccharide'''

Monosaccharide is carbohydrate monomer. The name is derived from Greek word &quot;mono&quot;-single and &quot;saccharide&quot;-sugar. The simplest forms of carbohydrates are also known as aldehydes and ketones.  It has one or more hydroxyl groups as well as a carbonyl group.  The smallest possible monosaccharide is called trioses for it contains three carbons. A sugar containing four carbons is called tetrose. A sugar containing five carbons is called pentose. Many names for sugars end in the suffix -ose. Furthermore, there are two possible stereoisomer, D and L.  D and L are designated by the absolute configuration of the asymmetric carbon atom farthest from the aldehyde or keto group.

[[file:Family tree aldoses.svg|thumb|left|400px|Fischer projection of D-Aldoses that contains three, four, five, and six carbons.  The Numbers shown in blue represents the ordering of the carbon atoms while the numbers in red represents the asymmetric carbon for each Aldose.  ]]

[[file:Family tree of d-ketoses.svg|left|thumb|300px|Fischer projection of D-Ketoses that contains three, four, five, and six carbons.  The Numbers shown in blue represents the ordering of the carbon atoms while the numbers in red represents the asymmetric carbon for each Ketose.]]

The dominant forms of the monosaccharide are not an open chains, but ring forms because they are energetically stable.  The formation of ring structure is possible because of the fact that aldehyde can react with an alcohol to form hemiacetal.  Hemiacetal’s 2-carbon atom can react with either C-6 hydroxyl group or C-5 hydroxyl group to form five or six membered ring.

'''Disaccharide'''

Glycosidic bonds between two monosaccharides allow linkage into disaccharide. During the linkage, one monosaccharide gives up a hydroxyl group while the other monosaccharide gives up a hydrogen. This reaction is known as dehydration reaction.  There are three most abundant disaccharides called sucrose, lactose, and maltose.  Sucrose is also known as table sugar. It's often found in plants and can be obtained from sugar canes and beets.  An anomeric carbon of glucose and fructose are joined together into this disaccharide.  The configuration of the glycosidic linkage for glucose is alpha and beta for fructose.  Moreover, sucrose is not a reducing sugar because both of the components of monosaccharide are not converted into aldehyde or ketone. Maltose is made by linking two glucoses together by dehydration reaction. Lactose on the other hand is joined by glucose and galactose which are both beta configuration.

''' Polysaccharide '''

Oligosaccharide is composed of linkage of multiple monosaccharides called polysaccharides.  Polysaccharide is an important source of energy storage and plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of an organism.  When the polymers of the oligosaccharides are all the same, then it’s called homopolymers.  The most common type of homopolymer is called glycogen, which is a storage form of glucose.  Glycogen is large and branches as it is linked by alpha-1, 4-glycosidic bond and alpha-1, 6-glycosidic bonds.    Cellulose is another form of polysaccharide and unlike glycogen, it is found in plants.  Cellulose play an important part in structural reinforcement and is the most abundant organic compound found in the biosphere.  The unbranched polymer form is in beta configuration, beta-1, 4-linkage.  The beta configuration allows cellulose to organize itself into long straight chain.  Fibrils can be formed through parallel interaction between the chains.  In the other hand, the alpha configuration leads to a hollow helix instead of the straight chain, specifically alpha-1, 4 linkages.  Even though animals cannot digest cellulose, it is important component of dietary fiber, which decreases exposure of toxin to the animals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Water's Absorption of Heat==
Water is able to resist temperature changes due to hydrogen bonding. Specifically, in order for water to increase in temperature hydrogen bonds must break giving rise to the relatively high boiling point of water. Conversely, hydrogen bonds must form before the temperature of water may be lowered. This property allows Earth's bodies of water to maintain temperatures by storing heat from the sun and releasing heat when cooler conditions arise. 

==High Specific Heat==
Water has a high specific heat (the measure of heat energy required to increase the temperature of a unit quantity of a substance by unit degree) of 4.1813J/(g·K) and a high heat of vaporization (heat energy required to evaporate one unit quantity of a substance) of 40.65 kJ·mol−1. The consequence of this is that water is an excellent temperature regulator, being able to absorb and store a significant amount of heat before increasing in temperature and thus accommodate for environmental temperature changes and those caused by exothermic reactions within the body.

==Evaporative Cooling==
During the evaporation of water, fast-moving water molecules constantly collide and eventually escape from the surface. These escaping molecules carry heat along with their escape, causing the slower moving water molecules left behind to cool. Sweating is an example of this property, as the water molecules in sweat absorb the heat from the body and move faster, allowing them to vaporize.

==Configuring your Domain Name System==
In this chapter we will have a look at the Domain Name System which provides useful automation of service discovery.
===Configuration of your Nameserver===
We are going to have a look at a configuration for a zone called &quot;secure&quot;. If you would like to have a closer look at DNS, see [[w:Domain_Name_System|DNS]]. If you think in terms of subnets or other hierarchies you have to distribute the information where to find the services inside your network. You can do so by using a Domain Name System or LDAP. 

====Basic Configuration of your Nameserver====
&lt;code&gt;
options {

directory &quot;/var/named&quot;;

};

zone &quot;localhost&quot; {

type master;

file &quot;db.local&quot;;

};

zone &quot;127.in-addr.arpa&quot; {

type master;

file &quot;db.127&quot;;


};

zone &quot;0.in-addr.arpa&quot; {

type master;

file &quot;db.0&quot;;

};

zone &quot;255.in-addr.arpa&quot; {

type master;

file &quot;db.255&quot;;

};

&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;
zone &quot;ilm&quot; {

type master;

file &quot;db.ilm&quot;;

};

zone &quot;168.192.in-addr.arpa&quot; {

type master;

file &quot;db.192.168&quot;;

};
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;

zone &quot;secure.ilm&quot; {

type master;

file &quot;db.secure.ilm&quot;;

};

zone &quot;2.168.192.in-addr.arpa&quot; {

type master;

file &quot;db.192.168.2&quot;;

};
&lt;/code&gt;

After we defined the base structure we will have a look at the zones where computers interact.

== Basic Configuration of Kerberos Database ==

TODO: post configuration files of krb5.conf and kdc.conf

We start by initializing the Kerberos database for our principal via &lt;code&gt;kdb5_util create -r SECURE.ILM -s&lt;/code&gt;. Please note that it is VERY IMPORTANT to remember the password you type in.

 root@torpedo-bay:~# kdb5_util create -r SECURE.ILM -s
 Loading random data
 Initializing database '/usr/var/krb5kdc/principal' for realm 'SECURE.ILM',
 master key name 'K/M@SECURE.ILM'
 You will be prompted for the database Master Password.
 It is important that you NOT FORGET this password.
 Enter KDC database master key: 
 Re-enter KDC database master key to verify: 

We used the r switch in order to tell that we are using the '''R'''ealm &lt;code&gt;SECURE.ILM&lt;/code&gt; and the '''s''' switch because it is our intention to create the corresponding stash files.

As the Kerberos servers are still offline we can use the &lt;code&gt;kadmin.local&lt;/code&gt; tool for creation of the necessary administration accounts. We do so by

 root@torpedo-bay:~# kadmin.local
 Authenticating as principal root/admin@SECURE.ILM with password.
 kadmin.local:  '''addprinc afsadmin@SECURE.ILM'''
 WARNING: no policy specified for afsadmin@SECURE.ILM; defaulting to no policy
 Enter password for principal &quot;afsadmin@SECURE.ILM&quot;: 
 Re-enter password for principal &quot;afsadmin@SECURE.ILM&quot;: 
 Principal &quot;afsadmin@SECURE.ILM&quot; created.
 kadmin.local:  '''addprinc afsadmin/admin@SECURE.ILM''' 
 WARNING: no policy specified for afsadmin/admin@SECURE.ILM; defaulting to no policy
 Enter password for principal &quot;afsadmin/admin@SECURE.ILM&quot;: 
 Re-enter password for principal &quot;afsadmin/admin@SECURE.ILM&quot;: 
 Principal &quot;afsadmin/admin@SECURE.ILM&quot; created.

Now we need an account responsible for the creation of the AFS tokens. That key may be random. Again we use the &lt;code&gt;kadmin.local&lt;/code&gt; tool for that task. Please note that the name of our future AFS cell is identical to the name of our Kerberos realm.

 kadmin.local:  '''addprinc -randkey afs/secure.ilm@SECURE.ILM'''                          
 WARNING: no policy specified for afs/secure.ilm@SECURE.ILM; defaulting to no policy
 Principal &quot;afs/secure.ilm@SECURE.ILM&quot; created.

Because OpenAFS needs direct access to the keyfile we export it by
 kadmin.local:  '''ktadd -e des-cbc-crc:normal -k /etc/kdc/kdc.keytab.afs afs/secure.ilm'''
 Entry for principal afs/secure.ilm with kvno 3, encryption type DES cbc mode with CRC-32 added to keytab WRFILE:/etc/kdc/kdc.keytab.afs

You may start the services &lt;code&gt;KADM5 administration server&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Kerberos V5 KDC&lt;/code&gt; by
 kadmind
 krb5kdc

== Input and action ==

Please take a look into the discussion on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks_talk:Manual_of_Style#title_category_vs_subject_category Wikibooks talk:Manual of Style#title category vs subject category] and see if you can give some input on that. Another issue that is still pending on the verge of finding consensus is the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Restriction_of_image_uploads Proposal for restricting image uploads], I can't seem to understand the last remaining objections by [[User:Arlen22]], see if you can clarify or resolve his objection.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:46, 7 September 2009 (UTC)

:I moved the status of the proposal as adopted, check out compilation of agreed upon solutions and other tasks that are now pending to see if I missed something.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:22, 6 October 2009 (UTC)
== VFD and consensus ==

Not to pick a fight or even protest against the closing I disagree with. But I must be consistent and I have raised this point before so I will do it again and in &quot;private&quot; to you, if you see a need for a more general discussion on the subject fell free to start it.&lt;br&gt;
I think both of us agree that VFD discussions should fallow the established rules, that is clear but since the rules aren't that clear I take this change so we can establish what our view point on the issue at hand is.&lt;br&gt;
I remember Wikibookians stating the opinion that VFD isn't a vote (besides what it is stated in policy on on the very page of the VFD discussions) consensus is then the objective (I know consensus has not a single generalized meaning on Wikibooks, for my part I like the original and strictest interpretation). Because of that I strongly disagree with the closing of VFD discussion where a minority vote (whatever side the argument is defending) is simply disregarded, and the result is archived on the simple ground of numbers. After an opposing view is put forward, consensus requires the other party to at least attempt to reach a common ground or a mutual understanding of the divergences, I have always done so and IIRC you also have attempted to do so.&lt;br&gt;
If you don't disagree to anything I've said please avoid closing VFD discussions on majority votes, as this reinforces bad practices and by default will promote deletions.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:29, 6 October 2009 (UTC)
:Believe me that I would absolutely love true consensus where everyone raises their arguments, one side sees the other argument's merits, they consent to deletion, and everyone is happy.  For some reason there has been very little participation by people whose opinion I would appreciate having in a discussion lately.  Maybe it's their way of abstaining, but if a discussion has gone for a week, two weeks, even longer without further discussion and a majority of people are in favor of deletion for one reason or another, it seems that action should be taken at that time to bring closure to the situation.  

:If most are in favor and only one person dissents, how else can I interpret the situation except as having momentum toward deletion?  I will say this: the comment you refer to should have been reworded to not promote simple votes and maybe &quot;votes for deletion&quot; should be renamed.  I only value opinions for or against if supported by evidence or reasoned argument.  A simple &quot;oppose&quot; or &quot;support&quot; with no substantiation is, in fact, disregarded.  Your comments, however, are always backed up and therefore please understand that I take them seriously, even if I don't always agree or even if others don't share the same position on the issue. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:57, 6 October 2009 (UTC)

::I think it is also important to examine the point raised on the discussion even if by a minority (this promotes inclusion), and rely on the value of the argumentation. The argumentation is important, more than the positions taken, especially on the VFD were a bandwagon for deletion is easy formed (a proposal for deletion is in itself promoting for the outcome), it can be even cases that no one states a position...
::You can only attribute a momentum to a discussion for consensus if people are engaging each others argumentations and one side seems to be weaker, this is very rarely the case on most VFDs posts except for the most experienced users most simply state a position and often with no valid argumentation for it. Critical analysis of the works under VFD often require taking time to do it, and clearly it is easy to notice that some people don't really put much thought behind their positions or do so very inconsistently. This is not only a problem with VFDs almost all discussions on this project are subject to this behaviors for example the image proposal, the user blocking the adoption was basing his objection due to lack of understanding that the issues had been already covered if we had ignored his position things could turn very ugly or at least would erode future decission processes, this is also valid on the VFDs, creating exceptions will be more harmful and demolish the sense of community and inclusion, this has been very visible in past events where a minority position is disregarded. Since I have been in the project I never saw anyone blocking any decission process in bad faith, and each time minority positions were ignored the user in question was alienated from the project in various degrees some even stopped participating, since most people will not take the time/effort to defend minority views even if right. One other point of interest is that most people that take time to participate in discussions aren't the ones creating the content that makes the project relevant. Making how we deal with minorities views, a very important part on how we build the community up.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:38, 6 October 2009 (UTC)
== Fishing ==

after a long bout of inactivity.. I agree that the stub book ought to be merged with the only-slightly less stub book &quot;River fishing&quot;.  I'm still not sold that his stub book ought to cover something so dang broad as fishing.  In fact,Perhaps the whole topic doesn't fit with most users here!  some of this disconnect between what I like to do and other people's focus on this site is part of why i'm not so active here in the first place...

BUT... having defined something; I ought to do a better job at it.  well, appreciate the comment. I will attempt to talk to the &quot;fishing&quot; author, as well.--[[User:JoliePA|JoliePA]] ([[User talk:JoliePA|talk]]) 15:47, 7 October 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Translation is the process of conversion from genetic information (codons) to protein sequence(amino acids). Translation requires some components before synthesizing proteins. The components are the mRNA,tRNA,ribosomes,amino acids,and energy. 

The mRNA (messenger RNA molecule) is prepared during the [[Structural_Biochemistry/Nucleic_Acid/Transcription|Transcription]]. 
==Structures Involved==

===Transfer RNA===
We are told that amino acid and codon work together by the genetic code. However, tRNA plays a big role between amino acid and codon. The tRNA carries the correct amino acid to its ribosome. To do this, tRNA will need to be able to recognize both the codon and the amino acid that it is carrying. The tRNA has a 3D structure. On one end, there are nucleotides that are complementary to the codon; also known as the anticodon. On the opposite, tRNA is bound to the amino acid that corresponds to the codon. Every tRNA has a nucleotide sequence that binds to the amino aicd. Also, each tRNA has a helper tRNA synthetate which is an enzyme that binds the amino acid to the tRNA using GTP (stands for guanosine 5'-triphophate). This result in an aminocyl-tRNA complex.

===Ribosomes===
[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Ribosome|Ribosomes]] are known as the factories of the cell which is the protein primarily responsible for transcription. Now, we are putting them into actions. Ribosomes are composed of two subunits, one large and one small,that they only bind together during protein synthesis. The purpose of the ribosome is to take the actual message and the charged aminoacyl-tRNA complex to generate the protein. To do so, they have three binding sites. One is for the mRNA; the other two are for the tRNA. The binding sites for tRNA are the A site, which holds the aminoacyl-tRNA complex, and the P site, which binds to the tRNA attached to the growing polypeptide chain. 

===Amino Acid===
Each amino acid in the protein is coded by a set of three DNA bases, called a codon.  While each codon codes for only one amino acid, many amino acids are coded for by multiple codons due to the fact that there are 64 possible combinations of the DNA bases, but only 20 amino acids.  Three of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] are known as stop codons (UAA, UGA, UAG) and their function is to end transcription.  There is only one start codon (AUG), which also codes for the amino acid methionine.  The relationship between the codons and the amino acids is called the [[Structural_Biochemistry/Genetic_code|genetic code]].


==Poplypeptide Synthesis(Translation)== 
The synthesis has three stages: '''Initiation, elongation, and termination'''. 

===Initiation===
Synthesis begins with mRNA seeking out a small ribosome. They bind in the presence of initiation factors, and the small ribosome slides along the mRNA until it reaches a start codon (AUG).The initiation aminoacyl-tRNA complex, methionine tRNA (with the anticondon 5'-CAU-3'), base pairs with the start codon. At this point, the large ribosomal subunits joins the complex, completing the ribosome. The tRNA is in the P site at this point, because it is the only part of the growing polypeptide chain.
====Initiation Factors====
=====Universally conserved factors=====
[[File:PDB_1ah9_EBI.jpg|thumb|IF1]]
[[File:PDB_1d7q_EBI.jpg|thumb|eIF1A]]
'''IF1/eIF1A'''

Bacterial IF1 functions mainly to prevent tRNA binding to the A site, stabilize the mRNA binding by the small subunit, and stabilize the binding of fMet-tRNA/IF2/IF3 to the small subunit of the ribosome. IF1 affects IF3 by increasing IF3’s antiassociation activity and coordinates with IF2 on the ribosome for their simultaneous release after initiation procedure. eIF1A is the archeal and eukaryotic equivalent of IF1 and is identical in structure with the exception of an extra tail at the N-terminal and helix at the C-terminal, the function of which is not yet fully understood.

'''IF2/eIF5B'''

Universally conserved IF2 in bacteria and eIF5B in archaea are primarily involved in joining of the small and large subunits of their respective ribosomes. After subunit joining, the GTPase associated center of the large subunit causes the IF2 or eIF5B hydrolysis reaction that releases IF2/GDP or eIF5B/GDP along with IF2 or eIF1A. IF2 has been proven to help locate the fMet-tRNA in bacteria while no such process has been proven of the eIF1A in archaea or eukaryotes.

=====Other IF=====

'''IF3'''

The main role of IF3 is bacterial ribosomal association and dissociation as it works along with IF1 and IF2. IF3 is also involved in locating the start codon and helping to select fMet-tRNA. The carboxyl terminal section of IF3 at sufficient concentration can perform the function of the whole IF3 shown by cleaving the protein below the carboxyl domain. It acts as a competitor to subunit association by binding to the active site of the small subunit and inducing conformational changes.

'''eIF3'''

Although eIF3 is smaller and dissimilar in structure and sequence to IF3, it performs some similar functions. eIF3 is able to recognize AUG start codons and discriminate against non-AUG codons at its carboxyl end. It functions similarly to IF3 by binding to almost the site as the carboxyl domain of IF3 inducing dissimilar conformational changes. eIF3 differs from IF3 in that it does not help select Met-tRNA.

'''eIF2'''

eIF2 is a heterotrimer that is involved in the selection of initiator tRNA and binding of the Met-tRNA to the small subunit. An eIF2/GTP complex forms a ternary complex with Met-tRNA by direct binding whereas eIF2 with GDP or bound to a tRNA without the methionine residue is unlikely to form a strong ternary complex and dissociation is likely. The eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNA ternary compound binds to the 40S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes and following recognition the eIF2 is detached and recycled by hydrolysis of GTP. This GTP hydrolysis in eukaryotes requires an additional eIF5.

'''eIF4G'''

eIF4G is a large protein that forms the scaffold for the construction of the cap binding complex. It is also responsible for the recruitment of the 43S IC in forming the 5-prime cap that is required for efficient translation. It has also been shown the eIF4G binds to eIF3.

===Elongation===
Once the complex has been formed, the ribosome can slide along the mRNA, adding new amino acids as it goes. Hydrogen bonds form between the mRNA codon in the A site and the complementary tRNA anticodon. This fills the A site. We now have a charged aminoacyl-tRNA n both the A site and the P site. The enzyme, peptidyl transferase, uses the energy that was stored in the aminoacyl-tRNA complex when the amino acid was loaded (from GTP) to catalyze the formation of a peptide bond. The aminoacyl-tRNA used for this is the one in the P site. Now the tRNA in the P site is free, and there is still an aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site. This aminoacyl-tRNA has its own amino acid, which is now bound to a methionine. Translocation is necessary to add the next amino acid residue. The ribosomal assembly slides in a 5' to 3' direction along the mRNA. This moves the next codon into place in the A site. At the same time, the deacylated tRNA from the P site is moved to the E site displacing the previously deacylated tRNA and the aminoacyl-tRNA that is carrying out nascent chain moved from the A site to P site. The process is ready to begin again with an empty A site. 

In bacteria, the aa-tRNA is bound to GTP and elongation factor EF1A as a ternary compound before reaching the ribosome. EF1A is nonspecific and will bind to most aa-tRNAs based on varying levels of affinity for the tRNA or amino acid. Notable exceptions that have weak binding to EF1A include the intiator tRNA fMet-tRNA and Asp-tRNA. The homolog elongation factor eEF1A in eukaryotes has similar characteristics to EF1A. 

Non-complementary or non-cognate aa-tRNA/GTP/EF1A complexes have an equal chance of binding to the ribosome as the correct complementary 
aa-tRNA ternary complex. There are two exclusion methods to ensure the correct matching for aa-tRNA complexes with the mRNA. First, conformational changes in the aa-tRNA complex and the ribosome allow for the codon and anticodon to make initial contact. Non-cognate ternary aa-tRNA complexes will dissociate quickly and GTP hydrolysis by EF1A is unlikely to occur. Base pairing is obeyed up until the third base pair and thus nearly cognate aa-tRNA complexes are excluded by the universally conserved nucleotides 530, 1492 and 1493. 

After correct complementary matching of the aa-tRNA ternary complex and ribosome, the small subunit of the ribosome assumes a closed conformation that promotes GTP hydrolysis by EF1A. The second process of elimination of near cognate aa-tRNA occurs in the PTC (peptidyl transferase center). Near cognate aa-tRNA have a much lower rate of accommodation compared to rate of dissociation while cognate aa-tRNA have a very low dissociation rate compared to their association rate. These two methods of exclusion for near-cognate aa-tRNA combine to give very low percentages of mutation during elongation. 

A second elongation factor, EF2/GTP attaches to the ribosome at the same site as the aa-tRNA/GTP/EF1A ternary complex and induces translocation of tRNA and mRNA one codon down. The acceptor site of the tRNA is thought to move first from the A to P site followed by the movement of the tRNA anticodon and mRNA codon with the small subunit of the ribosome rotating against the large subunit. EF1A/GDP is recycled by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to reform EF1A/GTP while the dissociation rate of EF2/GDP is fast enough to allow EF2/GTP and EF2/GDP to exist in near equilibrium.


===Termination===
Translation has its own set of stop signs. If the codon in the A site is UGA, UAA, or UAG, it is known as a termination codon. Instead of a new aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the A site, a protein called released factor binds to the termination codon, causing a water molecule to be added to the polypeptide chain. The chain will then be released from the tRNA in the P site, and the two ribosomal subunits will dissociate and as well as increase the amount of protein that may be made from a single transcript, several ribosomes may translate a message at the same time. This is known as a polyribosome. 

==Differences Between Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes==
Due to prokaryotes' significantly smaller amount of DNA, translation happens only one protein at a time.  However, because prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, translation occurs at the same time as transcription.  In eukaryotes, one complete strand of mRNA can be translated by many ribosomes at once, thus drastically reducing the amount of time required to produce a feasible amount of proteins, but transcription and translation are separate events.  Transcription occurs in the nucleus and the mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm before translation can occur.

Also, prokaryotic ribosomes are similar in structure to eukaryotic ribosomes, but not identical.  Prokaryotic ribosomes are smaller (30S for the small subunit, 30S for the large, whereas for eukaryotes, it's 40S and 60S, respectively).  Thus drugs that prevent bacterial infection by stopping translation can specifically target the bacteria and leave the host cells to function normally.


== Evolution of Translation in Eukaryotes ==
Translation in Eukaryotes is highly regulated and are regulated by universal and lineaged mechanisms.  Recent discovery has yielded information that suggests that the mechanisms that regulate translation emerged at different times based on evolutionary need.  The evolution of eukaryotes thus paralleled the evolution of translation.  Some mechanisms evolved independently of translation but were later incorporated into it.  The thinking now by scientists suggests that the mechanisms that regulate translation may have been involved in other cellular processes and were later incorporated into translation.  This overall view has been dubbed by scientists as 'tinker' which involves co-opting and assembling molecules and regulatory mechanisms from other cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|Proteins]] are capable of executing numerous functions based on the versatility of their 20 different [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]]. Proteins are also covalently modified to change their functions via attachment of other groups besides amino acids. For example, to make proteins more resistant to degradation, acetyl groups can attach to the amino termini of proteins. Also, hydroxyl groups can attach to different proline residues which stabilizes fibers of newly synthesized collagen. Furthermore, many proteins, specifically those present on the surfaces of cells, acquire carbohydrate units from attachment of specific asparagine residues. Carbohydrates in the form of aspargine-linked (N-linked) or serine/threonine (O-linked) oligosaccharides are major structural components of many cell surface and secreted proteins. The process of attachment of sugar molecules (such as carbohydrate) to the protein is called glycosylation. Protein glycosylation is known as one of the major post-translational modifications with significant effects on protein folding, conformation distribution, stability and activity. This addition of sugars makes the protein more hydrophilic and therefore able to better participate in protein-protein interactions. Besides the addition of certain groups to amino acids, other special groups can also be generated by chemical rearrangements of side chains and the peptide backbone, for example by spontaneous formation and oxidation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Posttranslation modification is the process by which proteome complexity (the global collection of proteins) is built by diversification at both the mRNA level and after translation of mRNAs into proteins by covalent modification of specific proteins. There are two broad categories of posttranslational modifications. The first is the covalent addition of one of more groups, such as phosphoryl, acetyl, or glycosyl, to one or more of the amino acid side chains in a particular protein. The second is the hydrolytic cleavage of one or more peptide bonds in a protein by enzymes called proteases (protein hydolases). 
There are more the 200 kinds of posttranslational modifications and almost all of them occur by covalent addition of groups to side chains in thousands of proteins carried out by enzymes. These enzymes are proteins with catalytic activity dedicated to effecting the posttranslational modifications. There are many types of catalytic posttranslations, with about 500 proteases encoded in the human genome and over 500 protein kinases for covalent phosphorylations of proteins. Also, there are nearly 150 protein phosphates opposing and balancing the action of protein kinases. Furthermore, there is a small subset of proteins which undergo automodifications- modifications without the help of ancillary catalysts to effect covalent change. 

'''&lt;big&gt;Scope of Posttranslational Modifications&lt;/big&gt;''' 
The diversity of posttranslational modifications by the proteome can be plotted on multiple axis. One scope is the number of proteins modified and thus the number of modified proteins produced. These numbers can differ for a given protein. A second and third axis of scope of posttranslational modification is by the type of amino acid side chain modified and also the type of covalent chemical modification introduced by the posttranslational modification enzymes. In posttranslational modification, the chemical reaction is of enzyme catalyzed transfer of an electrophilic fragment of a co-substrate molecule onto a nucleophilic side chain of the protein undergoing modification. The chemical modification occurs when the attacking nucleophilic side chain of the protein transfers the electrophile. Therefore, common sites for posttranslational modifications are side chains of proteins that can potentially act as nucleophiles. 


'''&lt;big&gt;Reversible vs. Irreversible Posttranslational Modifications of Proteins&lt;/big&gt;''' 
Some posttranslational modifications of proteins are irreversible, due to the nature of the biological function enabled by the modification. The most irreversible modifications are the proteolytic cleavages undergone by all proteins during their life cycles. The removal of N-terminal signal sequences of all proteins passing into the endoplasmic reticulum during the first stage of eukaryotic cell pathways is also irreversible. Also note that some posttranslational modifications are freely reversible in vivo but not in vitro.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Halogens ==

'''The Halogens are:'''

*Fluorine (F)
*Chlorine (Cl)
*Bromine (Br)
*Iodine (I)
*Astatine (At)

The halogens are a part of the 17th group of the periodic table of the elements. The halogens have varying physical properties; at room temperature fluorine and chlorine are gasses, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid. On the other hand, they are very similar in their chemical properties. Any of the halogens will react with any of the alkali metals in a 1:1 ratio to form an alkali halide. Examples of some of these salt compounds are NaCl, LiF, and RbI.

'''Reactivity:'''

Halogens are extremely electronegative which means that they are highly reactive since they are only one electron away from filling their outer most electron shell.  The halogen fluorine is one of the most reactive elements and has to be handled with care.  The storing of fluorine is very difficult because it could react with glass if it has any water in it so it is usually stored in a container lined with a fluoride compounds.  Chlorine and Bromine can be used as a sterilizer by their high reactivity.  Iodine could also be used as sterilization for the skin.

Besides, halogens mean &quot;salt formers&quot; and the compounds that contain halogens are also called &quot;salts.&quot; All of the halogens have seven electrons in their outer shells, which give them an oxidation number of -1. Also, at room temperature, the halogens exist in all three states: liquid, solid, and gas. The gas state include fluorine and chlorine, liquid state include bromine, and the solid state include iodine and astatine.

== Fluorine ==

Fluorine's atomic number is 9.  It can make a single bond with itself.  It's characteristics are a poisonous yellow brown gas that is very reactive. At room temperature Fluoride in the gas phase.

Fluoride is the reduced form of fluorine and consumption of this ion can have toxic affects on the human body. Despite its toxicity, fluoride can be found in many everyday products including, toothpaste, vitamin supplements, baby formulas, and even public water. Many dental products contain fluoride in order to prevent tooth decay, but an over consumption can be fatal. Effects include birth defects, osteoarthritis, bone and uterine cancer, and skeletal fluorsis. Fluoride poisoning can be tested in medical laboratories by measuring the amounts of potassium and calcium in blood samples. Too little calcium and too much potassium may be signs that a person has been exposed to too much fluoride.

==Applications of Fluorine==
There are tons of compounds that involve the element fluorine and many of those compounds are useful for research. One such example is cryolite. Cryolite is a sodium-aluminium-flouride compound that is used in the Hall-Heroult Process, where one takes cryolite and combine it with molten alumina followed by electrolysation. This leads to a collection of aluminum metal at the cathode of the electrophersis. This is an industrial method to produce pure aluminum by using a fluoride precursor. Another important daily use of a fluorine compound is sodium fluoride. This compound serves two purposes in the sense that it is present in the enamel of the tooth in the form of fluoroapatite. By fluorinating the water, people who use the water would have the benefits of fluorine, providing extra strength to the teeth. The other major use is the active ingredient in toothpaste. In toothpaste, the sodium fluoride acts as an active ingredient to dissociate water. This dissociation causes the separation of the fluorine atom enabling it to be absorbed into the bone of your teeth, enhancing the strength. more complex compounds containing fluorine which are used both in the industrial setting and in household environments include polytetrafluoroethylene, most commonly known as Teflon. In addition many refrigerants use fluorine, as well as in fire extinguishing reagent and propellant in aerosal sprays.  

== Chlorine ==

[[Image:Chlorine-sample-flip.jpg|thumb|Chlorine gas.]]

Chlorine's atomic number is 17. It is abundant in nature since it is part of common salts, such as sodium chloride (NaCl).  In its elemental form it can be seen as a pale green gas. Chlorine is also in the gas phase at room temperature.

In biological systems, chlorine accounts for about 0.15% of the human body weight. Chlorine is primarily used in the production of hydrochloric acid which is secreted from the parietal cells in the stomach and is used in maintaining the acidic environment for pepsin. It plays a vital role in maintaining the proper acid-base  balance of body fluids. It is absorbed in the intestine and secreted through urine, sweat, vomit and diarrhea.

A deficiency in chlorine can lead to a condition called metabolic alkalosis where the pH of the blood is higher than normal. Symptoms include: decrease in ventilation, acidic urine, and excessive excretion of potassium.

Atomic chlorine can also be linked to the depletion of ozone. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are originally used in refrigerators and air conditioners, escape and rise into the stratosphere are then decomposed by UV light from the sun to form atomic Cl. The newly formed atomic chloride is then able to react with ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), thus depleting the ozone concentration in the stratosphere and forming oxygen gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

== Bromine ==

[[Image:Bromine.jpg|thumb|Bromine.]]

Bromine's atomic number is 35.  At room temperature it is a reddish-brown liquid.  The vapors from bromine are corrosive and toxic. Bromine is the only halogen that is liquid at room temperature.  It has a similarly colored vapor with an offensive and suffocating odor. It is the only nonmetallic element that is liquid under ordinary conditions, it evaporates easily at standard temperature and pressures in a red vapor that has a strong disagreeable odor resembling that of chlorine. Bromine is less active chemically than chlorine and fluorine but is more active than iodine; its compounds are similar to those of the other halogens. Bromine is soluble in organic solvents and in water.

== Iodine ==

[[Image:Iodine-sample.jpg|thumb|Iodine]]

Iodine's atomic number is 53.  At room temperature it is a dark purple-grey solid and is the heaviest element in a living organism. At room temperature Iodine exists as a solid.

Iodine is an essential mineral for the body. It is heavily used in the thyroid gland, but also can be found in breast tissue, salivary gland, and adrenal gland. Without iodine, thyroid hormones cannot be produce and this can lead to a condition called hypothyroidism. Without treatment, the thyroid gland will swell and produce a visible goiter. Children with hypothyroidism may develop mental retardation. In women, hypothyroidism can lead to infertility, miscarriages, breast, and ovarian cancer.
Thyroid problems have been common issue for many years particularly in middle aged women. Correlated studies have shown that iodine levels in the general population have been significantly decreased in recent years. Most salt has iodine and with current health problems, many people have been consuming less salt, and therefore in-taking less iodine.

==Applications of Iodine==
Due to its lower oxidizing power compared to fluorine and chlorine, there not as much applications of this halogen as compared to the ones mentioned above, as most of the applications of halogens are derived from their oxidizing power. Nonetheless, iodine has its applications in the medical field. The solution of iodine and potassium iodine forms the solution better known as &quot;Lugol&quot;s iodine, which is present in emergency safety kits for the purpose of disinfecting wounds and disinfecting water by killing bacteria that may be present. The other use of iodine in the medical field is te generation of certain thyroid hormones from iodine derivatives. Thyroid hormones such as thyroxine and triiodothronine are dependent on a source of a small amount of iodine. a deficiency of iodine would usually involve in the development in &quot;goitre&quot; or a swelling in the thyroid gland and the laryx. In order to prevent such a swelling, it is recommended to consume more seafood seeing as how the ocean water naturally contains more iodine, the sea life would contain more percent iodine if consumed and absorbed in the body. 
== Astatine ==

Astatine's atomic number is 85.  This element is radio active and was only discovered because radioactivity in nature.  Is is also the heaviest halogen but only small amounts are found at a time because it has a short half life.  It is just presumed to be a black solid. At room temperature Astatine exists as a solid.
An image of Astatine can be found here :[http://www.lenntech.com/images/Periodic-chart-elements/At-en.5.jpg Astatine]

'''Hydrogen halides'''

Hydrogen halides are HF, HCL, HBr, HI, and HAt which are very strong acids because the can dissociate completely into ions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Phosphorylation of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] side chains in posttranslational modification of proteins is incredibly evolved and is a method of creating diversity in the proteomes of eukaryotes. Protein phosphorylation also occurs in prokaryotes but is less pervasive in bacterial protein metabolism and regulation. Phosphorylation of proteins involves the addition of phosphate groups to a target protein via protein kinases to activate or inactivate a certain function in the body. Marking proteins by the addition of phosphate groups assigns the proteins a code, which can instruct the cell to perform a number of functions, such as to divide or grow. 
Side chains of proteins that are phosphorylated (addition of a PO4 group) most commonly are serine, threonine, and tyrosine, which reflects the nucleophilic behavior of their -OH side chains. Also capable of phosphorylation is the imidazole ring nitrogen of histidine side chains in proteins. The process of phosphorylation turns protein enzymes on/ off, which can either cause or prevent certain diseses, such as cancer or diabetes.  
Nearly one-third of all the potential 30,000 proteins in the human proteome are estimated to be substrates for phosphorylation at a particular stage in their life cycle of eukaryotic cells. Kinases are those ATP dependent phosphorylation enzyme catalysts, and protein kinases are the subset working on protein substrates. There are over 500 estimated kinases in the human proteome, which is termed the human kinome.
It is known that about 20-30% of the proteins in human body are phosphorylated. However, the problem is sorting out which of the 500 different kinases is responsible to the specific phosphorylation activity.


=== Protein Kinase A (PKA) ===

Protein kinase A is an enzyme that covalently attaches phosphate groups to proteins. It is also known as the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. An extremely significant characteristic of protein kinase A is its ability to be regulated by the fluctuation of cyclic AMP levels within cells. Essentially, protein kinase A is responsible for all cellular responses due to the cyclic AMP second messenger. Cyclic AMP activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates specific ion channel proteins in the postsynaptic membrane, causing them to open or close. Due to the amplifying effect of the signal transduction pathway, the binding of a neurotransmitter molecule to a metabotropic receptor can open or close many channels.

&lt;gallery&gt;
=== Protein Kinase B (PKB) ===

Protein kinase B regulates various biological responses to insulin and growth factors. Akt is another way to classify Protein Kinase B. Protein Kinase B is a serine-threonine-specific protein kinase that contributes to multiple cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, apoptosis, and cell migration. &lt;ref&gt;http://jcs.biologists.org/content/118/24/5675&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Protein Kinase C (PKC) ===

Protein kinase C catalyzes the process of signals mediated by phospholipid hydrolysis. It is activated by the lipid second messenger, diacylglycerol. This lipid second messenger serves as the key initiation for most protein kinase C's. Protein kinase C isozymes consist of a single polypeptide chain that possesses an amino-terminal regulatory region and a carboxy terminal kinase region. The isozymes are categorized into various groups: conventional protein kinase Cs which are regulated by diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and Ca^2+ in addition to novel protein kinase Cs which are regulated by diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine. Activation of GPCR's, TKR's, and non-receptor tyrosine kinases can lead to protein kinase activation by stimulation of either phospholipase Cs to yield diacylglycerol, or phospholipase D to yield phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol. Additionally, conventional protein kinase Cs are regulated by Ca^2+.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upch.edu.pe/facien/facien2011/fc/dbmbqf/pherrera/cursos/receptores/pkc-cocb97.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulation of enzymatic activity: p300/CBP ===

Phosphorylation is used in various enzymatic activities. For example, proteins p300 and CBP (CREB binding protein), when phosphorylated, increase the activity of acetyltransferase. Acetyltransferase then stimulates histone acetylation that promotes the transactivation of genes controlled by p300 and CBP activity. Conversely, phosphorylation can also be triggered by acetylation.

=== Protein Kinase Inhibitors in celling transduction and in clinical use ===


=== Protein Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition ===
The mutation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) can change the communication between cells to be more or less frequent and can cause the spread of diseases.  These diseases include various forms of diabetes and cancers. These mutations either enhance or detriment the rate of phosphorylation within the different proteins.

&lt;br&gt;The inhibition of  PTKs will help prevent the spread of these diseases and is believed to not cause much harm to the normal cells.  PTKs are inhibited through the usage of tyrphostins (TYRosine PHOSphorylation INhibitors) as they bind to the ATP or substrate of the PTKs.  These inhibitors were not supported at first as they were believed to block functions that were needed for the cell.  However, after extensive tests and trials, it was found that there were natural occurring inhibitors and were as selective as needed. Both ATP competitive and substrate competitive molecules are used to block the signals.

&lt;br&gt;The first inhibitors used were natural occurring;  these included quercetin, genistein, erbstatitin, and lavendustin.  However, these natural PTK inhibitors were not very effective as they were not very selective and also inhibited Ser/Thr kinaeses.  These served as the model for the design of more potent and selective PTKs. These were developed through the usage of ATP mimics and substrate mimics to test the competitiveness of the designed inhibitor.  One PTK that was developed was STI-571, which is effective in treating certain tumors.

&lt;br&gt;Gefitinib and Erlotinib are two PTKs that were developed to treat non-small cell lung cancel (NSCLC).

=== Death - Associated Protein Kinases ===
Death-associated protein kinases (DAPk) are kinases that regulate cell death and can also be used to induced cell death. DAPk has the ability to act as a tumor suppressor because it can sensitize cells to many signals that a cell encounters as it undergoes tumorigenesis. Its ability to suppress tumors shows that it plays a key role in tumor development. The study of how it’s expressed can function as a diagnostic tool to help scientists better evaluate disease in its severity, progression and other factors. However, excessive levels or increased activity of DAP kinases can be harmful and can contribute to diseases associated with the brain. 

One of the structural components of DAPk is a death domain, located on the C terminus of the protein kinase, followed by a tail of 17 amino acids rich in serine residues. These serine residues are a key feature of death domain-containing proteins. Deletion of this tail was determined to produce a mutant that showed more killing potential than if the tail were not deleted however, the C terminus tail negatively regulates the cellular functions of DAPk. These functions demonstrate that the death domain competes with the full length kinase.

*Boron (B)
*Silicon (Si)

*Tellurium (Te)

The semimetals are parts of group 13-16 of the periodic table of the elements. The semimetals, or metalloids, resemble metals in some aspects and nonmetals in other aspects. As such, most of their properties are intermediate among the elements. For example, their electronegativities and ionization energies generally lie between those of metals and nonmetals. Other properties such as boiling points, melting points, and densities vary widely. Semimetals are especially important for their intermediate level of conductivity, which makes them the basis of semiconductors.

== Introduction of Porous Silicon and Etching Procedure==
=== Introduction of Porous Silicon ===

Arthur Uhlir Jr. and Ingeborg Uhlir discovered porous silicon by chance in 1956. It took place at Bell Labs in the United States. Their experiments involved developing the surfaces and shapes of silicon; however, under several  test trials, the silicon being tested formed unwanted colored layers on its surface, such as black and red. This mishap was ignored and went unrecognized for over 20 years. 

Towards the end of the 1980's, the discovery of porous silicon was noticed by the scientific community. A research analyst named Leigh Canham commented that the discovery of porous silicon proved to have some effects and advantages to the quantam confinement. After experiments and tests were ran in the 1990's, results showed that the porous silicon was able to emit light in chemical dissolution. More interest evolved in the scientific community and a large amount of experiments were conducted throughout the rest of the 1990's.

The application of research area of Porous Silicon is actually based on Porous silicon dioxide chip, which normally has 40nm-70nm irregular holes on chip. Inside of holes, there are negative charges on the surface of oxidized porous Si. These negative charges have been used to bind protein using for medical purpose. The size of holes mainly depends on currency strength during the etching process. The resistance of silicon chip and surface area of silicon chip also affect the size of holes. The silicon chips are unstable in high pH. The pH condition higher than 7 will cause silicon chip dissolve. Silicon chip has stable and negatively charges surface between pH4~7.

Picture of porous silicon:

===Classification of porous silicon===
====Porosity====
The definition of porosity is the fraction of void within the pSi layer, which can be determined by weight measurement. The porosity depends on current density, HF concentration, and thickness of silicon layer. The range of porosity of silicon chip is between 4% to 95%. The porous silicon layer is more stable in medium to low porosity condition. The formula of porosity is:  P=[(V0-V)/V0 ]=[1-V/V0 ] =(1-P0 /P)×100 %

====Pore size====
Based on the sizes of silicon pore, porous silicon layer are divided to three categories: macroporous, mesoporous, and microporous.

macroporous is defined as pore width less than 2nm. 

mesoporous is defined as pore width between 2nm and 50nm.

microporous is defined as pore width larger than 50nm.

=== Procedure of Etching Silicon Chip ===
Example for 1.3cm*1.3cm silicon chip


Picture of Etching instrument of porous silicon: 

http://sailorgroup.ucsd.edu/research/images/etch_cell_schematic.gif


Preparation: 

Preparing Aqueous HF (48%), Ethanol (99.9%), highly doped p-type Si chip (normally has resistivity ranging from 0.0008 to 0.001 Ω-cm), a piece of aluminum foil, and Teflon etching cell with a platinum counter electrode.


Procedure: 

1, Obtaining 30ml HF and 10ml Ethanol, gently mixing the solution.

2, Cutting silicon chip into 1.3cm*1.3cm pieces, aluminum foil into 5.0cm*2.0cm piece.

3, Setting up the silicon chip in the order as picture shows and checking airtightness of the Teflon etching cell.

4, Putting the Teflon etching cell on the operation platform in etching area and adjusting position of etching ring and the Teflon etching cell.

5, Adding HF/ethanol mixing solution into the Teflon etching cell until it totally submerges etching ring.

6, Using computer software to set up time and currency strength, and then beginning to etch. (Normally researchers will etch twice times. First time only etching 5 seconds, and then rinsing chip, letting chip react with NaOH to clean the surface of silicon chip. On the second time, researchers will set up computer data as what they really want to obtain in research. As the chip introduced in the example, the currency strength that may polish chip is higher than 800mA.) 

7, Rinsing silicon chip twice in ethanol and drying the chip with nitrogen gun. (In order to reduce the damage caused in evaporate process, sometimes researchers will use pentane instead of ethanol, which has higher surface tension.)

8, Using computer software Fringe to obtain the data, and saving pictures for all chips in both air and ethanol situation. 

9, Oxidizing silicon chip into a tube furnace at 750 °C for 1 hour in air and then let it cool to room temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Posttranslation modification is the process by which proteome complexity (the global collection of proteins) is built by diversification at both the mRNA level and after translation of[[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Messenger RNA (mRNA)|mRNAs]] into proteins by covalent modification of specific proteins. There are two broad categories of posttranslational modifications. The first is the [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent]] addition of one of more groups, such as phosphoryl, acetyl, or glycosyl, to one or more of the amino acid side chains in a particular protein. The second is the hydrolytic cleavage of one or more peptide bonds in a protein by [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] called proteases (protein hydolases). There are more the 200 kinds of posttranslational modifications and almost all of them occur by covalent addition of groups to side chains in thousands of proteins carried out by enzymes. These enzymes are proteins with catalytic activity dedicated to effecting the posttranslational modifications. There are many types of catalytic posttranslations, with about 500 proteases encoded in the human genome and over 500 protein kinases for covalent phosphorylations of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]]. Also, there are nearly 150 protein phosphates opposing and balancing the action of protein kinases. Furthermore, there is a small subset of proteins which undergo automodifications- modifications without the help of ancillary catalysts to effect covalent change.

'''&lt;big&gt;Scope of Posttranslational Modifications &lt;/big&gt;''' 

The diversity of posttranslational modifications by the proteome can be plotted on multiple axis. One scope is the number of proteins modified and thus the number of modified proteins produced. These numbers can differ for a given protein. A second and third axis of scope of posttranslational modification is by the type of amino acid side chain modified and also the type of covalent chemical modification introduced by the posttranslational modification enzymes. In posttranslational modification, the chemical reaction is of enzyme catalyzed transfer of an electrophilic fragment of a co-substrate molecule onto a nucleophilic side chain of the protein undergoing modification. The chemical modification occurs when the attacking nucleophilic side chain of the protein transfers the electrophile. Therefore, common sites for posttranslational modifications are side chains of proteins that can potentially act as nucleophiles.

'''&lt;big&gt;Reversible vs. Irreversible Posttranslational Modifications of Proteins &lt;/big&gt;'''

Some posttranslational modifications of proteins are irreversible, due to the nature of the biological function enabled by the modification. The most irreversible modifications are the proteolytic cleavages undergone by all proteins during their life cycles. The removal of N-terminal signal sequences of all proteins passing into the endoplasmic reticulum during the first stage of eukaryotic cell pathways is also irreversible. Also note that some posttranslational modifications are freely reversible in vivo but not in vitro.

'''&lt;big&gt;Post-Translational Modifications in Circadian Rhythms &lt;/big&gt;'''

Circadian rhythms are the biological clocks that exist in living organisms. These clocks are produced by oscillations in gene expression. Transcriptions factors and negatively acting transcription factors control the expressions of certain genes in an organisms genome. [[File:Circadian rhythm labeled.jpg|thumb| An example of a circadian rhythm in humans based on day and night.]]
These factors are proteins in themselves, and are thus subject to modifications after they have been folded (post-translational modifications). Modifications made to these transcription factors effect the rhythms of the genes on which they act. The effects of post-translation modifications can be studied on the positive transcription factors as well as on the negative factors. As reported by Dunlap et al., modification by phosphorylation, either by kinases or phosphatases, on the positively acting transcription factors result in its degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Mehra A, Baker CL, Loros JJ, Dunlap JC. 2009. Post-translational modifications in circadian rhythms. Trends Biochem. Sci. 34(10):483–90&lt;/ref&gt; The same can be said about the negatively acting transcription factors, except that there are possibly non-degradative effects as well. For example, the negatively acting transcription factors can be phosphorylated by kinases and transported by these negatively acting factors in order to phosphorylate the positively acting transcription factors. The positively acting transcription factors, in turn, become inactivated.

'''&lt;big&gt;Non-transcriptional Oscillator (NTO)&lt;/big&gt;'''

Theoretical evidences and recent discoveries have proven that there is a possible connection between non-transcriptional oscillator (NTO) and transcriptional/translational feedback loops (TTFLs). TTFL regulates translational modifications and engages in many important cellular programming relative to the circadian rhythm. However, studies have shown that the TFFL is challenged by the emergence of NTO circadian rhythms in cyanobacteria. NTO in eukaryotes produce a a very influential rhythmic output that is present in all organisms. As a result, NTO and TTFL elements are paired cooperatively in circadian science.

 NTO and TTFL oscillators have history in operating separately, but evidence suggest that the coupling of the oscillators to function as a whole will be an evolutionary advantage. Linking NTO and TTFL enhances overall circadian performance. Mathematical and experimental data proved that the oscillators feed back to each other under habitual physiological conditions.

==Inteins==
An intein is a segment of protein that is able of excising itself and rejoining the remaining portions that do code for information, exteins, through a peptide bond. Splicing of inteins occur after translation, so inteins are present in the DNA template and mRNA strand, but are cut out from the final protein product. 
The precursor of the intein may from from one gene, or from two genes. In split inteins, the inteins come from two genes. An example of split inteins is in cyanobacteria where DNA E is coded by two genes, dnaE-n and dnaE-c. The dnaE-n has an N intein, while the dnaE-c has a C intein. The two inteins will both be spliced and the two extein regions, dnaE-n and dnaE-c, will be joined.

Macromolecules are large polymer chains. They are made up of many monomers linked together. There are four main categories of macromolecules: [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Carbohydrates|Carbohydrates]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Nucleic Acids (DNA)|Nucleic Acids (DNA)]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Lipids|Lipids]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Proteins|Proteins]]. The function of each macromolecule depends on their structure. Monomers are bonded together by a process called dehydration synthesis, while polymers are broken down by hydrolysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;big&gt;Quantifying Proteins&lt;/big&gt; ==

Knowing the quantity of a protein after each separation step is useful in checking the progress of purification and evaluating the technique's efficiency. Quantifying proteins also helps us understand how an organism functions as one. [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/Gel-Filtration chromatography|Several]] [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/Ion-Exchange chromatography|chromatography]] [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/Affinity chromatography|techniques]] rely on quantifying proteins by mass, with additional observables such as charge to provide further differentiation.


== Specific Activity ==

Because specific activity is a ratio of the enzymatic reactions of a particular protein to the total amount of proteins, quantifying a protein can be followed throughout a purification. The equation for specific activity can be modeled as: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac {\color{YellowOrange}total\ enzymatic\ activity} {\color{Green}total\ protein}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, as the total amount of protein decreases per step, the specific activity should rise. Generally, an assay performed will give the rate of reaction, in units such as micromoles per second.  Dividing this rate by the concentration of your enzyme preparation yields the specific activity of a protein.

Ideally, the end of purification should be consistent with a constant specific activity. The specific activity can be monitored and used to quantify a purification by analyzing several variables which are total protein, total activity, yield, and purification level.

== Yield ==


The concentration of a protein can be measured by immunological techniques such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Enzyme-Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA)|ELISA]] or [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Western Blotting|Western Blotting]] (the former being able to measure the quantity of protein present because of the direct proportionalities of reagents to proteins). 

Activity can be measured using [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Fluorescent Marker|fluorescent techniques]].

In order to determine how much activity is retained after each successive purification step in the crude extract, the yield can be calculated as &lt;math&gt;\tfrac {\color{Purple}new\ activity} {\color{YellowOrange}initial\ activity}&lt;/math&gt;. In order to convert this to a percentage, multiply the yield by (100). Also, it is important to note that in most cases, the amount of initial activity is always 100 %.

== Purification Level ==

By obtaining a value for the purification level, we are able to assess how much purity has increased. The purification level can be calculated by: (&lt;math&gt; \tfrac {specific\ activity\ calculated\ after\ each\ purification\ step}{specific\ activity\ of\ the\ initial\ extract}). &lt;/math&gt;


**** Important note:  a purification scheme turns is only successful when taking into account BOTH purification levels and percent yield. Experimentation can become fairly complex if there is a high yield with very little purification. This is because there is an indication that there are a vast number of contaminants/proteins that aren't of interest. On the other hand, a purification level is high while the percent yield is low, then it is fair to conclude that there isn't enough protein available to carry out the experiment.

== Total Number of Proteins ==
The amount of protein separated using chromatography or dialysis is determined by: &lt;math&gt; (concentration\ of\ protein\ of\ each\ fraction  \times fraction's\ total\ volume)
 &lt;/math&gt;

== Total Enzymatic Activity ==

The recovered volume's activity is determined by: &lt;math&gt; (fraction\ volume \times fraction's\ measured\ activity)&lt;/math&gt;

== Techniques ==
In addition to electrophoresis and immunological assays, the use of ammonium sulfate, ''(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', can also quantitatively evaluate a purification. Because ammonium sulfate is non-denaturing and very water soluble (it is high on the Hofmeister series), it is used to effectively precipitate proteins: at high concentration, the ammonium and sulfate ions absorb most of the water through hydroelectric attraction, leaving the proteins to aggregate and precipitate out. {{note|ProteinsStruc}} 

The mass of a protein can be measured using the sedimentation-equilibrium technique.  This method requires slow centrifugation of a sample in order to establish a balance between sedimentation and diffusion.  Unlike [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis|SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis]], which gives merely an estimate of the mass of dissociated and denatured polypeptide chains, sedimentation-equilibrium provides accurate mass measurements without requiring denaturation, thereby allowing the native structure of multimeric proteins to be left intact.  Furthermore, the number of copies of each polypeptide chain that are present in a multimeric protein can be determined based on the mass of the dissociated chains and the mass of the entire multimeric protein, as measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedimentation equilibrium, respectively.      

[[Structural Biochemistry/Protein sequence determination techniques/Mass Spectroscopy|Mass spectrometry]] is another accurate analytical technique for determining protein mass.  In this technique, atoms are ionized through a machine and passed through a vacuum into the detector. In which then, the time of flight (TOF) in the electrical field is directly proportional to the mass of the protein (or the mass-to-charge ratio).  Thus, the smallest protein in a protein mixture has the smallest TOF, whereas the largest protein has the largest TOF. This technique allows the identification and analyzation of molecules based on their size and mass. This approach however, does not entail too much information about the structure or conformation of a protein.

    Macromolecules consist of proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids. 
1) Proteins are made of smaller building blocks called amino acids. There are 20 different amino acids.  The chains of amino acids fold up in complex ways, giving each protein a unique 3D shape. 
2) Nucleic acids allow organisms to transfer genetic information from one generation to the next.
3) Carbohydrates have several roles in living organisms. Carbohydrate derivates are actively involved in fertilization, immune systems, the development of disease, blood clotting and development.
4) Lipids include fats, phospholipids and steroid. Lipids also have function in the body.</text>

SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis is a technique to separate proteins according to elctrophoretic mobility - a function of polypeptide chain length or protein mass). SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis can also be used to separate DNA and RNA molecules.

SDS stands for sodium dodecyl sulfate. &quot;SDS is an anionic detergent that disrupts non-covalent interactions in native proteins.&quot; SDS is used to create denaturing conditions to separate proteins by molecular weight and also confers negative charge to the proteins in proportion to its mass. By denaturing the proteins with SDS, proteins can be separated by their mass alone; without SDS, other molecular properties, such as a charge and shape, would interfere with the separation process (proteins that are strongly negative, for example, would move faster down a gel, even if they were larger, without SDS). In addition, a loading dye is introduced that helps bind the protein to the gel and make it more recognizable when exposed by UV light.

SDS-PAGE gives an estimates of the mass of dissociated polypeptides by the anions of SDS binding to the main chains of the polypeptide at a ratio of one SDS anion for every two amino acid residues. 
SDS-PAGE is unlike sedimentation-equilibrium technique because denaturing of the proteins is applied for SDS-PAGE for mass determination.

This technique is used to test the purity of interest proteins and the percentage of interested protein in the sample solution. 
This technique is rapid, sensitive and capable of high resolution compared to Gel-Electrophoresis because it can give a distinct band with as little as 0.1 micrograms of the protein when stained with Coomassie Blue and proteins that differ by 2% can still be separated. 

SDS-PAGE can also be combined with Isolectric Focusing to obtain very high resolution separations. Proteins are first isolated by their net charge accordingly, then simultaneously run a SDS-PAGE adjacent to the filtering compartment.

==Detergents==
Detergents are widely used to interrupt the hydrophobic interactions which can then destroy the lipid bilayer. Detergents are the most common types of agents used to solubilize transmembrane proteins. 

Detergents are small amphiphilic molecules that are more soluble in water than lipids. Sometimes their hydrophilic heads (polar side) can be charged as in SDS but can be nonionic  like octylglucoside and Triton. Detergents are monomeric in low concentration but form micelles in high concentration, after overcoming the critical micelle concentration. In order to keep the detergent monomer concentration constant, individual detergents go in and out of micelles. Detergents are very condition specific because they depend on the pH, salt concentration, and the temperature. Therefore detergents are very complicated to study.

Detergents help break the lipid bilayer by acting as a substitute. When the detergents are mixed with the lipids, the hydrophobic part of the detergent attaches to the hydrophobic head of the lipid bilayer making them soluble. If the detergent concentration decreases, the protein would not remain soluble.If more phospholipid were to be introduced, membrane proteins would form liposomes. Since the opposite side of the detergent is polar, the binding brings the membrane proteins into the solution as detergent-protein complexes. In this sense, the detergents acts as a capsule/substitute for the lipid membrane.

SDS, a strong ionic detergent, can solubilize even the most hydrophobic membrane proteins by attacking the hydrophobic core itself, which ultimately denatures the protein and can be used in a procedure known as SDS polyacrylmide-gel electrophoresis. The study of the protein function seems almost frivolous with the protein denatured but studies have showed that the protein can be renatured once the detergents are removed. Detergents are used commercially today to remove stains or proteins that stained clothes. By making the protein soluble, it is able to remove direct and other proteins from the clothes.

==BN-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis==
Similar to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is another useful method of protein purification that has allowed scientists to analyze membrane protein complexes in mitochondria, chloroplasts, microsomes, and bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VS6-4SP05KW-2&amp;_user=4429&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2008&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000059602&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=4429&amp;md5=50079a074f8ef867263bd29c67b195f4&amp;searchtype=a&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= '''Theobromine''' =

Theobromine (xantheose),  is a xanthine derivative and bitter alkaloid commonly found in cacao plants. It’s name is derived from the name of the genus of the cacao tree, and doesn’t contain bromine, as its name might indicate. It shares a similar structure to that of another well-known purine and xanthine derivative known as caffeine, except, it contains one more methyl group.  It was first discovered in the cacao plant in 1841, isolated in 1878, and synthesized from xanthine by Hermann Emil Fischer shortly thereafter.  In its pure form, it is a water insoluble, crystalline white powder that has a milder effect than caffeine. Since dark chocolate has higher concentrations of theobromine than milk chocolate, its beneficial effects are better attained from the less diluted dark chocolate.

[[File:Theobromin - Theobromine.svg]]
==Therapeutic Uses==
Theobromine is known as a diuretic, which promotes the removal of excess fluids accumulated in the body from edema, or the flushing of excess salts through the increase production of urine. 

It is also widely used as a vasodilator, which widens blood vessels and improves blood flow. This, in turn, helps reduce blood pressure, although it is reputed that flavanols have a bigger role in promoting that effect. 

A 2004 patent on the future use of theobromine for cancer prevention was granted due to recent research that revealed anti-carcinogenic activity. 


==Effects==
===Humans===
Theobromine has a weaker effect on the human central nervous system than caffeine because of its weaker inhibition effects on cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and its antagonism of adenosine receptors. As for its effect on the heart, theobromine stimulates it to a much greater degree than caffeine. It is cited as being involved in contributing to chocolate’s role as an aphrodisiac.

Since theobromine is a myocardial stimulator, it increases the heartbeat.  As stated above it also dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure by enlarging the vessels.  It is possible that theobromine might be able to treat cardiac failure since it has properties which allowing draining.  Ingesting too much theobromine could lead to some adverse effects.  Since it is a diuretic, it will increase the amount of urine produced in the person.  It could also possible cause nausea, restlessness, sleeplessness, and anxiety.

===Theobromine poisoning===
A helpful hint in responsible pet-keeping is to not feed dogs or cats cacao containing products. This is because they metabolize theobromine much more slowly than humans. Complications that arise from doing such an action is succumbing your pet to theobromine poisoning, which causes digestive issues, dehydration, excitability, and a slow heart rate. Larger quantities of theobromine can result in epileptic-like seizures and even death.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Crosslinking is one method that is used to study the interactions in [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] and is often called bioconjugation when referring to proteins. Crosslinking involves covalently attaching a protein to another [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|macromolecules]] (often another protein) or a solid support via a small crosslinker. A crosslinker, or a crosslinking agent, is a molecule which has at least two reactive ends to connect the polymer chains. The crosslinkers are usually reactive toward functional groups common on proteins such as carboxyls, amines, and sulfhydryls.

==Types of Crosslinkers==
===Homobifunctional Crosslinkers===

Homobifunctional crosslinkers are molecules that have the same reactive groups on each end of the crosslinker. Homobifunctional crosslinkers can give a good idea of all the interactions between molecules present in a solution or cell, but it can also cause unwanted crosslinks. The reactive ends are impartial and may crosslink a protein to an identical protein when interactions between different proteins are desired. Homobifunctional crosslinkers often also create intramolecular crosslinks.&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Proteomics/Protein_-_Protein_Interactions/Cross-linking Protein Interactions/Cross-linking. (2009, July 20). In Wikibooks, Proteomics. Retrieved October 25, 2009. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterobifunctional Crosslinkers===

Heterobifunctional crosslinkers are molecules that have different reactive groups on each end of the crosslinker. Heterobifunctional crosslinkers can be more selective in the crosslinks formed because the reactivity of each group can be chosen so that a specific protein will only bind to one end. A two-step process can also be set up to minimize undesired crosslinks. First a crosslinker is added to a solution with one particular protein and allowed to react. The protein with the crosslinker attached is then purified and added to a solution with a second protein that will form a crosslink with the other reactive group on the crosslinker. This new structure can then be analyzed using different techniques to see if the proteins connected, how many connected, or other desired information.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;&gt;[http://www.piercenet.com/Products/Browse.cfm?fldID=CE4D6C5C-5946-4814-9904-C46E01232683 Chemistry of Crosslinking (2009). In Thermo Scientific Protein Methods Library. Retrieved October 18, 2009. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crosslinker Reactive Groups==

There are a number of different reactive groups used in crosslinkers that are targeted towards different functional groups on proteins including carboxyls, amines, sulfhydryls, and hydroxyls. Crosslinkers are generally selected based on their reactivity, length, and solubility. Crosslinkers can also be spontaneously reactive upon addition to a sample or be activated at a specific time, generally through photo-reactive groups.

Although a crosslinker can be chosen to target only a certain type of functional group, most proteins contain several residues with each type of group. If multiple target sites are available for binding, the crosslinker will lose specificity and multiple crosslinked products will be formed. However, a crosslinker will only be able to bind if the target functional group is on the surface of the protein. Thus, protein folding will often block access to a number of possible reaction sites and allow for greater specificity in crosslinking.

===N-Hydroxysuccinimide Esters (NHS Esters)===

NHS esters react with amines to give stable amide groups. As such, NHS esters are useful for linking to the N-terminus or lysine residues on a protein. The reaction is generally carried out in slightly alkaline conditions (pH 7.2-8.5). However, the desired reaction competes with hydrolysis of the NHS ester. The rate of hydrolysis increases with increasing pH, so the pH of the buffer solution must be closer controlled.

[[File:NHS ester.png]]

===Imidoesters===

Imidoesters are reactive groups that form amidines with primary amines. Like NHS esters, imidoesters are useful for linking to the N-terminus of a protein or a lysine residue. The reactivity of imidoesters increases with pH and the reaction is generally carried out between pH 8 and 10. However, imidoesters become labile at higher pH, and are thus not as stable as NHS esters. Imidoesters are useful for linking membrane proteins and for probing lipid-protein interactions, as they are able to penetrate the cell membrane.

[[File:Imidoester reaction.png‎]]

===Carbodiimides===

Carbodiimides are not traditional crosslinkers in that crosslinker itself does not become part of the protein-protein complex. Carbodiimides instead covalently link two proteins directly together by forming an amide bond between a carboxylic acid group of one protein and an amine group of another. Because of the mechanism of carbodiimide crosslinkers, they are by nature zero length (they do not become part of the molecule) and heterobifunctional crosslinkers. EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) is the only well known carbodiimide crosslinker.&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Ethyl-3-%283-dimethylaminopropyl%29carbodiimide 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (2009, August 27). In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Retrieved October 25, 2009. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EDC reaction.png]]

===Maleimides===

Maleimides react with sulfhydryls at physiological pH to produce a stable thioether linkage, and are usually linked to a cysteine residue. Since there are often far fewer free sulfhydryl groups than amine groups on a protein, maleimides tend to be more specific than reactive groups that target amines. Also, since sulfhydryls are often involved in disulfide bonds, connection to a crosslinker often does not disturb the structure of the protein.

[[File:Maleimide reaction.png]]

===Haloacetyls===

Like maleimides, haloacetyls react with sulfhydryl groups at physiological pH to give a thioether linkage. The most common haloacetyls are iodoacetyls and bromoacetyls, and they react via a nucleophilic substitution of the halide by the sulfur of the sulfhydryl.

[[File:Haloacetyl.pdf‎]]

===Pyridyl Disulfides===

Pyridyl disulfides react with sulfhydryls to form disulfide bonds. They are active over a wide pH range, but pH 4-5 is optimal. Because a disulfide bond is formed, the linkage can be cleaved with normal disulfide reducing agents.

[[File:Pyridyl Disulfides.png]]

===Diazirines===

Diazirines are an example of a photo-reactive group. While most other reactive groups are spontaneously reactive upon addition to a sample, a photo-reactive group will be inert until activated by exposure to ultraviolet light. Diazirine analogs of methionine and leucine are typically incorporated into a protein and then photo-activated in the sample solution or cell. When activated, the diazirine will react with any protein within a few angstroms of the photo-reactive analog. This allows for protein-protein interactions to be captured and studied in live cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link Cross-link (2009, October 18). In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Retrieved October 25, 2009. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the structural modifications, the proteins made from diazirine analogs of methionine and leucine are still viable, although their growth is slowed slightly. This allows for the creation of photo-reactive proteins that lack toxicity. The amino acid analogs and the proteins they are incorporated in can thus be used to study ''in vivo'' protein-protein interactions without greatly disturbing the cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v2/n4/pdf/nmeth752.pdf Suchanek, M., Radzikowska, A., and Thiele, C. (2005) Photo-leucine and photo-methionine allow identification of protein-protein interactions in living cells. Nature Methods. 2, 261 – 268]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protein Crosslinking Applications==
	
Crosslinking is a good technique to learn more about protein-protein interactions. Frequently the interactions between proteins are too weak to notice normally, but with crosslinking the interactions can be solidified and detected easily. This could be useful in determining if certain proteins in a cell interact with each other and could lead to more information on how a cell functions. Another use of crosslinking is to attach proteins to solid stations to immobilize them in order to analyze them more easily. Crosslinking can also be used to attach a tag to a protein to help detect its presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;&gt;[http://www.piercenet.com/browse.cfm?fldID=7C913112-2B27-4771-877D-25E3115FB8E1 Overview of Crosslinking and Protein Modification (2009). In Thermo Scientific Protein Methods Library. Retrieved October 18, 2009. ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;&gt;[http://www.piercenet.com/browse.cfm?fldID=A33D2E1C-5D19-4A22-95A7-74F0AE9F036E Protein Crosslinking Applications (2009). In Thermo Scientific Protein Methods Library. Retrieved October 18, 2009. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosslinkers can be chosen with different lengths between the reactive ends which can help determine the distances between certain functional groups in a protein structure. For example: if several crosslinkers, with the same reactive ends but with different lengths, were added separately to a solution with the desired protein to be analyzed, then depending on which solution reacted one would be able to tell the distance between the functional groups of interest based on the crosslinker added.

===Protein-Protein Interactions===

Interactions between proteins can be determined using crosslinkers to essentially freeze two proteins together while they are interacting. This technique creates a stable protein pair that can be purified or studied via gel electrophoresis or Western blotting. It is most common to characterize protein-protein interactions ''in vivo'', where crosslinking can be performed at different times after a desired interaction has been initiated. The resulting crosslinks can give an indication of the interactions taking place in a cell during a response to some stimuli.

Another way of using crosslinkers to study protein-protein interactions is to use cleavable, labeled, photo-reactive crosslinkers to label any protein that interacts with a &quot;bait&quot; protein. The label may be a radioactive isotope or mass variant. A heterobifunctional crosslinker is usually used, with one end being linked to the purified bait protein and the other end being a photo-reactive group. The photo-reactive end can be activated at different times by UV radiation, which will cause it to immediately react with the first group it encounters - hopefully a protein or co-factor that is interacting with the bait protein. The crosslinker can then be cleaved, transferring the label to the other protein or co-factor.

===Structural and Subunit Analysis===

Crosslinkers can be used for the quantification of certain amino acids and for determining the number of and distances between subunits. Using multiple crosslinkers that vary only in length allows the distances between particular amino acid functional groups to be determined. This information can be used to determine the relative positions of amino acids in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. Homobifunctional crosslinkers that bind sulfhydryl groups can also be used to replace the disulfide bonds in a protein with non-cleavable linkages.

===Immunotoxins===

Crosslinkers can be used to link a toxin molecule to an antibody that is targeted at tumor cells. The antibody will bind to antigens on the surface of the tumor cell and the crosslinked complex is taken up by the cell. Once inside, the toxin is released and activated, killing the cell. To be effective, the crosslinked antibody-toxin must be stable and able to locate and target the correct cells ''in vivo''.

A cleavable crosslinker is needed for immunotoxins so that the toxin is released once inside a cell. SPDP is one of the most common crosslinkers used for immunotoxins and contains an NHS-ester and a pyridyl disulfide group. The NHS-ester is first linked to the antibody and then the pyridyl disulfide is linked to the toxin. Since many toxins do not have surface sulfhydryls, free sulfhydryls are created by reducing disulfide bonds. Some of the toxins used are ricin and abrin. 

===Protein-Protein Conjugation===

Protein-protein conjugates are used in a number of immunodetection methods such as ELISA and Western blotting. Usually, an enzyme is linked to an antibody specific for an antigen of interest. The antibody will bind to the antigen and the attached enzyme will catalyze a detectable reaction, indicating the presence of the antigen. Horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase are the most common enzymes used as they produce products that are easily detected by spectroscopy.

Small peptide antigens can also be conjugated to larger proteins for the production of immunogens. Immunogens are usually prepared by injecting animals, typically mice, with an antigen and collecting the antibody produced by the animal in response. Small peptides are often not large enough to produce an antigenic response in animals, so linkage to a larger protein can be necessary to create an effective antigen. 

===Solid-Phase Immobilization===

Crosslinkers can be used to attach proteins to solid supports by selecting a solid resin containing functional groups that one end of the crosslinker is specific for. Attaching a protein to a solid support allows for affinity purification and for protein analysis. Other biological molecules such as DNA can be attached to solid supports in a similar fashion. Although DNA crosslinking is hindered by the lack of functional groups usually targeted by crosslinkers, DNA can be modified by adding primary amines or thiols to specific bases to increase crosslinker activity.

      <comment>/* Sequencing Larger Proteins */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Determining the Composition of an Amino Acid ==
Edman sequencing is done best if the composition of the amino acid is known. To determine the composition of the amino acid, the peptide must be hydrolyzed. This can be done by denaturing the protein to its constituents, heating it to 110 ˚C and adding 6 M HCl for 24 hours. The amino acids can then be separated by ion exchange chromatography. Each amino acid in the protein can be identified by its elution level, the amount of buffer that was added in order remove the amino acid. . A ninjydrin or fluorescamine indicator dye is also added to the column, the amount of each amino acid in the protein can be identified by comparing the color intensity levels shown by each amino acid.  This way, the composition but not the sequence can be determined.

== Sequencing Amino Acids ==
A less useful way to sequence amino acids is to label the N-terminal. This can be done is to use Dabsyl chloride, which forms a covalent bond with the amine group, and also can be detected because of its fluorescent derivatives. A strong covalent bond is needed because it needs to remain stable when the protein is being hydrolyzed. After hydrolysis, the N-terminal can be determined; however, this method is not very practical because the protein is damaged by the hydrolysis conditions. This may lead to a lost in sequencing.


To solve the problem of damaging the protein by hydrolyzing conditions, Pehr Edman created a new way of labeling and cleaving the peptide. Edman thought of a way of sequentially removing only one residue at a time, which did not damage the overall sequencing. This was done by adding Phenyl isothiocyanate, which would react with the uncharged terminal group, and create a phenylthiocarbamoyl derivative with the N-terminal. The N-terminal is then cleaved under less harsh acidic conditions, creating a cyclic compound of phenylthiohydantoin PTH-amino acid. Chromatography can then be used to identify the amino acid in the cyclic compound.  This does not damage the protein and leaves at least two constituents of the peptide. This method can be repeated for the rest of the residues.

== Sequencing Larger Proteins ==
Larger proteins (ones that contain more than 50 residues) cannot be sequenced by the Edman sequencing because the peptides will no longer release a single amino acid at each step in the reaction.  The process becomes less efficient as more amino acids are removed from the chain, they become increasingly impure. A strategy called divide and conquer successfully cleaves the larger protein into smaller, practical amino acids. This is done by using a certain chemical or enzyme (cyanogens bromide or proteolytic enzmes) which can cleave the protein at specific amino acid residues. This cleaving method breaks the amino acid residues at predicted areas of the chain, so it is easier to determine its overall sequence at the end -*The separated peptides can be isolated by chromatography. Then they can be sequenced using the Edman method, because of their smaller size.

In order to put together all the sequences of the different peptides, a method of overlaping peptides is used. The strategy of divide and conquer followed by Edman sequencing is used again a second time, but using a different enzyme or chemical to cleave it into different residues. This allows two different sets of amino acid sequences of the same protein to be separated, but at different points. By comparing these two sequences and examining for any overlap between the two, the sequence can be known for the original protein.  Sometimes the original protein chain is actually several different protein chains and SDS-gel electrophoresis is used to count the N-terminal amino acids to determine the number of original chains.  Afterwards, urea or guanidine hydrochloride is used to denature the several polypeptide chains held together and then their individual sequences determined through the use of the aforementioned identification procedures.

Edman degradation is the process of purifying [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] by sequentially removing one residue at a time from the amino end of a peptide. 

[[File:EdmanDegradation.png|center|500px]]
To solve the problem of damaging the protein by hydrolyzing conditions, Pehr Edman created a new way of labeling and cleaving the peptide. Edman thought of a way of removing only one residue at a time, which did not damage the overall sequencing. This was done by adding Phenyl isothiocyanate, which creates a phenylthiocarbamoyl derivative with the N-terminal. The N-terminal is then cleaved under less harsh acidic conditions, creating a cyclic compound of phenylthiohydantoin PTH-amino acid. This does not damage the protein and leaves two constituents of the peptide. This method can be repeated for the rest of the residues, separating one residue at a time.

Edman degradation is very useful because it does not damage the protein. This allows sequencing of the protein to be done in less time.

==Bergmann Degradationn==
Another non conventional way of stepwise sequencing polypeptides would be through degradation of peptide bonds using benzyl chemistry. The process is carried in three major steps.
First, an acyl azide experiences a Curtius rearrangement when hydroxybenzene is added. The Curtius rearrangement is a two-step process, in the first step nitrogen gas is released which forms an acyl nitrene followed by the rearrangement of acyl nitrenes by the shift of an R-group generating isocyanate in a concerted fashion.
Second, The intermediate product, benzyl carbamate is generated in the process.
Lastly, The Carbobenzyloxy molecule acts as a protecting group which is cleaved by hydrogenolysis finally yielding a primary amide and aldehyde.
In summary, 
The process requires benzoylation, conversion to azides and treatment of the azides with hydroxybenzene; this treatment yields, via rearrangement to isocyanates, carbobenzoxy compounds which require hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reduction reactions to yield the final product.

== Composition of an Amino Acid ==
Edman sequencing is done best if the composition of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]] is known. To determine the composition of the amino acid, the peptide must be hydrolyzed. This can be done by denaturing the protein and heating it and adding HCl for a long time. This causes the individual amino acids to be separated, and they can be separated by ion exchange chromatography. They are then dyed with ninhydrin and the amount of amino acid can be determined by the amount of optical absorbance. This way, the composition but not the sequence can be determined

== Dabsyl Chloride ==
[[File:Dabsyl chloride.png|right|200 px]]
A less useful way to sequence amino acids is to label the N-terminal. This can be done by the use of Dabsyl chloride, which forms a covalent bond with the amine group, and also can be detected because of its fluorescent derivatives. A strong covalent bond is needed because it needs to remain stable when the protein is being hydrolyzed. After hydrolysis, the N-terminal can be determined; however, this method is not very practical because the protein is damaged by the hydrolysis conditions. This may lead to a lost in sequencing.

== Sequencing Larger Proteins ==
Larger proteins cannot be sequenced by the Edman sequencing because of the less than perfect efficiency of the method. A strategy called divide and conquer successfully cleaves the larger protein into smaller, practical amino acids. This is done by using a certain chemical or enzyme which can cleave the protein at specific amino acid residues. The separated peptides can be isolated by chromatography. Then they can be sequenced using the Edman method, because of their smaller size. 

In order to put together all the sequences of the different peptides, a method of overlapping peptides is used. The strategy of divide and conquer followed by Edman sequencing is used again a second time, but using a different enzyme or chemical to cleave it into different residues. This allows two different sets of amino acid sequences of the same protein, but at different points. By comparing these two sequences and examining for any overlap between the two, the sequence can be known for the original protein.

For example, trypsin can be used on the initial peptide to cleave it at the carboxyl side of arginine and lysine residues. Using trypsin to cleave the protein and sequencing them individually with Edman degradation will yield many different individual results. Although the sequence of each individual cleaved amino acid segment is known, the order is scrambled. Chymotrypsin, which cleaves on the carboxyl side of aromatic and other bulky nonpolar residues, can be used. The sequence of these segments overlap with those of the trypsin. They can be overlapped to find the original sequence of the initial protein. However, this method is limited in analyzing larger sized proteins (more than 100 amino acids) because of secondary hydrogen bond interference. Other weak intermolecular bonding such as hydrophobic interactions cannot be properly predicted. Only the linear sequence of a protein can be properly predicted assuming the sequence is small enough.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Eukaryotes Originated from Prokaryotes ==

Similar gene sequences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes suggests that they originated from a universal ancestor and evolved into separate domains billions of years ago. Prokaryote evolved to eukaryote through several stages. An ancestral anaerobic (without air) eukaryote cannot metabolize efficiently due to its inability to oxidized fuel completely. To improve its metabolism, the ancestral eukaryote ingest a bacterial genome that is aerobic (with air). An aerobic metabolism is more efficient because fuel is oxidized to carbon dioxide. Once the bacterium is engulfed by the eukaryote, it then multiples within it. This symbiotic system can now carry out aerobic catabolism; thus, transforming anearobic eukaryote to aerobic eukaryote. There are three major changes that occurred as prokaryotes evolved to eukaryotes. First, the mechanism needed to fold DNA into compact structure containing specific proteins and the ability to divide equally between daughter cell during cell division became more elaborate. Since cell are now larger, system intracelluar membranes developed to create a double membrane to surround the DNA. Lastly, early eukaryotes were incapable of carrying out photosynthesis or aerobic metabolism until an aerobic bacteria is introduced to form endosymbiotic and to eventually form plastids. They are similar in their metabolic reactions and in the way they produce energy, as well as in regards to what both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are composed of. To name some of their similarities, both have their cells surrounded by plasma membranes, both contain cytoplasm, and they both contain structures of RNA and protein called ribosomes. Though they are not alike in many other ways, their distinct differences result from DNA mutations that have occurred over time.

[[Image:Celltypes.svg‎|frame|center|Comparison of Eukaryotes vs. Prokaryotes]]

&lt;h3&gt;Eukaryotic Cells Evolved from Simple Precursors&lt;/h3&gt;
Major changes of the simple cells lead to the development of Eukaryotic Cells

1. Cells were able to acquire more DNA, therefore mechanisms that required to fold DNA strands into complexes with more specific proteins and divide into daughter cells (cell division)

2. Growth of Cells- the cells grow larger in size allowed intramolecular membranes to develop, which led the development of double membrane surrounding DNA
-RNA synethsis on DNA template from cytolasmic process of protein synthesis on ribosomes became possible

=== Prokaryotes ===
*Domain
** in the domain Bateria and Archaea.

*Structure:
[[Image:Prokaryotes.jpg‎]]
** Cell membrane: phospholipid bilayer that encloses the cytoplasm, serves as attachment point for the intracellular cytoskeleton and cell wall.
** Cell wall: rigid, outside of the plasma membrane. Its function is to determine the shape of the organism and to act as a vessel pressure, preventing over-expansion when water enters the cell.
** Nucleoid: analog to nucleolus of eukaryotes, nucleoid contains DNA, genetic material of the cell, but it is not enclosed by any membrane.
** Chromosomes: contains genetic information. Chromosomes make up nucleoid. Prokaryotic cells are haploid.
** Flagella: tail-like organelles in charge of movements of cells.
** Pili: shorter and thinner than flagella, used also for motility and adherence.

* Morphology of prokaryotic cells
Prokaryotic cells have a variety of shapes. These shapes are to describe, classify and identify microorganism. Some common shapes are:
** Cocci: spherical shape
** Bacilli: cylindrical or rod shape
** Spirilla: a curves rod long enough to form spirals
** Vibrio: a  short curved rod (comma) shaped
** Spirochete: long helical shape

* Cell division
** Prokaryotic cells reproduce through asexual reproduction. They usually are divided by binary fissions (breaking in half, forming two identical daughter cells) or budding (daughter cells grow out of the parent and gradually increase in size)
** Prokaryotic cells have their genes passed out completely to their daughter cells through mitosis. Genome is stored in chromosome.

* Bacteria and Archaea are the main branches of prokaryote evolution.
** Generally, Bacteria and Archaea are quite similar in size and shape. They share the characteristics of prokatyotes but are different in many key structural, biochemical, and physiological characteristics.

* Prokaryotes vs. eukaryotes cell
There are many difference between prokaryote and eukaryote cell.
'''In nuclear body''' of prokaryote, the nuclear body is not bounded by a nuclear membrane  while eukaryotic cell have a nuclear that is bounded by a nuclear membrane having pores connecting it with the endoplasmic reticulum.In prokaryotes, nulear contains a circular chromosome and there is no nucleolus while in side eukaryotic cell, a nucleolus is present with one or more paired, linear chromosome. 
'''Cell division''' in prokaryotic cell and eukaryotic cell is also different. In prokaryotic cell, the cell divided by binary diffusion and prokaryotic cell are haploid. In eukaryotic cell, cell division follows process of mitosis; haploid sex cells in diploid. '''Cell membrane''' in prokaryotic cell is a phospholipid bilayer which usually lacking sterols while eukaryotic cell membrane contains sterols. Eukaryotic cell membrane is capable of endocytosis and exocytosis while prokaryote cell is not. '''Cell wall''' is present in plant cell, algea, and fungi which belong to eukaryote. Cell wall of eukaryotic cell never composed of peptidoglycan. In prokaryotic cells, a few member of domain bacteria have cell walls which composed of peptydoglycan. Member of domain Archae have cell wall composed of protein or unique molecules resembling but not the same as peptidoglycan. In '''cytoplasmic structures''' of '''eukaryote''', the ribosomes are composed of a 60S and a 40S subunit forming an 80S ribosome. Internal membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuoles, and lysosomes are present. Chloroplasts serve as organelles for photosynthesis. A mitotic spindle involved in mitosis is present during cell division. A cytoskeleton is present. It contains microtubules, actin micofilaments, and intermediate filaments. These collectively play a role in giving shape to cells, allowing for cell movement, movement of organelles within the cell and endocytosis, and cell division. In '''prokaryote''', the ribosomes are composed of a 50S and a 30S subunit forming an 70S ribosome. Internal membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuoles, and lysosomes are absent. There are no chloroplasts. Photosynthesis usually takes place in infoldings or extensions derived from the cytoplasmic membrane. There is no mitosis and no mitotic spindle. They may contains only actin-like proteins that, along with the cell wall, contribute to cell shape.

=== Eukaryotes ===

* Domain
** in the domain Eucaryota

** Plasma membrane: A lipid/protein/carbohydrate complex, providing a barrier and containing transport and signaling systems.
** Mitochondrion: Surrounded by a double membrane with a series of folds called cristae. Functions in energy production through metabolism. Contains its own DNA, and is believed to have originated as a captured bacterium.
** Cytoskeleton

*** Chromatin: contains genetic information of cells (DNA)
**** Chromosomes: only visible during cell divisions.
** Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
*** Rough ER: A network of interconnected membranes forming channels within the cell. Covered with ribosomes (causing the &quot;rough&quot; appearance) which are in the process of synthesizing proteins for secretion or localization in membranes.
*** Smooth ER: A network of interconnected membranes forming channels within the cell. A site for synthesis and metabolism of lipids. Also contains enzymes for detoxifying chemicals including drugs and pesticides.
** Golgi apparatus: A series of stacked membranes.
** Lysosome: A membrane bound organelle that is responsible for degrading proteins and membranes in the cell, and also helps degrade materials ingested by the cell.

There are many difference between prokaryote and eukaryote cell.
In nuclear body of prokaryote, the nuclear body is not bounded by a nuclear membrane while eukaryotic cell have a nuclear that is bounded by a nuclear membrane having pores connecting it with the endoplasmic reticulum. In prokaryote, the cell is covered by cell envelope, a structure varies with type of bacteria, while in eukaryote cell, there is cell membrane to separate the cell from outside environment and regulates movements of materials in and out of the cells. Circular, unorganized DNA molecule is located in nucleoid of prokaryote; on the other hand, linear DNA that is organized by histones is located in nucleus of eukaryote which the protector of nuclear envelope. In prokaryotes, the nuclear body contains a circular chromosome with the lack of histones (unwounded DNA). There is no nucleolus eukaryotic chromosome but a nucleolus, which is present with one or more paired, linear chromosome containing histones. This says that the DNA of eukaryotic cells are organized in nucleus and the DNA of prokaryotes cells are unorganized and floats free in the nucleolus. Eukaryotes sex cell and prokaryotes cell both have flagella, organelle that helps the cell move. Prokaryote's flagella is consist of two protein building block while eukaryote's flagella is complex and consisting of multiple microtubules. Eukaryotes have many organelles in cells such as mtochondria, golgi, lysosomes.... besides ribosomes, there is no organelles in prokaryotes. Prokaryotic cell on average are usually ten times smaller than eukaryotic cell. Cell division in prokaryotic cell and eukaryotic cell is also different. In prokaryotic cell, the cell divided by binary diffusion and prokaryotic cell are haploid. In eukaryotic cell, cell division follows process of mitosis; haploid sex cells in diploid. Cell membrane in prokaryotic cell is a phospholipid bilayer which usually lacking sterols while eukaryotic cell membrane contains sterols. Eukaryotic cell membrane is capable of endocytosis and exocytosis while prokaryote cell is not. Cell wall is present in plant cell, algea, and fungi which belong to eukaryote. Cell wall of eukaryotic cell never composed of peptidoglycan. In prokaryotic cells, a few member of domain bacteria have cell walls which composed of peptydoglycan. Member of domain Archae have cell wall composed of protein or unique molecules resembling but not the same as peptidoglycan. In cytoplasmic structures of eukaryote, the ribosomes are composed of a 60S and a 40S subunit forming an 80S ribosome. Internal membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuoles, and lysosomes are present. Chloroplasts serve as organelles for photosynthesis. A mitotic spindle involved in mitosis is present during cell division. A cytoskeleton is present. It contains microtubules, actin micofilaments, and intermediate filaments. These collectively play a role in giving shape to cells, allowing for cell movement, movement of organelles within the cell and endocytosis, and cell division. In prokaryote, the ribosomes are composed of a 50S and a 30S subunit forming an 70S ribosome. Internal membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuoles, and lysosomes are absent. There are no chloroplasts. Photosynthesis usually takes place in infoldings or extensions derived from the cytoplasmic membrane. There is no mitosis and no mitotic spindle in prokaryote but fission and budding only. They may contain only actin-like proteins that, along with the cell wall, contribute to cell shape.

=== Eukaryotes ===

* Domain
** in the domain [[Structural Biochemistry/Three Domains of Life/Eukarya|Eukarya]]

* Structure
** Plasma membrane: A lipid/protein/carbohydrate complex, providing a barrier and containing transport and signaling systems.
** Mitochondrion: Surrounded by a double membrane with a series of folds called cristae. Functions in energy production through metabolism. Contains its own DNA, and is believed to have originated as a captured bacterium.
** Cytoskeleton
*** Microfilaments
*** Intermediate filaments
*** Microtubules
** Nucleus: double membrane surrounding the chromosomes and the nucleolus. Pores allow specific communication with the cytoplasm. The nucleolus is a site for synthesis of RNA making up the ribosome.
*** Nuclear envelope: doubled membrane, enclosing the nucleus.
*** Nucleolus
*** Chromatin: contains genetic information of cells (DNA)
**** Chromosomes: only visible during cell divisions.
** Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
*** Rough ER: A network of interconnected membranes forming channels within the cell. Covered with ribosomes (causing the &quot;rough&quot; appearance) which are in the process of synthesizing proteins for secretion or localization in membranes.
*** Smooth ER: A network of interconnected membranes forming channels within the cell. A site for synthesis and metabolism of lipids. Also contains enzymes for detoxifying chemicals including drugs and pesticides.
** Golgi apparatus: A series of stacked membranes.
** Lysosome: A membrane bound organelle that is responsible for degrading proteins and membranes in the cell, and also helps degrade materials ingested by the cell.
** Ribosome: Protein and RNA complex responsible for protein synthesis
* Cell division
* Energy intake

Eukaryotes that live in extreme environments tend to be microbial. Microbial life is present in all extreme environment with enough energy to support life. Eukaryote cells are very adaptable, but prokaryotes are a little bit more so. This is not conclusive due to many environments that have yet to be explored. Anaerobic environments lack oxygen, but eukaryote cells still manage to survive.

Thermophile eukaryote cells are resistant to high temperatures. These cells must adapt by modifying their lipid and cell walls. The heat is dangerous so modifications to resist heat are necessary.

Psychrophiles are cells that have adapted to extremely cold temperatures. An example would be Heteromita globosa, which
is a heterotrophic flagellate that lives in Antarctica. Psychrophiles face an extra challenge in that they must make modifications to the lipid and cell walls in order to maintain fluidity. The cold temperatures cause cell walls to become rigid.

Acidophiles are cells that can survive in extremely acidic conditions. Until recently, there were only four organisms, all eukaryotic that could survive in near 0 pH conditions. The way acidophiles can survive in such low pH levels is not known, but it is suggested that it could be due to a strong proton pump or low proton membrane permeability.

Alkalophiles are cells that can survive in high pH levels. Some of these Alkalophiles can also be stable at neutral pH also which leads us to believe that the internal chemistry is highly resistant to environmental influence. Possible compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells could help this.

Barophiles are cells that survive in high pressure conditions.

Xerophiles are cells that survive in dry conditions.

Halophiles are cells that live in high saline conditions. These cells must face the problem of drying out by osmotic pressure. 
Eukaryotes such as flagellates thrive in such conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bereisheet (In the Beginning) / Genesis 1:1-6:8

“Let There Be Light”
“In the beginning of God’s creating the heavens and the earth--when the earth was astonishingly empty, with darkness upon the surface of the deep, and the Divine Presence hovered upon the surface of the waters--God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light” (Bereisheet/Genesis 1:1-3)    How powerful is our Creator in that He simply spoke the word,   &quot;Let there be light,&quot; and there was light.&quot; Genesis 1:3   Heavenly Light!  
  
The word &quot;orah&quot; means &quot;light.&quot; From the word ‘orah’ comes Torah, birthright, blessing, commandment, statues, ordinances. 

This Light was not a light like we know it.  It was the eternal light of the Living God, a physical manifestation of Himself.

“Who alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light; Whom no man has seen or has the power to see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.”(MRC)   1 Timothy 6:16

The first thing that He made was the light.  The earth was completely covered with a liquid which was a chaotic mass, possibly something like a black hole.  From this point forward we see how the universe is organized. The first thing that is made is the light - notice that the sun has not yet been created.  That teaches us that this is not talking about the same light which is later produced by the sun and the stars, but another light.

In 2 Corinthians 4:6 it is written:     “For it is God Who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ is the One Who has made His light shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of  Yeshua the Messiah.” 

In this text Paul teaches us that the light came from the darkness itself.  This can of course be understood symbolically as well.  If the Eternal could bring forth light out of the deepest darkness that has ever existed, then there is no darkness in our lives which is so compact that our heavenly Father cannot use it to bring forth something positive.  For him all things are possible, even creating light out of darkness!

The Psalmist remind us of that reality.   “Your word is a lamp for my feet and a light for my path” (Tehellim/Psalm 119:105).

The Original Creation
Yahweh created man to be a spiritual being, thus he was created to possess the likeness of his creator, Himself a spiritual being; yet man is also physical.
 
1. Man was first conceived in the mind and will of God. He thus &quot;existed&quot; though not in any form we can very well define other than something &quot;in God's image.&quot; (This is man before Genesis chapter 1.)

2. Adam was then created as a spiritual being. At this point there is no &quot;division&quot; between Adam and Eve. This is Adam as seen in Genesis, prior to the Garden of Eden. (Genesis 1)

3. The third stage is seen in Eden, where Eve is formed as a separate entity from Adam. (Genesis 2)  They do not yet exist as we do however, as they retained a spiritual proximity to the Divine that we do not have.

4. The fourth and final stage comes when they are banished from Eden into the physical world as we know it. (The end of Genesis 3.)  Here Scripture says they were clothed in tunics of skin, which in Hebraic is said to be the physical flesh we now have, that enables us to live in this world. (Compare this to Paul's writings in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 on different types of &quot;flesh/bodies&quot; as well as his comments on us receiving a different type of body for &quot;life beyond this world.&quot;)

The Rabbis teach that before the fall, Adam and Eve shone like the sun.   When Moshe came down from the mountain the &quot;skin of his face shone&quot;  (Exodus 34:29-30 ) as also Yeshua in the Transfiguation on the mount.  (Matthew 17:2)

The Light of Adam and Eve's souls was able to radiate through their &quot;bodies.&quot;  That is to say, their souls were &quot;transparent,&quot; there was little to conceal their true essence and their flesh was a medium through which they were able to do the tasks that  were required of them in this life.

The serpent as we all know represents HaSatan (the devil).  He too is a spiritual being, yet in Bereshit we find him also manifested in the physical realm, in the form of a snake. Therefore, what we have is two spiritual entities, man representing the image of God, and the serpent  representing the image of HaSatan and they are both interacting in the physical, sensual plane.   The conflict that we are being introduced to here between Chavah (Eve) and the serpent is physical, but the actual battle and the ultimate outcome is taking place and decided in the parallel spiritual world.  Genesis /Bereshit 3:1-8

Light and Darkness
There were two very special trees in the Garden, one represented darkness, &quot;the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,&quot; and the other represented light &quot;the tree of life.&quot;  The darkness, I believe is Satan and the light is Yeshua and there was a battle going on, a battle that obviously started long before man appeared on the scene.  However now there was a new battle ground on earth.  Scripture doesn't tell us exactly when Satan sinned and fell, but was prior to the creation of earth and man, because he was already here to greet us when we arrived. So Bereshit is not so much about creation as it is about choice and  our relationship with Yahweh God.
 
Much intrigue surrounds the nature of the fruit of the tree of the &quot;KNOWLEDGE of good and evil&quot;. Every tree produces after its kind, so a tree whose name is &quot;knowledge of good and evil&quot; will produce the knowledge of good and evil.   Previously they had not known evil or known either what was good.   They were in a state of innocence.   The tree might just as well have been labeled, &quot;the tree of freedom of choice&quot; or &quot;free will&quot;.  Yahweh did not have to give them a choice.  He placed the tree right in the middle of the garden so that Adam and Chava passed by it as they cared for the garden.

When they were apparently being very obedient to the command, Yahweh allowed the serpent to enter the garden for the purpose of enticing them to eat.  He wanted them to have free will but not by command or creation design.  He wanted them to choose for themselves what is good and what is evil and then, by an act of their own free will, chose to obey Him over every obstacle that was placed in their path.  Satan was the agent of this test.

The Exercise of Free Will
The tree of the knowledge of good and evil represents an acknowledging of Yahweh's authority over man.  Every time that man obeyed the negative command of not eating from the forbidden tree, he displayed who was the Sovereign of his life, and his God.  This tree helped man to submit and humble himself, and so keep his delegated lordship and trusteeship over everything created.  Therefore, this tree would, with time, be turned into some type of altar, a place for sacrifice and worship, where man’s will submits to the Creator’s will.  It is thought that this tree was placed on what is now the Mount of Olives.

This tree was also the proof of the freedom of man.  It was possible for man to sin.  He was free to choose between obedience and disobedience.  If man did not have any commandments, he would not have had the opportunity to be disobedient.  Instead, his obedience would come from a place of willing submission and it would make him into a higher being than if he had not had this choice. This way, love would be founded on free choice which is what Yahweh desires, not our forced love. 

He knew that the world would become very evil, but it was the only way He could create intelligent beings like Himself to fellowship with. That is why He created us in His own image after His likeness.  He wants children of intelligence not robots which simply operate according to design.
&quot;I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I Yahweh do all these things.&quot;   Isaiah 45:7 

The concept of evil coming &quot;indirectly&quot; from God (who is not evil Himself, nor does He create &quot;evil things&quot; as people often think of &quot;evil things&quot;), is difficult.  Nonetheless, it is true, as there is but One Creator, and it is He who restricts His light in people and in situations to bring about His desired result.  In Hebraic writings this is often called the &quot;right hand&quot; (merciful) and &quot;left hand&quot; (judgmental) of God.

It is interesting to note that according to the most modern scientific picture of the world, free will is an integral part of creation.  Science teaches us that there is an element of indeterminancy or &quot;free will&quot; inherent in the very quantum nature of matter, and this clearly indicates that the universe was created as an arena for a free-willed creature such as man.  The purpose of &quot;evil&quot; was to provide Adam with the opportunity to exercise free will.  Without temptation, the choice of good would have been axiomatic.  Evil was created not that man would succumb to it, but rather that he would be strengthened by overcoming &quot;temptation&quot; in order to gain perfection.  Mankind's task is to labor to eradicate imperfection from himself first, and subsequently from the entire creation, as far as is in his power i.e to bring it under his dominion.

It is this freedom of will that gives man a wider choice than merely to react to his surroundings. Although an individual's actions may be influenced by his heredity and environment, neither of these absolutely determines his actions.   Man can influence the highest forces (in the very Throne Room of God) in a positive or negative fashion.  As with the physical realm, the slightest such alteration at the &quot;cause&quot; can result in enormous changes with the &quot;effect.&quot;
Sin of any type &quot;energizes&quot; the negative aspects of the spiritual realm. Ramchal points out that even words and thoughts have this capacity.  The evil Forces are bound to the extent to which God’s light is concealed, which of course is determined by mankind’s actions.  When these Forces are made strong (through man’s failure to repent) then the lower worlds of existence (angelic and physical) suffer the consequences.

There is a constant struggle against sin that exists between the spiritual and the physical &quot;parts&quot; of man (i.e., Romans 6:12-20, 12:21; Ephesians 6:10-18, 1 Timothy 5:20-24, 2 Peter 2:19-20, 1 John 5:4-5; Revelation 2:7,11,17,26).

Light and Darkness in Conflict
Yahweh told us that He visits the iniquities of the fathers upon their children to the third and fourth generation (Deut. 5:9).  This is obviously a spiritual transference which manifests itself in the physical lives of succeeding generations.  

There is a conflict taking place on a regular basis in the spiritual for your soul and my soul.  That is the battle being pictured here in Parsha Bereshit.  However the same Bible which tells us that the spiritual battle which was lost to HaSatan by Eve (Chavah) and Adam’s disobedience, also tells us that the war was won in the spiritual which also manifested itself in the physical at the death and resurrection of Yeshua HaMashiach.  As the man of earth caused a spiritual and physical battle to be lost the man of heaven caused a physical and spiritual war to be won.  The first battle for our souls began in the spiritual and it ended in defeat in the physical, the last battle for our souls began in the physical and ended in victory in the spiritual.

&quot;And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.  Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.  The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is Yahweh from heaven.  As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.  And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.&quot;   1 Corinthians 15.45

&quot;If then you were raised with Messiah, seek those things which are above, where Messiah is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Messiah in God. When Messiah who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory. Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. .. .. ..But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth.  Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him .. ..&quot; Colossians 3:1-11

&quot;Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.&quot;  (Matthew 5:48)

[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''. I hope it is not too unusal to nominate 3 pages at once but they are all part of the same project, two just violate naming policy.  This project seems to be more about using Wikibooks as webspace to organize class projects then any actual instructional information.  It contains information like which specific students are assigned to which groups, the work of the students in these groups.  I am curious if the students understood the licensing of placing their work here.  This doesn't seem like an appropriate book for this site.

:&lt;s&gt;[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' or [[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''':&lt;/s&gt; I've fixed the naming of the other pages and merged in pages that were part of an older version of the book, so they can all be considered in your submission. However, I don't believe this should be deleted as long as everything in [[Subject:Class projects]] continues to exist. Part of me feels like class projects on Wikibooks may be better at Wikiversity (which was itself a part of Wikibooks in the past), but I need to look more closely at their scopes to determine where they fit in best. Whether class projects belong here is something that could be debated. However, the plethora of them on Wikibooks means that there's little momentum toward deleting this. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:56, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
:: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' I don't think works are kept just because they are part of a class project. The class needs to be working on a book for it to be within Wikibooks' scope. If the work isn't a book then the class is better off doing there work at Wikiversity. I think most of the works listed on [[Subject:Class projects]] are reasonably books. Paulpen seems to be the only person whose contributed to the work with the exception of 2 pages, and November 1st 2008 was the last time Paulpen worked on it. November 28th 2008 seems to be the last time anyone who might of belonged to the class contributed to the work. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:21, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' For what I have examined the book is stale since December 2008, it is just a stub (and not really a book stub but a class project stub), couldn't see any real content.
:As a response to the above opinion on class project (that I can't comprehend): As I understand it all class projects on Wikibooks have the purpose to produce/start/complete a book project (within Wikibooks policies). This should and for what I know always have been, extremely welcomed on Wikibooks (I have myself extended my congratulations/help for several of those projects).
:In this particular case the nominator for the VFD is advancing several issues. One seems to have been now addressed but the others seem to be unsolvable unless the project is adopted by someone on this VFD (a simple reshaping of the stub would be a satisfactory solution if someone sees it as important). There really is no use for this class project stub...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:32, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
:: I am not saying not to be welcoming towards class projects. Adrignola above seemed to be suggesting that this class project should be kept because Wikibooks allows the other class projects. I disagree with that reasoning. I think the fact a work was done by a class project should not be the sole consideration for keeping or deleting a work. I think most works by class projects are books and are within Wikibooks scope, but teachers can also make mistakes, make assumptions or not understand Wikibooks' scope. Like any works, I think examining, criticizing, scrutinizing and judging works by class projects is an import part of discussing and deciding whether a work is a book and does belongs on Wikibooks or not. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:40, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
:::I was not addressing your comment but Adrignola's statement that &quot;Part of me feels like class projects on Wikibooks may be better at Wikiversity&quot;, the distinct (from other type of projects) way a class project may be mistakenly started on Wikibooks is if the teacher(s)/educator(s) somehow infers that the work will not be participated by others than the targeted audience or that a project scope or evolution will be set in stone (probably the point Adrignola was attempting to make). This cases can be problematic due to the established rules (in procedure and practice) but with civility and a will to accommodate productive users by giving contributing and established editors a greater control on specific projects this can be resolved without major issues.
:::I have always of the opinion that there is a special distinction on Wikibookians and Wikipedians, not only on the nature of the edits but in the objective. A Wikipedian contributes to a single large work, even if some stick to specific articles, most edits for what I understand aren't guided by a long term involvement and don't (shouldn't) have close personal relation to those specific contributions, this is very distinct from edits on Wikibooks, were a long term relation, and personal investment is beneficial to the evolution of complete and well structured books. This makes the larger projects very prone to attract disruptive edits, even if well intentioned and allowed by policy (the use of the BeBold policy should take this issues in consideration).
:::Wikibooks suffers for a well known problem that relates to this situation. There is a saying about to many cooks in a kitchen that illustrates the issue, it relates to how easy it is to have meaningless and time wasting conflicts when too many creative people are working together and attempting to get control of a project. Here we have left the kitchen door open, anyone entering will be considered a cook and have the power to not only participate in the elaboration, but to ruin the dish and make the kitchen very unwelcoming to others. 
:::As always I'm strongly supportive of granting more control to book communities over their specific projects. The power to block and revert unannounced restructuring/formating or reshaping in books determined as active. This will address any disruptive edits, keep people interested, foster the evolution of better book structures and will address the expectations of teacher(s)/educator(s) for the needed editorial control, without limiting external but coordinated participations.
:::The review flag provides some of this control but it was not created with the Wikibooks project specificity in mind... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:03, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

::::My statement may have driven the discussion off track. The comments by Panic above would probably be better placed on a page where they won't be forever attached to a specific book, given their general scope.  Additional detail on changes proposed (if any) would be needed to drive the discussion forward.

::::[[File:Symbol abstain vote.svg|15px]] '''Abstain''': As for the book itself, after reconsideration, the mere status of the book as a class project should not preclude it from being subjected to the same criteria other books on Wikibooks have for being textbook material. That was the reasoning behind my vote above, which I withdraw. Lacking that reasoning, I have no feelings toward the book either way. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:36, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

==Lesson==
===Save versus Save As===
&lt;p&gt;When you want to save a document for the first time you want to click on SAVE.  You can name the document, and tell the document where to save (what folder). Also if you have already saved the document and just want to make a change and save it back to the same place, then you would use SAVE.   
&lt;p&gt;When you already have a document and want to make copy of it then you would use SAVE AS.  You can put the copy in the same folder, or in a different one.  You should rename the file to remove any confusion between the original one and the copy.  

===Workbook and Worksheet===
&lt;p&gt;When you open an excel workbook it opens by default with 3 work sheets.  You can see the three worksheets at the bottom of the screen as tabs: Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet 3.  You can rename these tab, delete them, create more, and change the color of them.  Information from the three tabs can interact if you use global names.  (global names will be coverd in a later lesson)

===General Data Analysis Questions===
#Why do some of the movies have such a high value in the first week on the chart?
#Why do some of the movies not have a value in the first week on the chart?
#Why do you think some of the movies drop off in value quickly as the weeks move on?
#What do the totals in column G represent? 
#What do the totals in row 13 represent?

===Worksheet Window===
==== Same as Word====
You will notice that many of the parts of the EXCEL Window are the same as the WORD Window.  The right side and the top have scroll bars, with scroll arrows and scroll boxes.  The top of the window has the Ribbon with the Tabs and Groups.  Many of the Groups on the HOME tab are the same such as Font and Alignment.  But some are different such as Number and Cells. The status bar is still at the bottom and gives information on the document as well as the active cell or range of cells you have chosen.  Excel still has the Key Tip Badges, Enhanced Screen Tips, Screen Tips, Dialog Box Launcher and Task Panes.  The menus for Mini Toolbar, Shortcut Menu, and Quick Access Toolbar are still available as well. 

====Different from Word====
&lt;p&gt;The Excel document contains different sheets, where as the Word document contains different pages. 
&lt;p&gt;In Excel you have column headings and row headings to display a grid that you can name the active cell or range of cells you are working with.  The column headings are letters like A, B, C.  The row headings are numbers like 1, 2, 3.  
&lt;p&gt;Each place that a row and a column intersect is called a CELL.  The Active Cell is the cell you are currently editing, or have chosen.  The name of the cell is something like: A1, B12, or F92, and this is also called the cell reference.  
&lt;p&gt;Dividing each cell is a faint line called a gridline.  These lines do not print by default, but guide you to help you better see what cell, row, or column you are in.  
&lt;p&gt; In the upper left corner is the Name Box and it will display the name of the cell you have active.  You can navigate to a specific cell by typing the name of the cell and pressing enter.  
&lt;p&gt;Next to the Name Box is the Function Box.  This contains the actual contents of the active cell.  If you have a formula then it will display that formula there.  If you have a number of text that is what will be displayed there.

===Adjust your column widths and row heights===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Column Widths
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your mouse between the column headings (the letters such as A and B)
&lt;li&gt;click and drag your mouse to the right to increase the column width
&lt;li&gt;click and drag your mouse to the left to decrease the column width
&lt;li&gt;double click to make the column width the BEST FIT for your data
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Row Heights
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your mouse between the row headings (the numbers such as 1 and 2)
&lt;li&gt;click and drag your mouse to down to increase the row height
&lt;li&gt;click and drag your mouse to the up to decrease the row height
&lt;li&gt;double click to make the row height the BEST FIT for your data
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
===Use AutoSum to compute the Totals row===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the cell B13 active by clicking on it.  This should be the first cell in the totals row. 
&lt;li&gt;Click on the AutoSum button in the HOME tab in the EDITING group. (It looks like a sigma or a fancy E)  
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the contents of the cell reads: =SUM(B4:B12), if it does not just click and drag over B4 to B12 and then press enter. Notice that the numbers are different. 
&lt;li&gt;Do the same steps in cell C13 making sure the contents reads =SUM(C4:C12)and press enter
&lt;/ul&gt;
===Use the Fill Handle to smart copy with a relative reference===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on cell C13
&lt;li&gt;Place your mouse over the tiny black box in the bottom left of that cell. This is the fill handle.  When your mouse is on the fill handle it turns into a black plus sign. 
&lt;li&gt;Click and drag the fill handle over to the right to cell G13
&lt;/ul&gt;
===Use AutoSum to compute the totals column===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on cell G4 to make it active
&lt;li&gt;Click on the AutoSum button in the HOME tab in the EDITING group. 
&lt;li&gt;Make sure it reads =SUM(B4:F4)  Notice that now the letters are different and the numbers are the same. 
&lt;li&gt;Do the same in cell G5
&lt;li&gt;Do the same in cell G6 - notice that it does not do it right and you will need to click on B6 and drag to F6
&lt;li&gt;Use the Fill Handle and drag it down to fill the rest of the column. 
&lt;/ul&gt;
===Create a title with the Merge and Center===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click and drag from A1 to G1
&lt;li&gt;Click on the merge and center button in the HOME Tab in the ALIGNMENT group. 
&lt;li&gt;This will take all of those cells and merge them into one cell called A1.
&lt;li&gt;Click and drag from A2 to G2
&lt;li&gt;Click on the merge and center button
&lt;/ul&gt;
===Format the document using Cell Styles===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format the titles
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on cell A1
&lt;li&gt;Click on the Cell Styles button in the HOME tab in the STYLES group. 
&lt;li&gt;Choose TITLE for the style
&lt;li&gt;Click on cell A2
&lt;li&gt;Click on the Cell Styles button
&lt;li&gt;Click on the HEADING 4 style
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format the headings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click and drag to choose the range A3:G3
&lt;li&gt;Click on Cell Styles button
&lt;li&gt;Click on HEADING3
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format the totals
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click and drag to choose the range A13:G13
&lt;li&gt;Click on Cell Styles button
&lt;li&gt;click on TOTAL style
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
===Format the numbers===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format the top row of dollars for standard accounting style 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click and drag to choose the range B4:G4
&lt;li&gt;Click on the $ in the HOME tab in the NUMBER group - this applies the Accounting number style with a fixed dollar sign.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format the rest of the block of dollars for standard accounting style
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the range B5:G12
&lt;li&gt;Click on the Comma in the HOME tab in the NUMBER group
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format the totals for accounting style
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the range B13:G13
&lt;li&gt;Click on the $ for accounting style 
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
===Create a Column Chart===
NOTE: An EMBEDDED chart is one that is on the same sheet as the data table it is graphically displaying. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the range A3:F12 - notice that we do not select the TOTALS 
&lt;li&gt;Discuss why you would not select the totals for a column chart
&lt;li&gt;Click on the INSERT tab
&lt;li&gt;Click on the COLUMN button in the CHARTS group
&lt;li&gt;Choose a chart style from the gallery
&lt;li&gt;Discuss why you would want one from the first or fourth columns and what the ones in the second and third columns represent. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the second column in the gallery add the data together and give one column per group
&lt;li&gt;the third column in the gallery gives a percent of the group for one column
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click and drag the chart below your table of data so you can see both
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your legend is filled in with your row labels, if it is not, then you did not choose them when creating the chart
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your X-axis has labels, if not you did not choose row 3 (the column labels)when you created the chart
&lt;/ul&gt;
===Formatting a Chart===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the CHART TOOLS button at the very top of your window
&lt;li&gt;Click on the DESIGN tab
&lt;li&gt;Click on the Gallery More Button
&lt;li&gt;Choose a style for your chart, hover over different ones and look at the live preview before you select one
&lt;li&gt;Select a style that matches the title colors you created earlier
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Project ==
&lt;p&gt;Create a Worksheet that compares the Job Outlook and Earnings for your top five occupationsyou selected with the career surveys. 
&lt;p&gt;Remember you created these from the web site http://www.collegeincolorado.org 
&lt;p&gt;Use the web site http://www.bls.gov/oco  
&lt;p&gt;The work sheet should have: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word Art Title at the top
&lt;li&gt;Columns for
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job Title
&lt;li&gt;Employment in 2006
&lt;li&gt;Projected Employment in 2016
&lt;li&gt;Change in number
&lt;li&gt;Percent Change
&lt;li&gt;Lowest Earnings
&lt;li&gt;Highest Earnings
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a column chart that compares employment rates between 2006 and 2016. 
&lt;li&gt;Create a second chart of your choosing (that is appropriate for the data) that compares high and low earning rates. 
&lt;li&gt;Printed on one piece of paper
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Back to the Beginning==

We are stuck again. No thanks to positional prohibitions, the absence of simultaneity in straightway travel degrees of freedom, relativity, Quantum unknowns time and of course failure after failure.

As we know a mass existing at a single position cannot be actual

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1\Rho}{M}=i&lt;/math&gt;

If we attempt to delude ourselves and assume that we can cause FTL using anything within the physical there is a 100% sure chance that energy will ultimately cause that failure because it just
won’t succeed.

For a moment let us try to incorporate the principles of simultaneity from a light-ring to line segment traversion. When we do this, &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu&lt;/math&gt; is either increasing or decreasing. Positive, gaining additional velocity, which is non-uniform. Now the light ring constantly changes direction in 1 direction and is repetitive but no &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu&lt;/math&gt; is apparent unless of course some other force may cause it to become compressed. So to cause repetition to &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu=a&lt;/math&gt;, would mean that &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu&lt;/math&gt; must become uniform.


If “a” were uniform, then &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu\neq\Delta\nu&lt;/math&gt; because no increase would be present by a positive change-in (&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;) or decrease by negative change-in (&lt;math&gt;-\Delta&lt;/math&gt;). Similarly, renewal in RPS changes, (the outer circumference distance) the value for RPS changes to compensate respectively. However in the sinusoidal propagation of a photon, deceleration leads to momentum where a very rapid interchange is; &lt;math&gt;-\nu=&lt;/math&gt;+Ρe-Ρe+Κe. 


If we assume this to be true then excess momentum is the residual amount of G retained in every increase in &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu&lt;/math&gt; is induced. Because of the difference in &lt;math&gt;\nu2-v_1&lt;/math&gt; every “time” an increase in &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is intended. Thus to cause a repeat-like the light ring-and intentional disengagement of F, in &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is initiated temporarily (not in the opposing direction) or a slight drop-back to manifest a rapid interchange between Pe and Ke and hence uniform forward motion for every &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we have a repeat going in straight-line motion but only initiative after &lt;math&gt;\nu_1-\nu_0&lt;/math&gt;. We could go back to &lt;math&gt;\nu_0&lt;/math&gt; but what would this purpose serve lest to accomplish inversion.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta\nu_2-\nu_1}{-dv_2+\Delta\nu} = (-a) \nu_2-\nu_1&lt;/math&gt;

Now we have a repetition in straight-line propagation and if &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu&lt;/math&gt; is unequal to the temporary disengagement of F then it might be assumed that the changes in &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; increase &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; in percentages past &lt;math&gt;\nu_2&lt;/math&gt;.The uniform motion-being repetitive now may be assumed to be equal to &lt;math&gt;\nu_2&lt;/math&gt; where no increase in &lt;math&gt;\nu_2&lt;/math&gt; maybe assumed to be entirely absent. Thus acceleration is eliminated by the repetitive act. 

Henceforth this is an equal and opposite interaction. So we want this repetition to be as close as it can be made to be to the renewal of E in the light ring. Not necessarily that one must be unequal to the other but that one occurs faster than the other-timitically. However what has been intentionally done, is reversed the process of acceleration to restart it anew.

We have therefore:

&lt;math&gt;\nu_1-\nu_0\nu_2-\nu_1-\nu_2=\nu_1\Delta\nu_1=\nu_2&lt;/math&gt;

Initially then what we have done is caused a repeat in &lt;math&gt;\nu_2&lt;/math&gt; -– an oscillatory one. And unlike the light ring is constantly changing direction back upon itself. An oscillation is a change in direction (&lt;math&gt;\Delta d&lt;/math&gt;) back upon itself. An oscillation is a change in direction but not constantly. In &lt;math&gt;-\nu-\nu_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu-\nu_1=\nu_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Now then we have to make these changes in direction very, very small so that in continuing the process the repeats will be fractionated taking up as it were the very positions themselves.

Quantum. 

Do you recall what we were saying about a mass at 1 position?

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1\Rho}{M}=i&lt;/math&gt;

What this shows is that it possesses no energy as well. Because energy in debt to potential energy can only be possible with the manifestation of 2 or more positions but is manifest by Ε.


Then it is equally true that:

&lt;math&gt;\int v\Delta v=\frac{1P}{E}=i&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:

&lt;math&gt;\int v\Delta v = \frac{1P}{E} = -E = i&lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;math&gt;-E \frac{PN}{i} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

One position only because energy when established, is established via 2 positions that constitute 1 possibility. There can be no other way. And even though the positions themselves are not present without energy this is the way it works. If in assuming that such an interaction could be constrained to 1 position at a time and much more mass itself comprising a ship, how then would one move from position to position?

The answer lies in the fact that E automatically disintegrates to a state of in-actuality for the mass if it were to occupy a solitary position. Suggesting that Ε becomes actual only with 2 or more positions while inversely 2 or more &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; become actual in the presence of energy actualizing. (2- dimensional line segment) In other words:

                               Ε =Δd ÷2Ρ

                                  OR

                               Ε=ΔΡ / d

      <text xml:space="preserve">*VirtualBox version: 3.0.6 r52128 
*Host OS: Mac Os X 10.5.8 
*Guest OS: Haiku R1 Alpha1 

# Download the .ISO image of [https://www.haiku-os.org/get-haiku Haiku] (an operating system). Burn it to CD (This is optional. You could boot directly from the .ISO. I just like having a physical CD.)
# Start up Virtualbox and create a new VM. In the Wizard, set the Operating System to Other and the Version to Other/Unknown. Name it Haiku.
# 512 MB memory should be plenty for Haiku.
# Create a new “hard disk”. Leave the “Boot hard disk” box ticked. You can use a dynamic disk. Make it 4 GB or more if you can spare the disk space.
# Now click on Settings and use the following:

*General | Advanced: Disable the shared clipboard (won’t work anyway). Check Remember Runtime changes.
*System | Motherboard: Make sure the CD/DVD is checked in the boot order. Uncheck Floppy. 
*System | Processor: If you have a Core2Duo processor, you can specify 2 cpu’s. If you have an 8-core Mac pro, well, I hate you. Don’t specify more cpu’s than you actually have. Enable PAE/NX, it doesn’t seem to hurt. 
*System | Acceleration: Enable everything. 
*Display | Video: Go on, be daring, give it 32Mb to play with. Enable 3d. 
*Display| Remote Display: Disable. 
*Storage| Select the host CD/DVD drive and enable passthrough. 
*Storage | Floppy: Don’t bother. I spent a whole day trying to make Haiku on VB see a floppy image. 
*Audio: If you get this working, leave a comment. Please. 
*Networking: The default PCNET-Fast adaptor does not work. There are three Intel Pro/1000 adapters available and they all seem to work. You have four slots available, so try all three and compare the speeds once in Haiku. In each case, use Attached to *Bridged adapter and attach to either Airport or to your wired connection. 
*Ports: Don’t bother. VB will see all your USB stuff, but Haiku does not seem to pick them up. Like everything else here, this may change after Alpha1. 
*Shared Folders. Don’t even try. This requires VB to supply OS-specific Guest Additions. Which they certainly don’t have for Haiku. 

7. Insert the CD you made in step 2. Now close Settings and press the Start icon on VB. Your VM will boot from the CD and start the install procedure. You will need to initialise the virtual hard disk. Don’t bother with a partition scheme, just put BeFs on it. Continue installing. Remove the CD and “reboot” the VM. Welcome to Haiku! The only Setting that you really need to consider within Haiku is screen size. On my 20′ iMac, I find that 1280×1024 works best in fullscreen mode. If you are going to use windowed mode, you’ll want to use less.

8. Use Command-F to toggle between windowed and fullscreen modes. The Command key by itself will toggle the mouse and keyboard between Host and Guest OS.

FAQ: doesn’t a VMM impose a heavy performance penalty?

A: Yes, but on today’s machines, and with a lean Guest OS like Haiku, who cares? That teapot is spinning so fast I can’t really make out the frame rate.

Specific Instruction Vary depending on your distribution.  The first step is to [http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads download] the version that is correct for your distro.  However, Debian and Red Hat based systems now have an automatic install/update option for the OSE.

==Installation for Debian Systems==
These include Debian and Ubuntu

===Building a Kernel Mod===
[[#Kernel_Mod_Build|See Below]]

==Installation for Red Hat based Systems==
These Include Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, and Fedora.

==PUEL Edition==
After downloading the rpm file for your distro, there are a number of methods of installation.

1.Double Click on the file, it should install VirtualBox
2. In a Terminal using YUM

===Using YUM in a Terminal===
Load up a terminal and change directory to the one where you saved the rpm.  To continue beyond this point you will need root privileges.  You will either need to be logged on as root (not recommended), su to root, or use sudo (if you have that configured).  The following assumes that you are using sudo.  If you are logged on as root or you used su then the instructions will work as shown.  However, you may also exclude the &quot;sudo&quot; in front of the commands.

In the terminal type
  sudo yum localinstall *name*.rpm --nogpgcheck
Replace *name* with the name of the rpm file.

Yum will load up and check for dependencies.  After doing that it should ask if you want to install VirtualBox.  Type 'Y' (without quotations) to continue.  VirtualBox will now be installed on your machine.

===Building a Kernel Mod===
[[#Kernel_Mod_Build|See Below]]

==Other==
===Building a Kernel Mod===
[[#Kernel_Mod_Build|See Below]]

==Building a Kernel Mod==
{{anchor|Kernel_Mod_Build}}
In order to run VirtualBox requires a Kernel Mod.  VirtualBox installed a script that can build the mod for you.  In order to do this you will require the Kernel Development Tools and GCC to be installed on your machine.  Assuming you have those you may continue by running the following command in a terminal: 
 sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup

If all is successful the script to successfully compile and initialise a VirtualBox Kernel Mod.  This mod should load automatically each time you reboot your host computer.

NOTE: You will need to rebuild the mod (using the script mentioned above) every time you update the Kernel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==REVIEW==

Okay, it's not ''all'' review.  Some of it is new.
The rest of it is review.  

These examples and questions should be challenging!  Get in, and get dirty!
The only way to learn to code is to try to make code.  When it breaks:

* take a deep breath
* read the error message.  They are often quite informative.
* check your 
** indentation
** matching parentheses / braces / brackets / quotes
** ego.  We all make mistakes!


If you're confused about anything here, seek out a more complete Python reference, 
or bring questions to class.


=== Dictionaries===

* dicts associate keys with values
* are accessed through their keys
* have no inherent order

* Exercise: Create the dictionary D, which we'll use throughout the exercises.  Note: we can use the dict() function to make a dictionary as well.

&lt;source lang='python'&gt;
D = {'i':1, 'l': [1,2,3], 's': &quot;my favorite string&quot;, d= dict(a=1,b=2)}
&lt;/source&gt;

What is broken here?  Now try this.

&lt;source lang='python'&gt;
D = {'i':1, 'l': [1,2,3], 's': &quot;my favorite string&quot;, 'd': dict(a=1,b=2)}
&lt;/source&gt;

* what are the keys of D
{{dynamic navigation |title = Answer |body =
get all keys:
    
    d.keys()  # this won't work since d isn't defined!
    D.keys()
}}
* what are the values?
{{dynamic navigation |title = Answer |body =
get values: 

    D.values()
}}


* try to access the values of D

{{dynamic navigation |title = Answer |body =
Accessing:

    D['i']
    D['d']
    D['c']  # what happens when it doesn't exist?
}}

* try deleting a key-value pair from D
{{dynamic navigation |title = Answer |body =
delete using &lt;code&gt;del&lt;/code&gt;

    del D['i']
    del D['c']
}}

* try adding a key-value pair to D:  'newkey' -&gt; True
{{dynamic navigation |title = Answer |body =
adding:

    D['newkey'] = True
}}

* Examine the '''get''' method of dictionaries
*#  &lt;code&gt;help(D.get)&lt;/code&gt; 
*#  try:
*#* D.get('i',&quot;notfound&quot;)
*#* D.get('c',&quot;notfound&quot;)

{{dynamic navigation |title = Answer |body =
    Help on built-in function get:
    
    get(...)
        D.get(k[,d]) -&gt; D[k] if k in D, else d.  d defaults to None.
        
Bascially, return D[k] if k is in D, otherwise, return d.  This saves
our bacon from having a &lt;code&gt;KeyError&lt;/code&gt; when a key isn't in the 
dictionary.  
}}

* ''extra credit'':  try  dict(1='a').  Predict what will happen, and explain it.
*# dict(a=1)
*# dict('a'=1)
*# dict(class=1)
*# help(dict)

{{dynamic navigation |title = Answer |body =
&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; isn't a valid python variable name.
The &lt;code&gt;dict()&lt;/code&gt; function expects valid python
identifiers, as described in the help.  
}}


* ''extra credit'':  What is the ''first'' element of D?


{{dynamic navigation |title = Answer |body =
Trick question!  Dictionaries don't have inherent order!  It may vary from machine to machine or from python version to python version.  In any case, it's not something to rely on. 
}}

===Lists, Tuples, Strings===

List, tuples and strings are all [http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-buffer-xrange python '''sequence types''']
* they are ordered
* they are accessed by their index [0,..,n], unlike dictionaries, which are accessed by key
* some are mutable (meaning the elements can change)
* strings have additional methods like upper,lower, split etc. 
* sequences support slicing (see below)

* construct &lt;code&gt;L,t,s&lt;/code&gt; like this:

    L = [8,'a',[1,2,3],None,'b']
    t = ('hallway', &quot;a creepy hallway!&quot;)
    s = &quot;a few of my favoirite strings&quot;

    # which do you think is easier?
}}


===Loops===

Sometimes we want to do things more than once.  Computers don't get bored by 
repetitive work, and have infinite patience.  Exploit this!


====Iterators====

Python has a magic appearing construct called &lt;code&gt;for...in&lt;/code&gt;, that
iterates over data strucutres.  

    for element in thing:
        print element, type(element)

Try iterating over our sequences, substituting our friends &lt;code&gt;D,s,t,L&lt;/code&gt; for 'thing'.  

{{dynamic navigation |title = Answer |body =
iterator example
    
    for thing in (D,s,t,L): 
        print thing
        for element in thing:
            print element, type(element)
}}


====While Loops====

The '''while''' constructor runs the body of the loop for as long as the '''condition
is True'''.

Here is an example:

&lt;source lang='python'&gt;
def countdown(n):
    while n &gt;= 1:
        print n
        n = n -1
    print &quot;liftoff&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;


* try this with different values for n, like 0, 1, -1, 'a', None
* write a function that counts up to a number.  

* final_countdown, which despite its name, uses a for loop

&lt;source lang='python'&gt;
def final_countdown():
    ''' print a version  of Europe's 'The Final Countdown' '''
    phrases = [ 
            'do de do dooo',
            'do de do do dooo',
            'de do de do',
            'de do de do do de dooo'
            'do de doo', 
            'do de do',
            'do de do do deee dooooo',
            'WEEEEE WOOOOOOOO',
    ]
    for phrase in phrases:
        print phrase
&lt;/source&gt;

===='''extra credit''':  make countdown wait====

What if we actually want the function to wait one second between loops?  There is a python function called [[http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.sleep time.sleep]] that we can use.  

{{dynamic navigation |title = Example showing time.sleep |body =
&lt;source lang='python'&gt;
import time
def countdown(n, wait=1):
    while n &gt;= 1:
        print n
        time.sleep(wait)
        n = n -1
    print &quot;liftoff&quot;

countdown(5,.5)
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

===='''extra credit''':  &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;====

* &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; breaks out of a loop
* &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; goes on to the repeat in the loop

{{dynamic navigation |title = examples |body =
example with continue and break:

    def cases_spaces_breaks(sentence):
        for letter in sentence:
            if letter == &quot; &quot;:
                break
            elif letter.islower():
                continue
            elif letter.isupper():
                print  letter, &quot;is uppity!&quot;
            else:
                print letter, &quot;is middle cased?&quot;

* try this out with various input sentences, to discover what it does

}}


===The Standard Library===

Explore the [http://docs.python.org/library/index.html standard library].  
* Choose a function or module, and experiment with it.  
* Tell the class which one you chose!  
* Show some code using it.
* Describe its inputs and outputs.  


====Get Dirty!====

Look at the [http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html standard exceptions (errors)],
and see which ones you recognize.  Try to write code that triggers these errors:

* SyntaxError
* KeyError
* NameError
* TypeError (hint:  &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; is a good candidate!)
* IndexError
* ImportError

{{dynamic navigation |title = Answer |body =
Generate some errors:

    a = '1 # SyntaxError
    {}['a'] # KeyError
    print fake_var # NameError
    int('a')  # TypeError
    [1,2,3][8]  # IndexError
    import fake # ImportError
}}

= American School of Bombay - One to One Program =

== Background ==

The American School of Bombay,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asbindia.org &lt;/ref&gt; is an American overseas school located in Mumbai (Bombay), India. American overseas schools &lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.gov/m/a/os&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aafsw.org/state/overseas_schools.htm &lt;/ref&gt; are institutions that have U.S. sponsorship through private businesses, churches, parent groups and/or government agencies.  These schools serve eligible U.S. students in foreign nations but are not limited to just US citizens; anyone seeking a US based curriculum may send their child to a US overseas school.  Some of these schools are governed by the Office of Overseas Schools in Washington D.C. and their mission is to promote quality educational opportunities at the elementary and secondary level for dependents of American citizens carrying out our programs and interests of the U.S. Government abroad.(state.gov).  American schools can range from small primary schools to larger institutions housing kindergarten (or pre-kindergarten) through grade twelve classes.&lt;p&gt;

The student body at the American School of Bombay (ASB) has 47 different nationalities currently attending. Only twenty five percent of the students are from the US.  Ten percent of the students are English as a Second Language (ESL). Most of the parent community within American overseas schools comes from a business or a diplomatic community. Since Mumbai is the financial capitol of India, the majority of families come from the business side. These families tend to move from one country to another so the American overseas schools provide American standards of education to them.  In general, ASB has a very transient population. One third of the student and parent population moves every year plus faculty and staff tend to move every 3 years, so there is always turnover.

== Initiative and Importance ==

[[Image:Tablet.jpg|left|250px]]

The American School of Bombay began investigating student laptop programs in the United States in 2000 and initially began their program during 2001 with IBM laptop carts available to students and teachers to share.  In 2003 Microsoft and Toshiba launched their “Anytime, Anywhere” learning initiative &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aalf.org&lt;/ref&gt; and ASB was one of the first schools to join this one-to-one program.  At this time, all students from grades 7 to 12 were asked to buy tablet PC’s.  If the student already had their own laptop, the school offered to buy them back so students could all buy the school approved and required Toshiba tablet to be on the same page.  Now in its 7th year, the American School of Bombay’s one-to-one program has grown considerably to include all students in grades 6 through 12.  In addition, all students in grades 3, 4 and 5 are in a one-to-one program.   However, the Elementary School laptops are provided by the school and remain on campus.  Students in grades 1 and 2 share one laptop between every 2 students, Kindergarten has a three to one ratio and Pre K has a four to one ratio.&lt;p&gt;

Dr. Shabbi Luthra &lt;ref&gt;Dr. Shabbi Luthra – Director of Technology - ITDirector@asbindia.org &lt;/ref&gt; became the Director of Technology at the American School of Bombay in 2005.  Previously she had been the IT director at the Dubai American Academy and the Tech Coordinator at the American Embassy School in New Delhi.  This is in addition to being an adjunct professor at the State University of New York, Buffalo and Boston University.  During the course of her four years at the school, she and Dr. Paul Fochtman, the Superintendent of ASB, led several systemic changes in technology use at the school.  Their forward thinking and the ASB leadership team’s dedication to meaningful professional development is continuing to ensure the success of the one-to-one program at this institution. &lt;p&gt;

ASB is one of the only American overseas schools to have a Pre-K-12 tablet and laptop program.  Many schools begin a one-to-one program in the middle school but few offer programs that include the lower grades, much less Pre-K.  ASB recognized that rapid changes in technology are constantly shaping the world and changing the way students learn.  The school leadership and the technology department foster the one-to-one program at this institution by setting goals that do not just keep pace with these technological shifts, but encourage the teachers and students involved to take ownership and look forward to what is coming many steps ahead.  Providing an environment where students can engage in the lessons they are presented using valid technology required for success in the future is why one-to-one programs are growing in popularity.

== Succesful Engagement ==
Dr. Luthra cited the greatest success of the one-to-one tablet program at ASB as the high level of engagement in learning that has emerged for students through integrating the tablets into the classroom.  True engagement occurred for teachers, parents and students at ASB.  This was achieved by ASB’s extensive approach to professional development and by providing a sense of inclusion and ownership for all parties involved.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:People icon half.svg|right|150px]]
ASB has a Technology Leadership Team made up of 32 people including parents, high school students, faculty, and staff members with representation across all divisions.  This team is responsible for macro-level thinking and planning about how technology should be integrated into the classroom.  They are not responsible for actual implementation, only for providing the vision, writing the plans, discussing potential implementation issues that may arise, and suggesting solutions to these issues.  This team develops a 5-year vision for where they see the school technologically and then prepares a 2-year technology plan to help them get there.  This plan becomes a recommendation to the administration and the technology department, and the exercise engages all included parties deeply.  The diverse cross section of team members ensures that all angles of technology integration are addressed.&lt;p&gt;

Dr. Luthra observed that students in many schools are more comfortable with technology than the teachers are; most times the students and teachers use technology in different ways.  However for successful integration to occur, the teachers must become the innovators while exploring and engaging with new technologies.  ASB has set up a wikispace listing a handful of appropriate, approved tools for secondary school teachers to use in the classroom.  These tools are listed by subject areas and include research on tech integration in each area and offer ideas on how to integrate.  Teachers are encouraged to explore these tools and choose which ones they want to use.  Some of these tools include blogs, wikis, podcasts, discussion forums, E-portfolios for English or Language Arts departments and Dyknow, Geometer’s Sketchpad, Math Type, Diigo, and Graphing Calculator for Math departments, among others.&lt;p&gt;

Another way teachers engage with the technology is through &quot;Tech Cafés” held every Monday where many teachers come together and discuss technology integration or other particular technology topics.  These meetings are informal and do not focus on how to use the technology but provide more of an open idea forum for teachers to discuss different tools and where it may or may not be appropriate to integrate technology into their lesson plans.  Interacting with their peers in this format has proven successful as teachers gain new insight and stock their bag of tools with fresh, proven ideas. &lt;p&gt;

ASB has adopted the ISTE &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iste.org&lt;/ref&gt; standards and devised a plan to allow each division (Upper, Middle, and Lower) to choose one standard, then write up a plan on how they would like to implement the professional development for all the teachers to achieve that standard.  For example, this year the Middle school chose standard 5; &lt;i&gt;Engage in professional growth and leadership&lt;/i&gt;.  The goal of this standard is to build professional leadership as a community/faculty giving every person the opportunity to become a technology leader.  Each division will be evaluated every year to see how successful they were with their professional development plan implementation.  Each division will choose another tech standard for the next year so in five years, each department will have implemented all five ISTE standards.  Each school principal is also required to present a yearly technology goal to the superintendent.  In fact, the superintendent also sets a yearly technology goal ensuring that technology integration is totally embedded in the school culture.

== Challenges and Limitations ==
According to Dr Luthra, there were a few factors that hindered the immediate success of the one-to-one project at ASB.  One was the lack of available educational software for the tablets at the time the project was rolled out.  There simply were not many educational packages in production that assisted teachers in integrating the tablets into their lesson plans.  The tablets were once only used with programs like Microsoft Office, OneNote and Windows Journal.  Another hurdle related to the hardware end of the program.  The Toshiba tablets were first generation and tended to be clunky and problematic for the students.  The tablets were different from the PC’s and laptops the students may have been used to working with in the past.  In addition, the school infrastructure at ASB proved to be inadequate.&lt;p&gt;

[[Image:Network-wireless.png|left|120px]]

Wireless technology was relatively new to the school and the existing access points were not robust enough to handle the extra traffic generated by all the new wireless hardware.  Fortunately, the Superintendent and the Board of Trustees recognized the need for a strong backbone and the funds were approved to upgrade the school infrastructure.  The wireless network was upgraded from a B network to a G managed wireless network.  The servers were upgraded along with firewalls and antivirus systems.  Consultants were brought in to complete site surveys and Microsoft was contracted to address wireless security issues.  These important upgrades addressed security concerns, expanded bandwidth and created redundancy for the growing school network.&lt;p&gt;

One issue with the program early on was that the focus was initially on the technology itself rather than on technology integration.  Just having the latest and greatest in tablet technology does not guarantee a successful program with true integration and support.  The shift was made to invest time and money into the people responsible for making the one-to-one program work.  ASB invested heavily in human resources to support the school infrastructure.  The school sought to hire technical support professionals from outside corporate environments rather than those with educational backgrounds to change the dynamic and knowledge base of the support team.  All six people in the main support team were trained to handle each other’s job responsibilities to ensure redundancy.  ASB committed to reducing network downtime to ensure the teachers and students remained engaged with the technology.

== Summary ==
When she arrived in 2005, Dr. Luthra believed ASB was doing a fine job of integrating the tablets and laptops into the classroom, but things were not running at an optimal level.  So as a result, teacher buy-in was not 100%.  She believes that a teacher’s belief system will not change until they have had a series of experiences that are successful with using technology.  Strengthening the backbone and building faith in the integration of technology was an ongoing process but proved successful as time progressed.  Keeping parents, students and teachers invested in the technology integration process truly forms important connections and innovations that might not exist if not for the Technology Leadership Team.  Providing freedom to share and explore, ensuring optimal operating conditions, and valuing the input of the end user are all reasons why the one-to-one program, has proven successful at ASB.  This institution is attempting to stay ahead of the technology curve and to provide their student, parent, and teacher communities with the tools required for success.

&lt;h1&gt;iPod Touch Initiative in Mansfield, Texas&lt;/h1&gt;

[[Image:Ipodtouch keyboard.jpg|left|240px|thumbnail]]
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
In spring 2009, [http://www.mansfieldisd.org Mansfield Independent School District] (MISD) in Mansfield, Texas introduced the [http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/ Apple iPod Touch], a popular touch-screen handheld computer, to its pre-K students. Mansfield Independent School District is located in a suburban area near Dallas, Texas. The school district has 39 schools, and enrolled over 31,000 students in 2009 (MISD Schools, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mansfieldisd.org/schools.htm accessed on October 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; MISD strives for a safe and comfortable environment for its culturally diverse student body, and aims to give students the skills necessary to succeed in real world situations, where technology is a critical element (About MISD, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mansfieldisd.org/aboutMISD/welcome.htm accessed on October 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The iPod Touch initiative is in line with these goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The primary objective for creating the iPod Touch initiative at MISD was to help pre-K students achieve the goals outlined in Texas pre-K education standards (Texas Education Agency, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/technology/techapp/teks/prek.htm accessed on October 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These guidelines explain the importance of introducing technology to young students and the specific skills they should have at the pre-K level in Texas schools. Introducing technology skills early in the students’ education is vital to preparing them for a future that is certain to be rich with technology. MISD decided to implement the initiative in order to increase students’ knowledge of basic concepts in a fun and interactive way that would also teach technology skills. The district also viewed the initiative as a way to help reduce language barriers for the Limited English Proficiency (LEP) students, so that they can progress at the same rate as their English-speaking classmates. MISD has created a short [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-TlMuJ_6hk YouTube video] to promote their new and unique program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For the initial implementation of the iPod Touch initiative, each pre-K classroom at MISD received 3 iPod Touches, along with other accessories like docks and cases. The teachers take advantage of the many free iPod Touch applications that are suitable to this age group, such as games that teach students about the alphabet, shapes, and counting. The interactive touch-screen interface of the device benefits students with different learning styles, such as visual or tactile learners. The district has also found that students learning English benefit greatly from iPod Touch applications that connect pictures to words (Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;article&quot;&gt;http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/curricula-foreign-language-education/12946254-1.html accessed on October 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The planning process for the iPod Touch initiative is ongoing; plans are developed as funds become available to purchase new iPods (Personal communication, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;staff&quot;&gt;Personal communication with MISD staff, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-K teachers received training on the iPod Touches prior to the implementation. They learned the basics of using the devices, along with the many options for classroom use, like applications and podcasts. The applications they used focused on early childhood learning. The day of training generated excitement among the pre-K teachers, who quickly felt prepared to introduce the devices to students. Ongoing support is available for these teachers as the initiative continues (MISD Blog, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;http://yourmansfieldisd.blogspot.com/2009/06/misd-minutes-apple-ipod-touch-for-pre-k.html accessed on October 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Importance of the Initiative&lt;/h2&gt;
The iPod Touch initiative at MISD introduced new and innovative technology to young students who are at an ideal age for acquiring new skills. This will help to prepare them for the remainder of their education and beyond, as schools and workplaces continue to include technology, requiring everyone to keep up with constant changes. Additionally, people of all ages today constantly use mobile devices such as cell phones and MP3 players. Since even young children are using such devices, they may already be comfortable with how to use them, which can help to reduce technical training time in the classroom and allow teachers to focus their time on lessons instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Internet also plays a significant role in education today, giving students access to resources worldwide and encouraging collaboration and communication among each other and with peers in other schools. Wi-Fi enabled devices like the iPod Touch allow schools to provide Internet access to students without having to invest in expensive desktop computers. While the iPod Touch is not a replacement for a computer, it does offer many of the same features for a fraction of the cost. This can help to put computers into the hands of more children than ever before, giving today’s students constant access to information regardless of their economic situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Recent research has shown the possible impact of mobile devices in learning today. Researchers for a 2009 report on this topic, which is entitled “Pockets of Potential,” believe that since mobile devices have become so ubiquitous for students today, taking advantage of them for education only makes sense.  They reported that the number of children ages 4-14 who own mobile devices has grown rapidly since 2005 – this includes cell phones, iPods, and pocket gaming devices. Providing opportunities for students to also use these devices in the classroom closes the divide between home and school. It also shows students how what they learn in school corresponds with the real world (Joan Ganz Cooney Center, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/pdf/pockets_of_potential.pdf accessed on October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the MISD initiative, the iPod Touch is both a music/video player and a pocket gaming device, so the implementation at the pre-K grade level makes perfect sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Ipodtouch_hand.jpg|right|240px|thumbnail]]
&lt;h2&gt;Successes and Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
Since the iPod Touch initiative at MISD has only been in progress for about 6 months, it is difficult to quantify success in terms of educational achievement or test scores. The greatest achievement of the initiative so far is the success of the implementation in the pre-K classrooms. Teachers have found that the pre-K students are naturals at using the iPod Touch and are having fun with the classroom activities that involve the devices. There was some hesitation to giving iPod Touches to such young students but they had no trouble learning to use them. Teachers also learned new technology skills and were excited to introduce the iPods to their students. This success led to future plans for implementation in other grade levels throughout the school district (Personal communication, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;staff&quot;&gt;Personal communication with MISD staff, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The majority of the problems with the initiative so far have been technical. Not every school in the district has wireless Internet access, so the iPod Touches cannot always be used to access the Web. The devices also need to be synced regularly with a desktop computer, and depending on the number of devices being used in a classroom, this can take up a lot of a teacher’s time, which would be better spent on educational tasks. Another problem standing in the way of a more widespread implementation across the school district is funding. MISD used grant funding to purchase the iPod Touches they have today, and will continue to purchase more iPods as more funding becomes available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
Soon after the iPod Touches were implemented in the pre-K classrooms at MISD, they were introduced to 5th and 8th grade science classrooms. Each class received enough devices for every student to have one to use. The teachers in these classrooms have used the iPod Touches to share videos and Web sites with the students, along with PowerPoint presentations and iPod Touch applications related to science topics. Again, using these touch-screen devices will appeal to different styles of learning and may help to increase students’ science knowledge. The next implementation will be at the high school level, where the devices will be used for podcasting, collaborative activities, and online research. MISD hopes to continue to increase the usage of the iPod Touch across the district, as funds become available. Instructional technology staff members at MISD have also created a social networking community for teachers involved in the iPod Touch initiative, to make it easy for teachers to share their successes and struggles with the devices (Personal communication, 2009; MISD Blog, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;staff&quot;&gt;Personal communication with MISD staff, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;http://yourmansfieldisd.blogspot.com/2009/06/misd-minutes-apple-ipod-touch-for-pre-k.html accessed on October 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
The iPod Touch initiative at Mansfield Independent School District is the first of its kind for the district, pairing innovative hardware and software to provide new and exciting learning experiences for its students. The project overall has been a successful one, and the district will continue to add iPod Touches to more of its classrooms as often as they are able to do so. One of the school administrators involved in the initiative said this of the pre-K students: “There's no fear. It's just endless what they can do.” (Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;article&quot;&gt;http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/curricula-foreign-language-education/12946254-1.html accessed on October 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This quote perfectly demonstrates the reason that the initiative will be successful at MISD as it continues to grow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Historical Development of the Thai Civilization=

In this chapter, the following topics shall be discussed:

==Prehistoric Thailand==

Based on London (2008):

Archaeological evidence seems to suggest that the geographical area now known as &quot;Thailand&quot; has been inhabited since prehistoric times (between 1 million and 500,000 years ago).

(p. 24)

The Thai people (not just the Siamese Thais in Thailand) have inhabited the region of continental Southeast Asia for over 4,000 years.

Cam Troung (2007), the leading Vietnamese expert on Thai ethnic community, has quoted a chapter titled 'Vietnamese Folk Poetry' collected and translated by John Balaban (2003) to support his arguement that the Thai people were here (Vietnam) in that distant past (p. ix. 

The Thai people were in the region of continental South East Asia (esp. in Lao, Thailand, North of Myanmar, Southern part of China, and Vietnam) since the birth of the 4000-year Dong Song culture Cam troung (2007).

A study conducted by a team of Thai researchers (Lertrit et al, 2008) suggests that (DNA tests on ancient skeletons in the Northeast) the Thai people's ancestors may have migrated to this part of the region long before previously thought.

This research rejected the long-held belief that Thai people migrated from China about 700 years ago. The results were published in ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology'' Volume 137, Issue 4. Here's the abstract:

&quot; The 360 base-pair fragment in HVS-1 of the mitochondrial genome were determined from ancient human remains excavated at Noen U-loke and Ban Lum-Khao, two Bronze and Iron Age archaeological sites in Northeastern Thailand, radio-carbon dated to circa 3,500-1,500 years BP and 3,200-2,400 years BP, respectively. These two neighboring populations were parts of early agricultural communities prevailing in northeastern Thailand from the fourth millennium BP onwards. The nucleotide sequences of these ancient samples were compared with the sequences of modern samples from various ethnic populations of East and Southeast Asia, encompassing four major linguistic affiliations (Altaic, Sino-Tibetan, Tai-Kadai, and Austroasiatic), to investigate the genetic relationships and history among them. The two ancient samples were most closely related to each other, and next most closely related to the Chao-Bon, an Austroasiatic-speaking group living near the archaeological sites, suggesting that the genetic continuum may have persisted since prehistoric times in situ among the native, perhaps Austroasiatic-speaking population. Tai-Kadai groups formed close affinities among themselves, with a tendency to be more closely related to other Southeast Asian populations than to populations from further north. The Tai-Kadai groups were relatively distant from all groups that have presumably been in Southeast Asia for longer-that is, the two ancient groups and the Austroasiatic-speaking groups, with the exception of the Khmer group. This finding is compatible with the known history of the Thais: their late arrival in Southeast Asia from southern China after the 10th-11th century AD, followed by a period of subjugation under the Khmers.&quot;

==Who were living in the region called 'Usa Kanay'?==

Prominent Thai historian Dr Charnvit Kasetsiri began with a question asking who the Thai people are, and where they came from.
 
&quot;Students would answer that the Thai people are those who speak Thai, believe in Buddhism, love the Nation, Religion and Monarchy, and probably they would also add that Thai people are good and moral, and willing to sacrifice for the country. And they came down from the Altai Mountains, and formed the kingdoms of Nan Chao, Sukhothai, Ayutthaya, and then Rattanakosin,&quot; he said.

*Did the Thais come from the Altai Mountains?

==Theories on the Origins of the Tai People==

Before discussing the relevant theories on the origins of the Thai people, let's look briefly at the summaries of other countries.

=== Laos ===

The History of Laos is conventionally traced to the establishment of the kingdom of Lan Xang by Fa Ngum in 1353. His successors, especially King Photisarath in the 16th century, helped stablish Theravada Buddhism as the predominant religion of the country. In the 17th century Lan Xang entered a period of decline and the late 18th century Siam (now Thailand) established control over much of what is now Laos.

The region was divided into three dependent states centered on Luang Prabang in the north,  Vientiane in the center, and Champassak in the south. The Vientiane Lao rebelled 
in 1828 but were defeated, and the area incorporated into Siam. Following its occupation of Vietnam, France absorbed Laos into French Indochina via treaties with Siam in 1893 and 1904.

=== Myanmar ===


The first identifiable civilization is that of the Mon. The Mon probably began migrating into the area in about 300 BC, and their first kingdom Suwarnabhumi, was founded around the port of Thaton in about 300 BC. &lt;br&gt;

The Pyu arrived in Myanmar in the 7th century and established city kingdoms at Binnaka, Mongamo, Sri Ksetra, and Halingyi. During this period, Myanmar was part of an overland trade route from China to India. By AD 849, the Burmans had founded a powerful kingdom centered on the city of Bagan and filled the void left by the Pyu. The kingdom grew in relative isolation until the reign of Anawrahta (1044 - 77) who successfully unified all of Myanmar by defeating the Mon city of Thaton in 1057. &lt;br&gt;

After the collapse of Bagan authority, Myanmar was divided once again. The Burmans had restablished themselves at the city of Ava (Thai: อังวะ) by 1364, where Bagan culture was revived and a great age of Burmese literature ensued. The kingdom lacked easily defendable borders, however, and was overrun by the Shan in 1527. Surviors of the destruction of Inwa eventually established a new kingdom centered on Taungoo in 1531 led by Tabinshwehti (reigned 1531-50), who once again unified most of Myanmar. A popular Burmese leader named Alaungpaya drove the Bago forces out of northern Myanmar by 1753, and by 1759 he had once again conquered Pegu and southern Myanmar while also regaining control of Manipur. He established his capital at Rangoon, now known as Yangon.

Myanmar was known to the West ever since western explorers had heard of it. Marko Polo was the earliest known westerner who discovered Myanmar and introduced to the West. 

Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years (1824-1886) and incorporated it into its Indian Empire. Burma was administered as a province of India until 1937 when it became a separate, self-governing colony; independence from the Commonwealth was attained in 1948.

Myanmar has a long and complex history. Many peoples have lived in the region and the history began.

=== Cambodia ===

Cambodia is another of Thailand's neighbors. Its history has been tied closely with that of Thailand's.

The Funan Kingdom, believed to have started around the first century BC, is the first known kingdom of Cambodia.  The kingdom was strongly influenced by Indian culture by  shaping the culture, art and political system.

An alphabetical system, religions and architectural styles were also '''Indian contributions''' to the Funan Kingdom.  There is archeological evidence of a commercial society in the Mekong Delta that prospered from the 1st to 6th centuries.

Returning from abroad, a Khmer prince declared himself the ruler of a new kingdom during the 9th century.  Known as Jayavarman II, he started a cult that honored Shiva, a Hindu god, as a devaraja (god-king) which then linked the king to Shiva.

He also began the great achievements in architecture and sculpture while his successors built an immense irrigation system around Angkor. His successors (26 from the early 9th to the early 15th century), built a tremendous number of temples - of which there are over a thousand sites and stone inscriptions. 

By the 12th century, Cambodia had spread into other areas, now known as Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and Malaysia (the peninsula).  There is actually still evidence of Khmer inhabitance in Thailand and Laos to this day.  

The 13th and 14th centuries were not as successful for Cambodia, some believe it was due to the increased power of (and wars with) Thai kingdoms that had at one time paid homage to Angkor.  Others believe it was due to the induction of Theravada Buddhism, which was totally contrary to the Cambodian societal structure at that time.  After this time historical records are rather sketchy at best regarding Cambodia and it is considered the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; of Cambodian history.

Cambodia was ravaged by Vietnamese and Thai invasions and wars up until the 19th century, when new dynasties in these countries fought over control of Cambodia.  The war, that began in the 1830's almost destroyed Cambodia.  King Norodom signed a treaty that enabled the French to be a protectorate, thus effectively stopping the Viet-Thai war within.  For the next 90 years, France in essence ruled over Cambodia.

Although officially they were just advisors, it was known that the French had final say on all topics of interest.  Although the French built roadways and made other improvements regarding trade and transportation, they sadly neglected the Cambodian educational system, which is still not effective to this day.

=== Theories/Stories about the origin of the Thai People ===

#The Altai Mountain Theory: This is perhaps the oldest theory. Thai people migrated south from Mongolia. Most people were skeptical about its validity.
#The Tibet Theory: Some scholars [citation needed] have argued that Thais came from Tibet.
#The China Theory: Thais migrated south (forced by stronger peoples such as the Huns) 
#The Vietnam Theory: Thais came from the north of Vietnam.
#The South Theory: Thais were Polynesains and Malaynesians, gradually moved north to the continent.
#The &quot;We Have Been Here&quot; theory: This is the story supported by archeological evidences. The word 'here' refers to the area called 'Suwannabhumi' and the south of China, the north of Vietnam, the Shan state of Burma, The Assam of India, Laos, Cambodia, and the Melayu Peninsular.

==Sukhothai Period (AD 1249-1463)==

According to the ''Encyclopedia for Thai Youths'':

&quot;The Sukhothai Kingdom became the center of the Siamese Thai in BE 1792 (AD 1249). It remained the center of the Siamese Thai until BE 2006 (1463) when it was integrated into the new Siamese kingdom, Ayudthaya&quot;.

The Sukhothai Kingdom was ruled by the Roung Dysnasty, entailing 9 kings.

*Dawn of Happiness

Sukhothai (literally means “Dawn of Happiness” ) was the first truly independent Thai Kingdom.

Sukhothai is the first Siamese Thai kingdom. It is located near the river Nan. 

Established in BE 1792; became part of the Ayudthaya Kingdom in BE 2006.

Sukhothai lasted for 214 years.

Sukhothai enjoyed a golden age under King Ramkhamhaeng.

*Geography

Sukhothai is located on the lower edge of the northern region, 440 kilometres north of Bangkok or some 350 kilometres south of Chiang Mai. The province covers some 6,596 square kilometres and is divided into 9 Amphurs (districts): Muang Sukhothai, Sawankhalok, Sri Samrong, Si Satchanalai, Kong Krailat, Kirimas, Thung Saliam, Ban Dan Lan Hoi and Sri Nakhon.

Kings of the Sukhothai Kingdom

#Pho Khun Sri Indraditya (1249 (BE 1792)-  c.a. 1257) 
#Pho Khun Ban Muang (1257 - 1277) 
#Pho Khun Ramkhamhaeng (Ramkhamhaeng the Great) (ruled 1277 - 1298 or 1317) 
#Praya Loethai (1298 - 1347) 
#Praya Nguanamthom (1347) 
#King Lithai or Maha Thammaracha I (1347 - 1368/1374) 
#King  Maha Thammaracha II (1368/1374 - 1399) 
#King  Maha hammaracha III or Praya Saileuthai (1399 - 1419) 
#King Thammaracha IV (Borommabal) (1419 - 1438)

==Ayudthaya Period (AD 1350-1767)==

After the decline of Sukhothai (Nan River), Ayudthaya (Undefeatable) became the new power hub along the Chao Praya River in BE 1893 (AD 1350). It remained the center of the Siamese Thai for as long as 417 years. It declined in BE 2310 (AD 1767). Altogether five dynasties ruled the kingdom: (1) U-thong Dynasty, Supunnapoom Dynasty, Sukhothai Dynasty, Prasatthong Dynasty, and Ban Plooloung Dynasty.

*Uthong Dynasty ราชวงศ์อู่ทอง (First reign, AD 1350 - AD 1370)

1. King Ramathibodi I (formerly Prince U Thong) (1350 - 1369) &lt;br&gt;

It was uncertain to identify his former city (Lavo, Supanburi, Petchaburi, or simply the city across the river to the other side (the eastern side of the Chao Praya river).

during his reign, the administrative system was different from the Sukhothai period, as Ayudthaya adapted many aspects of the Khmere governing practices and traditions. The management of Ayudthaya was divided into four domains, Vien, Vang, Klang, and Na. (the capital, the palace, finance, and cultivation)
 
The king was regarded as ‘the reincarnation of a god’ or ‘devaraja’. However, the kings of Ayudthaya also followed to the teaching of Theravada Buddhism, similar to the practice of the Sukhothai period. &lt;br&gt;

2. King Ramesuan (AD 1369 - 1370) (first rule, abdicated)&lt;br&gt;
 
He was King U Thong's heir. However, about a year under the throne, he was forced by Khunluang pra Ngua from Supanburi to abdicate. He went to rule Lopburi. This was the end of the first rule of the U Thong Dynasty.

* Suphannaphum Dynasty ราชวงศ์สุพรรณภูมิ (first reign, AD 1370-1388)

3. Somdej Pra Borommarachathiraj  I (Khunluang Pha Ngua) (1370 - 1388) &lt;br&gt;
Known as Khunluang Pha Ngua. He was the elder brother of the queen of the first monarch of Ayudthgaya (King U Thong). He was a strong military warrior. Many military campaigns during his reign brought Sukhothai under the rule of Ayudthaya in BE 1921. He then attacked Lan Na Kingdom.

4. King Thong Lan (1388)&lt;br&gt;

Son of  Khunluang Pha Ngua, ascending the throne when he was only 15. He ruled for only 7 days. Prince Ramesuan came down from Lopburi and decided to dethrone him.

==Thonburi Period (AD 1767-1782 or 28 December 1767 - 6 April 1782)==

After the second fall of Ayudthaya in BE 2310, the capital of Siam was destroyed. 

Ayudthaya was under the control of the Burmese authority for only 7 months.

King Thaksin the Great was the only king of this period.

We may not know what really happened. Some peeople say there is no 'if' in history. Whetever has happenned '''happened'''.

WE know that in AD 1767 or BE 2310, Ayudthauya fell due to the invasion of the Burmese. There were, however, internal conflicts within the kingdom. After the brief fall, the Siamese Thais were determined to reclaim their sovereignty and freedom, reflecting the independent spirit of the people. Ayudthaya was sacked and most temples were burned down. The Siamese warriors, in a few months, managed to expel its invaders. Its territory occupied was reclaimed.


The kingdom broke up into many different groups. It was King Thaksin the Great who unified the kingdom. History has it that he founded the new capital in the area called 'Thonburi'.


The resistance to Burmese rule was led by a noble of Chinese descent, Taksin, a capable military leader. Initially based at Chanthaburi in the south-east, within a year he had defeated the Burmese occupation army and re-established a Siamese state with its capital at Thonburi on the west bank of the Chao Phraya. &lt;br&gt;

In 1767 he was crowned as King Taksin. He rapidly re-united the central Thai heartlands under his rule. &lt;br&gt;

King Taksin demanded more. He was not satisfied with the mere fact of expelling the Burmese. He also aimed higher --- to demand loyalty from the former colonies of the great Ayudthaya Kingdom. He determined to turn crises into opportunities.  

In 1769 he marched west and occupied western Cambodia. &lt;br&gt;

He then marched south and re-established Siamese rule over the Malay Peninsula as far south as Penang and Terengganu. &lt;br&gt;

Having secured his base in Siam, Taksin attacked the Burmese in the north in AD 1774 and captured Chiang Mai in 1776, permanently uniting Siam and Lanna.

Taksin's leading general in this campaign was Thong Duang, known by the title Chaophraya Chakri. &lt;br&gt;

In 1778 Chakri led a Siamese army which captured Vientiane and re-established Siamese domination over Laos.

Despite these successes, by 1779 Taksin was in political trouble at home. He seems to have developed a '''religious mania''', alienating the powerful Buddhist monkhood by claiming to be a sotapanna or divine figure. &lt;br&gt;

In 1782 Taksin sent his armies under Chakri to invade Cambodia, but while they were away a rebellion broke out in the area around the capital. The rebels, who had wide popular support, offered the throne to Chakri. &lt;br&gt;

Chakri marched back from Cambodia and deposed Taksin, who was secretly executed shortly after. Chakri ruled under the name King Rama I, first king of the Chakri dynasty. &lt;br&gt;

One of his first decisions was to move the capital across the river to the village of Bang Makok (meaning &quot;place of olive plums&quot;), which soon became the city of Bangkok. The new capital was located on the island of Rattanakosin, protected from attack by the river to the west and by a series of canals to the north, east and south. Siam thus acquired both its current dynasty and its current capital.


Even though many scholars consider this period to be transitional, the Thonburi Period is indeed the most important development of the Thai nationhood.

On reflection, Siam (Thailand's former name) could maintain its statehood due two several factors. The two factors were significant: Genious and Chance.

In War and Peace (Volume Four), Leo Tolstry has discussed the concepts of 'chance' and 'genius'.&lt;/br&gt;

Why did it come to pass in this way and no other? asked Tolstoy. &lt;/br&gt;
'Because it happened so.' was his ultimate answer.

Chance created the position; genius took advantage of it.

==Rattana Kosin (Bangkok) Period (AD 1782 or BE 2325 - Today)==

King Rama I was the founder of the Chakri Dynasty.

World War I and World War II


After World War II


The present king of Thailand is King Rama IX.

==Thailand Today==

Today Thailand is one of the most prosperous nations in South East Asia.

The websites below give detailed information about Thailand today:

*Information about Thailand from the UN website at http://www.un.or.th/thailand/index.html

This is the summary found on the website:

&quot; Thailand is a middle-income country that has seen remarkable progress in human development in the last twenty years. Thailand now has a Human Development Rating of 0.768 . It will achieve most if not all of the global Millennium Development Goals well in advance of 2015. Thailand has reduced poverty from 27% in 1990 to 9.8% in 2002, and the proportion of underweight children has fallen by nearly half. Most children are in school; universal primary school enrolment is likely to be achieved within a few years. Malaria is no longer a problem in most of the country. Annual new HIV infections have been reduced by more than 80% since 1991, the peak of the epidemic. Strides are being made toward gender equality.&quot;

* Information about Thailand from CIA The World Fact Book, 2005:

The Kingdom of Thailand or Thailand (Former Siam) is &quot;a unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century. Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been taken over by a European power. A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to a constitutional monarchy. In alliance with Japan during World War II, Thailand became a US ally following the conflict. Thailand is currently facing armed violence in its three Muslim-majority southernmost provinces.&quot;

==iPod Touch Initiative - Shepparton High School, Australia==

===Introduction===
[[Image:As-map.png|left|Map Of Australia|200px|thumbnail]]
Students from [http://www2.shs.vic.edu.au/ Shepparton HS], in Victoria Australia are on the cutting edge of technology in an educational setting as they use iPod Touches to learn everyday. The high school, which is responsible for the education of about 900 students from years 7 to 12, has taken a new approach to learning, referred to as “personalised learning.” [Personalised Learning, 2009] &lt;ref&gt;http://www2.shs.vic.edu.au/curriculum/personalised-learning.html accessed on September 29, 2009 &lt;/ref&gt; The school environment lends itself well to supporting technology in the classroom, with large open learning spaces, a multimedia lab, interactive whiteboards, notebook computers, and digital and video cameras available for student use during the school day.

A research study that started in August 2008 and continued through December involved year 8 students collaborating with students from other countries [Mobile Learning, 2009] &lt;ref&gt; http://louiseduncan.globalteacher.org.au/files/2009/08/Mobile-Learning-Research-Report_Etech2009_Final.pdf accessed on October 5, 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;. During the first section of the study, students primarily used the iPod Touch to share with the students in other countries about what it is like to live in their country. Through StudyWiz the students shared photos and responded to each other’s comments about their work. The second half (from January 2009-June 2009) of the research study focused more on students using different iPod Touch applications to personalize their learning. Having more experience with the iPods, teachers were able to pick more specific applications, to foster the literacy initiative where students from different schools again collaborated.

Now in the continuing stages, Louise Duncan, teacher and coordinator of Personalised Learning for Shepparton High School is working to grow the program at her school and share her successes with others around the world [Expansion Plans, 2009] &lt;ref&gt;http://louiseduncan.globalteacher.org.au/2009/08/16/expansion-plans/ accessed on October 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;. Teachers and students use the iPod touch for everything from calendar dates to sharing homework assignments. Not only do the students use their iPod Touches at school, but they also take their iPods home to work on school assignments, submit homework, and access the Internet. Each student’s iPod Touch is customized to meet their needs as a part of the school’s personalised learning program. An active part of learning in every class, students find use for their iPods in a variety of settings.  For example, students may choose to review math facts with a math application, listen to an ebook during reading, or study vocabulary from the notes application to prepare for a science test.

===Value and Importance of Initiative===
The value and importance of this successful project has allowed students the opportunity to have control of their learning. With a personalized iPod, students are excited about their learning, as are teachers. The attitude of students alone has become more positive towards learning, making students more engaged in their learning. Since students are connected to the Internet via the school’s wifi network, there is constant access to communication. After students go home, teachers can send feedback to students through Study Wiz as well as communicate through e-mail  [Study Wiz, 2009] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.europe.studywiz.com/?cat=42 accessed October 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;. Teachers now spend their time coming up with innovative ways to involve their students using the iPod Touch in the classroom. &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;An example of an innovative classroom application would be appropriate here&lt;/font&gt;

===Planning Process - Responsible for Successes and Problems===
The planning process had a large impact on the success of the iPod initiative at Shepparton HS.  Duncan suggests that implementing in stages allows both teachers and students time to adjust to the new instructional tool.  When introducing the  iPods, it was found effective when guided activities were presented to students as part of whole-group instruction. Another important element that contributed to the successes was that teachers from all subject areas were able to integrate using the iPod into every class period. 
	
Perhaps the most important part of the planning process was the teacher involvement. Having the iPods 6 months before the students is highly recommended by Duncan. When teachers are comfortable with the technology for their own use, they will be more likely to come up with creative ways to use the technology in the classroom.  Professional development for teachers to learn to use Apple’s iPod Touch technology may be imperative for the success of the iPod initiative. For teachers to feel comfortable using the technology in the classroom, they need to have professional development and enough time to plan for the change of instructional style.
	
At Shepparton High School, Duncan quickly learned that having a planned system of file sharing and syncing was crucial to the success of the planned process.  Every Wednesday two year 11 students volunteer their time to sync the iPods with any new content, or delete content that is no longer needed [Syncing, 2009] &lt;ref&gt;http://louiseduncan.globalteacher.org.au/2009/08/21/syncing/ accessed on October 2, 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;. This puts a lot of demand on teachers as they have to be planning at least a week in advance to ensure that the proper applications are on the iPods in time for students to use them during instruction. The flexibility of adding new applications was also an important factor. When Duncan found that students were interested in a specific topic she might instruct the year 11 students to load a specific application on his or her iPod. In a typical laptop situation this would not be possible, as software applications are far more expensive than applications from the iTunes store. However, at a minimal cost, students are able to have a personalized device where they can control their learning. 
[[Image:ipodtouch.jpg|right|iPod Touch|400px|thumbnail]]
	
Because the implementation of iPods as a one-to-one initiative was a new idea, there were some elements of the process that did not go as planned or needed to be clarified along the way. Originally when students first got their iPods they were allowed to have games on their iPod. However, Duncan quickly found that some students were distracted by the games during class.  Games that were not directly related to education and Duncan’s class were removed so students could stay focused on their work. Students were also originally permitted to listen to music in class while working. Again, this was an unforeseen distraction and students were asked to not listen to music in class and save it for after school. 
	
Another issue that evolved from the plan is the need for technical support.  While the iPods are wonderful when they are working, when they are not working, problems begin to occur in the classroom.  The primary issue Duncan found that affected large groups of students was that the batteries on student’s iPods were not lasting the duration of the school day.  Even though students were charging their iPods in the evening, they were listening to music on the way to school as well as heavily using their iPods throughout the school day.  Along with iPod batteries not lasting long, some batteries also ended up failing and needed to be replaced, leaving students without an iPod Touch.
	
A need that arose for Shepparton High School is a better way of syncing and charging all of the iPods at once.  Available in the U.S. is a cart system that will charge and sync the iPod Touches.  Not only would the year 11 students save time in the syncing process, but the iPods could also easily be stored and charged in a safe place. The lack of USB cords posed a problem because students took their USB cords home to charge their iPods at night, so additional cords needed to be purchased for at school to sync.  With the cart syncing and charging at school, this issue would also be eliminated.

===Summary of Initiative===

      <text xml:space="preserve">=The Strengths and Weaknesses of Thailand=

&quot;Thailand&quot; or the land of the Thai people, formerly known as Siam, has several strengths and weaknesses.

==Weaknesses==

There are some critical comments of Thailand, its culture and peoples....

==Strengths==

'''The Strengths of Thai Culture'''

Like any other nation states, Thailand has both strengths and weaknesses. There are several strengths, and some of which are:

1. Thai people are morally civilized. They have built their civilization based on the teachings of Lord Buddha. Since the influence of Buddhism, the teachings of Lord Buddha and His disciples (Buddhist monks and believers) have been implemented, it can safely be said that today Buddhism has permeated into almost all fabrics of Thai society.

Many aspects of the teachings are eco-friendly, as discussed by Rom Avudhkom. Many articles of Pra Vinai (the Disciplinary Text) states what should be done to live harmony with nature.

They are non-violent people as they prefer to live in peace.

2. Thais are people who care about their cultural identities. Another strength lies in the practice of the Thai people passed down generation after generation. Cam Troung has noted that:

&quot; However, wet paddy cultivation has been the driving force of the long historical development of the Thai community. It must not be forgotten on the other hand, that they have continued to maintain their links with upland forest areas through hunting and gathering activities. Their settlement and migration patterns are determined by this factor&quot;. 

&quot;One of the interesting features of their (The Thais) use of land resources is the division of the territory controlled by each village into reserved sections, reflecting a strong sense of ecological management, something that has been an intergral part of community traditions for a long time&quot; (p. 2).

&quot;The ancient laws of the Thai establish a classification of special areas which include sacred forests (where the Deities of Land and Water are warshipped); rivers and streams which are essential for community life and agriculture areas...&quot;

3. Thailand has several geographical advantages. In the past, the land was called &quot;Suwanna Bhumi&quot; or &quot;The Land of Gold&quot;, reflecting the richness and fertility of the land.

Evidence of the land of plenty can ne found inscribed on the stone discovered by King Monkut, which says that Siam is a land of plenty and bountiful. &quot;In the water there are fish' There is rice in the paddy.&quot;


=== Positive 'Good' Findings on Thailand===

A recent report released by the OECD finds that Thai people are satisfied with their lives. With a score of 7.2 on a scale of 1 to 10 (low to high satisfaction), &quot;Thai people (citizens) rank the country among the top four countries in terms of quality of life, just behind high-income
countries such as Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. The average life satisfaction score for 30 OECD countries is 6.7&quot;. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/26/58/43465137.pdf]

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Thailand as a Member of the International Communities=

Thailand is a member of the '''United nations'''. It's also a member of '''ASEAN'''.


==Thailand as a Member of ASEAN==
For the record, Thailand is one of the founding fathers of ASEAN. Others include Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.  The information below is from the official ASEAN website at http://www.aseansec.org/
&lt;br&gt;

'''Overview'''

ASEAN or The Association of Southeast Asian Nations was established on 8 August 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand, with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) by the Founding Fathers of ASEAN, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. 

Brunei Darussalam then joined on 8 January 1984, Viet Nam on 28 July 1995, Lao PDR and Myanmar on 23 July 1997, and Cambodia on 30 April 1999, making up what is today the ten Member States of ASEAN.


'''AIMS AND PURPOSES'''

As set out in the ASEAN Declaration, the aims and purposes of ASEAN are:

#To accelerate the economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region through joint endeavours in the spirit of equality and partnership in order to strengthen the foundation for a prosperous and peaceful community of Southeast Asian Nations;
#To promote regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries of the region and adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter;
#To promote active collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest in the economic, social, cultural, technical, scientific and administrative fields;
#To provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities in the educational, professional, technical and administrative spheres;
#To collaborate more effectively for the greater utilisation of their agriculture and industries, the expansion of their trade, including the study of the problems of international commodity trade, the improvement of their transportation and communications facilities and the raising of the living standards of their peoples;
#To promote Southeast Asian studies; and
#To maintain close and beneficial cooperation with existing international and regional organisations with similar aims and purposes, and explore all avenues for even closer cooperation among themselves.
&lt;br&gt;

'''FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES'''

In their relations with one another, the ASEAN Member States have adopted the following fundamental principles, as contained in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC) of 1976:

*Mutual respect for the independence, sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and national identity of all nations;
*The right of every State to lead its national existence free from external interference, subversion or coercion;
*Non-interference in the internal affairs of one another;
*Settlement of differences or disputes by peaceful manner;
*Renunciation of the threat or use of force; and 
*Effective cooperation among themselves.


Thailand has prepared itself to integrate with ASEAN, Asean friends (+3+6+00000) to develop its citizens and the global citizens.

==Thailand as a Member of the United Nations==

This is an interesting news article about the relationship between Thailand and the UN  found in ''the Nation'', dated 27 October 2009.

    The United nations yesterday marked its 60th year in Thailand and the growth of Bangkok as  
    a regional hub of the UN system. ... in 1949 Bangkok became home to the Economic Commission
    for Asia and the Far East, which later became the Economic and Social Commission for Asia
    and the Pacific (Escap.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Religions and Traditions=

Most Thais are Buddhists. Ruth Gerson (1996) has written that:

&quot;Thailand is predominantly a Theravada Buddhist country with a population that devoutly follows the teachings of the Buddha. (p. 3)&quot; 


'''Religions &amp; Beliefs in Thailand'''

Religion is considered an essential pillar of Thai society. It is not only the major moral force of Thai family and community, but it has also contributed to the molding of freedom loving, individualistic, and tolerant people for many centuries.

Theravada or Hinayana Buddhism is the national religion of Thailand but there is total religious freedom and all major religions can be found in practice. The right to practice any religion in Thailand is protected by the constitution. 

Buddhism, however, is the faith of 95 percent of the population, 4 percent are Muslims, 0.5 percent are Christians, and the remainder Hindus, Sikhs and other religions. Despite the fact that Buddhism is the faith of majority, both the king and the government uphold and support all the religions accepted by the people. Amidst rich diversity of beliefs, people of Thailand have always lived together in peace and harmony.

'''The Three Belief Systems'''

They are Animism, Brahmanism (Hinduism), and Buddhism.

Before the introduction of Buddhism, what did they believe in? Historical evidence shows that Thais believed in Hinduism and animism. Today, Thai society portrays the harmony combination of three belief systems:  Animism, Hinduism, and Buddhism.

Animism is a word derived from Latin animus or ‘soul’. The belief of animism is probably one of man's oldest beliefs, with its origin most likely dating from the Paleolithic age. Animism basically means that every object, even inanimate ones possess a soul or spirit.

Animism has been practices in Thailand in various forms, and one of which is ancestor-worship. It is a primitive belief of the Thai people. Animism forms the first layer of Thai religion. On top of the first layer is the combination/integration of Brahmanism and Buddhism. 

Brahmanism refers to the earlier state of Hinduism arrived at the Suwannabhumi region before the arrival of Buddhism. A lack of historical evidence makes it difficult to say exactly when Brahmanism entered Thailand. However, on the basis of available evidence, it can be conjectured that the influence of the religion dates from the Dvāravatī period (6th - 11th centuries). At that time the Khmer Empire held sway over much of what is now Thailand and Brahmanism was then well established in Cambodia.

Today, there are some 15-20 Brāhmanas or priests in Thailand of which 11 are attached to the Bureau of the Royal Household under the patronage of His Majesty the King and who perform the Royal rites on ceremonial days such as the annual Royal Ploughing Ceremony held in May at the Meru Ground next to the Grand Palace.

Being of the Shaivite sect, Thai Brāhmanas worship Śiva as their Supreme God, although there are others in the pantheon. This does not clash with Buddhism since, most people pray and make offerings to the devas (deities) for good fortune and to make special requests. The everyday practice of Buddhism can incorporate this.

As Buddhism and Hinduism were evolved from one and the same source, i.e. Brahmanism, there was no hindrance to their assimilation. Later on came Buddhism and most Thais adopted it as their national religion. The Thai inherited a fair proportion of Hinduism through the influence of the Cambodians who were in former days a society that practiced Hinduism.

Whatever cults and beliefs are adopted by the Thai people, they are readily modified to suit their temperament and surroundings. When they adopted Buddhism, they greatly modified their basic belief of animism into the fold of Buddhism. Likewise when they embraced Hinduism, they adapted it as a subordinate to the former.

There is a Thai saying, particularly among the Thai of the central area where Hinduism still has some force with the elite class, that &quot;Buddhism and Hinduism usually uphold each other&quot;.

Even though the vast majority of Thais are Buddhist, animistic beliefs are still a big part of daily life for a big portion of the Thais. Thais are generally a superstitious race.

In summary, Buddhism in a modified form (Animism, Hinduism, and Buddhism) is the mainspring of the national life. The problem is how well we can preserve this tradition against the aggressiveness of the new materialistic force of the present civilization. Thailand cannot neglect or ignore the powerful force which besets her with many dangers if her traditional ideals are not to be uprooted suddenly. 

&lt;br&gt;'''Questions'''&lt;/br&gt;
Give an example of Thai-style practices that reflect the combination of the three beliefs systems (animism, Hinduism, and Buddhism).

Why do you think superstition has woven in the Thai way of life and Thai Buddhism?

Give three examples of Thai superstitions. 

What do Buddhists believe? Do you believe in karma?

Many Thais are very superstitious, e.g. they hold on to the magic power of amulets, charms, etc. We have learned from media that there are many monks and Wats involved in this trade which makes it even more confusing. It is almost voodoo-like with a belief that amulets possess special powers and magic based on what it is composed of and which monk from which temple blessed it, etc. These are examples of Thai superstitions. What do you think of the Thai saying &quot;Do not despise/defame any belief or practice if you do not believe in it.”? Should we embrace or abandon it? Why?

Some say that, although Thais have studied modern science for more than a century, the set of beliefs constitutive of modern science still has yet to permeate into the cultural fabric. Do you agree with this statement? Why?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Socio-Political Background of the Thai Society==

The king is the head of state.  The prime minister or premier is the head of government.

The premier and other members of the Cabinet make the Government's policies and carry out the operations of the government.

Thailand is divided into 76 provinces. The capital city is Bangkok. In terms of its administrative divisions, the provinces are divided into 795 districts (amphoe), 81 subdistricts (king amphoe), 7,255 rural administrative subdistricts (tambon), and 69,866 villages (muban).

== Social Structure of the Thai Society==

‘ village’ or ‘Moo Ban’  is the most basic unit of the structure. In the past, it was  a self-contained community in terms of economy and basic needs. 

In general, Thai people's ways of life and customs are based mainly on agricultural activities and religious activities. Most villages had a wat (Buddhist monastery). Most villages have a shrine for a village deity. Wats have been the spiritual and educational centers.

== The Sakdina System ==

Prai Sakdina System of the Ayudthaya Period

The Prai-Sakdinal system was a form of social system during the Ayudthaya period. It was establised to serve the state as well as to function as a means to balance the power of the administration of the kingdom/government.
 
The Prai (commoners) Sakdina system was invented to support the power of the rulers. During that time, Thai society divided its Prais or commoners into three groups:

1) Prai Som, 2) Prai Suai, and 3) Prai Luang  

1) Prai Som worked for the lords. Their wellbeings depended on their masters or lords. During the Ayudthaya period, this category of people worked for the state every other month (one month for the state - one month for the self). This system, perhaps, has created the concept of 'Nai' (Master) in Thai society (even today).

2) Prai Suai were war captives or labor given to the state by its vassal states.

3) Prai Luang served the king.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Position-less Motion==

As was referenced, a mass existing at a solitary position cannot be “actual” and exists in a potential state where E is all potential. It doesn’t mean it ceases to exist but rather that m is interpreted as being all potential with respect to gravity. This tends rather to suggest that when motion of a body of mass transpires and is accelerated, both the &lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;source forcing the mass to be pushed and the object itself DO NOT displace from position to position but from positions to positions.

&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;MC - &lt;i&gt;The source is always a problem in the goal of FTL, without it, displacement is N/A, the only way to do so would suggest omitting the source of the force, and this can only be done through automation, as it is with space-time, or an automated force&lt;/i&gt;.

Hence the proper equation is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1P}{M}=\frac{(E\div (-E))}{PN^1}&lt;/math&gt;

Where N is an indeterminable number of positions. We have therefore just revealed that positions are imaginary due to the fact that Ε is indebted to G to manifest positions. And that without G in E Position(s) cannot become actual. (&lt;i&gt;This may appear similar to potential energy, but gravitation is behind Pe, which is really kinetic&lt;/i&gt;).

The operation (Ε/(−Ε)) is the only method I know of to show how E is in-debt to G to cause positional prohibitions (limits, df) defined from Δd. (Ε-(−Ε)) is not respective of –1 only. Where i is an imaginary number corresponding to ΡΝ created by the indebtedness of energy to G.

&lt;p&gt;'''Function''' - pre-written formula built into Excel that takes different values and performs an operation: SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN
&lt;p&gt;'''Order Of Operations''' - PMDAS (Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   '''P''' - parentheses
&lt;li&gt;   '''E''' - exponents
&lt;li&gt;   '''M &amp; D''' - Multiplication and Division taken left to right
&lt;li&gt;   '''A &amp; S''' - Addition and Subtraction taken left to right
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'''Point Mode''' - selecting cells for a formula by clicking on them with the mouse
&lt;p&gt;'''Smart Tags''' - Dates, financial symbols, people's names, indicated by a small purple triangle in the cell.  Clicking on this purple triangle gives a list of actions you can perform for that cell
&lt;p&gt;'''Smart Tag Indicator''' - the small purple triangle itself is the indicator that a smart tag is available
&lt;p&gt;'''Arguments''' - The values that you plug into a function are called the arguments.  In a SUM function it would be the list of cells you want to add together: =SUM(C2:C15)   This means to add the values in the cells from C2 down to C15.  
&lt;p&gt;'''Average''' - Sums the numbers in a range and then divides by the number of cells in that range. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Max''' - A function that will display the highest value in a range of cells
&lt;p&gt;'''Min''' - A function that will display the lowest value in a range of cells
&lt;p&gt;'''Range Finder''' - A helping function in Excel that checks which cells are referenced in a formula.  Very convenient if you have accidentally clicked on the wrong row or column for one of the values. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Theme''' -  a set of predefined colors, fonts, chart styles, cell styles,a nd fill effects in an Excel Workbook.
&lt;p&gt;'''Accounting Number Format''' - displays the numbers as a dollar value with the dollar sign to the left of the numbers, a comma every three digits and rounded to the nearest hundredth. 
&lt;p&gt;'''fixed dollar sign''' - the dollar sign in a cell is to the far left
&lt;p&gt;'''floating dollar sign''' - the dollar sign is just to the left of the numbers
&lt;p&gt;'''Comma Style Format''' - uses commas but no dollar signs in the numbers
&lt;p&gt;'''Conditional Formatting''' - Formatting that changes depending on the value in the cell, or what condition the value meets.  You could change the color of numbers to blue for any number over 1,000,000 for example. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Condition''' - A relation between at least two values.  If a number is less than 7 then ..., this is a condition.  
&lt;p&gt;'''Pixel''' - The smallest element of a graphic.  It represents on dot of color on a screen.  The size of the dot is based on your screen resolution. A resolution of 1024X768 means that you have 1024 pixels across and 768 pixels down the screen.  
&lt;p&gt;'''Spell Checker''' - An operation in Excel that looks for possible spelling errors in a worksheet, comparing the words against a standard dictionary of words. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Page Layout''' - a view of the worksheet that lets you edit the worksheet while seeing how it will look in printed form. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Normal View''' - the default view of Excel allowing you to adjust the margins, header or footer.  
&lt;p&gt;'''Previewing the Worksheet''' - When you print an Excel Worksheet you should ALWAYS print preview before printing.  This allows you to check to see what is being cut off and placed on a separate page.  It also lets you see if you have a stray character that will cause you to print 100 pages instead of just 1. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Values Version''' - this is the default view and lets you see the results of the formulas and functions in each cell. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Formulas Version''' - this lets you see the functions and formulas in each cell instead of the value from the computation. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Debugging''' - the process of checking your formulas or functions to find errors.
&lt;p&gt;'''In-cell editing''' - Double clicking on the cell and making the changes in the cell itself. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Best fit''' - Double clicking between two rows or columns and letting Excel choose the best width or height depending on the largest contents of a cell in that row or column.

===Fill in the cells with formulas=== 
'''Fill in the empty columns'''
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial cost = (shares) * (Initial price per share)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to cell F4
&lt;li&gt;Type and click on: =D4*E4
&lt;li&gt;Use the fill handle to fill down the column
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current value = (Shares) * (Current Price/Share)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to cell H4
&lt;li&gt;Type and click on: =D4*G4
&lt;li&gt;Use the fill handle to fill down the column
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain/Loss = (Current Value) - (Initial Cost)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to cell I4
&lt;li&gt;Type and click on: =H4-F4
&lt;li&gt;Use the fill handle to fill down the column
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percent Gain/Loss = (Gain/Loss) / (Initial Cost)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to cell J4
&lt;li&gt;Type and click on: =I4/F4
&lt;li&gt;Use the fill handle to fill down the column
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
===Fill Cells in with Functions===
&lt;p&gt; '''Fill in the rows 13 - 16'''
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total =SUM(D4:D12)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to cell D13
&lt;li&gt;Click on the Sigma (AutoSum)
&lt;li&gt;Check that the correct range is chosen (D4:D12) and press enter
&lt;li&gt;Use the fill handle to fill across the row
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average =AVERAGE(D4:D12)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to cell D14
&lt;li&gt;Click on the drop down menu with the Sigma (AutoSum)and choose AVERAGE
&lt;li&gt;Check that the correct range is chosen (D4:D12) and press enter
&lt;li&gt;Use the fill handle to fill across the row
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highest = MAX(D4:D12)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to cell D15
&lt;li&gt;Click on the drop down menu with the Sigma (AutoSum)and choose MAX
&lt;li&gt;Check that the correct range is chosen (D4:D12) and press enter
&lt;li&gt;Use the fill handle to fill across the row
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lowest = MIN(D4:D12)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to cell D16
&lt;li&gt;Click on the drop down menu with the Sigma (AutoSum)and choose MIN
&lt;li&gt;Check that the correct range is chosen (D4:D12) and press enter
&lt;li&gt;Use the fill handle to fill across the row
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Verify a formula with the range finder===
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your formulas into excel you might need to go back and verify that you have entered them correctly.  If you single click on a cell that has a formula then you will see the formula in the formula bar and the value from the formula in the cell. 
&lt;p&gt;If you double click on the cell with a formula the formula will show up in the cell and the '''RANGE FINDER''' feature will be turned on.  This will outline the different cells that are used in the formula to make it easier to verify that you have entered the formula correctly.  
&lt;p&gt;This is very handy in the case where you accidentally click on a cell in a row lower than you meant to.

===Apply a Theme to a workbook===
&lt;p&gt;So far the spreadsheet is considered to be mostly unformatted. An easy way to format a worksheet is to apply a '''THEME'''.   You can change the theme of a worksheet from the Page Layout tab.  In the far left there is a themes button.  Play with the themes for the worksheet until you find one that you like.  
&lt;p&gt;Format the headings using the Cell Styles button from the HOME tab. The options here are dependent on the THEME you chose earlier. You should format each heading (row A and B) separately to give the main heading more emphasis than the sub heading. 
&lt;p&gt;Change the background color by selecting the cells you want to change and then clicking on the Fill color button from the HOME tab (it looks like a paint bucket).
&lt;p&gt;Add a border around the headings from the BORDERS button in the HOME tab. Chose both headings at one time, then click on the Thick Box Border. 
&lt;p&gt;Put a bottom border under row 3 using the border button. 
&lt;p&gt;Put a total Style on the total row. 
&lt;p&gt;Bold the row headings: Totals, Average, Highest, Lowest

===Number Styles===
&lt;p&gt;'''Accounting Number Format''' - When working with number such as stocks it is good to use Accounting Number Format.  This will place the dollar sign to the left of the number (as a fixed dollar sign).  It will also insert commas every third position to the left of the decimal, and put the decimals to two places (hundredths).  A negative number will be displayed in parenthesis.  
&lt;p&gt;'''Comma Style Format''' - This will place a comma every third position to the left of the decimal. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Percents''' - Will move the decimal two places and place a percent sign at the end.  
&lt;p&gt;If you want to change the number of decimals then click on the increase or decrease decimal buttons in the NUMBER group. 

===Apply conditional formatting===
&lt;p&gt;Conditional formatting lets you change how a cell is formatted based on the values in the cell.  In this case we will use the example of changing negative percent gain/loss to red so we can see them more easily.  
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click and drag over the range J4:J12
&lt;li&gt;From the HOME tab click on CONDITIONAL FORMATTING
&lt;li&gt;Click on NEW RULE
&lt;li&gt;Click on FORMAT ONLY CELLS THAT CONTAIN
&lt;li&gt;In the edit rule section at the bottom set FORMAT ONLY CELLS WITH: to Cell Value
&lt;li&gt;change the next drop down to LESS THAN
&lt;li&gt;type in the value 0 in the last field. 
&lt;li&gt;Click on the FORMAT button
&lt;li&gt;Go to the FILL tab
&lt;li&gt;Click on a color for a background color 
&lt;li&gt;Go to the FONT tab
&lt;li&gt;Change the color of the font so it will show up with your background color
&lt;li&gt;Click OK
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Page Layout View===
&lt;p&gt;The current view you are in is NORMAL VIEW.  Change to page layout view by clicking the page layout button in the lower right of the window.  Notice what is going to be cut off when you print and placed on a separate page.  
&lt;p&gt;I usually do my page layout from the print preview screen.  
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the Office Button
&lt;li&gt;Click on PRINT
&lt;li&gt;Click on PRINT PREVIEW
&lt;li&gt;Click on Page Setup
&lt;li&gt;Click on Landscape because this table is wider than it is tall
&lt;li&gt;Click on Fit to -1- page wide by -1- page tall
&lt;li&gt;Click on OK
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then usually print from the Print Preview screen because it is a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get). 
&lt;p&gt;NOTE - If you go to the SHEET tab from the Page Set up dialog box you can turn on grid lines to make your spreadsheet easier to read.

===Rename a sheet tab===
&lt;p&gt;Go to Sheet 2
&lt;p&gt;Double click on the sheet tab and rename it to real-time Stock Quote
&lt;p&gt;Make cell A1 the active cell

===Import stocks from a Web Source===
&lt;p&gt;Go to the DATA Tab
&lt;p&gt;Click on Existing Connections in the Get External Data group
&lt;p&gt;Click on MSN MoneyCentral Investor Stock Quotes
&lt;p&gt;Click on Existing Worksheet
&lt;p&gt;Click on OK
&lt;p&gt;check the box for Use this value/reference for future refreshes
&lt;p&gt;click OK
&lt;p&gt;be patient as the spread sheet is created for you with all the current values of your stock.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Concepts of QN==

Imagine the implications of a new science depicting the real nature of the Quantum. As opposed to those current efforts still underway that now appear to retard advancement.

Although Einstein held a peculiar distaste towards the Quantum revolution developing around him (something which he started with the photoelectric effect) and something by which he attempted to debunk in the now famous paper on spooky action at a distance (The EPR thought experiment – 1939 - which led to the Quantum Teleportation at IBM), however Einstein still stuck to his 4 - dimensional relativistic-(s), rather than being inclusive of more dimensions, as the Klausa-Klein theory clearly demonstrates when it finally reached his office. Additionally Einstein also tried to unify near his death, where it remains incomplete. 

(Initially, Einstein contradicted himself on the matter several times).

Einstein held that physical matter was nothing more than a concentrated field of force or forces. Force as we know is in fact manually operated energy. In other words what we know to be physical, being possessed by the properties of substance is an intangible concentration of waveforms. What these waveforms consisted of exactly was not clear but further evidence is known by the celebrated equation:

                                E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Inversely:

                                m=Ec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Energy and matter are equivalent; one can produce the other. We might assume that Quantum Nanotechnology starts with the &lt;b&gt;rearrangement of particles&lt;/b&gt;, but as we probe deeper into the insights of this QN you will comprehend it’s real meanings. If in reading this manuscript you do not comprehend these concepts, &lt;b&gt;re-read&lt;/b&gt; them again and they should become clear to you. 

With particle rearrangement it would be practical to cause Quantum manufacturing, except that no Quantabots or simile mechanizations would be necessary to shift particles that constitute the atoms of molecules. 

In other respects particle creation would enable the solutions to Quatraneons, GUT theories and similar spin-offs. All of which lead to ultimate control spaces for scientific endeavors but please don’t blow up the universe by destroying all forms of energy.

FTL would also result as a by-product, through the creation and elimination of them.

Gravitons are false assumptions for the simple reason that whenever energy is or becomes established in space-time degrees of freedom automatically produce positions. 

Using a transportation method, which does not incorporate energy results in the manifestation of no positions. In other words positions are the direct result of the establishments of energy in debt to G and traversal in it’s absence corresponds to their disappearance.

Where:

                                 dΕ = √ Ρ

Hence we treat the photon as a conveyor of the Gravity field perhaps as a cross-product of the interaction of electric and magnetic fields where Ε being present in the electric and magnetic fields or electromagnetic field is in debt to G-being that position of the entire particle as opposed to the conserved energy of the particle’s spin.

Electric and magnetic fields obey the laws of induction. From rest, in an unexcited state, Δν in any direction would result in an increase in the inducing fields across the particle as a whole. The increase in speed would cause these fields to increase inducing greater Gravitational force, improving it’s stability and hold the particle together with greater force. These fields collapse to smaller size as accelerated:

-a priori therefore


Stationary or accelerated (The establishments of Ε along with the Ε in the fields) manifests as
mass:

Cross product would then be applicable to GUT theories but not fully developed;

Thus:

                                     Ε x Β
                                     _____  = G
                                       T

Where T is the spin of the particle’s
Electromagnetic or Electric and Magnetic fields.

Where G equates:

&lt;math&gt;G= \left( \frac{E}{(-E)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

There is no telling how the spin of such photon waves translate into 360° rapid rotation but there lie a percent of the answer. Depictions 2-dimensionally are difficult to grasp and any spheroid shape may omit spin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Spin the solution to it all?==

However we can explain how the spin direction is simultaneity. Spin direction 2 of the photon is considerably finite and the speed of light is equal to 186,282.4 miles per second per second. 

That is it is a constant and it neither increases nor decreases without some outside intervention to aid it in becoming sluggish or faster. Limited to c = 1 second over which this speed covers. Over half this distance 93,141.2 the mass-less energy covers this distance at c in ½ second and on down the line to 1 mile and 1 inch. Commonly these distances are covered with the use of lasers. Rectilinearly, although mass-less energy from lasers bent into a 360° hoop or cylinder by electric or magnetic fields to it repeats in a circle at c over and over again.

The repetitious rate is measured by choosing a point on the inner or outer circumference to determine in how many seconds the speed of c (in this case angular velocity) (ω) (speed may differ from velocity in that it has magnitude) takes to complete 1 revolution (or many) in 1 second. The RPS is completely dependent on the distance of the circumference. Thus like our prior example ν=c covers 186,282.4 miles in 1 second from point A to point B. 

The point on the radius however is both point A and B because NO LIMIT exists in a 360° circle-it is perfectly uniform. So an RPS for the angular velocity of c about a circumferential distance of 186, 282.4 would be 1 second.93,141.2miles would be ½ second. At 1 mile would be 0+1 second. At 1 inch-1 would be absolute zero seconds. And this is approximately equal to 372,564.8 RPS! Now that is fast!

Relativistically,and provided the source is dismissed a ring of light could be observed. Accordingly the light ring created through optics and the usage of a section of a cylindrical Potassium Di-hydrogen Phosphate Crystal (KDP)and laser tech, does this without disappearing from current space-time- it remains here, in current space in current time. It does this through what is known as Global Causality Violation. (GVC for short). (again, Frank J. Tipler) Physical Review D 1974)). 

That is a cylinder or ring of light in this case, travels so quickly that the mass-less energy winds around the axis, goes through time, curls through space, arriving at the exact position (on the radius) from which it left, &lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;at a little less than the same time it left.

&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;MC - &lt;i&gt;we can see here that gravity is the inhibition here preventing the simultaneity of the GCV of the speck, otherwise it would most definitely emerge through time&lt;/i&gt;.

That is a return to the point on the radius arrives and leaves simultaneously. It is assumed that arriving occurs before leaving. However this is not the case and does NOT depend on the circumferential distance. Only the energy does this through RPS to renew energy before losing it timitically corresponding to the finite distance. This may tend to go against the grain but as we shall see later the evidence will become clear.

Now imagine how finite a particle is. It is moving about itself so rapidly that GVC is occurring. It is doing so timitically via the initial distance inductive of RPS. Thus the RPS is timitically dependent
upon the distance and hence simultaneity, in 1 direction. In another term the RPS rate of the constant c about the axis uses &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past returning to &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; future to remain in current time. 

As opposed to time travel (That is if travel is required to move through time, since obviously the ring is going “nowhere”), to &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; past or &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; future. Supposed “travel” to &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; past or &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; future suggests that Parallel Universes are nothing more than alternate time-lines, dependent upon current time to the number of possible outcomes that can become actual to the number of degrees of freedom imposed via positions that a physical object or organism can assume through energy. And you know that energy is the only reason why positions exist and that without the usage of energy to move,positions cannot formulate. 

Thus time is an illusion because we perceive prohibitions from a standpoint that FTL can be accomplished by virtue of energy, which is of course is ridiculous in the spotlight of a manually based external force, the force can never overcome the thing to which it`s energy transfers. 

Positions and the constraints of these degrees of freedom in light of these positions; manifestations caused by energy in debt to G, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;is because that is where Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy originate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. 

So to incorporate a method of travel of Trans-positioning through intermediate space-time, that does not require energy, would eliminate the prohibitions caused by energy establishments resulting in FTL by time travel, alternate time-line exploration, and other spin-offs including teleportation.

From this alone you should know by now that relativity is based on energies in relationship to it establishing degrees of freedom, which are positions, and therefore should a method be unraveled whereby travel is accomplished to other destinations and/or times relativity would fall!

Interested readers might skim through the contents and leap to this page to discover what it means. Every educated person is aware that energy and matter are equivalent. We also know that energy and matter are interchangeable. We understand this to be true because everybody is aware of Einstein’s famed equation:

                               Ε=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

This then being true,(or absolute) then the opposite is true where matter is equal to an amount of energy:

                               E = 2mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;i&gt;These two equations have been verified in particle accelerators using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production pair production] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation mutual annihilation]&lt;/i&gt;.

Powerful experimental bombs have shown this to be true, as well as successful experiments conducted in huge particle accelerators. But what do we have? 

Now that we have a good interpretation of particles and what some do, let us explain something here; something we barely touched upon earlier is the creation of particles. Assuming this to be true then particles could not only be created from spinning photons, they can also be destroyed and/or even replaced. 

But what do we indicate when we express &quot;by created and destroyed&quot;? By “create” it is meant to cause photons to gyrate in a certain direction through electric and/or magnetic forces.

By destroy it is meant to cause or create a limit in a particle or un-hitch it to straight way propagation through external electromagnetic force fields.

Now there are a multitude of examples to create and destroy certain particles constituting these finite little buggers but all in all they are never accomplished through such methods or trials and errors. The creation and destruction of spinning photon particles are not done via speed nor velocity of the particle itself. 

Since we have already explained that c is constant, and that Ε branches out so to speak to prohibit or limit our actions to a limited set equidistant degrees of freedom from an initial axis - by the very instance of manually established Ε, then it follows that if we try to create and/or destroy these particles with anything out of the ordinary, that starts with energy, we will eventually discover that we are going through the same old tire tracks we did before in trying to overcome faster than light travel by using manually based energy. 

When in all fairness it is energy that causes these limitations by it being in debt to G - to manifest positions in the first place - so we need to discard it (in a manual respect too) as unacceptable if we are to ever accomplish this goal…forever.

Considering that an RPS rate revolving about a central axis at c, of the circumference:

                                  D
                                 ___ =RPS
                                  c

Altercations in D mutate the value for RPS. If it is bigger than a certain value, the RPS of D by c will slow - arriving at the position from which it left (a point on the radius of the outer circumference) later and later. Which is normal causality where a thing arrives to another destination after leaving. But usually in another position crossing intervening space-or position to position.

[[File:Threefold_distance_Image26.png|thumb|300px|'''Intermediate Spacetime''']]

But when D is altered to become more finite, RPS arrives at the same position at the same time it left, and then reduced more finitely the arrival to the same position would &lt;i&gt;seem to&lt;/i&gt; occur &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; leaving - if that were possible, arrival would be earlier than leaving. This is the causality violation we have mentioned to you before - it occurs globally. In normal situations arrival transpires &lt;b&gt;after&lt;/b&gt; leaving. Supposing that the point is relocated to any other part of the circumference the same difference is evident.

Why?

Distance, (D).

Say for instance that a particle’s distance is expanded to a fixed distance where the value of RPS leaves and arrives at the same position at the exact same time. Will this then indicate that it can
now be displaced from P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;?

The answer is NO it does not mean this. Initially, because the energy is returning or re-turning to &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; present - from &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past in the same space - it therefore is going absolutely &lt;b&gt;nowhere&lt;/b&gt; by retaining the value of remaining in the &lt;b&gt;present&lt;/b&gt;. 

And this is why it &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;cannot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; arrive before leaving with respect to gravity. 

While, in comparison, the exact opposite is true for vast distances unequal to 186,282.4 miles, in 1 second of travel for mass-less energy - for such increases via Quantum Tunneling past c, every expanse (of real space) past this value of D, in straight lines, a corresponding increase past c would be necessary to compensate in the increase of the distance to match 1 second or below. 

Literally in straight-line motion to adjust the value of RPS, as would be by rectilinear traversement the value of c would be for the inverse situation - only this applied to straight lines between positions.

Once again we find ourselves back with our old enemy - energy - with it we are doomed to eternal failure in trying to incorporate it into the problem of causing FTL.

Causing more potentiality through gravity might be keyed into negative particles, provided they are timitic or time travitic. Incidentally negative particles and negative matter therefore are not created by forcing them to become smaller via &lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;compression, forcing the energy to &lt;i&gt;borrow&lt;/i&gt; against positive energy, and thereby be in-debt - (ed) to energy, because potentiality and Ε are interdependent,as is four-velocity motion being one and the same. The only other way is to cause it to avoid loss in Ε by renewal in Ε.

To manifest such a particle through Increased Deceleration designed to be 1 whole percentage above that of the initial velocity (Relativistically) would also be incorrect, although indication has it
that in doing so 2 and even 3 or 4 times above an initial velocity, and depending on the distance also, a (−0) will become apparent. 

The reason why this won’t work is again due to the energy requirements necessary in causing an unequivalent increase in deceleration as much as accumulation to an initial velocity. Rest here is immaterial because it is due to gravity when force is applicable.

Timitically, although energy could be avoided while potential, becomes fully manifest in a particle.

But what is happening here? Where are the extremes? First a particle is produced by means of one or more spinning photons or rectilinearly.

The finite distance of it is small enough so that the energy goes from a leaving point on the radius - back in time to return to the present - by coming back from the past - through the future - but &lt;b&gt;NEVER&lt;/b&gt; in another position other than the one measured by the point on the radius and never altogether for the entire particle since that would mean it is duplicating the action of the light ring remaining in the present. 

Always by (ω) (angular velocity or speed) at c. Always in the same positions when the point is relocated to any other place on the outer circumference.

Timitically - by RPS determined by c over the distance, over and over again, Ε goes back but does not stay back in time. Because coming back to the present requires that it must come from &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past - to &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; future - to arrive in &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; now. 

The more finite although, the more Ε goes back in time as if having to push it there relying on THE future. But ΔD also causes Δt where expansion and contraction of the circumferential distance is available.

&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;Proper compression of light Quanta forces it to borrow against negative energy to pass through a barrier. Various experiments have yielded in Quantum Tunneling successes of light becoming faster than light and in one 300 times faster.

Since it would be arriving back - before it left, it (the speck) would arrive back before it left in the same position - if the position where different than that referenced, to the point on the radius or the entire distance it might then be feasible to reverse Ε avoiding loss in Ε by renewal in Ε, so as to bring about Ε as avoided by total renewal in potential.

Nominally if a thing goes back in time to a position equal to it - leaving - a finite duration of time after it arrives - will allow it to proceed back to the present by going to the future from the past to/or at the present position from which it left.

What’s interesting about this odd reciprocal behavior, is in that, the reciprocation of the particle in being so finite - is that the value of RPS moves backward &lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt; time - to the past coming back
to the present to deceive the mind that it is supposedly arriving before leaving, when in reality this deception is &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; transpiring to the energy renewal in RPS, avoiding loss in energy (that is stopping and restarting (corners), arced)) due to the finite distance about which it traverses. 

Did it not already go to the past and come back to the future to the present - only to arrive once again in the past before leaving? 

Twice? 

It is again traversing through the past of the same position. What this shows is that the energy - by value of RPS - is traveling more and more to the past from the future the more finite D actually becomes.

So, the trip to the future the energy uses in RPS to return to the present begins to become smaller for every return before leaving - comprising as it were, any equilibrium that would be occurant if D were fixed at a circumference where leaving a position and arriving at a position were both at the same time, Aleodelogically.

When (and I mean this figuratively) the trip to the future decreases to 0 by the return trip - to the same position, travels or arrives in that past.

But because we are programmed to believe that zero is the limit, we assume that when D approaches 0 distance, no distance, that the whole process comes to a screeching halt and either ceases or discontinues.

(MC - (&lt;i&gt;But does not cessation come from result of partially automated systems with respect to automated space-time?

Indeed&lt;/i&gt;))!

But is this the case seeing the evidence laid out before us?

The answer to this is a definite NO.

Why?

The reasoning behind this is due to outcomes. In conjunction with this do you recall that loss in energy is being avoided by the renewal of energy about the distance at c by RPS? It is these outcomes (at least for energy) that determine the future (or possible result) for energy.

So if energy possesses no outcome - to result in, then how then can it be in the present?

And without a present or now there can be no df. Perhaps this sounds a bit confusing to the reader and I do not mean to wander so let’s explain what this means. In the presence of energy there are enough positions throughout the universe that account for degrees of freedom, any one of them are possible for Ε. 

But for these degrees of freedom to come out in an outcome they must possess a past also to emerge from, (under normal circumstances) one that can go to THE future to be present in &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; now. 

Thus all energy in whatever form - formulates by emergence from &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past to &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; future and into &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; now. 

This statement alone should be clear to you. 

The result of energy formulating from the past to remain attached to the now, is degrees of freedom by retainment of Ε in the present - all equivalently but never in the same position. 

These degrees of freedom incurred by energy to time prevent travel beyond the “now” so that now-retainment of energy creates df, &lt;i&gt;repititically&lt;/i&gt; - (that is we can move in so many df and then they eventually repeat) past to future to now equilibrium. Relativistically all three (past, future and now) interdependently “stretch”, where vast distance compensation in speed at c is needed to compensate for the extensive distance to reduce time-being unequal to c to D.

So in establishments of Ε, the interdependency of time is set up (so to speak) to prohibit Ε into the “now”, so that the now-and consequently the inability to go beyond it - (which would collapse the df via time travitics) acts as or is the df itself - thus preventing travel beyond the now by retention in it through the establishments of energy in debt to G in this repetitive past to future to now -- equilibrium. 

Therefore this interdependency for Ε is df in the retention of Ε in the now.

Let &lt;math&gt;P_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; denote the space of polynomials of degree at most &lt;math&gt; n-1\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Show that


&lt;math&gt; \langle p, q \rangle \equiv (p(A)v_1, q(A)v_1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


defines an inner product on &lt;math&gt;P_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, where the expression on the right above is the Euclidean inner product in &lt;math&gt;R^n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

|}

==Solution 1a ==

===Symmetry===
&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\langle p , q \rangle &amp;= ( p(A)v_1, q(A)v_1 )\\
                      &amp;= ( q(A)v_1, p(A)v_1) \\
                      &amp;= \langle q, p \rangle
\end{align}

\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
===Linearity of 1st Argument===

Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb{R} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\langle \alpha p , q \rangle &amp;= ( \alpha p(A)v_1, q(A)v_1) \\
                             &amp;= \alpha (p(A)v_1, q(A)v_1) \\
                             &amp;= \alpha \langle p , q \rangle
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\langle p+r, q \rangle &amp;= ( (p(A)+r(A))v_1, q(A)v_1 ) \\
                       &amp;= ( p(A)v_1, q(A)v_1) + (r(A)v_1, q(A)v_1) \\
                       &amp;= \langle p, q \rangle + \langle r, q \rangle
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


===Positive Definiteness===

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\langle p, p \rangle &amp;= ( \underbrace{p(A)v_1}_{\hat{v}}, \underbrace{p(A)v_1)}_{\hat{v}} \mbox{ where } \hat{v} \in R^n  \\
                     &amp;= (\hat{v}, \hat{v} ) \\
                     &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{v}_i)^2 \geq 0
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


===&quot;Zeroness&quot;===

We also need to show that &lt;math&gt; \langle p, p \rangle =0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;p =0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

====Forward Direction (alt)====

Suppose &lt;math&gt; p\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. It suffices to show &lt;math&gt;\langle p,p\rangle\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, this a trivial consequence of the fact that &lt;math&gt; p(A)v_1\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; (which is clear from the fact that &lt;math&gt; p(A)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;p\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; with degree less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt; v_i&lt;/math&gt; does not lie in the orthogonal compliment of any of the &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt; distinct eigen vectors of &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt;).

=====Forward Direction=====

Claim: If &lt;math&gt;\langle p, p  \rangle =0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;p=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


From hypothesis


&lt;math&gt;v_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i u_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;u_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the orthogonal eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are non-zero


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\langle p, p, \rangle &amp;= (p(A)v_1, p(A)v_1) \\
                      &amp;= (p(A) \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i u_i, p(A) \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i u_i) \\
                      &amp;= ( \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i u_i, \sum_{i=1}^n \beta u_i) \mbox{  (since } u_i \mbox{ are eigenvectors )} \\
                      &amp;= 0 \mbox{ (by hypothesis) } 
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Notice that &lt;math&gt;\beta_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, the coefficients of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and the scaling coefficient &lt;math&gt;m_i  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; of the eigenvector e.g. &lt;math&gt;A u_i = m_i u_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Since &lt;math&gt;u_i \neq 0 \forall i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \neq 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, this implies &lt;math&gt;p =0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  
=====Reverse Direction=====

If &lt;math&gt;p=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\langle p, p \rangle = (\underbrace{p(A)}_0v_1, \underbrace{p(A)}_0v_1)=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the recurrence


&lt;math&gt;\beta_{j+1}v_{j+1} = A v_j - \alpha_j v_j - \beta_j v_{j-1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_j \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are scalars and &lt;math&gt;v_0 \equiv 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Show that &lt;math&gt;v_j=p_{j-1}(A) v_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p_{j-1}(t) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;j-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

|}

==Solution 1b==

By induction.

===Base Case===

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\beta_2 v_2 &amp;= Av_1 - \alpha_1 v_1 - \beta_1 \underbrace{v_0}_0 \\
        v_2 &amp;= \frac{1}{\beta_2} [Av_1 -\alpha_1 v_1 ] \\
        v_2 &amp;= p_1 (A) v_1 \quad p_1(t)=\frac{1}{\beta_2}[t-\alpha_1] 
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\beta_3 v_3 &amp;= Av_2 - \alpha_2 v_2 - \beta_2 v_1 \\
        v_3 &amp;= \frac{1}{\beta_3}[ \underbrace{Av_2}_{ \in p_2(A)v_1} - \underbrace{\alpha_2 v_2}_{\in p_1(A)v_1} - \underbrace{\beta_2 v_1}_{\in p_0(A)v_1}] \\
            &amp;\in p_{2}(A)v_1
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Induction Step===

Claim: &lt;math&gt;v_j = p_{j-1}(A) v_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hypothesis: 

Suppose

&lt;math&gt; v_{j} = p_{j-1}(A)v_1  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v_{j-1} = p_{j-2}(A)v_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;p_{j-1}&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;p_{j-2}&lt;/math&gt;) has degree &lt;math&gt;j-1&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;j-2&lt;/math&gt;). Then for &lt;math&gt;\beta_{j+1}\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v_{j+1} = \frac{A p_{j-1}(A) - \alpha_j p_{j-1}(A) - \beta_j p_{j-2}(A)}{\beta_{j+1}} v_1  &lt;/math&gt;

which is as desired.

Suppose the scalars above are such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j=(Av_j,v_j) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta_{j+1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that &lt;math&gt;\|v_{j+1}\|_2=1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Use this to show that that the polynomials in part (b) are othogonal with respect to the inner product from part (a.

|}

==Solution 1c==
Since &lt;math&gt;v_j = p_{j-1}(A)v_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle p, q \rangle \equiv (p(A)v_1, q(A)v_1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, it is equivalent to show that &lt;math&gt;(v_i, v_j)=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i \neq j \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Since 

:&lt;math&gt;v_{j+1}=\frac{1}{\beta_{j+1}}Av_j - \frac{\alpha_j}{\beta_j}v_j - \frac{\beta_{j+1}}{\beta_j}v_{j-1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, 


it is then sufficient to show that


&lt;math&gt;(v_{j+1}, v_j)=(v_{j+1},v_{j-1})=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


===Claim &lt;math&gt; (v_{j+1},v_j)=0 \quad \forall j \!\,&lt;/math&gt;===

By induction.

====Base Case====

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
v_2 &amp;= \frac{1}{\beta_2}(Av_1 - \alpha_1 v_1) \\
(v_2,v_1) &amp;= \frac{1}{\beta_2}[(Av_1,v_1)-\underbrace{\alpha_1}_{(Av_1,v_1)} \underbrace{(v_1,v_1)}_1]  \\
          &amp;= 0
\end{align}
 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Induction Step====

Assume: &lt;math&gt;(v_j,v_{j-1})=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Claim: &lt;math&gt;(v_{j+1},v_j)=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
v_{j+1}  &amp;=\frac{1}{\beta_{j+1}}[Av_j-\alpha_jv_j - \beta_jv_{j-1}] \\
(v_{j+1},v_j)&amp;=\frac{1}{\beta_{j+1}}[(Av_j,v_j)-\underbrace{\alpha_j}_{(Av_j,v_j)}\underbrace{(v_j,v_j)}_1-\beta_j \underbrace{(v_{j-1},v_j)}_0]\\
             &amp;=0
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Claim &lt;math&gt;(v_{j+1},v_{j-1})=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;===

By induction.

====Base Case====

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
v_3 &amp;= \frac{1}{\beta_3}[Av_2-\alpha_2v_2-\beta_2v_1] \\
(v_3,v_1) &amp;= \frac{1}{\beta_3}[(Av_2,v_1)-\alpha_2\underbrace{(v_2,v_1)}_0-\beta_2\underbrace{(v_1,v_1)}_1] \\
          &amp;= \frac{1}{\beta_3}[(Av_2,v_1)-\beta_2] \\
          &amp;= \frac{1}{\beta_3}[(v_2,Av_1)-\beta_2] \mbox{ (because A symmetric) } \\
          &amp;= \frac{1}{\beta_3}[ \beta_2 -\beta_2] =0 \mbox{ (see below) }
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\beta_2v_2 &amp;= Av_1-\alpha_1 v_1 \\
\beta_2\underbrace{(v_2,v_2)}_1 &amp;= (Av_1,v_2) -\alpha_1 \underbrace{(v_1, v_2)}_0 \\
       \beta_2 &amp;= (Av_1,v_2)
\end{align}

\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Induction Step====

Assume: &lt;math&gt;(v_j,v_{j-2})=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Claim: &lt;math&gt;(v_{j+1},v_{j-1})=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

                  &amp;= \frac{1}{\beta_{j+1}} [ (Av_j,v_{j-1})-\beta_j) ] \\
                  &amp;= \frac{1}{\beta_{j+1}} [ (v_j, Av_{j-1})-\beta_j ] \mbox{ (because A symmetric)} \\

\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;

\beta_jv_j &amp;= Av_{j-1}-\alpha_{j-1}v_{j-1}-\beta_{j-1}v_{j-2} \\

|}

==Solution 2a==

===Rewrite given equation on specific interval===

For a specific interval &lt;math&gt;[t_k, t_{k+1}] \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have from hypothesis


&lt;math&gt;(\frac{t_{k+1}-t_k}{2}) (f(t_k)+f(t_{k+1}))- \int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} f(t) = \int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} G(t) f'(t) dt  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Distributing and rearranging terms gives


&lt;math&gt; (1) \qquad (\frac{t_{k+1}-t_k}{2})f(t_k)+(\frac{t_{k+1}-t_k}{2})f(t_{k+1}))-\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} f(t) = \int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}}G(t)f'(t) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Apply Hint===
Starting with the hint and applying product rule, we get 


&lt;math&gt; \int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} (f(t)G(t))'dt = \int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} f'(t)G(t)dt + \int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} f(t)G'(t)dt \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Also, we know from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus


&lt;math&gt; \int^{t_{k+1}}_{t_k} (f(t)G(t))'dt = f(t_{k+1})G(t_{k+1}) - f(t_k)G(t_k) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Setting the above two equations equal to each other and solving for &lt;math&gt; 
\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} f'(t) G(t) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; yields


&lt;math&gt; (2) \qquad - G(t_k)f(t_k) + G(t_{k+1})f(t_{k+1}) - \int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} G'(t)f(t)dt = \int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}}  G(t)f'(t)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Choose G'(t)===

Let &lt;math&gt; G'(t) = 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore since &lt;math&gt;G(t) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is linear


&lt;math&gt; (3) \qquad G(t) = t + b \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


By comparing equations (1) and (2) we see that 


&lt;math&gt; G(t_{k+1}) = \frac{t_{k+1}-t_{k}}{2}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;  and  


&lt;math&gt;G(t_k) = - \frac{t_{k+1}-t_{k}}{2}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Plugging in either &lt;math&gt; G(t_{k})\!\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; G(t_{k+1})\!\,&lt;/math&gt; into equation (3), we get that  


&lt;math&gt; b = -\frac{t_{k+1} + t_k}{2}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hence


&lt;math&gt; G(t) = t - \frac{t_{k+1} + t_k}{2}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&amp;= \int_a^b \rho(x) dx
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
===Claim===  


&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n r_k(x) =1  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


===Proof===

Since &lt;math&gt;r_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n r_k(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Notice that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n r_k(x_i)=1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\ldots,n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the &lt;math&gt;n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; distinct roots of &lt;math&gt;Q_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n r_k (x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and takes on the value 1, &lt;math&gt;n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; distinct times


&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n r_k(x) =1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

The Thai word for this is 'อิสสะราย.' Told me the abbot of Wat (The word &quot;wat&quot; refers to a Buddhist Monastery/Temple)Porramai Yikawas in 2008.

What does the word &quot;Issarai&quot; mean?

Issarai is a Mon word. The meaning of which is still ambiguous. According to the abbot (Thai: เจ้าอาวาส), the story has been much loved by most people on the island.

Here is the story:

นิทานเรื่องนี้เป็นเรื่องของสามเณรชื่อ สุบินทสามเณร เป็นเรื่องเล่าที่ทำให้เราทราบว่าทำไมชาวมอญจึงนิยมให้ลูกหลานของตนบวชเณร

กาลครั้งหนึ่งนานมาแล้ว มีสองสามีภรรยา เป็นพรานป่า ประกอบแต่การฆ่าสัตว์ตัดชีวิตเพื่อดำรงชีวิต  ทั้งสองไม่เคยทำบุญทำทาน ตื่นขึ้นมาก็ตระเตรียมเครื่องมือเพื่อประกอบการฆ่า 

อยู่มาภรรยาก็ตั้งครรภ์ คลอดบุตรออกมาเป็นเพศชาย ก็ยังเล็กอยู่ สามีก็ตาย พอสามีตาย แม่ก็เลี้ยงลูกต่อมาจนอายุได้ 5-6 ขวบ เด็กชายคนนี้ไม่ได้มีลักษณะที่เป็นพรานเหมือนพ่อ-แม่ ตื่นเช้าขึ้นมาก็ไปวัด สนิทสนมกับหลวงตาที่วัด หลวงตาก็มีเมตตาช่วยอบรมสั่งสอนให้ทุกครั้ง จู่ๆเด็กน้อยก็นึกขึ้นได้ว่าตนนั้นอยากจะบวชเป็นสามเณร แต่เนื่องจากยังเด็กอยู่ จึงบวชเองไม่ได้ หลวงตาบอกว่าต้องให้พ่อ-แม่อนุญาตก่อนจึงจะบวชให้ได้ 

เด็กน้อยไม่รู้ประสีประสา ก็ไปบอกแม่ของตนว่าอยากบวช แม่ไม่เห็นด้วย บอกว่า มึงจะไปบวชทำไม เครื่องไม้เครื่องมือล่าสัตว์ก็มีพร้อม ทำไมไม่ฝึกเป็นพรานเหมือนพ่อเอ็ง ลูกก็ไม่ทำตามที่แม่บอก ก็ยังไปวัดทุกวันเหมือนเดิม ครั้งที่สองไปขอแม่บวชอีก แม่ก็ไม่ยอมให้บวช จนครั้งที่สาม ทางฝ่ายแม่ก็รำคาญเลยบอกไปว่า มึงอยากจะบวชจะไปบวชที่ไหนก็ไปเลยไป 

ลูกชายดีใจเป็นอย่ายิ่ง ดีใจมากจึงรีบวิ่งไปหาหลวงตาที่วัด บอกว่าแม่อนุญาตให้บวชได้แล้ว หลวงตาจึงบวชให้ ตอนนั้นเด็กอายุ 6-7 ขวบ ก็ได้บวชเป็นสามเณร ได้ศึกษาเล่าเรียน หลวงตาก็สอน

อยู่มาวันหนึ่งหลังจากที่แม่ทำปาณาติบาต คือฆ่าสัตว์ตัดชีวิต เหนื่อย จึงไปนอนหลับที่โคนต้นไม้ใหญ่ หลับสนิท วิญญาณก็ถูกยมทูตมาเอาไป ไปที่เมืองนรก พอไปถึงไฟนรกยมทูตก็เหวี่ยงดวงวิญญาณลงไปในไฟนรก ขณะที่ดวงวิญญาณของแม่กำลังตกลงไปสู้เหวแห่งไฟนรกนั้น มีปรากฏว่ามีผ้าเหลืองๆมารับวิญญาณของแม่เอาไว้ ดวงวิญญาณของแม่ก็ลอยกลับมายังยมทูตตามเดิม ยมทูตจึงสงสัย เอ เกิดอะไรขึ้นน้า ทุกที่ขว้างวิญญาณก็ไม่เห็นมีปัญหา ยมทูตก็เลยขว้างไปเป็นครั้งที่สอง ก็เหมือนเดิมคือมีผ้าเหลืองมารองรับเอาดวงวิญญาณของแม่ไว้ ทำอีกครั้งที่สามก็เหมือนเดิม 

ยมทูตจึงถามวิญญาณว่า แกต้องไปทำบุญเอาไว้อย่างหนึ่งอย่างใดแน่นอน วิญญาณแกจึงไม่ลงไปสู่ไฟนรก นางก็บอกยมทูตไปว่า ตนไม่เคยทำบุญเลย มีแต่ฆ่าสัตว์ตัดชีวิต นางปฏิเสธ ไม่จริงยมทูตบอก เออ นางนึกขึ้นได้ว่ามีลูกบวชเป็นสามเณรอยู่ที่วัด อ๋อ นี่กระมังที่เป็นอานิสงค์ ของลูกที่ไปบวชเป็นเณรที่มีต่อมารดา ยมทูตก็เลยเอาดวงวิญญาณของแม่มาส่ง

นางสะดุ้งตื่น กลัวไฟนรก กลัวบาป ทิ้งของทุกอย่าง รีบรุดไปหาลูกที่บวชเป็นเณรที่วัด เล่าเรื่องทั้งหมดให้เณรฟัง เล่าถึงการที่ตนเองเอาแต่ทำปาณาติบาต ไม่ทำบุญ อาศัยอานิสงค์ของลูกที่บวชเป็นเณรจึงได้รอดพ้นจากการตกนรก แม่ไปหาหลวงตา ขอบวชเป็นชีถือศีลแปด อยู่ที่วัดเช่นกัน 

พอเณรอายุครบ 20 ปี ก็ได้บวชเป็นพระ ศึกษาเล่าเรียน ปฏิบัติธรรม จนสำเร็จเป็นพระโสดาบัน 

วันหนึ่งนึกถึงพ่อ ก็เลยเข้าฌาน สมาธิ ก็พบว่าพ่อของตนนั้นยังตกนรกอยู่ ไปเป็นสัตว์นรก คือมีลำตัวเป็นมนุษย์แต่มีหัวเป็นสัตว์  บรรดาสัตว์นรกทั้งหลายที่รับกรรมอยู่ในนรกนั้น ล้วนมีลำตัวเป็นมนุษย์แต่มีหัวเป็นสัตว์ เช่น ไก่ หมู วัว ปลา ถูกเฆี่ยนตี ทรมาน รับกรรมอยู่ในนรก

ลูกก็เลยแผ่อานิสงค์ของการบวชเป็นพระไปให้พ่อที่อยู่เมืองนรก หลังจากนั้นพ่อที่อยู่ในเมืองนรกก็รับรู้ได้ เอ ทำไมวันนี้จึงชุ่มชื่น ทำไมจึงรู้สึกสบายกาย สบายใจ ก็นึกขึ้นได้ว่า เอ มีลูกชายอยู่คนหนึ่ง ลูกได้บวชเป็นพระ และได้แผ่อานิสงค์มาให้ จึงได้สบายกว่าคนอื่นๆ ที่อยู่ในนรก

สัตว์ทั้งหลายที่อยู่ในนรกจึงถามว่า แกทำไมไม่ต้องมาทนทุกทรมานเหมือนเช่นพวกเรา พ่อก็ตอบว่า ลูกเราเป็นพระ แผ่กุศลมาให้ จึงไม่ต้องทนทุกข์ 

บรรดาสัตว์นรกก็บอกว่า เอ พวกฉันก็มีลูกเหมือนกัน แต่ทำไมต้องมาทนทุกข์ ได้รับความทรมานมากมายเช่นนี้ ไอ้ลูกหลานมันไม่เคยทำบุญ สมบัติก็ทิ้งไว้ให้ตั้งมากมาย ลูกหลายไม่เคยทำบุญมาให้ 

บรรดาสัตว์นรกต่างสาปแช่งลูกหลานของตน มึงไอ้ลูกหลานอกตัญญู ขอให้มึงฉิบหาย ต่างเสียใจที่ลูกหลานตนไม่เหมือนคนนี้ ลูกบวชเพียงคนเดียวก็ช่วยพ่อได้

Issarai (Translation by Tridet Soajaree )

This story is about the novice, named Subin Tasamanha, Issarai is a folktale which explains why Buddhists prefer having their children ordained as novice.
Once upon a time, there were couples of hunters who subsist on animal’s flesh by killing animals in the forest. Both of them never made any merit. When they got up at dawn, the first thing they did was preparing the animal-killing tools for hunting and rushing into the forest to hunt animals.

One day, the wife conceived and bore a male little baby. Later on, the husband passed away, so the wife had to look after her child until the boy was5-6 year old. Ironically, the boy’s characteristics and habits were not the same as their parents who were hunters at all. In the morning, the boy would get up early and hurried to the Buddhist temple. He was very close to the abbot of the temple. 

The abbot too mercifully brought him up as well. Then on e day, the little boy figured out that he would like to enter the priesthood, on the other hand, he still was too young, and he could not eligibly do it by himself. The abbot told the boy that he needed the mother’s permission in order to enter the priesthood first.

As on an account of his innocence, he asked for this mother’s permission, but she disagreed and scolded to the boy ‘ why the heck you wanted to do that for?’, and added ‘ why didn’t you just take after your father’s job as a hunter in the forest; moreover, we were well-prepared for the tools.

The little boy still kept going to the temple, and also continued asking for the ordination permission, but she resisted saying no. one day, she granted the permission without reasonable point. ‘ if you wanted to do it, then up to you.’ , replied peevishly the mother. 

Having heard his mother’s permission, the boy was really joyful and then ran to tell the abbot that he was granted; therefore, the abbot conducted the ordination for the boy, the boy was only 6-7 years old at that time.
Until one day, somehow after the mother finished the act of killing living things, so she laid down under a big tree to sleep. While she was in the deep sleep, she felt that her soul was restrained by the messenger of the death to the underworld!

Having reached the underworld, the messenger of death tossed her soul into the infernal flame in the hell. While her soul was being dragged down into the flame, there was an apparition of the golden and yellow clothes brought the mother’s soul up from the flame; consequently, the soul got back to the messenger of death again. The messenger of death was very doubtful of what had just happened, for this had never happened before. So , the messenger of death again threw for the second times, and again the apparition repeated itself, bringing up the soul back from the flame.

The messenger of death angrily said to the mother’s soul that you must have done some merits as your soul would not go down into the flame. The mother’s soul said that No, I had never done any merit before, all I had done was killing animals, but the messenger of death argued. Oh! Yes, my son had entered the monkhood at on the temple, as result, my soul would not go to the flame on an account of my son’s virtue, so, the messenger of death returned the mother’s soul back to the real world.

Suddenly, the mother woke up frightened. She started fearing the infernal flame, sins, and almost everything, so she then hurried to meet her son who was a novice at the temple and explained the event she experienced to him. She told him about her soul taken to the underworld by the messenger of death on account of killing; however, she got spared by the virtue of his son, and then the mother also decided to enter the nun hood, too.

When the novice reached the age of 20, he decided to enter the monkhood and studied , and stayed in morals.

Finally, the 20 year-old monk completed the four stages of enlightenments or so called, Arahan.

On day, he meditated and reminisced about his father’s presence, so he metaphysically meditated and found his father’ soul being in the deep hell as a hell beast in the hell, having the form of human body, but monstrous head. All the beasts in the hell suffering from their karmas were all in human boy but monstrous forms as well such as chickens, pigs, cows, fish and all being scourged, tortured with cruelty.

So the monk, the Arahan, expanded his virtue of the ordination to his dad who was paying the price in the hell. The dad felt fresh, comfortable, and then the dad knew that his son who was a monk must have expanded the virtues so that he was better than other beasts in the hell.

All the beasts in the hell kept asking the monk’s dad why he was more comfortable than others. The father said that ‘ my son was a monk, and he had expanded the virtue to me.’

All the beasts at the same time, said that they all had children, but their children had never even made any merit and expanded to them even though they bequeathed considerable property to them.

The entire beast in the hell furiously cursed all their children who had never made any merit, unlike, the man’s son.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=เณรปล่อยปลา (The Boy Monk and the Dying Fish)=

กาลครั้งหนึ่งนานมาแล้ว พระพุทธเจ้าได้ตรวจดูดวงชะตาของเณร พบว่า ดวงชะตาเณรจะขาดภายใน 7 วัน จึงให้เณรกลับไปหา โยมพ่อ โยมแม่ เณรซึ่งไม่รู้ว่าตนดวงชะตาขาด จึงเดินทางกลับบ้าน ตามคำสั่งของพระพุทธเจ้า

ระหว่างที่เดินทางกลับบ้าน ก็ไปเจอแอ่งน้ำที่กำลังแห้งขอด มีปลาเล็กๆอยู่หลายตัวกำลังจะแย่ เพราะขาดน้ำ อีกทั้งอากาศก็ร้อน ปลากำลังกระเสือกกระสนดิ้นรนเพื่อหนีความตาย  ด้วยความสงสารและจิตใจที่มีเมตา เณรจึงได้ใช้อุ้งมือช้อนเอาปลาขึ้นมา เพื่อนำไปปล่อย

พอเดินต่อไปได้ไม่ไกลนัก ก็ไปเจอหนองน้ำจึงได้ปล่อยปลาลงไปในหนองน้ำนั้น แล้วเณรจึงเดินทางต่อไป

เมื่อได้อยู่กับพ่อแม่ก็ดีใจ  พอครบกำหนดจึงเดินทางกลับมาหาพระพุทธเจ้า เมื่อเห็นเณรรอดชีวิตกลับมาพระพุทธเจ้าก็แปลกใจ จึงได้ถามเณรว่าระหว่างเดินทางไปหาโยมพ่อ โยมแม่นั้นได้ไปเจอะหรือทำอะไรมาระหว่างทาง เณรตอบว่าตนเองไปเจอปลาตัวเล็กๆ ที่กำลังกระเสือกกระสนอยู่ในแอ่งน้ำ ด้วยความสงสาร จึงได้นำปลาดังกล่าวไปปล่อย พระพุทธเจ้าจึงตรัสว่า ความจริงแล้วดวงชะตาของเจ้าขาด และจะต้องตายภายใน 7 วัน เหตุที่รอดมาได้เป็นเพราะจิตใจที่มีความเมตตา เพราะกุศลอันเกิดจากการปล่อยปลานั่นเอง

ยามหน้าแล้ง กุ้ง หอย ปู ปลามันลำบาก มีแอ่งน้ำมากมาย แอ่งน้ำเล็กๆ ร้อนมากๆเข้าเดี๋ยวก็ตาย ถ้าคนไม่ช่วยเดี๋ยวก็ตาย เหตุที่ชาวมอญนิยมปล่อยปลาเพราะเชื่อว่า การปล่อยปลาจะได้บุญมาก อานิสงค์ของการปล่อยปลาสามารถเปลี่ยนแปลงโชคชะตาได้ การปล่อยปลา จึงเป็นประเพณีนิยมของคนมอญ

Once upon a time, the Lord Buddha looked into the fate of a novice Buddhist monk. 
He saw that the boy monk would soon pass away. 
The boy monk was summoned and was told by Lord Buddha to return home to visit his parents.
The boy monk followed his advice; he did not know that he was destined to die in a matter of days. He was quite happy to be able to return home to visit his parents.

It was a long way home. While he was on his way home, the young monk saw a fish in a drying puddle. The fish was struggling to survive under the summer heat. 

With his compassion, the boy monk scooped the fish up; he would like to take it to a place where there was plenty of water such as a lake, pond, or a river. 

When he found a big pond with plenty of water, the boy monk let the fish go. He then continued his journey.

Finally, the boy monk reached his home. His father and mother were very pleased to see him They did not know anything about the prediction concerning the fate of their son.

After a few days staying with the parents, the novice bid them farewell. he had to return to practice Dhamma with the Lord Buddha. 

Seeing that the boy was still alive, Lord Buddha knew that on the way home the novice had accomplished something meritful -- saving lives of others. Such act is a great merit, so great that it could alter the fate of a person.

=The Cunning Burglar (ขโมยหัวแหลม)=


มีสองตายายมีอาชีพค้าขาย อาศัยอยู่ในบ้านสองชั้น คืนหนึ่งทั้งสองนอนอยู่บนบ้าน มีขโมยเขามายังใต้ถุนบ้านเพื่อขโมยของ สองตายายก็แอบฟังอยู่ ก็รู้ว่ามีคนเข้ามาขโมยของ ได้ยินแต่เสียงแต่ไม่รู้ว่าตัวขโมยอยู่ตรงไหน

Once upon a time, an old couple owned a two-story house on Ko Kred. They sold groceries. One night, there was a burglar entering the first floor of the house where they kept their goods. The old man and the old woman on the top floor heard the sound of the burglar breaking in. They could hear the burglar but they could not locate the exact location of the burglar. 

ตาไปหยิบหอกด้ามยาวมาอันหนึ่ง  ท่ามกลางความมืดตาใช้หอกด้ามยาวนั้นแทงลงไปชั้นล่าง ปลายหอกไปโดนหลังมือของขโมย ขโมยเจ็บปวดมาก แต่ก็อดทนเอาไว้ จะดึงมือออกก็ไม่ได้เพราะมือยังติดอยู่กับหอก 


The old man went to get his spear (A spear is a pole weapon consisting of a shaft, usually of wood, with a sharpened head). He was trying to use it by thrusting it to hit the burglar from the top floor, but he could not locate the spot because is was too dark. However, one of his attempts was a success but he did not know it. It struck the hand of the burglar. But he was clever, because he remained calm; he did not make any noise for fear of being spotted his whereabout. Of course, the burglar was in great pain.

ขโมยจึงใช้ไหวพริบร้องตะโกนออกไปว่า เฮ้ย ไอ้แก่จ้างก็แทงกูไม่ถูก เมื่อได้ยินดังนั้นตาก็รู้สึกโกรธมาก จึงชักหอกออกมาเพื่อจะแทงใหม่ พอขโมยสบโอกาสก็รีบวิ่งหนีไป

He used his wit by shouting out loud from the first floor. &quot;Old man, you are old and clumsy. You will never get me&quot;.

Upon hearing that, the old man was furious and very angry, so he lifted the spear to aim for some other spots. With the chance given, the burglar quickly ran away.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== file vs streaming compression ==

Many data compression algorithms are file oriented.
They assume that underlying transmission protocols have transmitted every bit of the compressed data file without error.

A few data compression algorithms are designed to be used with streaming one-way broadcast.
For example, the MPEG-2 compression algorithm used by almost all over-the-air digital TV.
At any time, a receiver may be turned on and start listening to the broadcast.
In order for a receiver to start up in mid-stream -- or recover after a few seconds of severe transmission errors --
such systems typically break up the stream into &quot;blocks&quot;.
The decoder uses synchronization marks or checksums to detect the beginning of the next block, and starts decoding from there.
At each new block, it re-initializes and re-starts the decoding process.
Block decoders that use a static per-block dictionary or static Huffman table forget the old one and read a new dictionary or table at the beginning of each block.
Block decoders that use an adaptive dictionary forget the old dictionary, reinitialize the default dictionary, and begin building a new dictionary.

The block size is a compromise between compression (longer blocks usually give better compression) and quick restarts (shorter blocks allow the decompressor to restart more quickly after an error or after turning on).
Because practically all errors can be detected with CRC codes, a streaming decoder knows which blocks are in error, and typically rejects the entire block.
Streaming audio decoders use a variety of techniques to mask such errors -- they may attempt to &quot;fill in&quot; with a prediction that previous tones will continue. To avoid &quot;clicks&quot;, they may choose to ramp down the volume to silence at the end of the last good block, play silence during the bad block, and then ramp back up to normal volume at the beginning of the next good block.

There has been little research on alternatives to &quot;blocks&quot;.
Some people speculate that, compared to using a block size of B bytes, it may be possible to achieve better compression and just as quick restarts with a (non-blocking) converging decoder designed so that all decoders, no matter when they are turned on, eventually converge on the same adaptive dictionary after at most B bytes.
An adaptive block decoder has very little context (and poor compression) at the beginning of each block, gradually rising to lots of context (and much better compression) at the end of the block.
A non-adaptive block decoder has the overhead of a dictionary or Huffman table at the beginning of each block (in effect, zero compression during the dictionary or table, and high compression during the data in the remainder of the block).
The converging decoder, in theory, has some intermediate context (and some intermediate compression) at all times, without dictionary or table overhead or times of poor compression.

=== tape storage compression ===
{{wikipedia | magnetic tape data storage#Data compression }}
One of the earliest applications for data compression was to compress data for backup tapes.
Many tape drives have an implementation of a data compression algorithm embedded in the firmware of the tape drive itself.
(With modern computers, one can get better compression by turning off this &quot;hardware compression&quot; and using a modern &quot;software compression&quot; algorithm.
Software compression algorithms takes advantage of the much faster CPU and much larger RAM available to the main processor than to the processor inside the tape drive.
Early computers could not use software compression because they were not fast enough to keep up with the tape).

Many tape drive manufacturers use a LZ algorithm.
IBM and QIC use the ALDC algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Exabyte uses the IDRC algorithm.
DLT uses the DLZ1 algorithm.

The VXA tape backup format (developed by Ecrix and produced by Exabyte) uses ALDC data compression.

Adaptive Lossless Data Compression algorithm (ALDC) is standardized by ECMA-222.&lt;ref&gt;
ECMA.
[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-222.htm &quot;Standard ECMA-222: Adaptive Lossless Data Compression Algorithm&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Linear Tape-Open&quot; (TO) tape backup format (produced by several manufacturers) uses LTO-DC data compression, also called Streaming Lossless Data Compression (SLDC).

{{todo | fill in more details on tape algorithms}}

For legal reasons, many data compression algorithm patents are described as being part of such tape backup storage systems.

=== implementation details ===

==== end handling ====

Most data compression algorithms are described in terms of abstract &quot;streams&quot; of data of indefinite length.
In practice, data almost always comes in finite-length blocks with a distinct beginning and end.
Systems that compress and decompress such data eventually come to the end of the block of data.

How does the decompressor know when to stop?

Some people argue that end-handling is &quot;outside of the scope of data compression&quot;.
And so many programmers use the &quot;single responsibility principle&quot; try separate the &quot;end handling&quot; code from the &quot;decompression&quot; code --
&quot;end handling&quot; is considered the responsibility of some other layer in the protocol stack.
(Those other layers are described in more detail in other books,
such as [[Data Coding Theory]], [[Communication Networks]], [[Serial Programming]], etc.
).

Archive file formats generally store compressed data in a &quot;container format&quot; that stores a block of compressed data with some metadata.
There are 5 popular approaches to implementing such archive formats and streaming protocols:

* The metadata includes both
** the compressed length (this makes it much easier to skip over compressed files in an archive to decompress just one desired file),
*and* the decompressed length (this makes implementing the decompressor simpler)

* The metadata describes exactly how many bits/bytes/symbols/pixels are in the *decompressed* data.
The software that decodes the container format passes this &quot;uncompressed length&quot; and the compressed data to the decompressor,
and the decompressor keeps a count of exactly how many bits/bytes/symbols/pixels it has produced so far, and stops when it produces enough.
(Sometimes it is simpler to allow the decompressor to decode a few extra bits/bytes/symbols/pixels into a temporary buffer, and then copy the correct number into the final output).
In some systems, the decompressor is required to return a count of how many *compressed* bytes it consumed,
so the container handler knows where to continue decoding the next part of the file.

* The compressed data is stored in some kind of &quot;container format&quot; that includes metadata describing exactly how many significant bits are in the *compressed* data.
The software that decodes the container format passes this &quot;compressed length&quot; and the compressed data to the decompressor,
and the decompressor keeps a count of exactly how many bits it eats up so far.
In some systems, the decompressor is required to return a count of how many *decompressed* bytes it produces,
so the container handler knows how many decompressed bytes in the buffer are &quot;real&quot; data.

* The compressed data is stored in some kind of &quot;container format&quot; that includes metadata describing exactly how many bytes are in the *compressed* data,
but the number of significant bits in the last byte is unknown.
(Often the compressor pads out the compressed data with 0 bits until it fills out a whole byte.
Somehow the decompressor needs to figure out the difference between
&quot;this is a codeword that happens to end with some (significant) zeros&quot;
-- in particular, the all-zeros codeword -- vs &quot;this is not a real codeword but only zero padding&quot;.
Software to handle this distinction
is notoriously difficult to get exactly right and bug-free in all cases).
In some systems, the decompressor is required to return a count of how many *decompressed* bytes it produces,
so the container handler knows how many decompressed bytes in the buffer are &quot;real&quot; data.

* The compressed data is stored or transmitted in a way so that neither the &quot;compressed length&quot; nor the &quot;uncompressed length&quot; are known,
and somehow the decompressor is responsible for detecting the end and returning both the decompressed data and that &quot;end point&quot; metadata to the rest of the software.

Container formats are sometimes described as having separate &quot;metadata sections&quot; and &quot;compressed data sections&quot;.
But when [[../Evaluating Compression Effectiveness/]], we must consider *all* the data given to the decompressor
as the &quot;compressed size&quot; or &quot;compressed rate&quot; --
both the &quot;compressed data sections&quot; and data such as &quot;uncompressed data size&quot;,
&quot;compressed size in bytes&quot;, and &quot;compressed size in bits&quot;
that may normally be considered part of the &quot;metadata sections&quot;.

A few people prefer compressed data formats designed such that
concatenating a bunch of compressed files into one big file, and then later decompressing that big file,
&quot;works correctly&quot; -- i.e., it produces one big decompressed file that is identical to concatenating all the original decompressed files into one big output file.

== file compression vs compressed file systems ==
''FIXME: Is there a better place in this book to discuss compressed file systems and flash memory?''

Many data compression algorithms are whole-file oriented.
They assume that the entire original file is available up-front,
and people will want to decompress the entire thing from beginning to end.

Compressed file systems (and especially flash-memory file systems) break that assumption.
The ZFS file system uses the LZJB compression algorithm.
Many internet routers and internet firewalls use a compressed flash-memory file system, often the cramfs file system.
(See [[Reverse Engineering/File Formats#Compression, Encryption &amp; Scrambling]] for an example).
Some &quot;solid-state hard drives&quot; (SSDs) internally use compression algorithms to reduce the amount of flash &quot;used up&quot; by files -- this doesn't actually give users any more storage space, but the larger amount of empty storage space can be used internally by the SSD in ways that extend the lifetime of the drive.

These systems require relatively rapid random-access to data stored in the file system -- decompressing everything from the beginning would be too slow.

One approach is to use an index that, given some file name we want to look up (or a &quot;logical block number&quot;), it tells where exactly on the disk (or in the bulk flash) to start decompressing,
combined with a streaming compression algorithm -- so the decompressor can jump into the middle of the compressed data and start decompressing from there.

A much more difficult requirement of these systems is to allow files to be edited.
(This is so difficult that some compressed file systems,
such as cramfs,
such as python executable zipfiles&lt;ref&gt;
Radomir Dopieralski.
[http://sheep.art.pl/Your%20Python%20Application%20as%20a%20Single%20File &quot;Your Python Application as a Single File&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;,
don't allow it --
they must be created all-at-once from a directory of uncompressed files.
After a cramfs system is created, it can only be mounted as read-only).

''FIXME: go into a little more detail on why unmodified file-oriented compression algorithms won't work for compressed file systems, and what techniques are used to either (a) modify those algorithms so they are suitable, or (b) other algorithms that are useful for compressed flash file systems, or (c) combinations of both.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">When an application programmer is deciding which compression algorithm to use,
there are a number of factors that must be balanced:
&lt;ref name=&quot;mcfadden&quot;&gt;
[http://www.fadden.com/techmisc/hdc/lesson12.htm &quot;Hacking Data Compression&quot;]
by Andy McFadden 1993
&lt;/ref&gt;

* Speed: how fast is it?
* compression ratio: There's really no point if it doesn't make our data smaller.
* complexity: How big is the executable? (This has both hard costs -- how much ROM or disk space does the software use? -- as well as soft costs -- if I need to change it, how long does it take to go through all the source code to find the right thing to change, and once changed, how long does it take to test every part of the code to make sure the change doesn't break something else?)
* space: how much RAM does it need to run?
* latency: how long do I have to wait before I hear the first note of the song?
* interoperability: Will the files I generate be readable by any standard archive utility?

When a compression library programmer has tweaked a compression algorithm and trying to decide if it is really better or if he should revert to the previous version, he uses the same criteria.

== Speed ==

When evaluating data compression algorithms, speed is always in terms of uncompressed data handled per second.

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm speed} = \frac{\rm Uncompressed\;bits}{\rm seconds\;to\;compress}&lt;/math&gt;

For streaming audio and video,

:speed = number of uncompressed bits that can be handled in one second.

Some applications use data compression techniques even when they have so much RAM and disk space that there's no real need to make files smaller.
File compression and delta compression are often used to speed up copying files from one end of a slow connection to another.
Even on a single computer, some kinds of operations are significantly faster when performed on compressed versions of data rather than directly on the uncompressed data.&lt;ref&gt;

''(Is &quot;zgrep&quot; or &quot;zcat&quot; relevant here?)''

Some compression algorithms specifically designed to compress bitmaps --
the byte-aligned bitmap code (BBC),
the word-aligned hybrid code (WAH),
the position list word aligned hybrid (PLWAH),
the compressed adaptive index (COMPAX),
and
the compressed 'n' composable integer set (CONCISE)
--
allow bitwise operations to be directly applied to compressed data.&lt;ref&gt;
Wikipedia:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bitmap_index#Compression bitmap index: compression].
''FIXME: replace this reference with better reference(s).''
&lt;/ref&gt;
This can be much faster than decompressing the data, applying the bitwise operation, and then re-compressing the result.

In many applications, the speed is critical.
If a particular implementation of an audio decompressor running on a prototype portable music player hardware cannot sustain 1.4 Mbit/s to the headphones, then it is unusable.
No one will buy it unless you switch to a different implementation or faster hardware (or both) that can keep up with standard stereo audio speeds.

If a particular implementation of an audio compressor running on a prototype voice recorder cannot sustain 7 bits/sample/channel x 1 channel x 8 kSamples/s = 56 kbit/s from the microphones to storage, then it is unusable.
No one wants their recorded voice to have silent gaps where the hardware could not keep up.
No one will buy it unless you switch to a different implementation or faster hardware (or both) that can keep up with standard telephone-quality voice speeds.


The speed varies widely from one machine to another,
from one implementation to another.
Even on the same machine and same benchmark file
and same implementation source code,
using a different compiler may make a decompressor run faster.

The speed of a compressor is almost always slower than the speed of its corresponding decompressor.

Even with a fast modern CPU, compressed filesystem performance is often limited by the speed of the compression algorithm.
Many modern embedded systems -- as well as many of the early computers that data compression algorithms were first developed on -- are heavily constrained by speed.
There are a limited number of compression algorithms that are fast enough to be usable on extremely speed-constrained systems:
&lt;ref name=&quot;mcfadden&quot; /&gt;
* RLE;
* algorithms in the LZSS family;
* algorithms in the LZW family;
* fixed byte pair encoding such as PalmDoc;
* delta encoding + adaptive Huffman.
''... any others? ...''

Many modern embedded systems -- as well as many of the early computers that data compression algorithms were first developed on -- are also RAM-limited.
When available RAM is so small that there is not enough room for both decompressed text and also a separate dictionary -- such as the 12 KByte dictionary needed by a GIF decoder for the LZW dictionary --
our options are even more constrained.
&lt;ref name=&quot;ojala&quot;&gt;
[http://www.cs.tut.fi/~albert/Dev/pucrunch/ &quot;Pucrunch: An Optimizing Hybrid LZ77 RLE Data Compression Program, aka Improving Compression Ratio for Low-Resource Decompression&quot;]
by Pasi Ojala
&lt;/ref&gt;
With so little RAM,
* If we need the entire decompressed text in RAM -- such a self-extracting executable -- then we are forced to rule out LZW and use the decompressed text as the dictionary, like LZ77 and Pucrunch
* If we don't need the entire decompressed text in RAM -- such as external modems decompressing data sent over &quot;slow&quot; telephone links before forwarding the plaintext to a PC -- then for any given amount of RAM, LZW-like compressed formats usually give better compression than LZ77-like compressed formats. For typical English text, the more words and phrases you store in the decompressor's dictionary, the better the compression. LZ77 uses a lot of RAM to hold common words that repeat frequently. LZW uses the available RAM to store each unique word exactly once, and so gives better compression than LZ77 when RAM is limited.

When designing the compressed file format, there is typically a speed/space tradeoff between variable-length formats and byte-aligned formats.
Most systems can handle byte-aligned formats much faster.
The variable-length formats typically give better compression.
The byte-aligned formats can and often do use data sizes other than 8 bit data.
&lt;ref name=&quot;ojala&quot; /&gt;
For example, many LZ77-like decompressors use byte-aligned formats
with 16-bit &quot;items&quot; that the decompressor breaks into a 3 bit length and a 13 bit offset.
Some decompressors use a mix of 1-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit items, where (for speed) the 1 bit items are carefully packaged into 8-bit &quot;control bytes&quot; so everything else can stay byte-aligned.
(Later in the book we discuss byte-aligned formats in more detail: [[Data Compression/Dictionary compression#Implementation tips and tricks]]).

== Evaluating Compression Ratio ==
{{wikipedia|data compression ratio}}
In this book, we define the compression ratio as

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Compression\;Ratio} = \frac{\rm Uncompressed\;Size}{\rm Compressed\;Size}&lt;/math&gt;

A algorithm that can take a 2 MB compressed file and decompress it to a 10 MB file has a compression ratio of 10/2 = 5, sometimes written 5:1 (pronounced &quot;five to one&quot;).

For streaming audio and video, the compression ratio is defined in terms of uncompressed and compressed bit rates instead of data sizes:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Compression\;Ratio} = \frac{\rm Uncompressed\;Data\;Rate}{\rm Compressed\;Data\;Rate}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, songs on a CD are uncompressed with a data rate of 16 bits/sample/channel x 2 channels x 44.1 kSamples/s = 1.4 Mbit/s.
That same song encoded at (lossy &quot;high quality&quot;) 128 kbit/s Vorbis stream (or 128 kbit/s MP3 stream or a 128 kbit/s AAC file) yields a compression ratio of about 11:1 (&quot;eleven to one&quot;).

That same song encoded with a typical lossless audio compressor such as FLAC or WavPack typically gives a compression radio of about 2:1 to 3:1 (&quot;three to one&quot;), although a few songs give no compression (1:1) and some kinds of classical music give better than 3:1 compression with such a lossless audio compressor.

Using this definition of &quot;compression ratio&quot;, for a given uncompressed file, a higher compression ratio results in a smaller compressed file.

(Unfortunately, a few other texts define &quot;compression ratio&quot; as the inverse, or with arbitrary other factors of 8 or 100 inserted, or some other formula entirely).

Some typical compression ratios for lossless compression of text files:
* 2:1 or worse: Extremely simple and fast algorithms such as LZRW1-a that can saturate a 100 MB/s hard drive with compressed data on a 2GHz CPU.
* 2.5:1 to 3.5:1 compression on text files: Slightly more sophisticated (and therefore slightly slower) algorithm such as DEFLATE&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.chipestimate.com/techtalk.php?d=2010-03-23 &quot;Unzipping the GZIP compression protocol&quot;]
by Joe Rash 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* 5:1 Unfortunately, all known algorithms for getting a compression factor better than 5:1 on English language text all run extremely slowly, 5 or more hours to decompress 100 MB of uncompressed data on a 2GHz P4.
* 6.27:1 The current (2009) Hutter prize world record compression

All lossless data compression algorithms give different data compression ratios for different files.
For almost any data compression algorithm, it is easy to artificially construct a &quot;benchmarketing&quot; file that can be compressed at amazingly high compression ratio and decompressed losslessly.
Unfortunately, such artificially high compression ratios tell us nothing about how well those algorithms work on real data.
A variety of standard benchmark files are available.
Using a large collection of such benchmark files helps a programmer avoid accidentally over-tuning an algorithm so much that, while it works great on one particular file, it is horrible for other files.

Some standard benchmark files are listed later in this book -- [[Data Compression/References#Benchmark files]].

=== generic compression ===

Some programmers focus on &quot;generic compression&quot; algorithms that are not tied to any particular format, such as text or images.&lt;ref&gt;
Matt Mahoney.
[http://mattmahoney.net/dc/uiq/ &quot;Generic Compression Benchmark&quot;].
Further discussion:
[http://encode.ru/threads/236-New-benchmark-for-generic-compression &quot;benchmark for generic compression&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
IETF.
[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bormann-6lowpan-ghc-04 &quot;6LoWPAN Generic Compression of Headers and Header-like Payloads&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
These programmers tune their algorithms on a collection of benchmark files that include a variety of formats.


=== format-specific compression ===
Other programmers focus on one specific kind of file --
video compression,
still image compression,
single-human speech compression,
high-fidelity music compression,
English text compression,
or
some other specific kind of file.
Often these format-specific programmers try to find some kind of redundancies in the raw data
that can be exploited for lossless compression -- for example, music often has one dominant tone
that repeats over and over at one specific frequency for a few tenths of a second --
but each repeat is never quite exactly the same as any of the others --
then a similar dominant tone that repeats over and over at some other frequency for a few more tenths of a second.
Often these format-specific programmers try to find limits to human perception
that can be exploited for lossy compression.
Often these programmers come up with ways to &quot;transform&quot; or &quot;preprocess&quot; or &quot;de-correlate&quot; the data,
and then hand the intermediate results off to some &quot;generic compression&quot; algorithm.
We discuss this more at [[Data Compression/Multiple transformations]].

For the particular format it was tuned for, such format-specific compression algorithms generally give much better results than a generic compression algorithm alone.
Alas, such algorithms generally give worse results than a generic compression algorithm for other kinds of files.

== Latency ==
Latency refers to a short period of delay (usually measured in milliseconds) between when an audio signal enters and when it emerges from a system.

Compression adds 2 kinds of latency: compression latency and decompression latency, both of which add to end-to-end latency.

In some audio applications, in particular 2-way telephone-like communication, end-to-end latency is critical.
The recommended maximum time delay for telephone service is 150 milliseconds{{fact}}([[Wikipedia:1 E-1 s]]).
This rules out many popular compression algorithms.
For example, a standard Huffman compressed block size of 150 milliseconds or longer won't work.
Standard Huffman compression requires analyzing an entire block before sending out the compressed prefix code for the first symbol in the block.
In this case the Huffman compressor uses up all the time allowed waiting for the block to fill up, leaving no time for time-of-flight transmission or decoding.
(A block size of 150 milliseconds or longer may work fine with an adaptive decoder).

In other audio applications, end-to-end latency is irrelevant.
When compressing a song for later distribution, or the soundtrack of a movie, the compressor typically has the whole thing available to it before it begins compressing.
Such applications may use low-latency algorithms when they are adequate; but they also allow other algorithms to be used that may give better net compression or a lower peak bit rate.

In a few applications, only decompression latency is important.
For example, if a particular implementation of an audio decompressor running on a prototype portable music player hardware has a latency of 10 minutes, then it is almost unusable.
No one wants to wait 10 minutes after selecting a song before starting to hear it.
No one will buy it unless you switch to a different implementation or faster hardware (or both).

Many compression algorithms have a minimum information-theoretic latency, measured in bits.
''(Is there a better name for what this paragraph and the next discusses than &quot;information-theoretic latency&quot;?)''
Given a constant uncompressed bitrate, this corresponds to the worst-case delay between when a (uncompressed) bit goes into the compressor, to the time the corresponding (uncompressed) bit comes out the decompressor, in situations where the bitrate is so slow that we can neglect the time required for the computations done in the compressor and the decompressor and the time-of-flight.

A fixed prefix coder or a adaptive Huffman coder typically has an extremely short information-theoretic latency.
Many of them have latencies of less than 16 bits.

MP3 compressors sacrifice latency and quality to gain much higher compression ratios.
They have a latency of at least 576 time-domain 16-bit samples at 44.1 kHz, giving a latency of at least 9,216 bits or 13 milliseconds, often longer to take advantage of the &quot;byte reservoir&quot;.

== energy ==

There has been little research done on the amount of energy used by compression algorithms.

In some sensor networks, the purpose of compression is to save energy.
By spending a little energy in the CPU compressing the data,
so we have fewer bytes to transmit,
we save energy in the radio --
the radio can be turned on less often,
or for shorter periods of time, or both.&lt;ref&gt;
Christopher M. Sadler and Margaret Martonosi
[http://mrmgroup.cs.princeton.edu/papers/sensys06sadler.pdf &quot;Data Compression Algorithms for Energy-Constrained Devices in Delay Tolerant Networks&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The best compression algorithms for such sensor networks
are the ones that minimize the total energy, and so maximize the runtime, the length of time between battery replacements.
Such algorithms are in a niche between, on one side,
algorithms that produce smaller compressed files, but use up too much CPU energy to produce them;
and on the other side,
algorithms that use less CPU energy, but produce (relatively) longer files that take far more energy to transmit.

== Comparisons ==
We use the game-theory term &quot;dominates&quot;
to indicate that one algorithm is faster, gives smaller compressed files, and has lower latency than some other algorithm.
Of course, some particular implementations are not very well optimized,
and so they could be tweaked to run *much* faster and still implement the same algorithm with the same compressed file format.
But any abstract algorithm necessarily requires some minimum number of operations,
and so it is unlikely that an algorithm that requires a couple orders of magnitude more operations than some currently-faster algorithm can ever be optimized enough to dominate that faster algorithm.

Many historically important compression algorithms are now obsolete, having been dominated by some other, more useful algorithm.
But currently (and for the foreseeable future) there is no one &quot;best&quot; compression algorithm even for a fixed set of benchmark files --
there is a spectrum of many &quot;best&quot; algorithms along the Pareto frontier; that spectrum of algorithms together dominates and makes obsolete all other known algorithms.
Blazingly fast algorithms that give some but not a lot of compression sit at one end of the Pareto frontier.
At the far end of the Pareto frontier sit the most compact known ways to compress benchmark files -- but, alas, running so slowly that they are not very useful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== executable software compression ==

In this chapter, we are careful to distinguish between 3 kinds of software:
* &quot;data compression software&quot;, the implementation of algorithms designed to compress and decompress various kinds of files -- this is what we referred to as simply &quot;the software&quot; in previous chapters.
* &quot;executable files&quot; -- files on the disk that are not merely some kind of data to be viewed or edited by some other program, but are the programs themselves -- text editors, word processors, image viewers, music players, web browsers, etc.
* &quot;source code&quot; -- human-readable files on the disk that are intended to be compiled into executable files.

Executable files are, in some ways, similar to English text -- and source code is even more similar -- and so data compression software that was designed and intended to be used on English text files often works fairly well with executable files and source code.

However, some techniques and concepts that apply to executable software compression that don't really make sense with any other kind of file, such as:

== compress then compile vs compile then compress ==

Which stage of compilation gives the best compression:
** compress the final machine-specific binary executable code?
** compress the original machine-independent text source code? For example, JavaScript minifiers.
** compress some partially compiled machine-independent intermediate code? For example, &quot;Slim Binaries&quot; or the &quot;[[w:JAR (file format)|JAR format]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://wiki.tcl.tk/4400 &quot;Slim Binaries&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some very preliminary early experiments&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;Code Size When Compiling to JavaScript&quot;
http://mozakai.blogspot.com/2011/11/code-size-when-compiling-to-javascript.html
&lt;/ref&gt;
give the surprising result that
compressed high-level source code
is about the same size as
compressed executable machine code,
but compressing a partially-compiled intermediate representation
gives a larger file than either one.

== filtering ==

Many data compression algorithms use &quot;filter&quot; or &quot;preprocess&quot; or &quot;decorrelate&quot; raw data before feeding it into an entropy coder.
Filters for images and video typically have a geometric interpretation.
Filters specialized for executable software include:
* &quot;detect &quot;CALL&quot; instructions, converting their operands from relative addressing to absolute addressing, thus calls to the same location resulted in repeated strings that the compressor could match, improving compression of 80x86 binary code.&quot; ([[Wikipedia: LZX (algorithm)#Microsoft Cabinet files]])
* recoding branches into a PC-relative form&lt;ref name=&quot;cooper_mcintosh&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Instead of decompressing the latest version of an application in isolation, starting from nothing, start from the old version of an application, and patch it up until it is identical to the new latest version. That enables much smaller update files that contain only the patches -- the differences between the old version of an application and the latest version.

Most other applications of compression -- and even most of these executable compression techniques -- are intended to give results that appear the same to human users, while improving things in the &quot;back end&quot; that most users don't notice.
However, some of these program compression ideas (refactoring, shared libraries, using higher-level languages, using domain-specific languages, etc.) reduce the amount of source that a human must read to understand a program, resulting in a significantly different experience for some people (programmers).
That time savings can lead to significant cost reduction.&lt;ref&gt;

[http://blog.blackducksoftware.com/?p=357 &quot;Should Code Reduction be Job #1?&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Such &quot;compressed&quot; source code is arguably better than the original;
in contrast to image compression and other fields where compression gives, at best, something identical to the original, and often much worse.

==Property rights==

Property rights are defined by law and are not freely definable by transactional parties (Civil Code, article 175). The types of statutory property rights are:

*'''Possessory rights''' (''senyūken'')
*'''Title''' (''honken'')
**'''Ownership''' (''shoyūken'')
**'''Restricted rights''' (''seigen bukken'')
***'''Usufructary rights''' (''yōeki bukken'')
****'''Surface rights''' (''chijōken'')
****'''Tenant farming rights''' (''eikosakuken'')
****'''Easements''' (''chiekiken'')
****'''Rights of common''' (''iriaiken'')
***'''Collateral rights''' (''tampo bukken'')
****'''Possessory liens''' (''ryūchiken'')
****'''Property liens''' (''sakidori tokken'')
****'''Pledges''' (''shichiken'')
****'''Mortgages''' or '''hypothecs''' (''teitōken'')

==Possessory rights==

Possessory rights (占有権 ''senyūken'') refer to the rights to ''control'' certain property. These rights arise when a person intentionally takes possession of property for themselves. Possession is completely independent of legal title, though it may be trumped by a claim of legal title.

A person who has been dispossessed may sue to have their possession restored. Such a suit may be brought within one year of losing possession (Article 201).

==Ownership==

Ownership (''shoyūken'') represents the right to freely use property, enjoy its benefits and dispose of it, within the restrictions of the law (Civil Code Article 206). Ownership of land extends above and below the land as far as can be managed (Article 207).

Ownership generally lasts indefinitely and does not expire unless another person acquires it by agreement, or by one of two unilateral methods:

*'''Acquisitive prescription''' (取得時効 ''shutoku jikō'') is the Japanese equivalent of common law adverse possession. It is completed when a person openly possesses the real property of another for a period of twenty years (Article 162). At the end of this period, such person acquires ownership by prescription.
*'''Immediate acquisition''' (即時取得 ''sokuji shutoku'') is the acquisition of rights over movable property by a non-negligent party acting in good faith. It occurs when such a party openly commences possession of such movable property by a transactional act (Article 192).

If movable property has no owner, a person may acquire ownership by voluntarily possessing the property (Article 239). 

===Neighbor relations===

*'''Right to demand use of neighboring land''' (Article 209)
*'''Right to demand access to public roads''' (Article 210)
*'''Right to cut foliage''' (Article 233)

===Joint ownership===

Multiple persons may share ownership over one item of property by joint ownership.

The ownership share (''mochibun'') held by each party may be determined by agreement of the parties or by operation of law. Under the Civil Code defaults, joint ownership shares are equal (Article 250) and each joint owner may use the entire property to an extent proportional to their share (Article 249).

Ownership shares may be freely traded or waived. If a joint owner waives their ownership share or dies without a successor, their ownership share reverts to the other joint owners (Article 255). Transfers or other changes in ownership shares require the consent of all owners (Article 251) unless otherwise agreed.

Management of jointly-owned property is determined by a majority decision of the owners based upon the value of each of their ownership shares, but each joint owner may individually repair or otherwise preserve the property (Article 252).

Appurtenant liabilities (such as management fees and taxes) must be borne by the joint owners proportionally to their ownership. If a joint owner does not fulfill such a liability, another joint owner may acquire their share upon payment of just compensation (Article 253).

Joint owners may demand partition of their joint property at any time. This right may be waived by agreement of the joint owners for no more than a five-year period (Article 256).

==Conveyances==

===Procedure===

Rights in property may generally be conveyed by contract, by succession or by prescription.

====Recording of real property transfers====
When real property is conveyed, the conveyance must be recorded (''tōki'') at the Legal Affairs Bureau before it can be legally asserted against most third parties (Article 177). Certain parties may have property rights asserted against them despite lack of recording (Supreme Court, Dec 15 1901):
*Parties to a transfer (and their successors) with regard to that transfer
*Persons without legal rights
**Illegal occupants are not considered to be third parties for purposes of Article 177 (Supreme Court, Dec 19 1950).
*Persons who obstructed the recording through fraud or intimidation
*Persons who have a duty to apply for the recording on another's behalf
*Persons acting in breach of trust (背信的悪意者 ''haishinteki akuisha'')
**Parties acting simply in bad faith (悪意者 ''akuisha'') are considered to have third-party protection under Article 177 (Supreme Court, Oct 29 1998).

Article 177 applies to most assertions of ownership of real property. For instance, a recipient of leased property must record the transfer before asserting their rights against any of its tenants (Supreme Court, Mar 19 1974).

Article 177 also applies when asserting ownership based on adverse possession (Supreme Court, Mar 2 1918).

Recording in and of itself does not affect property rights; recording without right (無権利の登記 ''mukenri no tōki'') within the chain of title may be challenged by a dispossessed owner of right. Some examples:

* Upon the death of an individual, one of their properties is inherited jointly by A and B as civil law successors. A records the property as their own, then transfers it to C. In this case, B retains the right to sue against C even if they have not recorded their share (Supreme Court, Feb 22 1963).
* In contrast, if A is bequeathed the property and then B inherits it under civil law, records the inheritance and transfers it to C, A must record their bequest in order to assert it against C (Supreme Court, Mar 6 1964).

====Movable property====
When movable property is conveyed, the key condition is delivery (''hiki-watashi'') (Article 178). Delivery may be physical, by directive or by a written instrument.

An exception is when property has been given to a third party for safe keeping. In that case, a lawful acquirer may assert their ownership against the custodian regardless of the Article 178 requirement (Supreme Court, Aug 31 1954).

====Rescission and chain of title====
If an agreement to sell property is rescinded by either party, each party is responsible for restoring their counterparty to their condition as it existed before the transfer, except where this would harm the rights of third parties (Article 545). This gives third parties limited protection when they have agreed to receive the same property from its recipient under the original sale agreement. However, this protection may only be asserted with regard to real property when that property has been recorded as transferred (Supreme Court, May 17 1921).

==Leases==

A lease is formed when one party allows another to use property, and the other pays consideration for this privilege (Article 601). 

===Duration===
Leases over movable property and buildings have a maximum term of 20 years, and will be deemed to expire after 20 years if a longer term is provided in the contract. Land leases generally have a term of 30 years or more (Land and Building Lease Act, Article 3). 

The maximum duration for a lease is shorter if the grantor does not have authority to enter a full lease. This is the case where the grantor is acting through an agent with unlimited authority or has no competency to dispose of property. In this case, the maximum terms are as follows (Article 602):
* Mountains and forests: 10 years
* Other land: 5 years
* Buildings: 3 years
* Movable property: 6 months

If there is no fixed term, the lease may be terminated by either party at any time (Article 617). The lease will then expire:
* Land: one year later
* Buildings: 3 months later
* Movable property: one day later

Upon expiration, a lease is automatically renewed, unless the owner objects or is unaware of the expiration (Article 619). Upon such an automatic renewal, the lease will become a non-term contract and may thus be terminated at any time.

===Assignment and sublease===

Any transfer of a lease requires the consent of the owner, and cannot be asserted against the owner if the owner has not consented. The transfer of a lease without the owner's consent is grounds for termination (Article 612). However, this termination right has been severely limited by precedent and is only recognized in practice when the tenant has not acted in bad faith (Supreme Court, Sep 25 1953).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Japanese Law and Government}}

'''Obligations''' (''saiken'' from the perspective of the obligee, ''saimu'' from the perspective of the obligor) are one of the key components of Japanese civil law. Unlike property rights, the content of obligations may be freely determined by the parties. The Civil Code is primarily concerned with setting default rules which apply when the parties have not chosen particular rules between themselves.

==Performance==

Performance (''bensai'') of an obligation generally extinguishes the obligation. Substitute performance (''daibutsu bensai'') is also possible.

Performance must generally be actual performance of the stipulated obligation, but there are two circumstances in which preparation for performance followed by oral notice of performance is adequate (Article 493):
* When the obligee has previously refused to accept performance
* When the cooperation of the obligee is necessary to effect performance

The location of performance, unless otherwise agreed, is:
* for obligations regarding delivery of a particular object, the location of that object at the time the obligation commenced;
* for other obligations, the domicile of the obligor (Article 484).

The cost of performance is generally borne by the obligor; however, obligees must bear any additional cost required by virtue of the obligee changing domiciles (Article 485).

Upon performance, the performing party may demand a certificate of receipt from the recipient (Article 486) or the return of any certificate evidencing the obligation (Article 487).

==Damages==

When a creditor or victim is harmed by the negligence of an obligor, a court may factor the creditor/victim's own negligence into determination of the amount of damages. In the payment of money claims, negligence on the part of the creditor may waive the obligor's liability entirely (Article 418). This rule does not apply to tort claims (see below).

==Contracts==
===General rules===
====Termination and cancellation====

Termination of a contract (''kaiyaku'') has the effect of cancelling its effectiveness on a forward-looking basis only. Cancellation (''kaijo'') cancels the contract's effectiveness retrospectively. In other words, cancellation causes the contract to have never existed for legal purposes, while termination causes the contract to cease to exist but maintains the validity of obligations which existed prior to termination.

Stipulated penalties for terminating a contract are generally treated as minimum expected compensatory damages and cannot be lowered by a court (Article 420). 

===Enumerated contracts===
The Civil Code also creates several categories of contracts and specifies default rules applicable to each. These rules may generally be superseded by the express agreement of the parties.

====Gifts====
A gift (贈与 ''zōyo'') contract is formed when one party offers its property to the other for no compensation, and the other party accepts the offer (Article 549). Written gift contracts are binding upon the parties. Oral gift contracts may be revoked by either party at any time prior to performance (Article 550).

The donor is not liable for any defects in the gift, or for the nonexistence of any part of the gift, unless such fact was known to the donor and not transmitted to the recipient (Article 551).

====Purchases====

A purchase (売買 ''baibai'') is the transfer of property from one party to another in exchange for a payment (Article 555).

====Exchanges====
====Consumption loans====
====Use loans====
====Leases====
====Employment====
====Undertakings====
An undertaking (請負 ''ukeoi'') is a contract wherein one party completes a specified task, and the other pays them compensation for completing that task. Undertakings differ from mandates (see below) in that they expire once the task is completed and the payment is made.

The general rules applicable to mandates are as follows:

* Compensation must be paid upon delivery of the product of the task, or at the completion of the task if no delivery is required (Article 633).
* If there is a defect in the product, the orderor may demand that the worker repair the defect within an appropriate period of time, unless the defect is not major and the repair would require disproportionate cost. The orderor may also demand damages (Article 634). A defect in the product is also grounds for termination if the defect prevents the purpose of the contract from being achieved (Article 635). These rights lapse if not exercised within one year of delivery (or completion if no delivery is required) (Article 637). For land and buildings, the period is extended to ten years if the defective structure is made of stone, brick, concrete or metal, or five years if made of other materials (Article 638). Liability for known but unannounced defects may not be waived by contract (Article 640).
* While the work is in progress, the orderor may terminate the contract at any time upon payment of any applicable damages to the worker (Article 641).
* If the orderor enters bankruptcy, the worker or the bankruptcy administration may terminate the contract, in which case any due compensation and/or damages will be paid out of the bankruptcy estate (Article 642).

====Mandates====

A mandate (委任 ''inin'') is established when one party delegates the disposition of certain matters to another, and the other accepts the delegation. Unlike an undertaking, a mandate does not require the completion of any particular task.

The general rules applicable to mandates are as follows:

* Mandates do not inherently require any compensation (Article 648).
* The mandatee must perform their mandated duties with the care of a good manager (Article 644).
* The mandatee must report to the mandator at the mandator's demand(Article 645).
* The mandatee has a duty to deliver items received and to transfer rights mandated for transfer by the mandator (Article 646).
* The mandator has a duty to pay any necessary expenses in advance (Article 649), and if expenses are paid after the fact, to pay legal interest on such expenses, which may be set off against items payable from the mandatee to the mandator (Article 650).
* The mandator must also compensate the mandatee for any harm incurred non-negligently while performing their mandate duties (Article 650.3).
* Mandates may be terminated by either party at any time, but if the timing of the termination is disadvantageous to the counterparty, the terminating party must compensate them for any loss (Article 651). Mandates also end automatically upon the death, bankruptcy or entrance into guardianship of either party (Article 653).

Strictly speaking, a pure &quot;mandate&quot; is only granted to perform legal acts such as signing contracts. Other types of mandate are called &quot;quasi-mandates,&quot; but the applicable rules are generally the same rules applicable to pure mandates.

====Deposit====
====Partnership====
====Annuity====
====Settlement====

==Torts==

The negligence of the plaintiff may be factored into the amount of liability but is not a basis for denying liability (Article 722).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Arguments==

But let us assume, although that our doctrine is considerably skewed as this would lead to the author’s brainwaves having a couple of screws loose. In that being that the order of progression is incorrect and that I have only extrapolated from causality violation involving a rectilinear mass-less energy form of said distance and applied it to normal causality (cause and effect) situations where relativistic effects are considerably negligible even in situations of walking and resting.

AH-HA! He’s a crank!

That’s how energy becomes established to grow in time in the order described - from the future to present is incorrect. That order of establishment of energy in time as it progresses from position
to position, does not occur in the now, that energy is not established in coming from THE past into THE present by coming to THE future to THE present. Which, by all accounts would make absolutely perfect sense. 

But rather by classical interpretations and reasons of thought that energy in being established in time, transpires by growing from THE past to THE present and that the future remains uncertain. Prediction has no bearing here. Then if this is assumed as absolute for nominal cause and effect situations involving all types of experimental bodies that incorporate energy to work and accomplish things - then of a surety I am wrong. And I admit it plain and simple.

But it still leaves our discoveries unaltered, the past present and future are still interdependent to create the now-to evolve limits for energies incorporated in the now by the now. Also whenever energy does become established in whatever degree, in situations where causality (RPS) is not reciprocal, that the now is responsible for the constraints for/of energy being prohibited to the relations of positions (that is they are created by them) which are the degrees of freedom created
by definition.

The conclusion where energy then would not be generated from the past - but instead is always in the now, or that it comes from the past only to the present and that in so doing the future does not lead to the present. Hence on one side of the fence we have the modernists who argue that the past leads to the present, while on the other side you have me and my discoveries and these writings. 

It appears then that we have a double standard resulting in a disagreement, which can be argued as uncomplimentary. However before everyone laughs and walks away, let’s take a closer look at this two-sided coin with the use of an imaginary time traversion machine.

And let us assume that in a straightaway manner, we transcend time to the same place back in time to approximately 1 hour beforehand. Upon emerging into THE past at the same spot we check our surroundings and realize we are indeed in THE past of 1 hour before initiating the
event to go back. (We are outdoors of course). 

Now we desire to return to the present from the past in which we are in-in the now, currently. To return via our machine from the past to the present- we must now journey to the future from the past of which we currently reside in. When we travel (if you can call it that) to the present from the past we are, in essence traveling also from the past to the present, by travel from the past to the future and the future leads back to the present from which we left. While inversely, we would travel from the now from the present. While also we would from THE future to THE past. And we emerge into the past it becomes the now.

Thus both interpretations are correct and neither is wrong! Therefore the future does lead to the present while also the past leads to the present. Now this might appear a tad perplexing but the differentiation comes between leaving and arriving. While it can be stated that the past leads to the future-it does, provided infinite travel in it is exercised. Reversed toward the Big Bang. And it does not matter whether that travel through time is reciprocal or in a straight-line. The past leads to the now and the future leads to the present. Confused? If you are re-read again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Real Time Travel==

With enough said here surrounding the semantics of time related to establishments of energy in space-time it becomes clear that time is the key to unlocking the secrets to particles and exotic forms of matter. Now all this is leading to an important pinnacle of which we have not gotten to yet because there are dire moments of scenery that need to be crossed over to solve the riddles behind these secrets in order to expose them and use them correctly. 

After all if we miss that scenery the road trip will be missed. With this we can estimate that D approaches 0 whenever arriving occurs more than leaving does. Or to put it meaningfully one part of interdependency would have to be to be avoided. That being when arrival before occurs more than the interdependency of coming back to the present from the past by way of the future. It literally must avoid it, as does loss in Ε by renewal in Ε.

When arrival occurs so much so that going back before leaving transpires more than coming back via the future from the past space collapses where t overrides D. Now comes the hardest part how to cause the particle to do this and do it in another position at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Now that we understand what is going on here any reader might be able to see where this is heading to bring about Quantum Nanotechnology. One should comprehend that there exists an interdependency between past and future in constraining energy to the present-the very reason for df - it becomes clear that the expansion in D of a particle will result in a change in RPS of the particle. 

Matching arrivals with leavings at the same time to the exact position(s) – is not actually going back - back in time to the exact position from which it left because there is a dependency for Ε to remain locked in the present by the interdependency between past and future. So every instance where the RPS value arrives at the same time it leaves via a return to the future to the present insinuates in-actual time travel to the past. Instead. 

This gap needs to be closed by arrival more. Once the value of arriving occurs more than leaving approaches a full value, say for instance 1, the dependency for coming back to the present from the past by way of the future approaches 0 so that Ε is enabled to go back through time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Quantum Time Travel==

Now the only problems left are how to do this. Understand, here, that compression to cause contraction of the particle’s distance or expansion does not affect the interdependency either way.

At every position on the circumference leaving and arrival are occurant. To force the circumference to be more finite by altercations in D to effect the RPS - at c - will only cause the interdependency to occur faster – no time travel – no nothing. It still retains the value of being in the present at any mark-off point indicating RPS about D at c.

Affecting the ω of c won’t do any wonders either because at each position it will go to the past faster to arrive in the now faster. What we have here is a crux where neither ΔD works to cause time travel, nor increments to the value of c because the past leads to the present. And as a note, notice that all visible matter you see macroscopically… remains in the now. Do you understand what is causing it Quantum dynamically?

Why? (I love this Question)

What is the reason for this? And why the lockout by the particle`s mechanics to cause time
travel?

Let us refer to this interdependency of time to habitually lock matter into the now by acting as a unit as Transciprocal (trans-reciprocal) motion. Transciprocal motion always leads to the present,
no matter how finite the circumferential distance of a thing may be and always at every position on the circumference. Timitically at a macro level this is the reason for positions. Otherwise they would be transcendent via time travel. 

That is that arrival NEVER arrives at any position before leaving and cannot no matter the distance, because the values of leaving to the past and arriving to the present are both equivalent. If the value for arrival were to be increased above the value for leaving - arrival would be assumed to transpire before leaving - or at best at the exact time of t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at all positions but because reciprocation is interdependent to remain in the now, that interdependency would flagrate and cancel like the interdependency of 4-velocity motion, one portion of the wave that results in ν by acceleration to c cannot exist without the other. Thereby locking arrival to leaving to arrival making it not possible to transcend the now.

We can now estimate that the arrival of energy before leaving or exactly is in the now of the past and this raises some more interesting subject matter.

Fortunately and yet unfortunately this is the only way to do this, to force arrival to transpire before leaving - because the RPS in leaving from the present goes back to THE past returning to the
present from THE past to THE future.

In assuming that a particle is electric, magnetic- it would be erroneous to pacify any argument that suggests that it is not coupled with Gravity. We may model a particle to any typical configuration of spin-direction, which follow patterns of non-interference.

However being that RPS of D of c is interdependent in GCV where arrival and leaving are equivalent any position via uniform circulation is of course a measurement pertinent to only the imaginary,hence in reciprocation no actual position is really evident. With no position essentially present,the loss in energy aside from decay is avoided by renewal in Ε occurent by D of c in RPS.(At) an exact time where leaving and arrival unite in a present position in the now. 

Attempts to isolate to/for &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past to return back to the now invites futility as much as it is impossible to isolate Pe from Ke. It just cannot be done. One can only avoid the other. Where position throughout space-time is contingent when energy in all forms are established - without such used to move would be irrelevant. Ε, in of itself, in it’s normal manifestations can in no sense result in FTL, for in it and by it do constraints result.

Exactly, the reason why the RPS of c about D can traverse to THE past and come back to &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; present is entirely due to the fact that ω of c/Ε about the finite D in RPS terms is because the finite circle possesses no position to contend with differentiated from that designated by a mark-off point indicating the RPS by measuring it’s v=c about D.

Making any placement thereof to purpose a base of actual position, as a real base of measurement is purely imaginary and has no basis apart from indication. Motion - back and forth- to and from the present is repetitive or uniformly repetitive, and thus time travitic. The heading of which goes absolutely nowhere - by the interdependency of repetition in the now. 

Because space is variable in such laser circles to a fixed speed, indication has it that with less distance (D) in traversion by mass-less energy, by time as it is measured in RPS and straightway changes in response to the variation one with more finiteness to quicken- and with much expanse speed must compensate for the compensation of more space that becomes more unequal to the speed
as if to signal a variation above c to variable energy establishment(s) that leave from one position through intervening space (That is assuming intervening space exists between positions) to any other position. (Quantum). 

As radical as this appears - we blind ourselves from these concepts because all relativistic measurements originate from the value-based measurements of Pe and Ke. Incidentally for certain Quantum relations of spin may be time dependent at certain finite distances or negligible.

We may refer to such levels of distance expansions and contractions effecting the RPS of c about different finite distances below 1 inch-1 and the compensation required in altering c to compensate for vast distance stretches unequal to c as the difference between the finite and infinite as subspace differentials below mass-less energy or infinite finiteness and infinite in-finiteness. 

But position still remains present with energy whenever that energy retains a value approaching 0 and above. Nothing represented by 0, is, at least something while less than nothing (-1) can be estimated as either position-less, avoided by energy renewal in a circle in finite distances of energy or is only applicable in time travel.

Again where:

                                  √ -1 = &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Or as an alternative or perhaps an analogy negative mass has no position that can be said of as existing in/with or to energetic relations because energy being related to mass is valid Ε=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, in relationship to position whenever either are incorporated in attempts to circumvent FTL. 

Therefore because positional relations manifest with the use of energy, negative mass must possess no positions to contend with also. Which means it is THERE and exists - but it is going to take either time travel to generate it or some other thing of highly advanced technological capabilities.

At every instance where energy is used a block results to cause or violate causality in avoidance of these position(s) to cause time travel in straight - lines even if induced in barrier-less oscillations at the Quantum level. So it becomes immediate to cause it (Or in causality violation effect it) to find it through an absolutely different approach other than energy to manifest the proper means of contending with positions to result in actual time travel. Then Aleodeology. 

But how would one generate an equation that does not incorporate energy when all measurement stems from energy in the first place? To get it we are going to need something that does not contend with position(s), similar to the RPS of c about a finite D, but absent of reciprocation. That being almost like converting the rapid rotation of a particle to straight-line displacement. 

But would this entail renewal of E? Does not this hint at position-less travel? And does not this indicate the omission of travel altogether? Yes, this is true. First, Let’s investigate what is what in it. One reason why circulation proceeds “nowhere” is because in it’s position-less travel it has nothing to grapple with to go. Such as the rapid rotation of a tire in the absence of a flat surface to travel across as it moves backward to propel a vehicle forward. 

With nowhere to go, it is simply a matter of comparison, similar to everyday world examples, such as an organism trapped in quicksand, with nothing for it to grab onto the mass effortlessly sinks or floats as in outer space. No foothold on position.

So what is the answer here?

A spin absent of repeating inputs of increased energy that causes accumulation?

A rapid rotation that does not go nowhere?

Would it be something that doesn’t contend with positions as in a closed time-like line but also does not repeat?


Like two die on felt, all animated objects must repeat within their own degrees of freedom. The organism possesses only so many degrees of freedom and will always find it impossible to extend beyond them without time travel, just as all things do that are possessed of energy and can *willfully move or be forced to move. 

So if we are to assume a closed time-like line and move it in all possible degrees of freedom as fast as can be - while reciprocating – it will eventually end all those df by going through all the combinations and permutations to begin repeating them all over again maybe in a different manner than before but eventual unto a repeat just the same. None united and all separate one from another due to Δd with respect to G. 

The point here being that each new spin, diversified for all df is done, accomplished and occurs in the now. Light speed or no. Finite distance for a particle or not it does not matter. Does this therefore indicate that a thing, which does not repeat within the degrees of freedom available to it, does not use or access positions?

Degrees of freedom (Positions established with the use of energy and in debt to Pe) surround us everywhere in space-time - a choice you make determines the outcome in the now and this necessitates Δd. As opposed to an alternate choice you could (or could have) made in the now but did not. (An alternate outcome in space-time (different positions)) – but ONLY in relationship to energy corresponding to establishment in it required to do so in space-time. Thus indicating no energy to be established for the second half of the conclusion. If no df is taken then positions are not contended with corresponding to Ε in space-time. Thus signifying, again no energy to be established for the first half of the conclusion. What then would not take df that is not energy corresponding to space-time?

In this oscillatory reference omitting repeats is the omission of returning to an original position - all new or existent? Leaving to a new position? Which is not a return to a prior position, because
returning to a previous position in such rapid rotation of a finite particle would indicate a timitic return to the now, provided mass-less Ε.

Leaving then would be travel (from) the now - to continually leave - omitting repeats. What then of the new position at c? Is not this arrival…? How then does the energy leave without returning, our
goal being to cause FTL? 

*Again choice and again Δd.

In that being leaving without arrival to any new position (straightway) not involved as a repeat to a previous position would fail? To avoid “arrival” indicates constant leaving. But what does this mean? Is this descriptive? To accomplish this Ε should constantly leave from itself, by-pass or a reduction in/of arrival must occur to leave? In particular this would have to be from the same position,which is a return back to a prior position. Would not then a total ΔΕ have to transpire in relationship to position? Loss in Ε? Reverse?

First, would not the position itself have to be not contended with? To do this repeats would have to be involved, because loss in Ε is necessary where renewal in Ε is causative of it. Hence we are again blocked in straight-line, oscillatory energetic motion. If Ε goes back – it arrives – forward – it arrives. Position to position is made sure. Arrival is at position B back to A, while leaving is A and from B with respect to Ε.

[[File:Arrive_leave_Image27.png|thumb|300px|'''Blocking''']]

We could (assuming that this were constantly applicable), speed up in leaving by pinpointing the leave time at c. In order to cause the speed-up in leaving to arrival, we would consider a photon
as one in which there exists a timitic response to electromagnetic induction.

Consider a photon leaving from position A while arriving at position A opposite in propagation direction. Depiction of the same photon is separate, indicated as in the same position Ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
…
The related positions it has come from.

[[File:Blocking_2_Image28.png|thumb|300px|'''Finite Timitic Differential''']]

There would be assumed a cancellation between the two photons, determined by equal and opposite polarizations in the electric and magnetic fields of each.

(Phase conjugate, yet in phase). However no cancellation can happen given that one transpires at a finite time that is different to/from that of the other’s arrival. (Unless from the opposite positions from which they do come - they occur at the exact same instant measured by a *static interval of time).

So cancellation is not seen because of this tiny timitic differential. Then again if the photon, as it is depicted were exactly precise it would indicate simultaneity, and this is not possible without a loss
in Ε as in the renewal of Ε in a rapid reciprocal process-therefore if there were no differential then cancellation would transpire as well as simultaneity. 

So in an oscillation there are two differentials of time – but coming from different directions. The electric field producing the magnetic field incorporates 4-velocity motion, which allegedly produces the speed of light as magnitude. The 4 - velocity motion originates from the fact that the energy produced exists as a rapid interchange between deceleration into Pe to curl into momentum resulting in Ke. The underlying cause - gravity, again.

Thus:

                              ν+Ρe+m−Ρe+Κe=a

Notice although that momentum is not a result of energy, but stems from potentiality due to G, which means degrees of equidistant freedom.

Acceleration (a) leads to a top velocity equal to c where repetitiveness again is engaged. If we could increase this rapid interchange between Pe+ m+ Ke is the effect of increasing a, ν, −ν in
the waves of the photon from which the interchange is produced and propagates. And this is done in a particle accelerator. However once we consider the source then it is obvious to see that the source can only function in the present and cannot extenuate itself beyond this speed to venture past light’s (through time) because it operates in the now also by energy where F=Ε.

*A precise static instant in time underlying a dynamical physical process at which the relative position of a body in relative motion or a specific physical magnitude would theoretically be precisely determined. Time and Classical and Quantum Mechanics: Indeterminacy vs. Discontinuity -Peter Lynds

[In rapid reciprocation about a finite distance in RPS at c, whenever there exists a non-contention of position for a particle spin or spinning photons where acceleration does not exist because of
this non-contention, energy that arrives – arrives in an “imaginary position” to an indicated point in the now – with nowhere to arrive to – in the now and no more arrival from the past leaving occurs.]

With this then being true of arrival because the energy has no actual position to contend with then the opposite is true for travel to the past.

[Arrival in THE past DOES NOT occur where no position exists to contend with. (Arrive to/at)

Therefore without a “past now” to arrive to by leaving from the now, arrival to the now must transpire.]

The same photon in the same position (arriving from opposite directions) (Not “A” position) does NOT cancel. What the photon is, as was depicted, are just the two halves of a circle split down
the center and straightened.

[[File:Circle_split_Image29.png|thumb|300px|'''circle split''']]

If we attempt to take 1 photon and invert it at either end there is still a Δd prevalent. Even if done at the precise center. Thus, for the rapid reciprocation of such a particle of a finite distance the
actual position that exists for the particle – devoid of position is of course compensated for as the reciprocation itself. Because it goes back upon itself. Hence the position is the entire renewal back to the same location or at most the position of the particle in space-time as it spins. 

And every imaginary position measurable about the entire circumference, arrives and leaves in precisely the now. No real position but always in the now. But as depicted before leaving would be travel (from the now) to continually leave – presumably omitting repeats. And arrival to the new position by leaving is arrival – which in turn is a return to a new position minus the old position.


So if the mass-less Ε goes back to itself – it is arrival – and forward (to another assumed position) it is arrival (straight). The “positions” here are imaginary because a line-segment can stretch add infinitum. So without causality violation leaving in a line-segment can catch up with arrival, pass it up and move back through time. But again a problem of mass interferes with particles and speed is un-incremental because the energy source cannot extenuate itself out of the now.

This is in relationship to energy corresponding to leaving and arriving. The positions are imaginary,and we have a quite complex problem associated with rapid reciprocation where positional relations do not or are not dealt with, except where renewal itself is manifest as the entire position itself. Hence in any case we wind up with an prohibition with energy in relationship to space-time.

With vast distance it is difficult to say how fast, fast is because at c for mass-less energy, it never compensates itself to match the now because it must come from the past. That also of starlight one sees in the night sky is light coming from the past. Although that light is seen in the now as it arrives to the eye it has been displacing over thousands if not millions of years and that travel from there to here does not occur in now. To cover such great distance in the now photons would have to be increased in velocity to compensate for the length of the distance to be unequal or equal to it.


But the distance is really far and unequal to the speed of light so c never approaches now although it remains in the now as it travels. 

Weird huh? Very long circular distances of laser light would also take approximately the same time to arrive to the eye – in an arc and then return to it’s point of origin and then again. So we might assume that either the distance involved must be altered to compensate for the lack of speed or alter the speed to compensate for the distance.

However since the distances involved in interplanetary travel are so vast anything that can approach the or even attain the speed of light will not be efficient enough to travel to other world properly because that velocity will be too slow to travel throughout space and visit other worlds with life on them now - and therefore any star ship able to travel at speeds approaching light speed will be found to be too slow for the demands required for interplanetary travel and therefore is worthy only of the garbage. 

If induced in the “now” as does the speed of light retains a grip in all possible answers fail in light of energy. Because whatever source is used to do so cannot also extend beyond the now – the force uses energy to generate the force and therefore force is energy.

Thus the solution to &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the equation:

                                √ -1 = &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;;

is:

                                 &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; = Ρ

Travel in/through time is positionless – arrival and/or leaving in time necessitates position. 

Space? 

Arriving without position leads backward in time. Arrival back in time (previous nows) leads back to the present. Because position is inherent to deceleration and without it in renewal of energy position is nowhere to be found in actuality. So position is compensated for in renewal of
Ε through leaving(s) and returning (s) to present time. 

No choice or at.

The common denominator in this IS loss in Ε or in reciprocation, the avoidance of loss in Ε, the absence of position therefore is related to stopping or halts to a position which is of course energy
in debt to Pe. Or Pe itself. Initially then avoidance of Pe/G is required to not originally (cause) by definition time - (travel) – but by definition it’s absence in renewal but to arrive through the avoidance of position in a diverse time – apart from the now necessitates that it be in that now to arrive,otherwise it CANNOT. 

Thus Ε in order to time travel, the avoidance of loss in Ε must be encouraged to avoid position consisting of Pe/G. I believe that it may in fact be the case to transcend positions by renewal in Ε to avoid loss in Ε and there are reasons for this, namely because of matter and mass. But who among us having investigated the subject can explain to you what position consists of apart from automated or pre-programmed information? We know that energy ends a position of Pe by G acting upon the mass. 

Whenever energy is established in space-time to propagate in 1 direction, positions naturally and automatically become established due to the fact that it is in resistance to it and that that energy in being established by an external force does not undergo renewal. But what have you in such an oscillatory process? As we know there exists a tiny timitic differential between a photon that arrives at an identical place from opposing directions. 

How much more an oscillating laser beam between 2 barriers? With an oscillation involving mass-less energy the result is evident as non-cancellous, and no-closed time-like line can result because an oscillation travels 2 dimensionally (2 directions) thereby prohibiting the avoidance of loss in energy related to position by renewal in energy.

How, mind you, even if one could unite the timitic differences would the oscillation be useful toward interplanetary travel when it may prove impossible to create such an oscillation without two 100% silvered barriers? And further still, the jittery travel would look awfully funny. More coffee? We could although begin such a barrier less oscillation at the Quantum level, very near to an imaginary reference point. 

Everything would naturally work out fine until more distance is used provided the energy is forced to become larger. As it does the process breaks down as it approaches the mesio-scopic and the macroscopic. This because the timitic differences in the same space widen, growing farther and farther apart and thereby necessitating that the renewal be sped-up to compensate for every growth in energy to distance. The indication is that for a spinning photon or particle a position in the past would have to be present for the energy to arrive in &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past. 

It is safe to assume that all that would be needed to do this is a slow-down of the position-less rotation at precise intervals (pulses, etc?) in/of time when the energy proceeds to go back to past nows from &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; now after arriving occurs to &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; now and has nowhere else to arrive.(Reader comprehend)

This is against the rapid revolvement of the particle- in the opposite direction to the direction of spin. The best part in this is that this can be done from the imaginary positions in the now.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Political and Administrative Background of the Thai Society=

==The Administration Before the Reformation By King Rama V==


The kingdom of Thailand has its king as head of state.

=== Central Administration===

===Provincial Administration=== 

Provincial administration is a part of the country’s administrative machines, allowing local communities a certain level of autonomy. The local powers are  under the state powers; the local administrations are not independent bodies; they are under the national laws, set up for the benefit and well-being of the members of the community. 

The website of Thailand's Election Commision has explained why the local administration is important:

        Powers and Duties of the Local Governmental Organisations

&quot; Decentralisation is, amongst others, the fundamental principle of the local government to empower people of self-government according to their will.  They will elect their representatives (members of the local assemblies or local administrators) to administer the local affairs instead of them with expectation of  their better lives as well as protecting local interests and the country’s as a whole.&quot;

&quot; Therefore, all the local governmental organisations shall enjoy autonomy in laying down policies for their governance, administration, finance, and shall have powers and duties particularly on their own part.  Members of the local assemblies or local administrators shall hold office for the period of four years.&quot;


There are currently 5 kinds of Thailand’s local (provincial) administration.

&lt;br&gt;
1)  '''Provincial  Administration  Organization''' is the largest body of Thailand’s provincial administration; each province has one, except Bangkok. The PAO covers the area of the whole province, set up with an aim to manage and provide public services within its province, helping the works of municipalities and the sub-district administrations; it does so by collaborating with other administrations within the same province to avoid power redundancy and appropriate budget allocation. 

Provincial Administrative organization (PAO) consists of two administrations. The first is the administrative body led by the chair of the provincial administrative organization; he or she is responsible for all the administrative affairs of the province. The second is the legislative body where members of the provincial administrative organization issues rules and regulations as well as monitor the management of the provincial organization. 

There is only one chair of each provincial administration organization; he or she is elected by the people in the province. The main duty is to monitor and manage the provincial administration organization led by the permanent secretary of the organization who functions as the top executive of the organization. The chair appoints his or her assistants who are not members of the provincial administration council to help him or her running the administrative affairs of the organization. The assistantship serves for four years. Their duties include managing and monitoring of the provincial administrative affairs, making sure that the administration is done in accordance with the provincial acts and regulations and the provincial development plan. Other duties include planning for the development of the province, setting up the annual budget to be submitted to the provincial administrative council, and reporting the performance and expenditures to the provincial administrative council.  
	
Members of the PAO are directly elected by the people; they are elected to a four-year term. Their duties and responsibilities include enacting rules and regulations to be used within a particular province or district such as regulations on petrol and tobacco taxes, monitoring of the administration of the PAO, and monitoring and evaluation of projects’ expenditures. Their roles and responsibilities also include their roles in approving the provincial development plan which is a collection of plans and projects submitted from municipalities and sub-district administration organizations. The plan may entail road construction or other infrastructures. They also take part in approving the province’s annual budget, which is the management of the public money, managing the collected taxes levied from the public; the taxes include property tax and indirect taxes such as trade and business taxes. These collected taxes, in principle, would return for the development of the province or city.
&lt;br&gt;
	
2)  '''Municipalities''' refer to provincial political units, such as a city or town. It has three categories: (1) sub-district (Tambon) municipality, district (Muang) municipality, and (33) city (Nakorn) municipality, depending on the number of population and the civility and development of that particular area. 
 
Municipalities are set up to manage and provide basic infrastructures for people in local areas; they permeate the daily life of people from birth to death. In theory, a municipality has its autonomous administration. Municipal staff and the permanent secretary function as local government servants, carrying out their duties under the supervision of the municipal council directly elected by the people. 

A municipality entails two bodies: legislative and administrative bodies. The legislative body’s main duty is to enact local regulations and monitor the administration of the municipal council; the administrative body manages the affaires of the municipality via the executive power of the mayor and the members of the municipal council. 

The mayor is directly elected from the eligible people with a particular constituent, serving for the term of 4 years; each municipality entails 2 council members from each sub-district (Tambon), 3 council members from each district, and 4 council members from the province.  

Members of the municipal council are directly elected from the eligible voters, serving the term of 4 years. The number of the council members depends on the type of the municipality. The number is 12 for the sub-district municipal council, 18 for the district municipal council and 24 for the city municipal council.

3)  '''The Special Administration of Bangkok'''. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration divides its administration into districts and sub-districts. The Bangkok Administration Council functions as the legislative body; the governor of Bangkok is the head of the administrative body. The governor and members of the Bangkok Administration Council are elected from the voters. The term for the members of the council is 4 years.  

4) '''The Special Administration of Pattaya'''. This administration entails the city council as the legislative branch entailing the 24 elected members. The mayor of Pattaya is elected by the people, serving as the head of the executive branch.

5)  '''The Sub-District Administration Organization''' is a local administrative organization under the Councils and Sub-district Administration Organization Act BE 2537, functioning as a local administrative organization at the sub-district (Tambon) level; it is, thus, very close to the people of the community. A Sub-district Administration Organization has developed from a Tambon Council with income up to a certain level. It is established to manage public services at the local level, villages and sub-districts, as it is impractical for the government to administer all of the villages in the country, the number of which is over 70000.
	
A sub-district administration organization entails two branches: the legislative branch and the executive branch. The legislative branch entails members of the organization; their main duties are to pass the local laws and monitor the administrative affaires of the sub-district. The executive branch is led by the president of the organization who chairs the sub-district administration organization.  The chair of a sub-district administration organization is elected by the people functioning as the head of the administrative branch, and the term is 4 years. 

Members of the sub-district administration organization are directly elected by the people of the community; their administrative term lasts for four years. The number of the members of for each sub-district varies, depending on the number of villages within a particular sub-district. The sub-district organization of only one village can only have 5 members. If the number of villages is two, each village is allowed to vote for three representatives. The organization with more than two villages is allowed to have two representatives for each village (See Thailand's Office of Election Commission [http://www.ect.go.th/newweb/en/election/ElectoralAdmin_LocalElection.php].

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sauce|Sauce]]

'''JZ's Chicken Barbecue Sauce''' is a [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] based sauce used as marinade or barbecue sauce for grilled [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] parts such as wings, drumsticks or breasts. It also works very well for vegetarian (e.g., wheat and soy based) alternatives. It is invented by Johan Zandin from Gothenburg, Sweden and mixes 9 different ingredients from Europe, Asia and North America.

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (30 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) of [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (5 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) of walnut oil
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (30 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) of mild chili sauce (the kind which is just slightly hotter than ketchup)
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (5 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) of [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]] (see below for vegetarian alternative)
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (5 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) of [[Cookbook:Teriyaki|teriyaki]] marinade
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] (10 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) of tandoori powder
*2 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] of ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]]
*2 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|herbal salt]]
*1 small, dried, crunched piri-piri

Makes 6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (90 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) of sauce.

==Procedure==
#Just mix everything together in a small [[Cookbook:Mixing bowl|mixing bowl]].
#Use a brush to apply a thick layer of the sauce to your favorite chicken parts or vegetarian alternative.
Then [[Cookbook:Barbecue|barbecue]] over fire, charcoal or in the oven.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*The sauce can also be used as a [[Cookbook:Marinade|marinade]]: Soak the chicken parts in it, for half an hour to a few hours.
*Any remaining sauce can be applied with the brush during the cooking.
*In case of allergies or problems to find some ingredient, most ingredients can be replaced by similar alternatives:
**peanut oil → [[Cookbook:Sunflower Oil|sunflower oil]], [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|corn oil]] or any other neutral oil
**walnut oil → [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]
**mild chili sauce → [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] or [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato purée]]
**Worcestershire sauce → HP sauce
**teriyaki marinade → [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
**herbal salt → plain salt
**piri-piri → any other hot [[Cookbook:Chili pepper|chili pepper]]

==Warnings==
*Make sure that any sauce that has been in contact with raw chicken gets properly heated. So do not apply more sauce just before taking the chicken from the heat or use the sauce uncooked after you have dipped the brush in it.
*Note that Worcestershire sauce usually is non-vegetarian, since at least the original recipe contains [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]]. (See above for alternative.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Economic Foundation of the Thai Society=

Thailand has recognized itself as a country with agriculture-based society. In the past, most Thais were farmers.

The stone inscription says that Thailand is a fertile land --- there are fish in water and rice in the field pr &quot;Nai Nam Mi Pla, Nai Na Mi Khao.&quot; Thailand has been a rice-growing society for many centuries. The Thai word for 'rice' is 'khao.'


Gradually, Thailand has developed into an industrialized state like many othetr countries in the world.

However, agriculture remains its back-bone of the economy. Its exports include rice, rubber, sugar, bananas, pineapples, and other agricultural products. In fact, the Thai government has branded Thailand as 'a great kitchen of the world.'

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Thai Literature=

One of the British ambassadors to Thailand used to opine that Thailand is a country with no literature. Here's his exact language:

            &quot;'''They (Thais) have no literature, no painting and only a very odd
             kind of music; their sculpture, ceramics and dancing are borrowed
             from others, and their architecture is monotonous and interior
             decoration hideous.&quot;''' &lt;br&gt;

Sir Antony Rumbold (British Ambassador to Thailand From 1965-1967)

The above quote has created a lot of comments in Thai society. Even though Sir Rumbold's comment was direct and personal, it is useful and should be viewed as a feedback from a true friend. For one thing, it helps Thais to investigate their own intellectual culture in relation with the world



Thai Literature can be divided into four periods:


Traditionally, Thai literature is an oral one. &lt;br&gt;

         Mi Nam Chang Mi Moung;(If there is water, there is a town.)
         Mi Moung Chang Mi Tao.(When there is a town, there is a ruler.)

== Five Thai Verse Forms ==

1)โคลง 2) ร่าย 3) ฉันท์ 4) กาพย์ 5) กลอน 

By Janpha Thadphoothon


1.	Khlong Khlong can be termed as the earliest forms of Thai poetry. Educated and sophisticated people generally follow Khlong since it is considered as an intellectual form of poetry. Khlong has different and elaborate tonal and rhythmic constrains and has been developed on the basis of Thai language.
Ex. 
เสียงลือเสียงเล่าอ้าง	อันใด พี่เอย 
เสียงย่อมยอยศใคร	ทั่วหล้า
สองเขือพี่หลับใหล	ลืมตื่น ฤๅพี่ 
สองพี่คิดเองอ้า	อย่าได้ถามเผือ
 	ลิลิตพระลอ

โคลงกระทู้ (Khlong Poems by Topics or Themes)
กวน	ตะกอนสงบแล้ว	กลับมา
น้ำ	ขุ่นคลักอีกครา	สุดใช้ 
ให้	คนตัดปัญหา	เหตุแห่ง    เคืองแล
ขุ่น	ข่มจิตสงบไว้	อย่าได้ฟื้นความ
 	 	ครูภาทิพ ศรีสุทธิ์


คน เกิดมามิได้                	มีใคร กำหนด
ดี ชั่วตัวทำไป	  	ย่อมรู้
คน สูงต่ำดูใจ		หาใช่ กายา 
เลว อย่าทำคือผู้		ทั่วหล้า นิยม

2.Raay ร่าย

พระสารประเสริฐ (ตรี นาคะประทีป) สันนิษฐานว่าร่ายเป็นของไทยแท้ มีมาแต่สมัยพ่อขุนรามคำแหง ด้วยปรากฏหลักฐานครั้งแรกในวรรณคดีสุโขทัยคือสุภาษิตพระร่วง และต่อมาจึงปรากฏเป็นรูปเป็นร่างขึ้นในวรรณคดีอยุธยาเรื่องโองการแช่งน้ำในสมัยสมเด็จพระรามาธิบดีที่ ๑

ร่ายเป็นร้อยกรองแบบหนึ่ง มีสี่ประเภทได้แก่ ร่ายยาว (Long) ร่ายสุภาพ (Courteous)  ร่ายดั้น (Harsh)  และร่ายโบราณ (Traditional)
ร่าย คือ คำประพันธ์ประเภทร้อยกรองแบบหนึ่งที่แต่งง่ายที่สุด และมีฉันทลักษณ์น้อยกว่าร้อยกรองประเภทอื่น ถ้าพิจารณาให้ดีจะพบว่าร่ายมีลักษณะใกล้เคียงกับคำประพันธ์ประเภทร้อยแก้วมาก เพียงแต่กำหนดที่คล้องจองและบังคับวรรณยุกต์ในบางแห่ง

Raay is one of the oldest verse forms of Thai poetry generally used for drafting laws and chronicles. Raay typically contains a five-syllable group of sentence that is linked together by a rhyme. This form of poetry usually contains more than one sentence in a single stanza. Syllable number and tone placement are very much similar in Raay and Khlong. Lilit is another form of Thai poetry where raay and khloong are alternately used.

ร่ายยาว
 
ร่ายยาว คือ ร่ายที่ไม่กำหนดจำนวนคำในวรรคหนึ่ง ๆ แต่ละวรรคจึงอาจมีคำน้อยมากแตกต่างกันไป การสัมผัส คำสุดท้ายของวรรคหน้าสัมผัสกับคำหนึ่งคำใดในวรรคถัดไป จะแต่งสั้นยาวเท่าไรเมื่อจบนิยมลงท้ายด้วยคำว่า แล้วแล นั้นแล นี้เถิด โน้นเถิด ฉะนี้ ฉะนั้น ฯลฯ เป็นต้น

ตัวอย่าง โพธิสตฺโต สมเด็จพระบรมโพธิสัตว์ อันสร้างสมดึงส์ปรมัตถบารมี เมื่อจะรับวโรรัตนเรืองศรีแปดประการ แด่สำนักนิท้าวมัฆวานเทเวศร์ ก็ทูลแก่ท้าวสหัสเนตรฉะนี้

Khloong and Raay are believed to be the original Thai forms of poetry.


3. Chan

This poetry contains two types of syllables called the light or lahu and heavy or kharu. These syllables are arranged in innumerable and different forms and sequences.

There are up to 108 varieties of Chan. ฉันท์ คือลักษณะถ้อยคำ ที่กวีได้ร้อยกรองขึ้น ไห้เกิดความไพเราะ ซาบซึ้ง โดยกำหนดคณะ ครุลหุ และสัมผัสไว้ เป็นมาตรฐาน 
ฉันท์นี้ไทยได้ถ่ายแบบมาจากอินเดีย ของเดิมแต่งเป็นภาษาบาลี และสันสกฤต
จิตรปทาฉันท์ ๘ cittapathaachan 8 
 
ตัวอย่าง: 
 

มาณวกฉันท์ ๘ maanawakkachan 8 
 
ตัวอย่าง: 
 


4. Kaab

Kaap. It has a definite rhythm and requires a fixed number of syllables. Although the rhythm is similar to Chan form of poetry, Kaap does not require the use of lahu and kharu syllables for making tone. There are several variations inside Kaap depending on the number of syllables per line. The most common are the yaanii that contains eleven syllables per line, cha-bang that has sixteen syllables and suraangkhanaang having twenty-eight syllables per line.


วิชาเหมือนสินค้า		อันมีค่าอยู่เมืองไกล
ต้องยากลำบากไป		จึงจะได้สินค้ามา
จงตั้งเอากายเจ้า		เป็นสำเภาอันโสภา
ความเพียรเป็นโยธา		แขนซ้ายขวาเป็นเสาใบ


5. Klon The most popular or the poetic form for the mass. A klon poem consists of 4 lines. Each line must have 6-8 syllables.

แต่ปางหลังยังมีกรุงกษัตริย์	 
สมมุติวงศ์ทรงนามท้าวสุทัศน์	ผ่านสมบัติรัตนานามธานี	 
อันกรุงไกรใหญ่ยาวสิบเก้าโยชน์	ภูเขาโขดเป็นกำแพงบูรีศรี	 
สะพรึบพร้อมไพร่ฟ้าประชาชี	ชาวบูรีหรรษาสถาวร	 
มีเอกองค์นงลักษณ์อรรคราช	พระนางนาฏนามประทุมเกสร	 
สนมนางแสนสุรางคนิกร	ดังกินนรน่ารักลักขณา	 
มีโอรสสององค์ล้วนทรงลักษณ์	ประไพพักตรเพียงเทพเลขา	 
ชื่ออภัยมณีเป็นพี่ยา	พึ่งแรกรุ่นชันษาสิบห้าปี	 
อันกุมารศรีสุวรรณนั้นเป็นน้อง	เนื้อดังทองนพคุณจำรุณศรี	 
พึ่งโสกันต์ชันษาสิบสามปี	พระชนนีรักใคร่ดังนัยนาฯ	


***
บัดนั้น พระยาพิเภกยักษี 
เห็นพระองค์ทรงโศกโศกี อสุรีกราบลงกับบาทา 
ทูลว่าพระลักษณ์สุริยวงศ์ ยังไม่ปลงชีวังสังขาร์ 
อันโมกขศักดิ์อสุรา พรหมาประสิทธิ์ประสาทไว้ 

ทรงอานุภาพฤทธิรุทร ต้องใครจะฉุดนั้นไม่ไหว 
แต่มียาคู่หอกชัย ให้ไว้สำหรับแก้กัน 
แม้นละไว้จนรุ่งราตรี ต้องแสงพระระวีจะอาสัญ 
ขอให้ลูกพระพายเทวัญ ไปห้ามพระสุริยันในชั้นฟ้า 
อย่าเพ่อรีบรถบทจร ข้ามยุคนธรภูผา 
แล้วให้ไปเก็บตรีชวา ทั้งยาชื่อสังขรณี 
ยังเขาสรรพยาบรรพต ปรากฏอยู่ยอดคีรีศรี 
กับปัญจมหานที สรรพยาทั้งนี้มาให้ทัน 
แม้นว่าได้บดชโลมลง องค์พระอนุชาไม่อาสัญ 
จะดำรงคงชีพชีวัน หอกนั้นก็จะหลุดขึ้นมา 

จากเรื่อง รามเกียรติ์ 
พระราชนิพนธ์ในรัชกาลที่ 1



จะกล่าวถึงพลายแก้วแววไว 
เมื่อบิดาบรรลัยแม่พาหนี 
ไปอาศัยอยู่ในกาญจนบุรี 
กับนางทองประศรีผู้มารดา 
อยู่มาจนเจ้าเจริญวัย 
อายุนั้นได้ถึงสิบห้า 
ไม่วายคิดถึงพ่อที่มรณา 
แต่นึกตรึกตรามากว่าปี 
อยากจะเป็นทหารชาญชัย 
ให้เหมือนพ่อขุนไกรที่เป็นผี 
จึงอ้อนวอนมารดาให้ปราณี 
ลูกนี้จะใคร่รู้วิชาการ


This is another example of a 8-syllable klon.

เศรษกิจพอเพียงเพียงพอใช้

ทรัพย์ที่ได้พึงประมาณการซื้อหา

รู้พอดีเก็บหอมออมเงินตรา

เพื่อวันหน้าคราลำบากไม่ยากจน

I suggest merging the [[Computer Networks]] book into the [[Communication Networks]] book.
There seems to be a lot of overlap between the books -- Ethernet, Wireless Internet, IP, UDP, TCP, etc. are discussed redundantly in both books.
My understanding is that computer networks are, by definition, a subset of all communication networks.

I suspect that someday &quot;Communication Networks&quot; will grow large enough that it makes sense to split it back up into several books -- perhaps &quot;Computer Networks&quot; will be one of those books, or perhaps we'll figure out a better way to split it up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section is meant to briefly introduce each topic to you, what are we going to do under each topic and its application in real life. The purpose is to excite you.

==Motion==

Things move. From baseball to comet, from F1 race car to falling feather. The physicist's dream is to know exactly how these things move. Where is it going to be at at a certain time? When is it going to be here? When is it going to be there? Where is the moon at a hundred days and one hour from today?

But things do not simply move from one place to another, translational motion, they also rotate; spinning around their own axis, a spinning wheel, or around other things, moon circling around (orbiting) the earth.

==Thermodynamic==

This section will amuse the want-to-be-engineer the most. You will learn how the internal combustion engine (the cool stuff inside the car that make it run) works, how fridge and air conditioner works, and so forth. Yet, as a spoiler, this will also be the most disappointing section, because this will tell you that perfect machines (100% efficiency) are impossible.

==Fluids==

Fun fact: There are more missions that send people into outer space than to Challenger's Deep at Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the ocean, which has only been visited by humans once, in 1960 with a Bathyscaphe (a type of submarine) named Trieste. They found strange creatures beyond imagination there. Why is it so hard? It is because of the high water pressure at such depth: 100MPa. How bad is that? Well, the air pressure that we experience in daily life is around 101.kPa, that is, around one thousand time less. The pressure on the heel of a 60kg (132lbs) person wearing spike shoes is 12MPa. That will give you a good idea.

==Electric Current==

{{BookCat}}
In our daily life we use lot of electrical appliances like television etc., that we our able to use with the help of electricity. Have you ever tried to think of of it i.e. What is Electric Current?

Electric current is the rate of  flow of electric charge through a medium like metals. It measured in Coulombs/second which is named as Amperes. In this section you will study about the rate of flow of charge, the resistance on it, voltage and a lot related the current.

==Gravitation==

Have you ever imagined why are you landed on earth, why don't you just fly off into the space, why a ball always come back to earth after being thrown into air. You will get all your answers in this section of physics.

Its the gravitational pull of the earth that let it all happen, and not only earth but each and every particle of this universe attract each other. Newtons law of gravitation and Kepler's laws, all you will come across this section.</text>

'''BSD''', or Berkeley Software Distribution, is a UNIX operating system developed at the University of California, Berkeley. Started in 1977, it introduced many technologies still in use by operating systems today. It was the first OS of its kind to implement libraries supporting the Internet Protocol, allowing for easy read/write across a network.

Although the project died in 1995, it gave birth to multiple popular derivatives such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. --&gt;

This template creates a box with two to ten images arranged vertically or horizontally with captions for the entire box and/or for each images.

=== Usage ===
* '''align''' defaults to &quot;right&quot;
* '''direction''' defaults to &quot;horizontal&quot;
* '''header_align''' defaults to &quot;center&quot;
* '''footer_align''' defaults to &quot;left&quot;
* '''image1''' is name of first image. Similarly for '''image2''', etc.
* '''width1''' is width of first image. Similarly for '''width2''', etc.
** '''width''' overrides width1, width2, width3, etc. If you want the images to be different sizes, do not provide the width parameter.
* '''alt1''' is alternate text of first image. Similarly for '''alt2''', etc.
* '''caption1''' is caption of first image. Similarly for '''caption2''', etc.
* '''link1''' is where the first page links to. Similarly for '''link2''', etc. If not specified, image links to the image description page as usual. If specified to the empty value, the image does not link anywhere; this should be used for purely decorative images.&lt;br /&gt;'''Important''': If the image is under a free license like the GFDL or a CC license, you '''must not''' use this parameter as the terms of those licenses require the license, or a link to it, to be reproduced with the image. The image must, therefore, link to its image page. Public domain and (theoretically) fair use images are not subject to this restriction.
* '''background color''' defines the background color between the border of the box and the images.
* header, footer, background color and captions are optional.

=== Horizontal placement: matching image heights ===
: ''This trick is not required if both images have the same [[w:Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], where {{para|width}} suffices''
* Decide on a common height for the images, say 100 pixels.
* Examine the individual image pages to obtain the full resolution. For example:
** [[:File:Donkey 1 arp 750px.jpg]] shows &quot;Donkey_1_arp_750px.jpg‎ (750 × 536 pixels, file size: 125 KB, MIME type: image/jpeg)&quot;
** [[:File:Rainbow trout.png]] shows &quot;Rainbow_trout.png‎ (300 × 300 pixels, file size: 158 KB, MIME type: image/png)&quot;
* For non-square images, use these figures to construct an expression for the {{para|width''n''}} parameters, of the form:
** &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{#expr:&lt;/nowiki&gt; (''dh'' * ''ow'' / ''oh'') round 0&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* where
** ''dh'' is the desired height in pixels (100)
** ''ow'' is the original width in pixels (750 or 300)
** ''oh'' is the original height in pixels (536 or 300)
* For ''square'' images, simply set the appropriate {{para|width''n''}} to be the desired height. If all are square, only {{para|width}} needs to be set.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You really need a proper science lab and a trained presenter to do this experiment. It is more of a demonstration than a participatory exercise.

==Ingredients==
  {{multiple image 
   | header    = Images of most ingredients

   | caption1  = Tub

   | width5    = 138
  }}
  {{multiple image
   | image1    = Magnesium-products.jpg
   | caption1  = Magnesium Ribbon
   | width1    = 287
   | image2    = Scripto adjustable lighter.jpg
   | caption2  = Lighter
   | width2    = 103
  }}

*a tub which holds about 1 gallon
*water
*soap
*A beaker or test tube
*a stopper with a hole
*glass elbow and rubber tubing
*hydrochloric acid
*magnesium ribbon
*a lighter

==What to do==

*Step one: fill the tub with very soapy water
*Step two: fill the beaker or test tube about half way with hydrochloric acid
*Step three: attach the glass elbow and the hose to the stopper
*Step four: place the other end of the hose in the tub of soapy water
*Step five: add a small amount of the magnesium ribbon to the beaker and quickly cover the top with the stopper; hold the beaker so it is lower than the tub and there are no kinks in the hose
*Step six: bubbles will appear in the tub
*Step seven: pick up some bubbles with your hand and light them with the lighter; they should go up quite spectacularly without burning your hand
*Step eight: when you get tired of playing with the bubbles, you can light the ones left in the tub all at once.  FWOOSH!

==Principle==

Magnesium and hydrochloric acid react to create hydrogen gas and magnesium chloride. The chemical equation looks like this:

Mg (s) + 2HCl (aq) --&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)

Because Hydrogen gas is lighter than air, it travels up the tube and bubbles through the water. Hydrogen gas burns at a relatively low temperature and shouldn't harm your hand when you light it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Q. Point out some property which are not topological.
Q. Is mertrizability is a topological property ?

Metrizability is a topological property (see the various metrization theorems).

Also note that 'completeness' is a topological property in the sense that: A Tychonoff topological space is Cech-complete (it is a countable intersection of open sets in some (and thus every) Hausdorff compactification) if and only if there is a compatible uniformity which is complete.</text>

Description: MPEG is one of the most standard and widely used formats. Its been produced in a number of different iterations and used throughout the film industry from capture, storage to delivery.

== Background ==
The Moving Pictures Experts Group, is the fore most group on defining and implementing video standards through out the film industry. Operating since 1988 and shaping the development of the entire industry.

MPEG's can be used for all levels of use but understanding how the different formats work will help you decide which is best suited for you needs. Please read through usages to help you decided which are the best settings for you usage.

The basic premise of the Moving Picture Expert Group, is that encoding is done by a few powerful machines and decoding will be done by many weaker systems. So depending on the setting you use, it can be processor intense to encode, but should be fairly light to decode.

== FFMPEG Guide ==

== Usages ==

=== MPEG1 ===
MPEG1 is a low bit rate format, designed to be used on CD running at a rate of less than 1.5Mb/s. Comparative to MPEG2, MPEG1 will generally out perform MPEG2 at lower bit rates, though MPG4 should out perform MPEG1.

There is no audio encoder for MPEG 1 audio, although there is a decoder. For audio simply use MPEG 2 (mp2) audio as this will work with most high end encoders.

==== For a single pass mpeg1: ====

ffmpeg -i &quot;input_file&quot; -vcodec mpeg1video -acodec mp2 &quot;output_file.mpeg&quot;

==== For a two pass mpeg1 encoding: ====

ffmpeg -i &quot;input_video&quot; -pass 1 -f mpeg1video -an -passlogfile log_file &quot;output_file.mpeg&quot;

ffmpeg -i &quot;input_video&quot; -pass 2 -f mpeg1video -acodec mp2 -passlogfile log_file &quot;output_file.mpeg&quot;


==== For an optimized two pass mpeg1 encoding: ====

ffmpeg -i &quot;input_video&quot; -pass 1 -f mpeg1video -b 750000 -s 320x240 -an -passlogfile log_file &quot;output_file.mpeg&quot;

ffmpeg -i &quot;input_video&quot; -pass 2 -f mpeg1video -b 750000 -s 320x240 -acodec mp2 -ab 128000 -passlogfile log_file &quot;output_file.mpeg&quot;

=== MPEG2 ===

=== MP3 ===

=== MP4 ===

# ffmpeg -i source.avi -f psp -r 29.97 -b 768k -ar 24000 -ab 64k -s 320×240 destination.mp4

# ffmpeg -v 0 -i in.flv -y -acodec libfaac -ar 22050 -ab 64k -r 25 -vb 384000 -f mp4 -vcodec mpeg4 out.mp4

# ffmpeg -i source.mp4 -s 176×144 -vcodec h263 -r 25 -b 12200 -ab 12200 -ac 1 -ar 8000 destination.3gp

=== Universal Delivery ===
mpeg1

=== CD ===
VCD and SVCD

=== DVD ===
DVD-Video are the most used format for final delivery of footage. This section is only looking at standard DVD-Video as a delivery format.

Some useful information to know. DVD decodes tend to work up to a maximum of about 8Mb/s and a minimum of 1.5Mb/s (assuming MPEG2, MPEG1 can go smaller, though we advise you don't use it). Constant bit rate is faster to encode to but variable bit rate will give to much better size and possibly quality. Please see the section on [[FFMPEG_An_Intermediate_Guide/General#Variable vs. Constant Bit Rate|variable bit rate]].

For older DVD players you should not go above 6Mb/s, though the rule of thumb is unless its specifically asked for, 8Mb/s should work 90% of the time and buy you grandma a new DVD play.

==== Constant Bit rate DVDs ====
Best quality: 8Mb/s, 55 minutes of video

* 1 Hour: 7350Kb/s.
* 2 Hours: 4550Kb/s

(these are guide lines you may need to adjust to the length of your footage.)

You should avoid going below 4500kb/s as the quality become awful.

==== Variable Bit Rate DVDs ====


=== BLU-RAY and HDDVD ===

=== Broadcast ===
15Mb/s

=== Long Term, High Quality Storage ===
50 - 880Mb/s

=== Streaming ===

=== Interlaced Footage ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to control the way that namespace prefixes are handled in your submission.

== Method ==
We will use the '''includenamespaceprefixes''' attribute of a submission.

The XForms 1.1 specification allows the user to change the way that namespace prefixes are handled in a submitted element.

Here is an example of the use of the includenamespaceprefixes attribute to the submission element.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:submission action=&quot;http://example.com/submit&quot; 
   method=&quot;post&quot; id=&quot;submit&quot; 
   includenamespaceprefixes=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:submission action=&quot;http://example.com/submit&quot; 
   method=&quot;post&quot; includenamespaceprefixes=&quot;#default&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Form ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
    xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
    xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;
    xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
    xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;
    xmlns:task=&quot;http://www.example.com/task&quot;
    task:dummy=&quot;dummy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Test of XForms Submission Namespace Inclusion&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
            &lt;![CDATA[
            @namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
            body {font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;}
             .block-form xf|input { display: block; margin: 1ex; }
             .block-form xf|label {display: inline-block; width: 15ex; float: left; text-align: right; margin-right: 1ex; font-weight: bold;}
            ]]&gt;
        &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;xf:model&gt;
            &lt;xf:instance src=&quot;input-default-ns.xml&quot; id='save-data'/&gt;

        &lt;/xf:model&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Submit Test&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-form&quot;&gt;
           &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;instance('save-data')/task:id&quot;&gt;
               &lt;xf:label&gt;ID: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
           &lt;/xf:input&gt;
   
               &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;task:task-name&quot;&gt;
               &lt;xf:label&gt;Name: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
           &lt;/xf:input&gt;
   
               &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;task:task-description&quot;&gt;
               &lt;xf:label&gt;Description: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
           &lt;/xf:input&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;submit-std&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Without Attribute&lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:submit&gt;
        &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;submit-null&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;With Attribute Null&lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:submit&gt;
        &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;submit-default&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;With Default Namespace&lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:submit&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Instance Files ==

=== With Default Namespace ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;task xmlns=&quot;http://www.example.com/task&quot;&gt;
    &lt;task:id&gt;123&lt;/task:id&gt;
    &lt;task-name&gt;Task Name&lt;/task-name&gt;
    &lt;task-description&gt;Task Description&lt;/task-description&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== With Namespace Prefixes ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;task:task xmlns:task=&quot;http://www.example.com/task&quot;&gt;
    &lt;task:task:id&gt;123&lt;/task:id&gt;
    &lt;task:task-name&gt;Task Name&lt;/task:task-name&gt;
    &lt;task:task-description&gt;Task Description&lt;/task:task-description&gt;
&lt;/task:task&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this information age, you must have heard of Internet or its synonyms like Net, Web or Information Highway. However, you may or may not be familiar with the full potential of this tool. Even though the Internet has been around since the 1960s, it is only in the last two decades that it has become a household word. As with many other inventions, the origin can be traced to army use. The US military created it as a means of sharing information between a number of interconnected computers over a distance. The design then was rather primitive. The Internet in its modern form with various protocols like Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) came into being only in the early eighties. The creation of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee for the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 1989, has allowed the internet to be used in applications other than for sharing information. These include emails, phone, video messaging, instant messaging etc. The list is an ever expanding one, the only limit being human ingenuity. 

== Internet Usage ==
The evolution of web communities has been drastic over the decades, ranging from scientists to heavy electronic game players.  The Internet once was the ARPANET, created by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) as a result of the USSR's launch of the space satellite of Sputnik.  ARPA gave the ARPANET contract to BBN Technologies, and the physical network was built in 1969, linking four nodes: the University of California at Los Angeles, SRI (in Stanford), the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah.  In 1972, ARPA renamed &quot;DARPA&quot;, or The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  The first e-mail program was also developed in the same year.  Through the decades, the ARPANET became the DARPANET,

As of December, 2009, the total global internet audience has exceeded one billion visitors (excluding people age 14 and younger).
Worldwide, there were 1,007,730 unique visitors

I am thirtysomething female into the art of creating wikibooks. Recently, I was lucky enough to discover Emotional Freedom Techqniues. It really helped me to put things into perspective. 
Some of the books I would like to reccomend to people entering into the new thought movement for the first time:

1. Truth vs. Falsehood by David Hawkins
2. Power vs. Force by David Hawkins
3. The Teachings of Don Juan, a Yaqui Way of Life by Carlos Castaneda
4. Self Realization Worhsip by Paramahansa Yoga
5. Conversations with God by Neale David Walsh 
6. You can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay
7. Ageless Time Mind and Body by Deepak Chopra
8. The Power of Intentions by Dr. Wayne Dyer
9. Thought Vibration by Wilaim Atkinson</text>

: '''PO''' - Special stamps generated only by machines in Post Offices&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Based on, if the brain generates an impulses when working and on that the eyes see. A computer can remember that and point what kind it was. so the next time the computer could test this again for to
get the similar result. And further this is unstopable process for all kinds of thoughts.
Probably every person has own special impulses, so the computer needs the time to test the main themes and after it will read it. Also if you say something and if the brain starts to operate it, the computer can scan the impulse.
&lt;br\&gt;
2004 year.
&lt;br\&gt;
It is only theory, also some people from medicine area talk what in Russia it is under developing.

      <comment>Add voltage equation question.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Shouldn't it be 
 &lt;math&gt;v=v_s-iR_s \,&lt;/math&gt;
not 
 &lt;math&gt;v=v_s+iR_s \,&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly for the Norton's Theorem version for i.

I can't see how the voltage at that point is '''more''' that the source voltage. (fwiw, http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mastascu/eLessonsHTML/Source/Source2.html#What seems to agree with me)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to update an XML file and understand how the XQuery update process might impact the namespace of the document the next time it is viewed.

== Method ==
We will use the XQuery update statement to change the values of XML documents and note how the default output changes with respect to how the default namespaces and namespace prefixes are rendered. XQuery updates can impact how namespaces are rendered.

== Example ==

Suppose we have a task that includes a default namespace like the following XML document.

Example XML document using a default namespace.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;task xmlns=&quot;http://www.example.com/task&quot;&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;task-name&gt;Task Name&lt;/task-name&gt;
    &lt;task-description&gt;Task Description&lt;/task-description&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the following example we refer to this XML document as $doc.

Most people that want to view XML prefer to use a default namespace and not clutter the entire document with unnecessary prefixes.

Suppose we have just saved this file and we now want to add an ID value to the '''&lt;id&gt;''' element.  After we update this XML file with the following update statement we note that the serialization will change.

   update replace $doc/task:task/task:id with &lt;task:id&gt;123&lt;/task:id&gt;

The next time we view this document we see the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;task:task xmlns:task=&quot;http://www.example.com/task&quot;&gt;
    &lt;task:id&gt;123&lt;/task:id&gt;
    &lt;task:task-name&gt;Task Name&lt;/task:task-name&gt;
    &lt;task:task-description&gt;Task Description&lt;/task:task-description&gt;
&lt;/task:task&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This is known as &quot;fully qualified&quot; document where the namespace prefix of every element is fully shown.  It is technically equivalent to the prior example.   This may not be what you would like.

== Updating the Element Value, not the entire Element ==

To get around this we can just update the text() node of the id instead of
the entire id element:

   update replace $doc//task:id/text() with 123

or you can use the update/value syntax

   update value $doc//task:id with 123

Using either of these techniques will not dirty up your default namespace structures.

== Acknowledgments ==
Joe Wicentowski was kind enough to make these observations and provide samples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vocabulary==
&lt;p&gt;'''#REF!''' - An error message stating that there is an error with the formula, this can occur if you have a formula and delete one of the cells that the formula referred to. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Format Symbol''' - Symbols that are entered with numbers such as $, %, or a comma.  When you type one of those in with a number Excel will automatically assume the formatting that goes with it. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Freeze the Titles''' - Taking a row or column and having Excel display it on the screen, no matter how far down or to the right you scroll. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Date Stamp''' - Shows the date a file was created.  This is very important in Business Financial Reports. 
&lt;p&gt;'''NOW Function''' - This will always display today's date, or the date the computer holds as the system date. The date is actually stored as a number representing a day starting January 1, 1900
&lt;p&gt;'''Absolute Cell Reference''' - Keeping a cell constant when copying it.  This is done by adding $s.  $C$15 is an absolute cell reference and when you copy a formula that contains it, =$C$15 +C16, down a column the $C$15 will stay the same and the C16 will change with the row. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Relative Cell Reference''' - A cell reference that changes as the formula is copied.  In the equation =$C$15 + C16, the C16 is the relative cell reference. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Mixed Cell Reference''' - You can tell Excel to keep part of the cell reference from changing by only using one $.  C$15 and $C15 are both called mixed cell references.  In C$15 the row will stay the same but the column letter can change.  In $C15 the Column letter will stay the same but the row number can change. 
&lt;p&gt;'''IF Function''' - A condition that allows you to assign a value to a cell based on a test.  =IF(B7&gt;$B$2, $C$2, 0)
This means that if the value in cell B7 is greater than the value in Cell B2 then keep the value in cell C2.  If it is equal to or less than the value in B2 then keep the value 0.  
&lt;p&gt;'''Logical Test''' - The test in an IF statement such as B7&gt;$B$2. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Value If True''' - This is the value that is displayed if the condition tested is true.  =IF(B7&gt;$B$2, $C$2, 0) in this example it is the $C$2. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Value If False''' - This is the value that is displayed if the condition tested is false.  =IF(B7&gt;$B$2, $C$2, 0) in this example it is the 0. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Comparison Operators''' - There are six tests you can perform: 
&lt;ul&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;&lt; is the first one less than the second
&lt;li&gt;&gt; Is the first one greater than the second
&lt;li&gt;&gt;= Is the first one greater to or equal to the second
&lt;li&gt;&lt;= Is the first one less than or equal to the second
&lt;li&gt;= Are the two values equal to each other
&lt;li&gt;&lt;&gt; Are the two values NOT equal to each other
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'''Nested IF function''' - You can place one IF statement inside another IF statement.  The second if statement would be in the area for value if true, or value if false.  
&lt;p&gt;'''Chart Sheet''' - A sheet in Excel that contains only a chart
&lt;p&gt;'''Pie Chart''' - A graphical representation of part of a whole.  You would use a pie chart only if you want to show how the percentage of something is made up.  Each pie wedge shows a percentage of the whole. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Exploded Pie Chart''' - A pie chart where one or more wedges is pulled out from the rest. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Offsetting''' - The piece of the pie chart that is pulled out is called offsetting. Sometimes you only want one piece pulled out to show the area you are discussing. 
&lt;p&gt;'''What-If Analysis''' - This is sensitivity analysis, this just means that Excel will recalculate every formula and redraw every chart for any cell that you change the data in.
&lt;p&gt;'''Goal Seeking''' - If you want to find what has to happen to give your desired results in a cell you can use this function to determine the values of a cell on which the formula depends.

===Save the Workbook===
&lt;p&gt;Click the Office Button to save the workbook
&lt;p&gt;Click the Office Button - Prepare to add document properties for your name and other relevant information 
&lt;p&gt;Pick a Theme for the worksheet
===Format by Rotating Text===
&lt;p&gt;Rotate the names of the month so that they are at a 45° angle
&lt;p&gt;Click on the Row Heading 3 to select the entire row. 
&lt;p&gt;Click on the HOME tab to make it active
&lt;p&gt;Click on Alignment Group Dialog Box Launcher
&lt;p&gt;Change the Orientation to 45°
&lt;p&gt;Click OK
&lt;p&gt;[[File:Format_Cells_Orientation.jpg]]

===Create a Series with the Fill Handle===
&lt;p&gt;Click on cell B3, the month JANUARY
&lt;p&gt;Click and drag the fill handle to the right, to cell G3
&lt;p&gt;Notice that Excel automatically updates the month to the next on in the series.
&lt;p&gt;Also notice the new options button that appeared - '''Auto Fill Options Menu'''
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy Cells
&lt;li&gt;Fill Series
&lt;li&gt;Fill Formatting Only
&lt;li&gt;Fill Without Formatting
&lt;li&gt;Fill Months
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Copy and Paste===
&lt;p&gt;In Excel there are many different ways to copy and paste. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy and Paste button in the HOME tab in the CLIPBOARD group
&lt;li&gt;Right click and copy and paste
&lt;li&gt;CTRL+C to copy and CTRL+V to paste
&lt;li&gt;Another option is to cut and paste if you want to move the data
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use one of these methods to Copy the range A9:A13 to A19:A23. 
&lt;p&gt;Just like with the Fill Options Menu, there is a Paste Options menu that offers the same options.

===Insert and Delete Cells===
&lt;p&gt;You can insert a single cell, range of cells, or whole rows and columns.   
The different methods are: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on a row header and click INSERT to insert a Row
&lt;li&gt;Right click on a column header and click INSERT to insert a column
&lt;li&gt;Click on a row header and click in the HOME tab in tyhe CELLS group on INSERT
&lt;li&gt;Click on a column header and click in the HONME tab in the CELLS group on INSERT
&lt;li&gt;You can do the same for just one cell
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also delete a cell, range of cells, or whole rows and columns.  When you delete a cell you are asked if you want to shift cells up, or over.  
&lt;p&gt;Insert cell A21 and place the text Margin in the new cell A21.
&lt;p&gt;Insert cell A24 and place the text Revenue for Bonus in the new cell A24. 
&lt;P&gt;NOTE: if you delete a cell and it is used in a formula the formula result will show as REF! and you will need to fix the formula.

===Type in the What-If Assumptions Data===
&lt;p&gt;B19 = 150,000.00
&lt;p&gt;B20 = 4.5%
&lt;p&gt;B21 = 58%
&lt;p&gt;B22 = 8%
&lt;p&gt;B23 = 6.25%
&lt;p&gt;B24 = 5,250,000.00
&lt;p&gt;B25 = 16.5%

===Freeze Cells===
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you are working with a large spreadsheet it would be nice to see the column and row headings.  There is an option in Excel that allows you to Freeze rows or columns on your screen. This will allow you to still see the headings, and scroll to see the rest of the data.  
&lt;p&gt;To freeze a cell
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click in the cell that boarders the areas you want to freeze.  In this example that would be cell B4
&lt;li&gt;Click the VIEW tab
&lt;li&gt;Click the FREEZE PANES button
&lt;li&gt;Click Freeze Panes, this will freeze column A and row 1 - 3
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Display the System Date===
&lt;p&gt;When working with data it is very important to know how recent the data is.  For this reason we place the date in our table. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to cell H2
&lt;li&gt;Click the Insert Function box in the formula bar
&lt;li&gt;Select Date &amp; Time
&lt;li&gt;Click on NOW in the Select a Function box. 
&lt;li&gt;Click OK
&lt;li&gt;Right Click cell H2 
&lt;li&gt;Click on Format Cell
&lt;li&gt;Click on the Number tab
&lt;li&gt;Click on DATE
&lt;li&gt;Click on the format that you like (I will choose 10/27/09)
&lt;li&gt;Click OK
&lt;/ul&gt;

This date is actually stored asthe number of days since December 31, 1899.

===Make Reference to Cells both Absolutely and Relatively===
'''On the below formulas, make sure you determine what references are absolute and what are relative prior to using the fill handle.'''

|}
&lt;p&gt;When you enter in a formula you have three options for how the formula will interact with the cells you have referenced: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relative Cell Reference - This is what you have been working with.  When you use the fill handle the cell reference changes.  If you use the fill handle on a cell with the formula =A3+A5 and drag right the new formula would be =B3+B5.  If you use the fill handle and drag down the new formula would be =A4+A6.  Depending on what direction you drag would change either the row number or the column letter.  
&lt;li&gt;Absolute Cell Reference - Sometimes you would want the cell in the formula that you refernced to not change when you drag the fill handle.  (Like in the formulas above.) If you Take the formula for cell B5, =B4*(1-B21).  The B4 is the sales for that month.  When you drag right you would want that to change so that each column refers to the month it is in.  But the cell B21 does not have anything next to it.  So you would want that cell to be absolute.  To do this place a $ in front of the B and the 21 so it would be $B$21, or the formula would read =B4*(1-$B$21)
&lt;li&gt;Mixed Cell Reference - If you do not need to block a cell from changing references in both the column and row direction, like in this case you could just put the $ on the part that you don't want to change.  $B21 so the formula would read =B4*(1-$B21)Then the reference would always be to the B column and when you drag right the 21 would not change anyway.  
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Create Conditional IF Function Statements===
&lt;p&gt;The format of an IF statement: 
&lt;p&gt; = if (B4&gt;=$B$24,$B$19,0)
&lt;p&gt;This is read - If the contents of B4 is greater than or equal to the contents of B24 then use the value in B19, otherwise use 0.  
&lt;p&gt;or
&lt;p&gt;IF(logical_test, Value_if_True, Value_if_False)
&lt;p&gt;You can test for: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;= Equal to
&lt;li&gt;&lt; Less than
&lt;li&gt;&lt;= Less than or equal to
&lt;li&gt;&gt; Greater than
&lt;li&gt;&gt;= Greater than or equal to
&lt;li&gt;&lt;&gt; Not equal to
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Total on Non-adjacent Cells===
&lt;p&gt;Choose the cells in Column H that should have a total. If the cells are not next to one another then use CTRL. 
&lt;p&gt;Click on the AutoSum button to get totals. 

===Use the Format Painter===
The format painter works the same here as it did in Microsoft Word.  Click on a cell with the formatting you want to copy, then click on the format painter (paintbrush tool) then click on the cell you want formatted the same.

===Create a Pie Chart===
&lt;p&gt;Select B3:G3 and B16:G16
&lt;p&gt;Insert Tab
&lt;p&gt;Pie Chart - 3-D Pie
&lt;p&gt;Click on the Move Chart button in the Chart Tools - Design Tab
&lt;p&gt;Click on the NEW SHEET radio button
&lt;p&gt;Type &quot;Semiannual Financial Projector&quot;
&lt;p&gt;Click OK
&lt;p&gt;Notice the new chart tab at the bottom of the window.
&lt;p&gt;Add a chart title - &quot;Semiannual Financial Projector&quot;
&lt;p&gt;Underline it
&lt;p&gt;Turn the Legend off - From the LAYOUT tab click on LEGEND and click on NONE
&lt;p&gt;Add data labels - From the LAYOUT tab click on Data Labels - Check Category Name and Percentage
&lt;p&gt;Rotate the Chart - From the LAYOUT tab click the 3-D rotate button - Choose the degrees
&lt;p&gt;Change the Format of the Chart - Right click on the pie chart and go to Format Data Series - Explore and make sure you visit the 3-D Format to add contour, surface or material. 
&lt;p&gt;Try to change the colors of the pie wedges manually from the Format Data Series window.

===Rename and Change Color of Sheet Tabs===
&lt;p&gt;Right Click on the sheet tab and click on RENAME to change the name from SHEET 1 to &quot;SemiAnnual Financial Projection&quot;
&lt;p&gt;Right Click on the sheet tab and click on TAB COLOR to change the color of the tab, change active tabs to see the color change. 
&lt;p&gt;Click and drag a sheet tab to the right or left to change the order they are listed at the bottom. 
===Previewing===
&lt;p&gt;ALWAYS PRINT PREVIEW BEFORE YOU PRINT!!!
&lt;p&gt;Office button - print - print preview
&lt;p&gt;I use the Page Setup button to format and then I print from the preview to ensure I will get what I want.  
&lt;p&gt;From the PAGE tab you can change from landscape to portrait, and fit the document to one page. 
&lt;p&gt;From the MARGINS tab you can change the margins of the page and center horizontally and vertically.
&lt;p&gt;From the HEADER/FOOTER tab you can add either a header or a footer to the page. 
&lt;p&gt;From the SHEET tab you can set a print area, set the row or columns that will print at the top or side of every sheet, turn on gridlines for printing, print only in black and white, or print in a draft quality that takes less in.

===Printing a WorkBook===
If you have a multiple sheet workbook, you can print the entire workbook at one time.  Choose all the sheet tabs that contain data or charts, then print preview and print as normal.  In the print preview you will need to use the scroll bar to see the other pages.

===Using What-If Analysis===
&lt;p&gt;Since all of your data is linked to the What-If Assumptions section you can change your assumptions and watch the changes through out the entire workbook, chart and all. 
&lt;p&gt;Zoom your worksheet so you can see the entire data table. 
&lt;p&gt;Enter 72,000 in cell B19 - What does this change, and why?  What does it mean? 
&lt;p&gt;Enter 3.0 in cell B20 - What does this change, and why?  What does it mean? 
&lt;p&gt;Enter 15.25 in cell B25 - What does this change, and why?  What does it mean? 
&lt;p&gt;What happens in cell H16 and why?

===Goal Seeking===
&lt;p&gt;This is very useful if you know the results you want but are unsure how to get there.  This feature of Excel allows you to put in the end result and it will help calculate the dependent variables.
&lt;p&gt;click on the Virtical Split box and split the screen after column E. 
&lt;p&gt;[[File:Virtical_and_Horzontal_Split_box.jpg]]
&lt;p&gt;Adjust the right side to show column H
&lt;p&gt;Click cell H16
&lt;p&gt;Click the DATA Tab
&lt;p&gt;Click the What-If Analysis button 
&lt;p&gt;Click Goal Seek
&lt;p&gt;Fill in the box as follows: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Cell - H16

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''cons''' is both Lisp's fundamental memory object and the name of a Lisp operator. The cons, as the memory object, is a memory construct which is able to store a pair of objects, known as the [[Common Lisp/Reference/car|car]] and the [[Common Lisp/Reference/cdr|cdr]].

The cons operator offers a way to both create a cons object and also set the values. So, for example, the following command creates a cons object with the car field set to 1 and the cdr field set to 2:
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
&gt; (cons 1 2)

(1 . 2)
&lt;/source&gt;

As the cons object can also store references to other cons objects in its car and cdr fields, the cons field is also able to be used as a basic building block for a series of data structures. So, a singly linked list could be constructed with cons objects such as:
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
&gt; (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)))

(1 2 3)
&lt;/source&gt;

The previous car nested structure generates an equivalent singly linked list to the following:
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
&gt; (list 1 2 3)

(1 2 3)
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How can we use the emerging eReader platforms in Distance Learning? ==

'''Paul Acquaro (For MSTU 4022, Fall 2009)'''

The textbook deathwatch has begun, states a late summer edition of Tech and Learning (Tech &amp; Learning, 2009). Citing the Amazon Kindle, the Sony eReaders and the efforts of Google to digitize books, the author asks “Is the print textbook—that old-fashioned, heavy, expensive staple of the 20th-century classroom—soon to be a thing of the past?” (Tech &amp; Learning, 2009, p. 1).

While there is no true consensus that ereader can or will replace the textbook, there are certainly some in both higher and K-12 Education that are testing the waters. 

As of Fall 2009, several colleges are piloting projects that seek to replace textbooks with ereaders like the Kindle. Amazon.com gave out to two hundred college students Kindles with copies of their textbooks loaded digitally (eSchoolNews, 2009) and many K-12 school are also looking at supplementing and/or replacing their physical books with the ereader (Tech &amp; Learning, 2009).

While it may seem like traditional institutions are starting to embrace digital books, what possibilities are there with using ereader like the Amazon Kindle as a Distance Learning tool? Although online learning is primarily computer based, and many DL courses, much like their in-person counterparts, rely on the PDF or Word Documents, a tool like the Kindle could offer both a brief respite from the somewhat demanding computer screen (the ereader screens use eInk technology, which has resolution that is more book-like than a typical computer screen) and possibly invigorate a traditional learning medium with some modern ‘tweeks.’

The rest of this article will refer to the Kindle 2 device, which is currently being sold by Amazon.com. 


'''Reading Experience'''

According to Amazon.com, the idea of the Kindle’s design is to disappear and let the user be immersed in the text (Amazon.com, 2009). The Internet enabled device works independently from a computer, allowing texts to be downloaded directly to the device. The system allows several different eBook formats, but has some reported trouble displaying image heavy PDF files. There are several resources available to learn more about the file formats online. The site http://www.downloadsquad.com/tag/kindle/ is just one such example.

 
'''Annotation and Highlights'''

The Kindle allows users to annotate the pages of the text. Notes can be placed throughout the text and passages can be highlighted. Bookmarks can also be placed in the text. Additionally, notes and highlighted passages can be exported out as text files when the Kindle is attached to the computer via USB cable. In some studies, students have indicated that the note taking process is limited by having to use the keyboard rather than writing on the page and say the result is that they take fewer notes (eSchoolNews, 2009). 


'''Internet'''

Kindle’s Internet connection gives it some interesting functionality. Subscriptions to magazines and ‘professional’ blogs can be purchased and books can be searched and downloaded directly to the Kindle, including a vast number of public domain works. Public libraries are even beginning to offer digital lending (Rich, 2009).

In addition, the current 2009 edition of the Kindle includes a limited but functional mobile Internet browser. An exercise included in this chapter will look at how a course facilitator (though it could easily be turned around to the students) can create custom information feeds that are filtered for specific uses and audiences.


'''Universal Design'''

Interestingly, the eReader has roots in Universal Design for Learning. UDL is a concept that is often applied to assistive technologies, such as screen readers for computers. The concepts of UDL goes far beyond reading texts, rather it tries to encompass all types of learning:
 
UDL encompasses three principles. First, to support recognition-based learning, you need to provide multiple methods of presentation. Second, to support strategic learning, you need to provide multiple, flexible methods of expression and apprenticeship. Third, to support affective learning, you need to provide multiple, flexible methods of engagement. (eWeek, 2003, pg.2)

Digital text in the Kindle is a perfect example of Universal Design for Learning. The device, while providing a typical visual reading experience, can also offer several different text sizes for users with lower vision. In addition, the Kindle offers a text to speech option that can read books aloud to users.  This option makes a tool like the Kindle a versatile tool for learners with disabilities such a low vision and dyslexia (eWeek, 2003). 


'''Green?'''

In addition, eReaders have the added benefit of providing a way of accessing digital texts at any times, which are usually lower cost than hard copies (of course there is an initial investment on the hardware). There is also a &quot;green&quot; angle - being that there is no paper and being used to print each copy of the book that is sold and no physical shipping needed.


'''Replacing the textbook'''

The Obama administration is considering a push for eBook readers in US schools (Prabhu, 2009). Though there is an upfront cost to buy the technology, some experts forecast that over the course of a few years, schools could save approximately $500 million annually on purchasing text books. 

While such plans have their detractors, ereader technology is growing and students may come to expect that their schools and education to harness similar technology to what they experience outside the classroom (Prensky, 2008)


'''Harnessing the Kindle…'''

A main advantage of a Kindle is its ability to offer access to the books in a course in a convenient to carry, simple to access and easy to read format. However, the Kindle's access (now international) to the Internet is an exceptionally useful resource for educators.

Though the Kindle has access to a multitude of information, books, blogs, wikipedia, dictionaries, etc. it also can provide a very focused reading environment. As Evans points out, &quot;The vast amount of information on the internet coupled with its accessibility for any user can be overwhelming&quot; (2008, p. 25).  Evan advocates the use of RSS feeds to help weed through all of the content that is available online at any given moment. He proposes several uses of RSS feeds for educators, professional development, time saving, up-to-the-minute content specific feeds in your teaching area, and for the kids, information coming from contrasting sources (Evans, 2008). 
 
Via the Kindle, students have access to web sites, Wikipedia, Google, news sources, making the Kindle a powerful research tool. In addition, course facilitators can take advantage of this to offer students specific information or tailored information feeds.

Another Internet tool that has great potential for education is the blog. Blog systems such as “Blogger.com” offer educators a way to easily publish to the web. Educational technology expert Alan November (2008, pg 29) writes “Blogging represents one of many tools that pioneering teachers are using to empower students to take more responsibility of managing their own work and adding value to the world.” 

Using a blog, in addition to RSS feeds and the downloadable textbook content starts opening up new possibilities for the Kindle as an distance learning tool.

The following are two possible ways for educators to harness the distance learning capabilities of the Kindle. 


''1. RSS feeds with Yahoo Pipes''

Keeping in consideration some of possibilities that Evan’s mentions, a facilitator could develop a set of RSS feeds and then create an online aggregator to be bookmarked in Kindle's browser.

Yahoo Pipes is a Web 2.0 tool that allows users to pull various information sources together to create custom feeds of information. As the website for the tool explains, Pipes allows the user to “rewire” the web.

The following is a high level discussion of using the tools for an educational outcome, technical how-to information can be found at http://pipes.yahoo.com.

The facilitator can start a new pipe by adding several different pre-determined RSS feeds. They then add filters, perhaps filtering out news items that only pertain to “ereaders” or “ebooks”. The resulting “pipe” of information can then be published out to the web. This published “pipe” can be given a simple URL address (like http://yahoo.pipes.com/pipename), visiting this pipe will also reveal an option that turns the “pipe” information feed into a RSS feed. 

The resulting web address of the feed can be rather long and unmemorable (usually a long string of random text and numbers), therefore it is recommended that the address be fed into a URL shortener like “bit.ly” (http://bit.lu) and the resulting address can be given to students to add to their Kindle web browser bookmarks. 

Using this personalized “pipe”, now converted to an RSS feed, students can receive up-to date information that has been chosen by the facilitator for their study.

''2. Blogs'' 

In addition to being able to create news feeds, the facilitator could also use a blog sites like “blogger.com” to communicate with their students. Blog entries, via Kindle’s browser, work similarly to RSS feeds, but can contain more personalized content than an RSS feed from another source. In addition, personal blogs RSS feeds can be added to new or existing pipe.

Perhaps more interestingly, students can create their own blogs, and use “pipes” and RSS feeds to share and read each others blogs. As Alan November (2008, pg 30) states, blogging is a shift if control from the teacher to the students:

The audience moves from teacher and class to the world. Teachers are no longer the sole or even the primary arbitrator of student work. It is even possible that teachers do not have to work as hard to motivate traditionally failing students or to set much higher expectations for excelling students. (November 2008, pg 30)

Students can even blog from Kindle, entering their reviews of books, articles, or chapters that they have read. Together, they can create a shared source of 'inspiration' and knowledge sharing in a course.


'''Conclusion'''

The Kindle, and eReaders in general, offer some new possibilities for Distance Learning. The distinct advantage of an eReader over a laptop or a netbook for a learner is in its attractive and easy to read eInk screens. The Kindle’s access to new texts via the Internet, as well as its ability to access the Internet opens up many possibilities for distance learning and training, especially when used with other web based tools such as RSS feeds and blogs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Stories=

== Novels==

It's delightful to read a novel. What is it? A novel, if you check the dictionary, is a story long enough to fill a complete a book, in which the characters and events are usually imaginary.

===Detective Novels===

A detective novel is a novel that focuses on crime by a brilliant detective. It usually employs elements of mystery and suspense.  


Agatha Christie's ''Murder on the Orient Express'' is a good example.

===Historical Novels===

A historical novel is a novel where fictional characters are created; they take part in actual historical events and interact with real people from the past.

James Fenimore Cooper's ''Last of the Mohicans'' is a good example.

===Romantic Novels===



=== Fantasy Novels===

A fantasy novel is a story that is disengaged from reality. Often such novels are set in nonexistent worlds, such as under the earth, in a fairyland, on the moon, etc. The characters are often something other than human or include nonhuman characters. 
 
J. R. R. Tolkien's ''The Hobbit''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pedagogical Principles Underpinning the Teaching of Creative Writing in the EFL Classroom==

Henry Widdowson mentioned two benefits of ESL poetry: awareness and ability. 

'''*Benefits'''

This is one example of the benefits. A survey recent conducted found that mini saga writing promoted students' thinking skills (creativity and critical thinking skills). The fact that a mini saga required them to 'wrap it up' in 50 words encouaged/forced them to be careful about their language use i.e. the length of sentences and punctuation use.

Mini saga writing encourages self-editing behavior. Students have to read and reread what they have written in order to make the 50 word mini sagas.

'''*Disadvantages'''

Creative writing may have some advantages for some people. It sometimes involves the use of some 'irrational matters' This may hinder the use of one's rationality and scientificity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Traditionally, the teaching of writing in the EFL context has focussed on expository (non-fiction) writing. &lt;br&gt;

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in encouraging students to write more creative kinds of text, such as poems. &lt;br&gt;

It is possible to do creative writing even in the EFL classroom, and it has been shown to develop all language skills, to increase self-esteem and confidence, and thereby to foster motivation to go further in exploring the language.

It is educationally valuable because it opens up the imagination of learners. And it has positive spin-off value for more factual kinds of writing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a professional setting, computers in this day and age record and keep track of everything.  Mostly in larger companies, when audits are performed, they are able to see what e-mails you have sent other co-workers or any other person through your business e-mail.  Because of this, privacy is non-existent on what can't be seen by many others.  If you are sending out e-mails that may be inappropriate, whether they are humourous, romantic, or personal, it may best be left to your personal PC.  Companies can and will fire people over e-mails that have been sent out.
Emails also can be used against you if you are untruthful about business and put it in writing in emails, it can be discovered and come back to frame you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Networking sites such as Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter are a great way to connect and keep in touch with your friends, but it can also be a very easy way to leak unwanted information to a lot of people quickly.  A waitor was recently fired from a high-end restaurant because he tweeted about a celebrity and his bosses learned of the tweet and immediately dismissed him.  Facebook and Myspace are a little more intrusive with the feature of pictures.  Friends can tag you in pictures and these pictures can go up and stay up with an employer immediately seeing it before you can un-tag them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Perhaps the most terrifying digital danger is that of someone obtaining your personal information.  In a day and age where it seems the internet can offer any information possible, it is almost easy to have your identity stolen.  Personal information such as credit card and social security numbers are almost considered a common threat in the digital world.  Another major concern is that of [[../Online Predators|online predators]].  They are seemingly everywhere and anywhere they can possibly target underage children.  They lie about their age and identity in an effort to gain trust from children and then try to meet them and take advantage of them.  In this world of being so networked and everyone is so accessible, it is scary to think that there are a lot of people who you would never like to come in contact with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Online predators are one of the biggest digital dangers.  They stalk and target users online hoping to take advantage of them in some way.  They usually work alone and engage in illegal activities.  The worst part about an online predator is you never know who it is.  It could be your next door neighbor or your teacher.  Many measures have been made trying to prevent these predators from being able to access everyday users.  Encrypted pages and passwords help deter predators from accessing accounts and personal information.  But as far as kids meeting these predators in chat rooms, facebook, etc., it is up to parents to monitor their kids computer use and to talk to them about these type of people so they can alert their parents immediately if something comes up.

==Example==

The following example&lt;ref&gt;[http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/clos-tutorial/index.html Fundamentals of CLOS by Nick Levine, Ravenbrook Limited, 2003-07-15 ]&lt;/ref&gt; declares a Lisp structure with the symbol ''point'' and three slots referenced by the symbols ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''. Here constructor is named ''make-point''.

Let us assume, although that our doctrine is considerably skewed as this would lead to the author’s brainwaves having a couple of screws loose. In that being that the order of progression is incorrect and that I have only extrapolated from causality violation involving a rectilinear mass-less energy form of said distance and applied it to normal causality (cause and effect) situations where relativistic effects are considerably negligible even in situations of walking and resting.


That’s how energy becomes established to grow in time in the order described - from the future to present is incorrect. That order of establishment of energy in time as it progresses from position
to position, does not occur in the now, that energy is not established in coming from &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past into &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; present by coming to &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; future to &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; present. 

Which, by all accounts would make absolutely perfect sense. But rather by classical interpretations and reasons of thought that energy in being established in time, transpires by growing from &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past to &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; present and that the future remains uncertain. Prediction has no bearing here. Then if this is assumed as absolute for nominal cause and effect situations involving all types of experimental bodies that incorporate energy to work and accomplish things - then of a surety I am wrong. And I admit it plain and simple.

But it still leaves our discoveries unaltered, the past present and future are still interdependent to create the now-to evolve limits for energies incorporated in the now by the now. Also whenever energy does become established in whatever degree, in situations where causality (RPS) is not reciprocal, that the now is responsible for the constraints for/of energy being prohibited to the relations of positions (that is they are created by them) which are the degrees of freedom created by definition.

The conclusion where energy then would not be generated from the past - but instead is always in the now, or that it comes from the past only to the present and that in so doing the future does not lead to the present. Hence on one side of the fence we have the modernists who argue that the past leads to the present, while on the other side you have me and my discoveries and these writings. It appears then that we have a double standard resulting in a disagreement, which can be argued as uncomplimentary. However before everyone laughs and walks away, let’s take a closer look at this two-sided coin with the use of an imaginary time traversion machine.


And let us assume that in a straightaway manner, we transcend time to the same place back in time to approximately 1 hour beforehand. Upon emerging into &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past at the same spot we check our surroundings and realize we are indeed in &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past of 1 hour before initiating the event to go back. (We are outdoors of course). Now we desire to return to the present from the past in which we are in-in the now, currently. To return via our machine from the past to the present- we must now journey to the future from the past of which we currently reside in.


When we travel (if you can call it that) to the present from the past we are, in essence traveling also from the past to the present, by travel from the past to the future and the future leads back to the present from which we left. While inversely, we would travel from the now from the present.

While also we would from &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; future to &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past. And we emerge into the past it becomes the now.

Thus both interpretations are correct and neither is wrong! Therefore the future does lead to the present while also the past leads to the present. 

Now this might appear a tad perplexing but the differentiation comes between leaving and arriving. 

While it can be stated that the past leads to the future-it does, provided infinite travel in it is exercised. Reversed toward the Big Bang. And it does not matter whether that travel through time is reciprocal or in a straight-line. The past leads to the now and the future leads to the present. 

Confused? 

If you are re-read again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Quantum Nanotechnology==
the outset of actually causing time travel with particles these discoveries may shock the entire world. However we are not finished just yet because the formula is not complete and it needs to be furthered to be favorable Aleodelogically. This is to mean that when Aleodelogically done, the energy arrives in &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past it arrives before it left. Initially this was the assumption I made early on in my research. 

Though I had previously devised Aleodeology (and named it) in many of my writings, I did not fully grasp how it could be done until I came across this particular information, which I am sharing with the entire world. 

What needs to transpire now is how to do it to the particle. Because the spin of the particle is position-less and any point indicating position on the outer circumference is an imaginary reference point measures the RPS of the particle dependent on the velocity of light about the distance of the circumference. Thus the angular velocity of the light is dependent on the distance of the circumference.

[[File:Reveloutions_per_second_Image30.png|thumb|300px|'''The Value of Revolutions''']]

The reference point on the radius is imaginary and in no case can depict actual position. If the reference point is relocated anywhere else along the circumference there is no difference in RPS.


[[File:Moving_the_rps_Image31.png|thumb|300px|'''Moving the Revolutions''']]


Therefore at every reference point RPS is still the same and this tells us that arriving and leaving in the now is transpiring at every position indicated by the reference point. Thus at all imaginary
positions on the outer circumference must the slow-down be. Generally speaking a sub-division in the RPS in arriving in the now to leaving. 

The slow-down can be done magnetically, electrically or
with other forces involving light rings and Potassium Di-hydrogen Phosphate Crystals (KDP). Once a slow-down from &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; now is induced to create a position in THE past it can then arrive in &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past before leaving. Thus accomplished it is assumed as being in &lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt; past in the same position. Now it can be done in a different position or degree of freedom. The time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the same it can move in all possible df without any prohibition from any other df whatsoever. It can even be
spun in multiple df. 

We can even cause it to travel faster than light and arrive in t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at point &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; from point &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; without any troubles. Taking this to the biological level and to matter control is to deal with atoms. Atoms constitute molecules. Similar to molecular manufacturing Quantum manufacturing consists of the rearrangement of particles constituting atoms through Aleodeology to rearrange the basic building blocks of the chemicals involved. Initially, the process is, understandably applicable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Transportation==

Can a single atom compose an entire ship for interplanetary travel? The answer thanks to Aleodeology applied to atoms, is yes. Assume we have a single atom or groups of atoms.

[[File:Groups_example_Image32.png|thumb|300px|'''Group of Atoms Example''']]

The particles of the atom are affected via Aleodelogic techniques and can exits in all diverse outcomes at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:Diverse_outcomes_Image33.png|thumb|300px|'''Outcomes by Aleodeology''']]


Done properly it can take up so many positions it can actually form the structure for a craft – one
that can support life oxygen and travel faster than light Aleodelogically.

Altogether the craft can be flown at incredible speeds repair damage, from any collisions with particles it may encounter while in FTL mode and even induce simulated Gravity. This “craft” can assume any feasible shape and alchemical structure possess food processors add infinitum and caress the inner reaches of imagination.

==Occupants==

Occupants (people or organisms) may not travel independently of the craft. They to must be temporarily permeated with the craft until arrival at destination. 

Then reconstituted.

The reason is quite simple unless you and any objects surrounding you want to be destroyed.

==Various Spin-off Transports==

Predictably with such an ability to transport to distant places there are going to arise transport systems that emulate those from popular science fiction television shows and I am sure that I am going to get lectured on this area since so many authorities in these areas have either debunked the possibility of such transports from being a whimsical fantasy or too far into the future to even consider currently. However with Quantum Nanotechnology and Aleodeology that dream and it’s realization could become a reality within the next hundred years instead of the ongoing search for answers to FTL &lt;i&gt;by energy&lt;/i&gt; which results in fruitless research efforts. 

A plausible suggestion since it may come to pass one day that our own sun may go nova. Just where would we go to at such a time, and how would Earth be evacuated? It will be a necessity to eventually, just as cars have become a necessity. But such cool transport systems do not make slower modes of transport obsolete unless those modes of transport are immaterial in light of the new transport system by

*popular consensus. 

Eliminating the need to land a ship and having replaced that with a transport system that avoids this is of course a brilliant idea-it’s real name however is called teleportation. Obviously we have extrapolated these ideas from automation and certain themes from fictitious depictions.

*From sci-fi comes the most popular of these … our friendly space-crew from the 60’s. Universal owns the rights to the fan-based show and from time to time they produce new versions of this show. However the techno-feasible concepts behind them extended far beyond T.V. fantasy of possible life out there, The impact of the show resulted in far reaching implications that went well beyond the fantastical aspects of outer space life in the future and seared the status-quo of outer space life and it’s military operations into the minds of scientists, laymen, theorists and enthusiasts the world over.


But what have you in the face of a malevolent race bent on evil intentions and that in their possession having highly advanced technology to boot? Perhaps even advanced by millions of
years? Such transport systems entail Quantum Nanotechnology and details Aleodeology. 

At this point in this book I am not able to compile the proper methods to execute such a system, however it will be necessary to create them in positions-less travel in the craft/ship to be designed otherwise the inner walls will have to do the job instead. I am sorry to lift your hopes up on this particular subject but more time is needed to detail the schematics of it so that even a kitten will come out unscathed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Distance Learning as a Testing Tool for K-12 Education =
In general [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_education Distance Learning] (DL) is a tool used by educators to facilitate different areas of education.  An area that most distance learning environments have to address is the effective evalation of students.  Distance Learning technology provides unconventional means of evaluating by testing, quizing, and homework assignments.  There are no paper quizes, scantrons, or in-person proctors.  Usually   There are strong advantages such as efficiency and accuracy in evaluation but there are also clear disadvantages such as cheating, limiting responses, and inequal computer literacy of students.

== Background ==
Although K-12 environments are starting to show more integration of DL into curricula, post secondary institutions use DL more frequently.  Evaluation students with DL is a cautious trend for most institutions and for good reason (see disadvantages below).  However when implemented correctly it can be a very useful tool.

The term evaluating covers test taking, homework assignments similar to tests, and more broadly, any other means of recieving measurable feedback of the student's progress.

Evaluating a students progress in the K-12 environment is becoming a more and more daunting task cosidering the amount of students in classrooms.  Statistics show many schools suffering from overcrowding classrooms with ratios as high as 40 for students to teachers.  The great advantages of efficient testing is alluring to educators to switch over to homework completed and graded via DL however online courses have had difficulty controlling cheating in quizzes, tests, or examinations because of the lack of teacher control. In a classroom situation a teacher can monitor students and visually uphold a level of integrity consistent with an institution's reputation. However, with distance education the student can be removed from supervision completely. Some schools address integrity issues concerning testing by requiring students to take examinations in a controlled setting.[23]

Assignments have adapted by becoming larger, longer, and more thorough so as to test for knowledge by forcing the student to research the subject and prove they have done the work. Quizzes are a popular form of testing knowledge and many courses go by the honor system regarding cheating. Even if the student is checking questions in the textbook or online, there may be an enforced time limit or the quiz may be worth so little in the overall mark that it becomes inconsequential. Exams and bigger tests may be harder to regulate.

Used in combination with invigilators, a pre-arranged supervisor trusted with overseeing big tests and examinations may be used to increase security. Many Midterms and Final examinations are held at a common location so that professors can supervise directly. When the Internet became a popular medium for distance education many websites were founded offering secure exam software and packages to help professors manage their students more effectively.


== Existing Programs and Means of Implementation ==
=== K-12 Distance Learning Programs ===
Over a million children, teenagers, and adults are currently participating in some type of online K-12 schooling. Online schooling offers options and flexibility for families who want alternatives to traditional brick-and-mortar classroom learning, or for those with difficult schedules, or extenuating circumstances, or for returning adults.  Students can use online schooling to make up missed credits, repeat courses, take enrichment classes, or earn an accredited high school diploma through the internet.  Below are a list of just a few schools with grade level.
**Abbington High School (Grades 1 and Up Only)
**Alger Learning Center and Independence High School
**Ariel Christian Academy (Grades 3 and Up Only)
**Plano Home School Academy (Grades 4 and Up Only) 
**Red Oak Academy 
**Regina Coeli Academy (Grade 5 and Up Only) 
**Seton Home Study School 
**Southeast Atlantic Academy 
**St. Thomas Aquinas Academy 
**Summit Christian Academy (Grades 3 and Up Only) 
**Texas Tech University Independent School District 
**University of Missouri - Columbia High School (Grades 2 and Up Only) 

These schools usually have a &quot;course portal&quot; or &quot;learning management system&quot; (LMS) where the virtual classroom takes place.  This is very similar to many learning management systems colleges use to supplement courses.  Documents are retrieved through the LMS, discussion boards are held, grades are recorded, and in particular it is where testing is done and homework assignments are submitted.

Below are screenshot examples of the testing environment of various LMS sites.  The interface depends on the LMS platform used, which tool of the LMS is used, and the instructor's specific configuration of the evaluation.

*From a student's perspective

**[http://www.aleks.com/homeschool/Master-Account_Quiz-Results.jpg, see example of quiz results]
*From an Instructor's perspective
**[http://www.rdctools.com/QMMQuizBuilder.png see example of building a quiz]
**[http://jolt.merlot.org/vol3no3/cooper4.jpg see example of viewing class results]

Below are a few popular learnming management systems all of which include some form of evaluation tool for instructors.

=== SharePointLMS ===
More popular for being an evalation heavy LMS is Microsoft's [http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/Pages/Default.aspx SharePointLMS].  Build-in authoring tools - quiz maker and Question Pool, which allows teacher not just create quizzes, but to keep a Pool of questions for future use in quizzes or exams.  GradeBook to record the grades of the students and issue course certificates if applicable.  Course Statistics, each course has a statistical report showing information such as the most active users, which areas / tools are used in the course. This can be filtered down to an individual student.  SharePointLMS comes with a build in Blackboard converter enabling users of Blackboard to reuse their existing course materials.

=== WebCT ===
WebCT now owned by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_Inc. Blackboard] is used by many colleges with 10 millions students in 20 countries allows an instructor to customize tools to supplement classroom instruction.  A quiz tool is used to asses students which is flexible in the format type of question and responses (multiple choice, essay question, fill-in-the-blank).

=== eFront ===
[http://www.efrontlearning.net/ eFront] is designed to help create online courses with opportunities for rich interaction. eFront comes with a distinctive icon-based user interface that is intuitive to use. The platform offers a wide range of features from content creation, test builder, project management, extended statistics, internal messaging system, forum, chat, surveys and more. Open source software allows the user, with some knowledge of computer programming, to create customize tests and assessment tools.  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBH13ZY1imE See video preview.]
 
=== Post Secondary Institutions with K-12 Distance Learning Programs ===
While some K-12 institutions have distance learning in place, it was the higher education community that made the greatest advancements in terms of presence, technology, design, and offerings. One popular school which offers K-12 distance learning education is [http://www.depts.ttu.edu/distancelearning/ Texas Tech University].  The school is accredited within their own school district and therefore standards (Texas Tech University Independent School District).

There are many others similar to Texas Tech, some which are affiliated with colleges and universities and some which are independent institutions.  Most have LMS software such as the above examples in place.

== Going Beyond Regular Testing ==

Because DL testing tools are inherent of computer testing technology, it possess similar attributes and possibilities.

=== Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) ===
A method for administering tests that adapts to the examinee's ability level. For this reason, it has also been called tailored testing.  CAT successively selects questions so as to maximize the precision of the exam based on what is known about the examinee from previous questions.[1] From the examinee's perspective, the difficulty of the exam seems to tailor itself to his or her level of ability. For example, if an examinee performs well on an item of intermediate difficulty, he will then be presented with a more difficult question. Or, if he performed poorly, he would be presented with a simpler question. Compared to static multiple choice tests that nearly everyone has experienced, with a fixed set of items administered to all examinees, computer-adaptive tests require fewer test items to arrive at equally accurate scores.[1] (Of course, there is nothing about the CAT methodology that requires the items to be multiple-choice; but just as most exams are multiple-choice, most CAT exams also use this format.)  Adaptive tests can provide uniformly precise scores for most test-takers.[2] In contrast, standard fixed tests almost always provide the best precision for test-takers of medium ability and increasingly poorer precision for test-takers with more extreme test scores.

An adaptive test can typically be shortened by 50% and still maintain a higher level of precision than a fixed version.[1] This translates into a time savings for the test-taker. Test-takers do not waste their time attempting items that are too hard or trivially easy. Additionally, the testing organization benefits from the time savings; the cost of examinee seat time is substantially reduced. However, because the development of a CAT involves much more expense than a standard fixed-form test, a large population is necessary for a CAT testing program to be financially fruitful.

Adaptive testing, depending on the item selection algorithm, may reduce exposure of some items because examinees typically receive different sets of items rather than the whole population being administered a single set. However, it may increase the exposure of others (namely the medium or medium/easy items presented to most examinees at the beginning of the test).[2]  Although not prevailent in LMS software yet, CAT algorithim could be easily migrated to LMS platforms.

=== Plagerism Detection ===
Essay questions on examinations, particularly if take-home-exams, are subjected to the possibility of plagerism.  Plagiarism detection is the process of locating instances of plagiarism within a work or document. The widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet has made it easier to plagiarize the work of others. Most cases of plagiarism are found in academia, where documents are typically essays or reports. However, plagiarism can be found in virtually any field, including scientific papers, art designs, and source code.

Detection can be either manual or computer-assisted. Manual detection requires substantial effort and excellent memory, and is impractical in cases where too many documents must be compared, or original documents are not available for comparison. Computer-assisted detection allows vast collections of documents to be compared to each other, making successful detection much more likely.  LMS programs sometimes have tools that automatically run software to detect plagerism.

See more about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism_detection Plagerism Detection]

=== Testing from a Database ===
Administering a test comprised of multiple questions, whether it be multiple choice, essay, or fill-in-the blank, a computer can easily generate many permutations of questions to make an exam.  The questions are stored on a database and the computer draws questions from it.  Because many exams are possible, a LMS program can generate many tests for students to practice or generate different tests to deter students from cheating.

== Cost and Other Factors to Consider ==
Usually testing with Distance Learning platforms require the ownership of the entire platform as it is &quot;hosted&quot; by the platform.  The cost of various LMS platforms can range from free applications such as [http://moodle.org/ Moodle] (a popular opensource user friendly LMS) to costly programs such as WebCT.  Cost of such platforms being dependent mostly on traffic and amount of users ranging $50,000 to $125,000 for some programs.

The cost of ownership take into account other factors to run the site such as the site administrator(s), training for staff to use, if needed computer hardware, etc.  Which mean free LMS programs could have significant cost of ownership if it serves a large community with a lot of overhead.

Various articles on LMS platforms can be found [http://www.elearnity.com/EKCLoad.htm?load=categorylist?openForm&amp;Target=LMS here] which describe other concepts such as the Return on Investment, Human Capital and LMS, and Market Shares of Vendors (which play a large role on cost).

== Conclusion ==
Ultimately for K-12 environments it is up to technology administrators, shool staff, district administrators to decide whether to use distance learning and how to use it in their programs.  Although most LMS platforms are similar, finding the best fit platform is also important to best serve the needs of the users.  Similarly using distance learning for student evaluation purposes needs careful consideration.  The people who make these decisions have to keep in mind that LMS platforms and its testing tools need to be considered as mutually dependent entitites.  In summary below are advantages and disadvantages of using distance learning as a testing tool.

=== Advantages ===
#Efficient grading - Most promising of testing with any computer systems is the ability to test a large number of test takers
#Accurate - Errors made in correcting exams by hand are eliminated
#Instant results and statistics - Results can be returned to students for instant feedback due to low turnaround time of grading.  Statistics can be generated for students to view where they are at or for a teacher to identify trouble areas ina subject.
#Mobility - Inherit of DL is the flexibility of when and where a student can be evaluated.
#Mobile medium - Aside from reducing paperwork, the evaluation and its results are accessible from anywhere anytime.  This may prove useful in a parent-teacher meeting.
#Flexible testing - Computer based tests have the ability to administer a test and its questions.  Adaptive testing (similar to the GREs) are useful in honing in on a students score more accurately and quickly.  Many different versions of the same test can be created by a computer.  Responses can be timed.
#Computer literacy - An indirect result of using the computer as a learning tool facilitates computer literacy.

=== Disadvantages ===
#Cheating - Lack of proctering during evaluations may open the door for some to use illegal resources, especially the internet, to respond.  A deterent by some platforms is to have the computer create different versions of the same test.
#Limiting Responses - Some DL platforms limit the way a user can provide a response (i.e. multiple choice vs. essay response).  All DL platforms will never achieve the same level of fliexibility that a hand written medium can.  This limits freedom of communication by the user.
#Computer literacy and equality - Students may not have equal access to a computer with internet access and those that do are not all equally proficient in computer literacy.  Those that are more literate can navigate the site and its exam better than those who aren't.  The less able have much at stake because of the grading aspect of an evaluation.  How well the evaluation is made is also dependent on the instructor's knowledge of the software.  For example if a teacher programs a test to register a correct answer for only responses that match exactly how she typed in a word with all lowercase letters, a student typing in the same word with the first letter capitalized will be marked incorrect.
#Cost - For secondary schools, distance learning is still rarely used and therefore considered by many school districts as a luxury rather than necessity.  High schools unlike colleges have a difficult time budgeting distance learning proposals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Variables are names that refer to values. 
In MUMPS, there are are two kinds of variables, &quot;global variables&quot; and &quot;local variables&quot;. 

* The first kind of MUMPS variables is called a &quot;global&quot; variable. These variables store information in a similar way to DISK memory in a computer.  When the computer is shut down, the disk information is still saved. MUMPS global variables are persistent, and available after a MUMPS JOB is HALTed. These variables are persistent, and permanent until they are KILLed. They can be explicitly erased by the KILL command. These global variabless are process-public, and accessible from any JOB on the system at any time and can be changed by any JOB at any time even though they are actually stored on disk.  These global variables are available from any subroutine, and there is only one shared copy available to every subroutine. These MUMPS global variables are not replicated in other programming languages.  In other langauges, information that persists over time is not as accessible as global variables, as it is stored in a database, and requires a different way of access.

* The second kind of MUMPS variable is called a &quot;local&quot; variable. These variables store information in a similar way to RAM memory in a computer.  When the computer is shut down, the memory is erased. MUMPS local variables are erased when a MUMPS JOB is HALTed. These variables are temporary, only existing as long as a [[MUMPS Programming/jobs| JOB]]. They can be explicitly erased by the KILL command. These variables are also private to a JOB, so that only the subroutines in that JOB can view them. These local variables are available in every subroutine unless a NEWed local variable exists that hides their name. Other programming languages refer to this type of variable as &quot;globals&quot;, because they are visible to any part of the program that is currently running. This name is inappropriate in MUMPS, because in contrast to other languages, MUMPS global variables are variables that have a higher visibility than the &quot;global&quot; variables used in other languages.

* Since all MUMPS local variables are temporary and local to a JOB, there are times that a program needs to use a variable name that has already been used to refer to its own variables.  The NEW command allows any already existing local variables to be hidden and a new variable name to be made available.  These NEWed local variables have the same properties as other local variables, but are only visible to a particular subroutine and all subroutines that are called from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Tokens==

A Standard ML program consists of a sequence of &quot;tokens&quot;; these may be thought of as the &quot;words&quot; of the language. Some of the most common token types are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! token type !! examples
|-
| special constants || &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;~5.6&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;&quot;string&quot;&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;#&quot;c&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| alphanumeric identifiers || &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mod&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| symbolic identifiers || &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| keywords || &lt;code&gt;val&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
|}

==Arithmetic expressions==

Arithmetic expressions are similar to those in many other languages:

 3 + 4
 3.0 / 4.0
 (2 - 3) * 6

However, a few points bear note:

* Unary negation is expressed using the tilde &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; rather than the hyphen &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;; the latter is used only for binary subtraction. For example, three minus negative-two is written &lt;tt&gt;3 - ~2&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;3 - ~ 2&lt;/tt&gt;.
* Though the operators are &quot;overloaded&quot; to support multiple numeric types — for example, both &lt;tt&gt;3 + 4&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;3.0 + 4.0&lt;/tt&gt; are valid (the former having type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, the latter type &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;) — there is no implicit promotion between types. Therefore, an expression such as &lt;tt&gt;3 + 4.0&lt;/tt&gt; is not valid; one must write either &lt;tt&gt;3.0 + 4.0&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;real 3 + 4.0&lt;/tt&gt; (using the basis function &lt;tt&gt;real&lt;/tt&gt; to convert &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;3.0&lt;/tt&gt;).
* Integer division is expressed using the special operator &lt;tt&gt;div&lt;/tt&gt; rather than the solidus &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt;; the latter is used only for real-number division. (And since there is no implicit promotion between types, an expression such as &lt;tt&gt;3 / 4&lt;/tt&gt; is not valid; one must write either &lt;tt&gt;3.0 / 4.0&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;real 3 / real 4&lt;/tt&gt;.) There is also a modulus operator &lt;tt&gt;mod&lt;/tt&gt;; for example, seventeen divided by five is three-remainder-two, so &lt;tt&gt;17 div 5&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;17 mod 5&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;. (More generally, if ''q'' is a positive integer, then &lt;tt&gt;''d'' = ''p'' div ''q''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''m'' = ''p'' mod ''q''&lt;/tt&gt; are integers such that &lt;tt&gt;''p'' = ''d'' * ''q'' + ''m''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;''m'' &gt;= 0&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;''m'' &lt; ''q''&lt;/tt&gt;. If ''q'' is a negative integer, then &lt;tt&gt;''p'' = ''d'' * ''q'' + ''m''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;''m'' &lt;= 0&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;''m'' &gt; ''q''&lt;/tt&gt;.)

==Function calls==

Once a function has been declared:

 '''fun''' triple n = 3 * n

it is called simply by following the function-name with an argument:

 '''val''' twelve = triple 4

In the general case, parentheses are not necessary, but they are frequently necessary for grouping. Also, as we saw in the chapter on types, tuples are constructed using parentheses, and it is not uncommon to construct a tuple as a function argument:

 '''fun''' diff (a, b) = a - b
 '''val''' six = diff (9, 3)

Function calls have very high precedence, higher than any infix operator; so, &lt;code&gt;triple 4 div 5&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;code&gt;(3 * 4) div 5&lt;/code&gt;, which is 2, rather than &lt;code&gt;3 * (4 div 5)&lt;/code&gt;, which is 0. Also, they are left-associative; &lt;code&gt;f x y&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;code&gt;(f x) y&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; takes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as its argument and returns a function that accepts &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; as ''its'' argument), not &lt;code&gt;f (x y)&lt;/code&gt;.

===Infix function calls===

A binary function — that is, a function whose parameter type is a 2-tuple type — can be turned into an infix operator:

 '''fun''' minus (a, b) = a - b
 '''val''' three = minus (5, 2)
 '''infix''' minus
 '''val''' seven = 4 minus ~3
 '''val''' two = '''op''' minus (20, 18)

An infix operator can have any precedence level from 0 to 9, 0 (the default) being the lowest precedence, 9 being the highest. The Standard Basis provides these built-in infix specifications:

 '''infix'''  7  * / ''div'' ''mod''
 '''infix'''  6  + - ^
 '''infixr''' 5  :: @
 '''infix'''  4  = &lt;&gt; &gt; &gt;= &lt; &lt;=
 '''infix'''  3  := ''o''
 '''infix'''  0  ''before''

Notice that in the third line, &lt;tt&gt;::&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt; are made infix using &lt;tt&gt;infixr&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;infix&lt;/tt&gt;. This makes them ''right''-associative rather than ''left''-associative; whereas &lt;tt&gt;3 - 4 - 5&lt;/tt&gt; means &lt;tt&gt;(3 - 4) - 5&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;3 :: 4 :: nil&lt;/tt&gt; means &lt;tt&gt;3 :: (4 :: nil)&lt;/tt&gt;.

An identifier can actually be declared infix even before it refers to a specific function:

 '''infix''' pow
 '''fun''' x pow y = Math.pow (x, y)
 '''val''' eight = 2.0 pow 3.0

Note that in this case, the infix notation is already used in declaring the function. Another way of doing this is by using &lt;tt&gt;op&lt;/tt&gt; in the function declaration, which works regardless if the function has already been declared infix or not:

 '''fun''' op pow (x, y) = Math.pow (x, y)

The preferred style is usually to not do this, but it can be useful if the declaration happens in a setting where it is not certain whether the function has been declared infix or not, or when &lt;tt&gt;use&lt;/tt&gt; might be called on a file containing such a function declaration more than once, where the function is declared as infix after its definition. It can also be a way of signalling that the function might be declared as infix later on, possibly in another file, in which case it can be useful to ensure that the order of parsing the files does not matter.

==Boolean and conditional expressions==

===Comparisons===

As we saw in the chapter on types, the &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; (boolean) type has two values, &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. We also saw the built-in polymorphic equality operator &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, of type &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''a * ''a -&gt; bool&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Closely related is the ''inequality'' operator &lt;code&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, also of type &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''a * ''a -&gt; bool&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; would return &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, and vice versa.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; (less than), &lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (greater than), &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt; (less than or equal to), and &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; (greater than or equal to) operators are overloaded to be usable with a variety of numeric, character, and string types (but as with the arithmetic operators, both operands must have the same type).

===Operations on booleans===

Three main functions operate on boolean values:

* The function &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt;, of type &lt;code&gt;bool -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;, maps &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and vice versa.
* The infix operator &lt;code&gt;andalso&lt;/code&gt;, of type &lt;code&gt;bool * bool -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;, maps &lt;code&gt;(true, true)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, and all other possibilities to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. Furthermore, it is a &quot;shortcutting&quot; operator; if its first operand is &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, then it will return &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; without even evaluating its second operand.
* The infix operator &lt;code&gt;orelse&lt;/code&gt;, of type &lt;code&gt;bool * bool -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;, maps &lt;code&gt;(false, false)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, and all other possibilities to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. Like &lt;code&gt;andalso&lt;/code&gt; it is a shortcutting operand, but in the opposite direction: if its first operand is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, then it will return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; without even evaluating its second operand.

===Conditional expressions===

One major use of boolean values is in conditional expressions. An expression of this form:

 '''if''' boolean_expression '''then''' expression_if_true '''else''' expression_if_false

evaluates to the result of &lt;code&gt;expression_if_true&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;boolean_expression&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, and to the result of &lt;code&gt;expression_if_false&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;boolean_expression&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. As with the shortcutting operators, the unneeded expression is not evaluated. This allows conditional expressions to be used in creating recursive functions:

 '''fun''' factorial x = '''if''' x = 0 '''then''' 1 '''else''' x * (factorial (x - 1))

It also allows for conditional side effects:

 '''if''' x = 0 '''then''' ''print'' &quot;x = 0&quot; '''else''' ''print'' &quot;x &lt;&gt; 0&quot;

Note that, since conditional expressions return a value, the &quot;then&quot; and &quot;else&quot; branches are both required to be present, and to have the same type, though they do not have to be particularly meaningful:

 '''if''' x = 0 '''then''' ''print'' &quot;x = 0&quot; '''else''' ()

==Case expressions and pattern-matching==

Functions may be composed of one or more rules. A rule consists of its function-name, an argument pattern and its expression. When the function is called the argument values will be matched to the patterns in top down order. Functions using pattern-matching are very similar to case expressions. In fact you can transform any case construct into a function. For example this snippet 

 '''case''' compare(a,b) '''of'''
  GREATER =&gt; 1
  LESS =&gt; 2
  EQUAL =&gt; 3

is semantically equal to

 '''fun''' case_example_function GREATER = 1
   | case_example_function LESS = 2
   | case_example_function EQUAL = 3;
 case_example_function compare(a,b);

The first matching rule will get its expression evaluated and returned. That means if the patterns are overlapping (multiple patterns match a given argument value) one must keep in mind that '''only the first matching rule gets evaluated'''.

 '''fun''' list_size (''nil'') = 0
  |  list_size (_::xs) = 1 + str_len xs;

The functions pattern is called '''exhaustive''' if there is a matching pattern for all legal argument values.
The following example is '''non-exhaustive'''. 

 '''fun''' list_size ([a]) = 1
  |  list_size ([a,b]) = 2;

Any empty list or lists of ''size&gt;2'' will cause a &lt;code&gt;Match&lt;/code&gt;-exception. To make it exhaustive one might add a few patterns. 

 '''fun''' list_size ([a]) = 1
  |  list_size ([a,b]) = 2
  |  list_size (nil) = 0
  |  list_size (_) = 0;

Lists of ''size&gt;2'' will return 0 which does not make a lot of sense but the functions pattern is now '''exhaustive'''.

==Exceptions==

Exceptions are used to abort evaluation. There are several built in exceptions that can be thrown using the &lt;tt&gt;raise&lt;/tt&gt; keyword, and your can define your own using the &lt;tt&gt;exception&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. Exceptions can have messages attached to them by writing &lt;tt&gt;of&lt;/tt&gt; in the declaration and they are used much like datatype constructors. An exception can be caught using the &lt;tt&gt;handle&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. Example:

 '''exception''' Exc '''of''' string;
 '''fun''' divide (_, 0) = '''raise''' Exc(&quot;Cannot divide by zero&quot;)
   | divide (num, den) = num div den
 '''val''' zero_or_infinity = divide (0, 0)
   '''handle''' Exc msg =&gt; (print (msg ^ &quot;\n&quot;); 0)

This will print &quot;Cannot divide by zero&quot; and evaluate zero_or_infinity to 0 thanks to the &lt;tt&gt;handle&lt;/tt&gt; clause.

Built in exceptions include Empty, Domain and Fail(msg).

==Lambda expressions==

A lambda expression is an expression that can be evaluated into a function without the function being bound to an identifier, a.k.a. an anonymous function, function constant or a function literal. Such a function can be defined in Standard ML using the &lt;tt&gt;fn&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. This is particularly useful for higher order functions, i.e. functions that take other functions as arguments, such as the built in &lt;tt&gt;map&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;foldl&lt;/tt&gt; functions. Instead of writing:

 '''fun''' add_one x = x + 1
 '''val''' incremented = map add_one [1, 2, 3]

You could simply write

 '''val''' incremented = map ('''fn''' x =&gt; x + 1) [1, 2, 3]

Note that the &lt;tt&gt;=&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; operator is used instead of &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;. The &lt;tt&gt;fn&lt;/tt&gt; keyword can be used in place of &lt;tt&gt;fun&lt;/tt&gt;, including pattern matching and even recursion (if the &lt;tt&gt;rec&lt;/tt&gt; keyword is used):

 '''val''' '''rec''' fact = '''fn''' 1 =&gt; 1 | n =&gt; '''if''' n &gt; 1 '''then''' n * fact(n - 1) '''else''' '''raise''' Domain

Be aware that it is often considered better style to use the &lt;tt&gt;fun&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.

==Let expressions==

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about the University of California, San Diego. The University of California, San Diego is also known as UC San Diego or simply UCSD. UC San Diego is one of the ten general campuses in the University of California system and is a public research university. Over 22,000 undergraduate students are currently enrolled at UC San Diego and a large number of potential students apply to UC San Diego each year so a guidebook may be useful for some of these people. This guidebook is meant to be a useful resource for prospective or current students of this university.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Instructors at UC San Diego normally require that their students purchase textbooks or other course materials for their courses. Instructors have a number of options regarding what kind of course materials they want students to buy and where students should get these materials. The instructor normally provides this information on the course syllabus or in class. This information is also normally available before the course begins and can be obtained by clicking on the 'book' icon by the course listed in the Schedule of Courses.

==UC San Diego Bookstore==
The UC San Diego Bookstore is located in the center of the main campus. It is part of the Price Center complex and opens out to the Price Center Plaza. There is also an entrance to the Bookstore on Library Walk and another facing the Town Square. The Bookstore contains a Textbook and Course Materials department, a General Books department (which is similar to a Borders of Barnes and Nobles bookstore), Customer Service, Perks Coffee Shop, a clothing department, a medical supplies department for School of Medicine and School of Pharmacy students, as well as other areas students can shop at. Facing the Price Center East foodcourt is the Sunshine Market, a convenience store run by the Bookstore. There is also a satellite bookstore by the new housing at the northern end of the campus which includes many of the items available at the main Bookstore. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography also has a bookstore which specializes in oceanography and related science books.

==Textbook Reservation Service==
During their orientation, incoming freshman and transfer students can sign up for the Textbook Reservation Service (TRS). Representatives from the bookstore will be at a table during most of the college orientations with the campus organizations and other groups students can visit during a portion of their orientation. This is a free service offered by the UC San Diego Bookstore to incoming students only for the Fall Quarter. Students can fill out a form for this service or can complete the form online by going to the UC San Diego Bookstore website.[http://www.bookstore.ucsd.edu/books/textbooks/trs.htm] Students can select their textbook preferences and their method of payment on this form. During move-in weekend before the start of the Fall Quarter, students who signed up for this service can go to the Price Center Ballroom West and get their textbooks. Changes can be made to their order at this time as well. Their textbooks will be in a convenient cardboard box students can carry out with them after checking out. After the Fall quarter, students cannot use the TRS again but can order their textbooks online using TxtXpress.

==TxtXpress==
For a certain period of time before the academic quarter starts, students can order their textbooks online from the UC San Diego Bookstore. Their books will be pulled from the shelves and will be ready to pick-up at Customer Service in the bookstore. This service is free but is only available for a certain time period each quarter (about two weeks before classes start each quarter). Check the bookstore website for more information.[http://www.bookstore.ucsd.edu/books/textbooks/tol.htm]

==Return Policy==
Textbooks are normally returnable for a full refund up to Saturday of Second Week. To return textbooks, students need their receipt and the textbook must be in the condition it was purchased in. This means no software has been opened and no online access codes have been uncovered. New books must be in the condition they were purchased in. There is more leeway with Used books students are attempting to return. Some books cannot be returned if they have been opened (looseleaf textbooks in particular) and this will be indicated on the book with a sticker that says something like &quot;Nonreturnable in unwrapped.&quot; After that, textbooks can only be returned if the student has a Term Audit (obtained from the Registrar's Office) stating that the student dropped the course the textbooks are for and the rest of the conditions described above have been met. The rules are somewhat different for Extension and ELI textbooks and the Bookstore website should be consulted for the return policy for these textbooks. The policy is also modified for Summer Session courses since they are shorter than regular courses.

==Textbook Sell-Back==
During the First Week and during Final Exam Week of each academic quarter, a textbook wholesaler visits the campus and students have an opportunity to sell some of their textbooks. The most a student can get for a particular textbook is half the cost of a new textbook. Students can bring their old books to the white tent in front of Price Center Plaza of the Bookstore and check to see what price the buyer will offer them for their books. There is no guarantee the buyer will buy their book and what price they will offer for it. The employees in the Textbook department do not know if the wholesaler will buy back a particular book and can only offer an educated guess based on mainly on whether the book is being used for the upcoming quarter. It is recommended that students try to sell their books early in the week because the buyer can buy only so may of a particular book so they many have filled their quota by the end of the week.

==Course Readers==
Instructors have a number of options regarding course readers. Instructors can have UC San Diego print course readers for their course. These readers will be available in the UC San Diego Bookstore. They can also have students order their course readers through companies like University Readers. If an instructor does this, students have to purchase the reader from the company and cannot buy the reader from the Bookstore. Instructors can also have Cal Copy print the course reader for them. Students will have to go to Cal Copy to purchase their reader if this is the case. Cal Copy is located near the Villa La Jolla entrance to the main campus behind the gas station on Villa La Jolla Drive. 

==AS Soft Reserves==
AS Soft Reserves is a service run by the Associated Students (AS) of UC San Diego. They print materials for courses such as packets and lecture notes. For some courses, a note-taker is paid to produce notes which are available to students at AS Soft Reserve. AS Soft Reserves is located at the old Student Center, which is behind Mandeville Center and near Porter's Pub. 

==Groundworks Books==
Groundworks Books is a student-run bookstore that specializes in left-wing political and social publications.[http://groundwork.ucsd.edu/Welcome.html] They also carry textbooks for a number of courses, especially Ethnic Studies and Sociology courses. Groundworks Books is located in the old Student Center, which is behind Mandeville Center and near Porter's Pub.

==General Store==
The General Store sometimes has copies of certain textbooks available for purchase.

==Clickers/Transmitters==
Some professors require that students buy a small handheld device known as a &quot;clicker&quot; or &quot;transmitter.&quot; This is typical for lower division chemistry course and physics courses. If this is the case, the type of clicker a students must buy will be listed with the other textbooks they need for the course. The UCSD Bookstore sells three types of clickers. One is known as a &quot;RAD&quot; or &quot;H-ITT&quot; or &quot;13-button&quot; clicker. It looks like a small, neon remote and comes in several colors (green, orange and yellow). It requires a 9 volt battery (which can be purchased at the bookstore). Another is the PRS transmitter. It has a metal cover with a LCD in it. The third type is the I-clicker. It is beige and flat. The same return and other policies apply to clicker that apply to textbooks. Students may also be able to sell clickers back like they can textbooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|MINIX}}

'''MINIX''' is a Unix-like operating system developed by computer science professor Andrew S. Tanenbaum. While originally devised as a teaching tool, it has found use (particularly in its latest incarnation, MINIX 3) as a reliable OS for embedded systems and computers with limited resources. Its stability can be attributed largely to its [[../../Microkernel|microkernel]] architecture, which has device drivers and the like contained in user space rather than kernel space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Incoming and current student need a place to live. They have two main options to choose from: on-campus or off-campus housing. Incoming freshmen usually live on-campus for their first year or two and incoming transfer students normally live off-campus. 

==On-Campus Housing==
Each college provides on-campus housing for its incoming freshman students. This housing can vary greatly, ranging from buildings built in the 1960s for Revelle students to buildings built in the 1990s for ERC students. On-campus housing can also vary in size, ranging from multistory buildings such as Tioga and Tenaya halls to the small &quot;summer camp&quot; style buildings used by Sixth College students.

==Off-Campus Housing==
After their first year or two on campus, students usually move off-campus. Transfer students normally do not have the option of living on campus so they must live off campus from the very beginning of their time at UC San Diego. However, new housing units are starting to open so more transfer students may be able to live on campus in the near future. Students living off campus have a number of options. They can live at one of the apartment complexes in the area or in a house near the campus. Many students live with fellow UC San Diego students or other young adults living in the La Jolla area and split the rent between them. To find off-campus housing, students have a number of options. UC San Diego provides housing listings for commuter students that they can search through to find roommates or apartments.[http://www.ucsd.edu/current-students/_organizations/commuter-student-services/index.html] Students can also use resources like Craigslist to find a place to live.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am currently an undergraduate student at UC San Diego. My primary goal for Wikibooks is to create a useful guidebook for UC San Diego. I want to create a book that is useful for people who are considering applying to this university and also for current students, especially new students. I would appreciate it if other people joined in and added to the book I am starting since I am not an expert on all aspects of UC San Diego.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
== Sets ==
In the so-called naive set theory, which is sufficient for the purpose of studying abstract algebra, the notion of a set is not rigorously defined. We describe a set as a well-defined aggregation of objects, which are referred to as members or elements of the set. If a certain object is an element of a set, it is said to be contained in that set. The elements of a set can be anything at all, but in the study of abstract algebra, elements are most frequently numbers or mathematical structures. The elements of a set completely determine the set, and so sets with the same elements as each other are equal. Conversely, sets which are equal contain the same elements.

For an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, we can say either &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;x \not\in A&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not contained in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. To state that multiple elements &lt;math&gt;a, b, c, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt; are contained in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, we write &lt;math&gt;a, b, c, \ldots, n \in A&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The axiom of extensionality ===
Using this notation and the symbol &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;, which represents logical implication, we can restate the definition of equality for two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x \in A \rightarrow x \in B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in B \rightarrow x \in A&lt;/math&gt;.

This is known as the axiom of extensionality.

=== Comprehensive notation ===
If it is not possible to list the elements of a set, it can be defined by giving a property that its elements are sole to possess. The set of all objects &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with some property &lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{x : Q(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the set of all elements &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with some property &lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{x \in A : Q(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;. The colon : here is read as &quot;such that&quot;. The vertical bar | is synonymous with the colon in similar contexts. This notation will appear quite often in the rest of this book, so it is important for the reader to familiarize himself with this now.

As an example of this notation, the set of integers can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} = \{x : x \mbox{ is an integer}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and the set of even integers can be written as &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \mbox{ is even}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Set inclusion ===
For two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, we define set inclusion as follows: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is included in, or a subset of, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if every member of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a member of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B \Leftrightarrow x \in A \rightarrow x \in B&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;

where the symbol &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; denotes &quot;is a subset of&quot;.

By the aforementioned axiom of extensionality, one finds that &lt;math&gt;A = B \Leftrightarrow A \subseteq B \mbox{ and } B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The empty set ===
One can define an empty set, written &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\forall x( x \not \in \emptyset)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; denotes universal quantification (read as &quot;for all&quot; or &quot;for every&quot;). In other words, the empty set is defined as the set which contains no elements. The empty set can be shown to be unique.

Since the empty set contains no elements, it can be shown to be a subset of every set. Similarly, no set but the empty set is a subset of the empty set.

=== Proper set inclusion ===
For two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, we can define proper set inclusion as follows: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a proper subset of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; does not equal &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, there is at least one member in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; not contained in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A \subset B \Leftrightarrow (A \subseteq B \and A \neq B)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;

where the symbol &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; denotes &quot;is a proper subset of&quot; and the symbol &lt;math&gt;\and&lt;/math&gt; denotes logical ''and''.

=== Cardinality of sets ===
The cardinality of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt;, can be said informally to be a measure of the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. However, this description is only rigorously accurate for finite sets. To find the cardinality of infinite sets, more sophisticated tools are needed.

=== Set intersection ===
For sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, we define the intersection of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; by the set &lt;math&gt;A \cap B&lt;/math&gt; which contains all elements which are common to both &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Symbolically, this can be stated as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{ x \mid x \in A \mbox{ and } x \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

Because every element of &lt;math&gt;A \cap B&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and an element of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \cap B&lt;/math&gt; is, by the definition of set inclusion, a subset of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

If the sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; have no elements in common, they are said to be disjoint sets. This is equivalent to the statement that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint if &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

Set intersection is an associative and commutative operation; that is, for any sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = B \cap A&lt;/math&gt;.

By the definition of intersection, one can find that &lt;math&gt;A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \cap A = A&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B \Leftrightarrow A \cap B = A&lt;/math&gt;.

One can take the intersection of more than two sets at once; since set intersection is associative and commutative, the order in which these intersections are evaluated is irrelevant. If &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are sets for every &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;, we can denote the intersection of all &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i\in I} A_i=\{x \mid (\forall i\in I )x\in A_i\}&lt;/math&gt;

In cases like this, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is called an index set, and &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are said to be indexed by &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case of &lt;math&gt;I=\{1,2,...,n\}&lt;/math&gt; one can either write &lt;math&gt;A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3 \cap \cdots \cap A_n&lt;/math&gt; or

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Set union ===
For sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, we define the union of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; by the set &lt;math&gt;A \cup B&lt;/math&gt; which contains all elements which are in either &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; or both. Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;A \cup B = \{ x \mid x \in A \mbox{ or } x \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

Since the union &lt;math&gt;A \cup B&lt;/math&gt; of sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; contains the elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq A \cup B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq A \cup B&lt;/math&gt;.

Like set intersection, set union is an associative and commutative operation; for any sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \cup B = B \cup A&lt;/math&gt;.

By the definition of union, one can find that &lt;math&gt;A \cup \emptyset = A \cup A = A&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B \Leftrightarrow A \cup B = B&lt;/math&gt;.

Just as with set intersection, one can take the union of more than two sets at once; since set union is associative and commutative, the order in which these unions are evaluated is irrelevant. Let &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; be sets for all &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;. Then the union of all the &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i = \{x \mid (\exists i\in I) x\in A_i\}&lt;/math&gt;

For the union of a finite number of sets &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_n&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;I=\{1,2,...,n\}&lt;/math&gt; one can either write &lt;math&gt;A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup \cdots \cup A_n&lt;/math&gt; or abbreviate this as

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Distributive laws ===
Set union and set intersection are distributive with respect to each other. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;A \cap (B \cup C) = (B \cup C) \cap A = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;A \cup (B \cap C) = (B \cap C) \cup A = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Cartesian product ===
The Cartesian product of sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;A \times B&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all ordered pairs which can be formed with the first object in the ordered pair being an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the second being an element of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. This can be expressed symbolically as

:&lt;math&gt; A \times B = \{(x,y) \mid x \in A \mbox{ and } y \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

Since different ordered pairs result when one exchanges the objects in the pair, the Cartesian product is not commutative. The Cartesian product is also not associative. The following identities hold for the Cartesian product for any sets &lt;math&gt;A, B, C, D&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;(A \cap B) \times (C \cap D) = (A \times C) \cap (B \times D)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;(A \cup B) \times (C \cup D) = (A \times C) \cup (A \times D) \cup (B \times C) \cup (B \times D)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;A \times (B \cap C) = (A \times B) \cap (A \times C)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;A \times (B \cup C) = (A \times B) \cup (A \times C)&lt;/math&gt;.

The Cartesian product of any set and the empty set yields the empty set; symbolically, for any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \times \emptyset = \emptyset \times A = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

The Cartesian product can easily be generalized to the ''n''-ary Cartesian product, which is also denoted by &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;. The ''n''-ary Cartesian product forms ordered ''n''-tuples from the elements of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; sets. Specifically, for sets &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_n&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;A_1 \times A_2 \times A_3 \times \cdots \times A_n = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) : x_i \in A_i \}&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be abbreviated as

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n} A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In the ''n''-ary Cartesian product, each &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th coordinate of &lt;math&gt;(x_1, \ldots , x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the special case where all the factors are the same set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, we can generalize even further. Let &lt;math&gt;A^{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all functions &lt;math&gt;f\,:\,\Omega\rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;. Then, in analogy with the above, &lt;math&gt;A^\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is effectively the set of &quot;&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;-tuples&quot; of elements in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and for each such function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and each &lt;math&gt;i\in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, we call &lt;math&gt;f(i)&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th coordinate of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. As one might expect, in the simple case when &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \{1,2,...,n\}&lt;/math&gt; for an integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, this construction is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^n A&lt;/math&gt;, which we can abbreviate further as &lt;math&gt;A^n&lt;/math&gt;. We also have the imporant case of &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, giving rise to the set of all infinite sequences of elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, which we can denote by &lt;math&gt;A^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;. We will need this contruction later, in paticular when dealing with polynomial rings.

=== Disjoint union ===

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be any two sets. We then define their disjoint union, denoted &lt;math&gt;A \coprod B&lt;/math&gt; to be the following: First create copies &lt;math&gt;A^\prime&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^\prime&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A^\prime \cap B^\prime = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. Then define &lt;math&gt;A \coprod B = A^\prime \cup B^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that this definition is not explicit, like the other operations defined so far. The definition does not output a single set, but rather a family of sets. However, these are all &quot;the same&quot; in a sense which will be defined soon. In other words, there exists bijective functions between them.

Luckily, if a disjoint union is needed for explicit computation, one can easily be constructed, for example &lt;math&gt;A\coprod B =(\{0\} \times A)\cup (\{1\}\times B)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Set difference ===
The set difference, or relative set complement, of sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of elements contained in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; which are not contained in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = \{ x \mid x \in A \mbox{ and } x \not\in B\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

By the definition of set difference, &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;.

The following identities hold for any sets &lt;math&gt;A, B, C&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A \Leftrightarrow A \cap B = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = \emptyset \Leftrightarrow A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A \setminus C \Leftrightarrow A \cap B = A \cap C&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;A \setminus (B \cap C) = (A \setminus B) \cup (A \setminus C)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;A \setminus (B \cup C) = (A \setminus B) \cap (A \setminus C)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;A \setminus (B \setminus C) = (C \cap A) \cup (A \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;A \setminus \emptyset = A&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;A \setminus A = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\emptyset \setminus A = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

The set difference of two Cartesian products can be found as &lt;math&gt;(A \times B) \setminus (C \times D) = [A \times (B \setminus D)] \cup [(A \setminus C) \times B]&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The universal set and set complements ===
We define some arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; for which every set under consideration is a subset of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; as the universal set, or universe. The complement of any set is then defined to be the set difference of the universal set and that set. That is, for any set &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;, the complement of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;A^C = U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;. The following identities involving set complements hold true for any sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;:

:De Morgan's laws for sets:
::&lt;math&gt;(A \cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;(A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C&lt;/math&gt;,
:Double complement law:
::&lt;math&gt;A^{CC} = A&lt;/math&gt;,
:Complement properties:
::&lt;math&gt;A \cup A^C = U&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;A \cap A^C = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\emptyset^C = U&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;U^C = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B \rightarrow B^C \subseteq A^C&lt;/math&gt;.

The set complement can be related to the set difference with the identities &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A \cap B^C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A \setminus B)^C = A^C \cup B&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Symmetric difference ===
For sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, the symmetric set difference of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;A \bigtriangleup B&lt;/math&gt; or by &lt;math&gt;A \ominus B&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of elements which are contained either in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; but not in both of them. Symbolically, it can be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;A \bigtriangleup B = \{x : (x \in A) \oplus (x \in B)\}.&lt;/math&gt;
More commonly, it is represented as
:&lt;math&gt;A \bigtriangleup B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)&lt;/math&gt; or as
:&lt;math&gt;A \bigtriangleup B = (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt;.
The symmetric difference is commutative and associative so that &lt;math&gt;A \bigtriangleup B = B \bigtriangleup A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A \bigtriangleup B) \bigtriangleup C = A \bigtriangleup (B \bigtriangleup C)&lt;/math&gt;. Every set is its own symmetric-difference inverse, and the empty set functions as an identity element for the symmetric difference, that is, &lt;math&gt;A \bigtriangleup A = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \bigtriangleup \emptyset = A&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;A \bigtriangleup B = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;.

Set intersection is distributive over the symmetric difference operation. In other words, &lt;math&gt;A \cap (B \bigtriangleup C) = (A \cap B) \bigtriangleup (A \cap C)&lt;/math&gt;.

The symmetric difference of two set complements is the same as the symmetric difference of the two sets: &lt;math&gt;A^C \bigtriangleup B^C = A \bigtriangleup B&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Notation for specific sets ===
Commonly-used sets of numbers in mathematics are often denoted by special symbols. The conventional notations used in this book are given below.

Natural numbers with 0: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Natural numbers without 0: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^* = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Integers: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} = \{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rational numbers: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} = \left\{\frac{p}{q} : p \in \mathbb{Z} \mbox{ and } q \in \mathbb{N}^*\right\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Real numbers: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Complex numbers: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==   
A function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt; is a triplet &lt;math&gt;(A, B, G)&lt;/math&gt; such that:
* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set, called the domain of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a set, called the codomain of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;A \times B&lt;/math&gt;, called the graph of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt;
In addition the following two properties hold:
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in A, \exists y \in B \mid (x,y) \in G&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in A, y \in B, y' \in B\mbox{, then } (x,y) \in G \mbox{ and } (x,y') \in G \Rightarrow y=y'&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in A&lt;/math&gt; we write &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}(x)&lt;/math&gt; for the unique &lt;math&gt;y \in B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \in G&lt;/math&gt;.

We say that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt; is a function from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, which we write:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===
Let's consider the function from the reals to the reals which squares its argument. We could define it like this:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:x \mapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Remark===
As you see in the definition of a function above, the domain and codomain are an integral part of the definition. In other words, even if the values of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}(x)&lt;/math&gt; don't change, changing the domain or codomain changes the function.

Let's look at the following four functions.

The function:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f_1}:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f_1}:x \mapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt;
is neither injective nor surjective (these terms will be defined later).

The function:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f_2}:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f_2}:x \mapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt;
is not injective but surjective.

The function:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f_3}:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f_3}:x \mapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt;
is injective but not surjective.

The function:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f_4}:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f_4}:x \mapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt;
is injective and surjective

As you see, all four functions have the same mapping but all four are different. That's why just giving the mapping is insufficient; a function is only defined if its domain and codomain are known.

==Image and preimage==
For a set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, we write &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(E)&lt;/math&gt; for the set of subsets of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;. We will now define two related functions.

The '''image''' function:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:\mathcal{P}(A) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(B),S \subseteq A \mapsto \{\operatorname{f}(x) \mid x \in S\}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''preimage''' function:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f^{-1}}:\mathcal{P}(B) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(A),T \subseteq B \mapsto \{x \in A \mid \operatorname{f}(x) \in T\}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the image and preimage are written respectively like &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt; and its inverse (if it exists). There is however no ambiguity because the domains are different. Note also that the image and preimage are not necessarily inverse of one another. (See the section on bijective functions below).

We define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}_{\operatorname{f}}:=\operatorname{f}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, which we call the '''image''' of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt;.

For any &lt;math&gt;y \in B&lt;/math&gt;, we call &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f^{-1}}(\{y\})&lt;/math&gt; the '''support''' of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
Let's take again the function:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:x \mapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Let's consider the following examples:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f^{-1}}(\{4\})=\{-2,2\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f^{-1}}(\mathbb{R}_{&lt; 0}) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}) = \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt;

==Further definitions==
Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:B \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g}:A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;. We define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f} \circ \operatorname{g}:A \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{f} \circ \operatorname{g})(x) := \operatorname{f}(\operatorname{g}(x))&lt;/math&gt;, which we call the '''composition''' of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set. We define the '''identity function''' on A as
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id_A}:A \rightarrow A, x \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

'''Definition''': A function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; is '''injective''' if
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in A, x' \in A, \operatorname{f}(x) = \operatorname{f}(x') \Rightarrow x = x'&lt;/math&gt;

'''Lemma''': Consider a function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; and suppose &lt;math&gt;A \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt; is injective if and only if there exists a function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g}:B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g} \circ \operatorname{f} = \operatorname{id_A}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
''Proof'':
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;'\Rightarrow'&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt; is injective. As &lt;math&gt;A \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; let's define &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; as an arbitrary element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. We can then define a suitable function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g}:B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{g}(y):= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\mbox{the unique } x \in A \mid \operatorname{f}(x) = y &amp; \text{, if } y \in \operatorname{Im}_{\operatorname{f}}\\
m &amp; \text{, else}\\
\end{array} \right.
&lt;/math&gt;
It is now easy to verify that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g} \circ \operatorname{f} = \operatorname{id_A}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;'\Leftarrow'&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose there is a function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g}:B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g} \circ \operatorname{f} = \operatorname{id_A}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\forall x,x' \in A, \operatorname{f}(x) = \operatorname{f}(x') \Rightarrow \operatorname{g}(\operatorname{f}(x)) = \operatorname{g}(\operatorname{f}(x')) \Rightarrow x = x'&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt; is thus injective.
&lt;br /&gt;
Q.E.D.

'''Definition''': A function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; is '''surjective''' if
:&lt;math&gt;\forall y \in B, \exists x \in A \mid \operatorname{f}(x) = y&lt;/math&gt;

'''Lemma''': Consider a function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt; is surjective if and only if there exists a function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g}:B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f} \circ \operatorname{g} = \operatorname{id_B}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
''Proof'':
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;'\Rightarrow'&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt; is surjective. We can define a suitable function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g}:B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g}(y):= \mbox{an } x \in A \mid \operatorname{f}(x) = y&lt;/math&gt;
It is now easy to verify that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f} \circ \operatorname{g} = \operatorname{id_B}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;'\Leftarrow'&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose there is a function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g}:B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f} \circ \operatorname{g} = \operatorname{id_B}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\forall y \in B \mbox{, let } x := \operatorname{g}(y)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}(x) = \operatorname{f}(\operatorname{g}(y)) = y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt; is thus surjective.
&lt;br /&gt;
Q.E.D.

'''Definition''':  A function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; is '''bijective''' if
it is both injective and surjective.

'''Lemma''': A function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}:A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; is bijective if and only if there exists a function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g}:B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g} \circ \operatorname{f} = \operatorname{id_A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f} \circ \operatorname{g} = \operatorname{id_B}&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore it can be shown that such a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{g}&lt;/math&gt; is unique. We write it &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f^{-1}}:B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; and call it the '''inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{f}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
''Proof'':
&lt;br /&gt;
Left as an exercise.

'''Example:''' If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are sets such that &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an obviously injective function &lt;math&gt;i\,:\, B\rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;, called the inclusion &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;i(b)=b&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;b\in B&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example:''' If &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there is an obviously surjective function &lt;math&gt;\pi\,:\,X\rightarrow X/\sim&lt;/math&gt;, called the canonical projection onto &lt;math&gt;X/\sim&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)=[x]&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' Define the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(a)=f(b)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, if &lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; is any function, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; decomposes into the composition

:&lt;math&gt;A\stackrel{\pi}{\longrightarrow} A/\sim \stackrel{\tilde{f}}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{im}f \stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow} B&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is the canonical projection, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,f\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; is the bijection &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}([a])=f(a)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': The definition of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; immediately implies that &lt;math&gt;f=i\circ\tilde{f}\circ\pi&lt;/math&gt;, so we only have to prove that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; is well defined and a bijection. Let &lt;math&gt;a,a^\prime \in A&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;[a]=[a^\prime] \,\Rightarrow \, a\sim a^\prime \,\Rightarrow\, f(a)=f(a^\prime)&lt;/math&gt;. This shows that the value of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}([a])&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the representative chosen from &lt;math&gt;[a]&lt;/math&gt;, and so it is well-defined.

For injectivity, we have &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}([a])=\tilde{f}([a^\prime])\,\Rightarrow\, f(a)=f(a^\prime) \,\Rightarrow\, [a]=[a^\prime]&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; is injective.

For surjectivity, let &lt;math&gt;b\in \mathrm{im}\,f&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists an &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(a)=b&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}([a])=b&lt;/math&gt; by definition of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,f&lt;/math&gt;, this proves that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; is surjective.

Q.E.D.

'''Definition:''' Given a function &lt;math&gt;f\,:\,X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a

(i) ''Monomorphism'' if given any two functions &lt;math&gt;g,h\,:\,W\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f \circ g = f \circ h&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g=h&lt;/math&gt;.

(ii) ''Epimorphism'' if given any two functions &lt;math&gt;g,h\,:\,Y\rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = h \circ f&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g=h&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' A function between sets is

(i) a monomorphism if and only if it is injective.

(ii) an epimorphism if and only if it is surjective.

''Proof'': (i) Let &lt;math&gt;f\,:\,B\rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; be a  monomorphism. Then, for any two functions &lt;math&gt;g,h\,:\,A\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(g(a))=f(h(a)) \,\Rightarrow\, g(a)=h(a)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;. This is the definition if injectivity. For the converse, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is injective, it has a left inverse &lt;math&gt;f^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, if &lt;math&gt;f(g(a))=f(h(a))&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;, compose with &lt;math&gt;f^\prime&lt;/math&gt; on the left side to obtain &lt;math&gt;g(a)=h(a)&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a monomorphism.

(ii) Let &lt;math&gt;f\,:\,A\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; be an epimorphism. Then, for any two functions &lt;math&gt;g,h\,:\, B\rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g(f(a))=h(f(a))\,\Rightarrow\, g(b)=h(b)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\in B&lt;/math&gt;. Assume &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im} f \neq B&lt;/math&gt;, that is, that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not surjective. Then there exists at least one &lt;math&gt;b\in B&lt;/math&gt; not in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,f&lt;/math&gt;. For this &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; choose two functions &lt;math&gt;g,h&lt;/math&gt; which coincide on &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\, f&lt;/math&gt; but disagree on &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt;. However, we still have &lt;math&gt;g(f(a))=h(f(a))&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;. This violates our assumtion that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an epimorphism. Consequentally, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is surjective. For the converse, assume &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is surjective. Then the epimorphism property immediately follows.

Q.E.D.

'''Remark:''' The equivalence between monomorphism and injectivity, and between epimorphism and surjectivity is a special property of functions between sets. This not the case in general, and we will see examples of this when discussing structure-preserving functions between groups or rings in later sections.

'''Example:''' Given any two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, we have the canonical projections &lt;math&gt;\pi_A\,:\,A\times B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\pi_B\,:\, A\times B\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. These maps are obviously surjective. 

In addition, we have the natural inclusions &lt;math&gt;i_A\,:\, A\rightarrow A\coprod B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i_B\,:\, B\rightarrow A\coprod B&lt;/math&gt; which are obviously injective as stated above.

===Universal properties===

The projections and inclusions described above are special, in that they satisfy what are called ''universal properties''. We will give the theorem below. The proof is left to the reader.

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt; be any sets.

(i) Let &lt;math&gt;f\,:\,C\rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\,:\,C\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a ''unique'' function &lt;math&gt;u\,:\,C\rightarrow A\times B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f=\pi_A\circ u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g=\pi_B\circ u&lt;/math&gt; are simultaneously satisfied. &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;f\times g&lt;/math&gt;.

(ii) Let &lt;math&gt;f\,:\,A\rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\,:\,B\rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a ''unique'' function &lt;math&gt;u\,:\,A\coprod B \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f=u\circ i_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g=u\circ i_B&lt;/math&gt; are simultaneously satifsied.


The canonical projections onto quotients also satisfy a universal property.

'''Theorem:''' Define the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;f\,:\,X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; be any function such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim b \,\Rightarrow\, f(a)=f(b)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a ''unique'' function &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}\,:\,X/\sim \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f=\bar{f}\circ \pi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\pi\,:\,X\rightarrow X/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is the canonical projection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Definition===
A binary operation on a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a function &lt;math&gt;*:A\times A\rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;a,b\in A&lt;/math&gt;, we usually write &lt;math&gt;*(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;a*b&lt;/math&gt;. The property that &lt;math&gt;a*b\in A&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in A&lt;/math&gt; is called ''closure under &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;''.

'''Example:''' Addition between two integers produces an integer result. Therefore addition is a binary operation on the integers. Whereas division of integers is an example of an operation that is ''not'' a binary operation. &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; is not an integer, so the integers are not closed under division.


To indicate that a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has a binary operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; defined on it, we can compactly write &lt;math&gt;(A,*)&lt;/math&gt;. Such a pair of a set and a binary operation on that set is collectively called a binary structure. A binary structure may have several interesting properties. The main ones we will be interested in are outlined below.

'''Definition:''' A binary operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is ''associative'' if for all &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example:''' Addition of integers is associative: &lt;math&gt;(1 + 2) + 3 = 6 = 1 + (2 + 3)&lt;/math&gt;. Notice however, that subtraction is not associative. Indeed, &lt;math&gt;2=1-(2-3)\neq (1-2)-3=-4&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:''' A binary operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is ''commutative'' is for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a*b=b*a&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example:''' Multiplication of rational numbers is commutative: &lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{b}\cdot\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ac}{bd}=\frac{ca}{bd}=\frac{c}{d}\cdot\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that division is not commutative: &lt;math&gt;2 \div 3 = \frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;3 \div 2 = \frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Notice also that commutativity of multiplication depends on the fact that multiplication of integers is commutative as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Jessica Phelps-Ch.17 English as a Second Language

During 1986, Congress passed The Bilingual Education Act. This act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. This means when needed, schools must provide equal education opportunities for language- minority students. Under this act, students who speak English as a second language must be kept in an adequate program until they can read, write, and comprehend English well enough to participate in all aspects of a school’s curriculum. 46% of all schools in the Unites States have students who speak English as a second language. However, only 43% of schools have programs for students who speak English as a second language. 27% of schools find it difficult or impossible to fill these teaching positions with qualified instructors. In this article I am going to discuss the following: what is a student who speaks English as a second language and what programs have been provided for them, the pros and cons of these programs, and how teachers can take extra steps to help these students. 

Students who speak English as a second language, also called an ESOL student, are defined as those students whose native language is not English. These students have difficulty speaking, reading, writing, and understanding the English language. The ESOL program is a state funded program for eligible English language learners in grades K-12. According to Dr. Ken Shore, The ESOL program is a standard based curriculum emphasizing social and academic language proficiency. This program will allow English language learners to communicate and demonstrate academic, social, and cultural knowledge. The ESOL program is for students that speak any first language other than English. Some examples of other languages would include the following: Vietnamese, French, German, and Spanish.  However, the most common first language is Spanish.  The programs are different for each school district. According to author Denise McKeon, there are a few variables that influence the kind of programs offered in a given district. These factors include the following: the student population that is being served, individual student characteristics, and the district’s resources. Characteristics of student populations include the numbers of students per language group, the size of a particular language group, and the geographic and grade distribution of students influence the type of ESOL program designed for a given district. Some districts have large, stable populations of ESOL students from single language or cultural backgrounds. On the other hand, some districts have large groups of ESOL students representing several language backgrounds. This makes it difficult to find qualified instructors fluent in all languages. The overall goal of the ESOL program is to teach the student until they are at a level where they can continue their education in classes with their English speaking peers.

There are many positive aspects of the ESOL program, as well as many negative aspects. Since extremely high dropout rates have been reported for English as second language students, the ESOL program will give these students the confidence they need to be successful all the way through grade 12 and for the rest of their lives. It will give them the abilities to connect with their peers and other members of the community. It will be useful as they get older and start looking for a job. And once in the job market, they will be able to communicate with potential employers. Most of the time, these students are the only members of their households able to speak English. Because of this their parents are limited in their involvement as compared to English speaking parents. As ESOL students master the language, they can help other family members learn the language. Also, when they grow up and have children of their own they will be able to speak English to them. This means that these future students will enter the school system knowing the English Language. There also are many downfalls to the ESOL program. The main downfall is the challenges the teachers face while teaching these students the academic skills they need to succeed, helping them adjust to a new school setting, and helping these students adapt to the American culture. There are also issues with finding qualified instructors with the ability to speak English and the other foreign languages. This is needed because in the ESOL program instruction is provided in both English and the student’s dominant language. Some people say that the program is actually hindering the students’ ability to learn the curriculum because teachers are cradling the students by using their native languages too long. In my opinion, the native languages have to be used a little at the beginning to communicate with the student as they first enter the ESOL program. 

There are some useful strategies teachers can use to help ESOL student learn faster and adjust to the new setting. Here are some useful tips that can help teachers. They can help the student feel a sense of belonging by making ways to make him or her feel comfortable. For example, having all of the students make sure they pronounce their name correctly.  Another tip is to find someone else that speaks their native language in the school system or in the community that they can talk to in their native language and feel comfortable around. This way they will not feel so isolated. You can also teach the student key words such as: student, teacher, principal, nurse, book, reading, math, homework, clock, lunch, playground, bathroom, backpack, and bell. It will also help in teaching these words if the teacher writes the word on one side of an index card and have a picture on the opposite side. Teachers can also write important information on the board since an ESOL student might not catch the teacher saying it out loud such as homework, seat work, and important dates. Teachers can also assign the ESOL student a buddy to help the ESOL student find their way around the school, understand the rules, and understand directions. Teachers can also keep track of student’s language progress by recording conversations throughout the year and then show them how they have progressed in their learning of the English language. 

It is very important for all teachers and all students to understand that language is acquired, not learned. Students of an average intelligence will take 5-7 years to become fully proficient in the English Language. Until then, everyone needs to be patient and remember that EVERY teacher is an English teacher. A warm smile will go a long way when everyone is starting to get frustrated and wants to give up. It is also important to remember that a new language is best learned when the student is participating in activities they are interested it. 
After researching this topic, I have become very aware of all of the cultural diversities there are in schools. Hopefully students will be able to accept each other for their differences and become more intelligent and caring because of these differences.  My mom is a Pre-K teacher and she has ESOL children in her class. To help her ESOL students, she has students from the local high schools in higher level foreign language classes come to the classroom once a week and buddy up with an ESOL student. This helps because sometimes something explained in a different set of words can make a world of a difference to a student trying to learn the English language. I also think schools could have ESOL programs afterschool for the parents so they will be able to be more involved in their children’s school life. They would be able to help with homework, attend and understand school activities, and be able to communicate with the teachers.

Chapter 19-Early Childhood Education Debate

The Debate continues when to start teaching our young children. The research has shown in a number of studies that a child’s brain develops between the ages zero to 3 years. Neurologists have found what may be a biophysical basis for these results. It has been known for some time that the human brain achieves approximately 85 percent of its adult size (as measured by weight) by age 2 1/2 years, and 90 percent of total growth by age 3 (Purves, 1994). This period of brain growth corresponds to the young child’s attainment of important developmental milestones, including emotional regulation and attachment, language development, and motor skills (Sander, 1987).  Head start what it is and what it is not. Head-start for some or all how do. The access disparities achieving the right balance.  The early childhood education in the 21st century preparing the children read for the future.  

Early Head Start program was established to serve children from birth to three years of age in recognition of the mounting evidence that the earliest years matter a great deal to children's growth and development. Head Start began in 1965 President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty and Great Society. Programs are administered locally by non-profit organizations and local education agencies such as school systems. Head Start is a program for children age 3 to 5 in the United States. Helps to create healthy development in low-income children ages three to five. Programs offer a wide variety of services, that depend on a child's and each family's heritage and experience, to influence all aspects of a child's development and learning.The quality of a preschool program determines how effective it is in helping children learn and delvelop, with consequences for later success in school and economic benefits to its community. 


Term applied universally to educational group experience for children prior to entrance into the primary grades of elementary school. It usually refers to the education of boys and girls from age’s three to six or seven, depending on the admission requirements of schools in the area. Many educators have found that children who have been enrolled in preschool centers develop positive self-concepts and basic understandings and skills that make them better able to apply their efforts to intellectual tasks when they enter school. Preschool education may be provided in day-care centers, nursery schools, or kindergartens in elementary schools. Research and clinical work have found that the experiences of the infant and young child provide the foundation for long-term physical and mental health as well as cognitive development.

In comparison, there are fewer research studies that have examined the magnitude and growth of the achievement gap prior to kindergarten. Earlier examinations of the pre-kindergarten achievement gap focused on home language learning experiences. Following children from 42 families from the Kansas area when they were 9-month-old to 36-month-old, found that by the age of 3, children in families receiving welfare had vocabularies that were half as large as those of their more affluent peers, and the disparities persisted throughout childhood. (Hart and Risley 1995) More recent studies in this area have examined the pre-kindergarten achievement gap using nationally representative data using a nationally representative sample of families in the U.S.  Estimated the math achievement gap between black preschool age children and white preschool age school as two-third of a standard deviation; and the reading achievement gap as just under half a standard deviation. (Yeung and Pfeiffer 2005) Findings from these earlier studies showed existence of pre-kindergarten achievement gaps in math and reading between Black children and White children; however, these studies fell short in documenting the exact magnitude of the pre-kindergarten achievement gap in math and reading across different ethnic and racial groups. (Rock and Stenner 2005) We do know, however, that multiple risk factors place children at even greater disadvantage (Sameroff and Chandler, 1975).

As some states move forward rapidly, other fall further behind. Oklahoma remains the only state where virtually every child can start school at age 4, but other states are approaching that goal. In at least eight other states, more then half of 4 year olds attend a public preschool program of some kind. At other end of the spectrum 12 states have no regular state preschool education program. In eight states, less than one in five children are enrolled in a public preschool program at age 4 taking into account preschool special education and head start programs (Harrison, C. 1995.)  

With the beginning of the 21st century in the world shaped by global competition, preschool education programs play an increasingly vital role in child development and school readiness. This is growing awareness that early learning impacts persist across children’s life span, affecting educational achievement. (Morrow, L. 1990) Federal and state programs will require expansion and greater coordination to finish the job of reaching disadvantaged children with high quality preschool education. Strategies need to be build upon and move beyond targeting to increase middle-income families who find it difficult to access high quality preschool and pre-k programs.

Policy the nation and its children will not benefit if quality is sacrificed to increase participative rates. Higher standards and added resources for quality are essential components of any effort to increase access to effective preschool education. (NIEER)

In conclusion research has provided throughout the last decade that early childhood education is the key to children having the skills they will need in school and beyond.  “We need to bring what we teach and how we teach into 21st century” (Claudia Wallis, 2006)

A cornstarch slurry is a mixture of a cold liquid with cornstarch.  It is used as a thickening agent, and is particularly common in Asian sauces.

A typical cornstarch slurry will consist of 2 parts cold water and 1 part cornstarch.  The slurry can then be added slowly to hot sauces until the desired consistency is reached.

==Ingredients==
*1 tablespoon cornstarch
*2 tablespoons cold water

==Procedure==
#Pour the cornstarch in a cup.  Add water.  Mix thoroughly with a fork.  Re-mix as needed.</text>

I suggest merging [[Algorithm Implementation/Checksums]] into [[Algorithm Implementation/Hashing]].
Each checksum function is a kind of hash function.
Perhaps sometime in the future we will have enough content to split &quot;checksums&quot; back out into a separate chapter -- or perhaps we will decide on a better way to divide it up.

: In general, checksum implementations have very different properties from cryptographic hash implementations, since the former are optimised for speed and the latter for cryptographic properties. But I agree that in practice the contents of this page has a lot of overlap with checksums, and also that lookup hashes have a lot more in common with checksums. Personally I'd support having a page for fast hashing and a page for cryptographic hashing. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 14:02, 30 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pronunciation guide:
''The suggestions in this guide come from a typical American accent''

=== Vowels ===
'''A''' - A doctor asks you to open your mouth and say &quot;ahhhh&quot;. Same principle.
'''E''' - I've encountered two e's. One is a typical schwa (as in &quot;usted&quot; - where the e is just a sound that gets from the T to the D); the other is how you'd normally say &quot;a&quot; in the English alphabet.
'''I''' - how you'd say &quot;e&quot; in the English alphabet.
'''O''' - if you're around Minnesota, or if you've watched Fargo, you know how to make this O. It's just more clipped.
'''U''' - same as the double-o in &quot;boot&quot;

It's ''very'' important that your tongue doesn't move around when you're making these singular vowels. There's a tendency to say &quot;Ay&quot; as in English when you mean a simple &quot;A&quot;. To facilitate against these mistakes, it's recommended that you force your month into a tight grin when saying &quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, or &quot;I&quot;. &quot;O&quot; and &quot;U&quot; are rounded, as in English (albeit less so).

=== Consonants ===
B &amp; V - these carry the same sound. If there is no vowel sound preceding a B or V, then it's made as a regular B. If there is a vowel sound before either, it's a bit different: it's very close to a v, but the tongue does not touch the lips. Instead, your lips are tightened and air is forced through. Sounds a lot like a V that way. Consider it like a &quot;light&quot; B.
C - Normally holds the same sound as in &quot;cat&quot;, unless followed by an i or an e: then it sounds like a regular S. Don't add a puff of air at the end.
D - same as in English, but without much force behind it. It's a light sound, which I'll abbreviated as (LS)
F - Same as in English
G - Same as in English, unless followed by an i or an e. Then it's more of a &quot;ch&quot; sound found in Scottish &quot;loch&quot;. Sometimes the sound is a light G, as in &quot;agua&quot;. I don't have the right words to describe it. You'll get it intuitively if you listen to Spanish speakers.
H - non-existent as a sound. It's all over the place in Spanish, but it doesn't mean anything.
J - This often carries the sound of a &quot;y&quot; (as in &quot;yup&quot;)
K - Non-existent. Maybe a few loan-words carry it... it would take the value of a regular K anyway.
L - same as in English. However, English has a &quot;dark l&quot;, which you'll hear in the word &quot;English&quot;... has a guttural quality to it. Avoid this. Most l's in English (like in roll and love) don't carry that &quot;dark l&quot;; aim for using those.
M - Same.
N - Same.
P - Same, but lighter. Edges a bit towards sounding like a &quot;b&quot;; just don't add a puff of air at the end (as in &quot;pfft&quot;)
Q - Always followed by a u. Same value as a C.
R - uugh... okay, two versions: one is a &quot;tap&quot;, where the tip of your tick strikes against the gums behind your upper teeth. Often sounds like an L or a D, but is distinguishable. If a word begins with an R, it's trilled.
RR - R, only trilled. Can't trill? Practice, practice, practice.
S - Same.
T - Same, but lighter.
V - read &quot;B&quot;
W - Something you'll never need to worry about.
X - this is a bit like a J. If you know German, it's rather similar to the &quot;ch&quot; sound in &quot;ich&quot;, but not nearly as strong.
Y - Same.
Z - Same as an S.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Developing students’ awareness of textuality==

Two kinds of text types: haiku poems and mini sagas, are suitable as texts with potential to raise the students' textuality.

*Criteria for the state of being a text
&lt;br&gt;
What makes a series of sentences or utterances a text? Or Criteria for Textuality 

#They must make sense. (Sentences must be coherent.)
#They must have a clear communicative purpose. (Function เช่น To thank someone)
#They must be well-formed. 	
#They must hang together. (They must be cohesive.)
#They must be a recognizable text type. เช่น Ads, Fables, Letters, Notes, Textbooks, Haikus, etc.

The direct way is to have students memorize thse criteria, but it may not be the best way to do. Alternatively, EFL teachers can use haikus and mini sagas to help them develop their awareness of these qualities.




*What is a haiku poem? &lt;br&gt;

A haiku poem is a syllabic poem of three lines. The first line must have 5 syllables, the second 7, and the third 5.

For example


      The nature of life
      Flashing brightly then fading
      Like a shooting star
      Lin Lihua, China)

&lt;br&gt;

Here's another example:

   Sitting in the park
   The blind man waiting
   Alone, in the rain

   &lt;br&gt;

*What is a mini saga?

A mini saga is a very short story. It must contain exactly 50 words.

For example:

       '''Stronger'''
       
       Song is my friend. He thought he was faster than me in everything. One day, we
       visited  a brothel. He said he needed no protection. Four years later he died of HIV.
       After the cremation, I threw his ashes into a river. I know he is always faster than
       me.    
       
       (Yongyuth Khamkhong)
&lt;br&gt;
Here's another mini saga:
&lt;br&gt;
   '''A Banana Grower'''
   
   While visiting a small village along the Thai-Myanmar border province of Kanchanaburi,  
   Thongdee helped a Karen man from going to jail. The acquitted man gave him a big plot of
   land. The man helped him plant bananas. The plantation was successful; he quit his job and
   became a banana grower.
   
    (Janpha Thadphoothon)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Noach   Genesis 6: 9 - 11: 3

Corruption of the Earth
When men began to multiply upon the earth and daughters were born to them the &quot;sons of God&quot; took wives from them and produced the &quot;mighty men&quot; as their offspring  (Genesis 6:1-4)
Verse 5 goes on, &quot;Then Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth&quot;

It is understood that the offspring from this union of the sons of God and the daughters of men was the root cause of such great wickedness in the earth and the reason why Yahweh had to condemn it to destruction.
Jude speaks of the “angels who did not keep their proper abode” (Jude 6), perhaps referring to and giving us an inspired interpretation of Gen 6.  This view was understood by most of the Jewish sages and was held by Josephus, Philo, and the writer of Enoch. The term “sons of God” is used only of angels and not men in the old covenant.

Yahweh looked upon the earth and saw that the wickedness of man is great, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.  The earth was corrupt and filled with violence, for all flesh had corrupted its way.  Genesis 6: 5, 11-12

According to Rashi, the word “corrupted” has to do with idolatry and sexual sins. 
In 1 Corinthians 6:18 it is written:  “Flee fornication. Every other sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who is committing fornication sins against his own body.”(MRC)
In 1 Corinthians 10:14 it is written: “Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.”(MRC)

That the earth was &quot;corrupt&quot; (shakkat) carries the idea of something in utter ruin.   The sin in the earth in Yahweh's sight, made it abhorrent to Him.   The degradation of human morality is suggested by the phraseology &quot;all flesh had corrupted their way&quot; and that Noach was &quot;perfect in his generations&quot;.   It would seem that Noach alone was of a pure genetic stream from Adam and that the rest had become corrupted by demonic interbreeding or genetic manipulation and their sinful lifestyle.  vv.9, 12


Noach's Righteousness
&quot;These are the records of the generations of Noach.  Noach was a righteous [or just - tsaddiq] man, blameless [perfect -tamim] in his time (generation); Noach walked with God.” (Genesis 6:9).
These two Hebrew words tsaddiq or “righteous one,” and tami or “blameless” and their derivatives are used liberally throughout the Tanakh to further describe the requirements for communion with the Holy One of Israel.  A holy and righteous God requires these attributes in the people whom He uses:  &quot;Then Yahweh said to Noach, &quot;Enter the ark, you and all your household; for you alone I have seen to be righteous [tsaddiq] before Me in this time” (Genesis 7:1).
The Lexicon of Brown-Driver Briggs gives the definition of  'tzaddik'  as  &quot;lawful, righteous&quot;,  and the Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament says &quot;This root basically connotes  conformity to an ethical or moral standard&quot;   See Hebrews 11: 6-7

Noach was a &quot;righteous or just man, blameless or perfect in his generation&quot;.   Noach was not sinlessly perfect, but he was righteous in that he followed God's ways.   Noach lived a repentant life, he followed the commandments of God and he had a personal relationship with his creator.
Many people use their environment as an excuse for their bad conduct.  They blame their bad attitudes on the influences of the people around them and their inability to honour the Shabbat on peer pressure or obligations. However Parasha Noach is telling us that our obedience to God and His Torah does not depend on our location or circumstances.  Our obedience to God depends upon our choices!   

Neither culture, habits of the nation, the surrounding people, environment or  our own family can be held responsible for a person’s way of life.  Each individual has a responsibility to live righteously and wholeheartedly before Yahweh.

“Noach walked with God” – The Hebrew verb 'walked' “hithalech” – is in the “hitpalel” form, which means that it is something you cause yourself to do.  “walked himself, caused himself to walk” – which comes from the same root as halachah.  The word halachah is a noun that means “a walk”.  That means, therefore, that Noach himself was the reason that he walked with God.  It was not an easy thing, he had to stand alone against the rest of his generation.  He made an effort to do it, and he succeeded.  That teaches us that walking with God requires personal discipline.   Noach made an effort everyday to walk with his heavenly Father in relation to His righteous attributes.   By this we can learn that Noach was interested in living out, in a practical way, the commands that the Eternal had revealed to Adam and that applied to all people.  Yahweh's laws have always existed, it was not something new at the giving of the Torah to His people at Mount Sinai.  There is one straight way for man, which was established when man was created. Noach walked in this way, and therefore he was called tzadik and tammim, righteous and wholehearted.

Adam lived in an ideal environment, yet he chose to be disobedient to Yahweh, whereas Noach's lived in the midst of a spiritual desert.   He had to labour for what he wanted, he was ridiculed for his beliefs, he had pressure from those he lived amongst and he had to endure a corrupt and degenerate society, yet Noach chose to obey God. 

The root of all evil lies in man's heart.  God looked upon the hearts of mankind in Noach's generation and every heart he saw was turned to evil.  People are not wicked because of what they do, people are wicked because their hearts are turned to evil intent. 

Noach found grace with God, because &quot;...all that God commanded him, so did he.&quot;  Noach's heart was submitted to the Almighty to obey him and follow His instructions  -  he didn’t use his own reasoning and do things his way.
   
Noach believed God, he had faith in Him and he followed His commandments and lived according to His precepts, as a result he knew God's voice.  Noach spent time with God,  prayed to Him and talked with Him, he meditated upon Him and out of this relationship, Noach could hear God speaking to him.
Noach was ultimately  delivered because of his faithfulness to abide by a standard of righteousness, and the same will be true of those who face the  end-time judgments before Yeshua's return.

Yahweh always works through His righteous remnant.  Thus we see that from among Noach's three sons only one was chosen; Shem and through Shem the line flows to Avraham(Abraham), through Avraham to Yehuda (Judah), through Yehuda to David, through David to Mashiach Yeshua.  Yeshua chose His twelve talmidim (disciples) and through these twelve Yahweh, through divine selection has raised up His righteous remnant.   This process is called Bechira in Hebrew, this is divine selection.


The Tower of Babel   Genesis 10-11:9
Here is the list of generations recorded and the lines of descent within their nations that filled the earth after the flood.  In Genesis 11 we see the extent of evil upon the earth once again.   Yahweh in keeping His word not to flood the earth again, causes great confusion by changing their language so the nations could not function in a single unit again.   The language they spoke was just ‘babel’ (Hebrew - confusion) to those listening.    Babylon means, as called by the people of the area,  &quot;the gate of god&quot;.

Nimrod was the founder of Babel as well as Erech, Accad and Calneh in Mesopotamia and this was the beginning of his kingdom.   &quot;He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh&quot;   Genesis 10: 8-10   He acquired dominion by terror and by conquest and led the people into rebellion against Yahweh. He was a &quot;mighty hunter&quot; (a spiritual hunter) of men's souls against Yahweh.   He established himself as a 'messiah' and commenced the counterfeit religious system which has had its outworking down through the ages in the false &quot;Babylonian&quot; worship of which Revelation 17-19:2 speaks.  He was the original Antichrist figure that counterfeits the true Messiah (Christ).   The false trinity and the Madonna and child have their origin here.   Nimrod of Hamitic lineage was dark-skinned, and all the figures of this deity were depicted as dark-skinned in Canaan and in Egypt where he later established his dominion.  Note Abraham's later concern about his wife when coming into these areas.


Salvation and Deliverance
The covenant established with Noach still abides, (as does every covenant Yahweh makes with man) and every time we see the rainbow we are reminded that Yahweh keeps His covenant with mankind.  
The covenant made with Noach was made with all mankind but a greater covenant exists for those who have peace with Him through Yeshua the Messiah.    

Isaiah prophesies to those in covenant relationship with Yahweh &quot;For a mere moment I have forsaken you, but with great mercies I will gather you &quot;In an outburst of anger I hid My face from you for a moment, but with everlasting lovingkindness I will have compassion on you,&quot; says Yahweh your Redeemer &quot;For this is like the days of Noach to Me, when I swore that the waters of Noach would not flood the earth again; so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you nor will I rebuke you.  &quot;For the mountains may be removed and the hills may shake, but My lovingkindness will not be removed from you, and My covenant of peace will not be removed,&quot; says Yahweh who has compassion on you&quot;   	Isaiah 54:7-10    

Out of the ashes of a degenerate world sprouted the seed of Noach and out of the judgement to come, a righteous seed will come forth that will establish His kingdom on earth and we will have a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness.

The flood of Noach is used by Yeshua and Peter regarding the judgement of the end days. Yeshua the Messiah tells us that the days prior to His return will be like the days of Noach.  Understanding the story of Noach is imperative to properly understanding His words.   The sinful people were not expecting the judgment that was to befall them at the time of Noach.   They were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, and then Noach entered the Ark and the Flood took them all away by violence.    Matthew 24:37-42 - also Luke 17:26-30

As Yeshua's return approaches, God is telling us that the earth will experience a society much like the one Noach lived in.  Noach lived in a time of violence, no one was safe and that is the key word in our society today.  Our national acceptance of immorality has degenerated us into an amoral society where everything goes.   We also have genetic manipulation of plants, animals and human life - the type of thing that brought judgement in Noach's day.

Peter said,  “In the last days scoffers will come, walking according to their own lusts, and saying, &quot;Where is the promise of His coming?   Ever since the fathers fell asleep,  all things continue as they were since the beginning of creation.&quot; 

For this they willingly forget that by the Word of God the heavens were of old,  and the earth standing out of the water and in the water. By which  the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water.  But the heavens and earth which are now are preserved by the same word, are reserved for the fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.  

But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with Yahweh one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. Yahweh is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of Yahweh will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise; and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works therein  will be burnt up.

Therefore seeing all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,  looking for and hastening the day of God.   Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.&quot;   2 Peter 3:3-17

      <text xml:space="preserve">Naval architecture is not a part of marine engineering. According to the definition on this page itself, it is the design, construction, installation, operation and support of the ''systems and equipment'' which propel and control marine vehicles, and of the systems which make a vehicle or structure habitable for crew, passengers and cargo. It is not per se the design and construction of the ship structure, which is the subject of naval architecture. The reclassification of Ship Resistance and Ship Construction is probably in error.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Kinematics of a particle moving in a straight line or plane ==

=== Projectiles ===

Projectiles are objects, like cannonballs, that move freely under gravity along a curved. When dealing with projectiles in M2 we make a number of assumptions:

* There is no force acting horizontally on the particle (such as air-resistance).
* The only force acting vertically on the particle is gravity.

The key to understanding projectiles is to consider the particle in two dimensions, let's call them ''x'' and ''y''. The in the ''x'' direction, the particles motion is unchanged (because there is no air resistance) and in the ''y'' direction, the particle is accelerating due to gravity. For example, a penny which is thrown horizontally from the top of a building will continue to move away from the building as it falls (horizontal motion does not stop as the velocity of the coin increases, it just becomes less noticeable).

The hardest part of most questions involving projectiles is resolving the particle's velocity into the x and y plane. For any angle at which a particle is projected the horizontal component is given by &lt;math&gt; V \cos{\theta} &lt;/math&gt; and the vertical is given by &lt;math&gt; V \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;. This makes sense, as if you have a particle projected at 90° to the horizontal, then the vertical component is given by &lt;math&gt; V \sin{90} &lt;/math&gt; (which is simply V) and the horizontal component by &lt;math&gt; V \cos{\theta} &lt;/math&gt; - or 0. Similarly if our particle is projected at 0°, then our horizontal is V and our vertical is 0.

Once the particle is in motion, you can solve equations separately on the x and y directions. So for example you could use the equation &lt;math&gt; v = u + at &lt;/math&gt; to work out how fast the particle is travelling vertically after it hits a wall 5 metres away.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Feedback''' is an integral part of any group situation.  The K-12 environment is no different.  In the decades preceding the internet revolution, teacher feedback to and with the student was relegated to face to face time or notes scribbled on tests and/or papers. 

= Overview = 
With the internet and electronic copies of school materials making headway into school culture, teachers and other faculty not only can utilize several tools to provide feedback targeted towards improving the students’ work but the ability to offer an atmosphere where students can proactively assess and evaluate their progress.  It is to be hoped that with the arrival of new tools, meaningful feedback can become more relevant, helpful and useful in the lives of students. 

== Feedback ==

=== What is Feedback ===
Before we go any farther with the enhanced tools used for feedback, we must take a look at what feedback means to the instructor and the student as a whole.  In the school setting, feedback is also considered reinforcement &lt;ref&gt;Michael, J. (1975, 2005). Positive and negative reinforcement, a distinction that is no longer necessary; or a better way to talk about bad things. Journal of Orgnizational Behavior Management, 24, 207-222.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Here are some stereotypical forms of feedback teachers and instructors can provide to individuals:
{| claass=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
|-
|'''Confirmation'''
|The answer you provided was correct..
|-
|width=139|'''Corrective'''
|width=432|The answer you provided was incorrect. The correct choice was Michigan.
|-
|'''Explanatory'''
|The answer was incorrect because Carter was from Georgia; only Jefferson called Virginia home.
|-
|'''Diagnostic'''
|Your answer was incorrect. Your choice of Carter suggests some extra instruction on the home states of past presidents might be helpful.
|-
|'''Elaborative'''
|Your answer, Jefferson, was correct. The University of Virginia, a campus rich with Jeffersonian architecture and writings, is sometimes referred to as Thomas Jefferson’s school.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback#In_education  Wikipedia: ''Feedback in Education'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;)

However, using the term reinforcement limits the effectiveness of the overall feedback process.  The several criticisms of reinforcement focus on the black and white nature of promoting positive behaviors while decreasing the negative ones &lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Criticisms  Wikipedia: ''Criticisms of Reinforcement'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Additionally, reinforcement aims to directly correct or promote an issue rather than feedback’s “effect after the fact” (wikipedia, criticisms reinforces) Feedback, on the other hand, strives to improve the current situation. 

According to the ''Academic Leadership Journal'', effective feedback consists of three main parts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academicleadership.org/leader_action_tips/Providing_Students_with_Effective_Feedback.shtml  Academic Leadership Journal: ''Providing Students with Effective Feedback'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;. They include:
* Overview of an attempt at a desired goal
* Objective evidence about present position
* Linkage on how to close the gap between item 1 and 2

Recently, the three step model above has been expanded and modernized to include the role of student interaction in hopes of increasing the validity and usefulness of classroom feedback. Principles of good feedback include&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/York/documents/resources/resourcedatabase/id353_senlef_guide.pdf  Juwah C, Macfarlane-Dick D, Matthew B,   
Nicol D: ''Enhancing Student Learning through Effective Formative Feedback'' &lt;/ref&gt;:
* Facilitates reflection
* Increases dialogue
* Clarifies good performance
* Provides sufficient opportunities to improve
* Delivers relevant information pertaining to learning
* Encourages positive self esteem
* Allows the teacher to reflect and improve their plans

=== The Application of Feedback ===
It is up to the practitioner to bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical applications of feedback while within the digital classroom. According to Susan Brookhart &lt;ref name=Brookhart&gt;
{{cite book 
|author=Brookhart, Susan.
|title= How to give effective feedback to your students
|year= 2008
|edition=Second Edition
|publisher=Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development 
|location= Alexandria, Va. : 
|isbn=1416607366}}
&lt;/ref&gt;, the process of effective feedback is divided into two separate, but necessary spheres of influence. The first necessary sphere is the '''Planning''' phase where the purpose of the feedback is determined &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108019/chapters/An_ASCD_Study_Guide_for_How_to_Give_Effective_Feedback_to_Your_Students.aspx  Brookhart, S: ''An ASCD Study Guide for How to Give Effective Feedback to Your Students'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;. Facilitating planned feedback is necessary for the success of not only the student’s improvement, but also how the feedback is shaped. Planned feedback ultimately has structure and a definite purpose behind it, along with the historical context to directly pertain to the individual student. The second sphere if the application of feedback is determining the '''Delivery Method'''. Brookhart defines the two forms of delivery possible within a distance learning atmosphere that include written and verbal forms of feedback. One common theme between administering both the written and verbal forms of distance feedback is reflecting upon what is being stated. Critical reflection while in the feedback process is a key component to the success or failure of the session. Whether the feedback is written or spoken, it is necessary to understand where the student’s feelings come into play. It must be mentioned that the process of critical reflection is easier while completing written feedback as opposed to verbal communication. However, using the first sphere of planning the feedback session, the negative attributes should be minimized due to proper planning, resourcing and contextual evidence. 

=== Feedback Today ===
As we look closer into the trends for developmental feedback today, we can see there are several trends.  Foremost, unlike decades in the past, teachers and other school officials have started to put more of the responsibility on the students to not only receive feedback, but also provide it to fellow students.  There are several benefits for granting students the opportunity to actively participate within the feedback cycle. By incorporating the student into the feedback process and cycle, many of York’s feedback principles (listed above) will automatically come to fruition. The principles include increased student reflection, increased clarification and most importantly, opportunities to improve future performance (cite).
	
Looking closer into how feedback evolved today, the methods behind distributing, facilitating and monitoring feedback have changed dramatically from the time of paper based and face to face feedback. In this article we will take a closer look at all the items listed, but the changes are not limited to Youtube and video pastings, bulletin boards, email and live video feeds. Before the internet, distance learning feedback was limited to mailing, faxing or telephone sessions. 
	
Lastly, the role of feedback today has undergone a significant improvement in terms of knowledge dissemination over the years. I am sure everyone can remember in the past where feedback was limited by the source it was delivered upon and also the thought process behind the delivery. Feedback within the K-12 environment has undergone a revolution with the information available and the studies completed. With endless amounts of studies easily accessible through a variety of resources like the internet, teachers can increase the effectiveness of their feedback to further improve students’ performance as well as their self-esteem. 

== Tools to use ==
The list below contains only a partial list of distance learning related feedback platforms. As the internet and communications begin to evolve, so to will the tools used to provide feedback. The list below should be used as a guide designed to foster ideas regarding they types of feedback that can be compiled.

=== Youtube ===
[http://www.youtube.com YouTube] has become an internet phenomenon with advancing and promoting the role of easily accessible videos lasting under 10 minutes. The issue with distance learning and meaningful feedback stems from the fact of little physical interactions between the student and the teacher. Youtube, and the videos on it, allow for an increased sense of interpersonal relationships between individuals. I personally think having interpersonal communication is critical for any feedback. With the videos, students and teachers will be able to assess body language, inflection of voice and of course the audio portion of the feedback itself. 

One of the ways in which YouTube can be used in regard to effective feedback is to post the actual session to an individual student, or a group. The students would then be able, at their own time, to come back and view the video. Incidentally, YouTube offers users the ability to limit the users who see the videos, assuring privacy and confidentiality when dealing with sensitive feedback sessions. The user interface for the poster, or virtual feedback administer, on YouTube allows for the easy management of videos and feedback sessions for easy organization.

=== Video Conferencing ===
[http://www.webex.com Webex], [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/livemeeting/default.aspx LiveMeeting] and other video capable conferencing solutions provide the ability for two or more individuals, who would not be able to meet in person, to see and hear each other in a live environment. As service provider bandwidth increases and prices continue to fall, more and more people will come into contact with this type of technology to provide feedback. Video conferencing allows for the same communication to occur that would happen in real life, obviously making this the most useful tool to administer feedback and connecting with a student virtually. The effectiveness of the video conferencing is limited by a couple of key items. The first is the cost of buying the necessary video cameras and subscriptions to video conferencing solutions. The second is the relative speed of the internet. Without a fast internet connection, the granularity and choppiness of the video will cause frustration and missed words on both end. Lastly, as with any distance learning situation, teachers and students must be cognizant of the time differences. Unlike the other forms of communication used in the feedback process, video conference’s live component needs both users to be present for it to be effective and worth while. 

=== Bulletin Boards ===
'''Bulletin boards''' allow for a different mode of communication than videos or audio files in a distance learning situation. Unlike other modes of virtual communication, bulletin boards facilitate a myriad of different options for feedback. Unlike email or videos, where feedback can get lost in the shuffle, bulletin boards archive feedback to ensure the student or students recollection of it and grant the ability to apply it to future situations. Bulletin boards also allow for easy communication between both the teacher and the student to account for any questions or inconsistencies that may arise from the feedback received. Having the discourse between the student and the teacher will ensure the feedback has been assimilated and reflected upon by the student, which has been identified as a necessary component in distance learning feedback.  

=== Email ===
'''Email''' has been around for quite a while and it has become apparent that many people have delivered some sort of feedback at some time or another over this medium. This does not necessarily mean it has been used correctly. Email brings with it the innate ability for two people to easily and quickly connect by way of text. Just as with the bulletin board option, email contains only text, and therefor does not contain the body language or voice inflection which is necessary with any human interaction. With that said, however, email provides two people over great distances the ability to connect and improve upon their skills through the sharing and receiving virtual feedback. 

== Feedback Today ==

=== Pros ===
Distance Learning, and the feedback that is associated with it, can be very tricky to master. As technology improves and as individuals become more accustomed to giving and receiving feedback, the process will become easier and easier. Using different technologies and understanding how to administer feedback in a virtual world will better prepare teachers and students to interact in ways that were previously never thought possible. Distance learning, and the feedback associated with it, has allowed classes to be taught over great distances and through mediums that may or may not require the actual instructor’s presence. Some of the pro’s for the feedback sessions are the accountability the distance learning software allows when tracking and keeping track of a student’s progress by constructive feedback. Additionally, technology and distance learning feedback allows for students to take the reigns of their progress, the feedback sessions and the evaluating sessions.

=== Cons ===
As with any distance learning program, the possible side effects and negative reactions towards feedback have to surround two separate issues. The first being the fact that the direct human interaction is negated by the technologies, distances and time zone issues. Furthermore, the technology puts increased responsibility on the students who may or may not be receptive towards this type of learning. Without the discipline to fully interact, the benefits of distance learning fall by the way side and confusion and frustration can set in. With a detailed training and feedback plan, and with close teacher supervision, both negative side effects can be avoided.

== Conclusion ==
Distance learning has asserted itself among the tools used to teach students. It must be noted that as with any type of learning, feedback is necessary to improve the student and their performance while in the distance learning theater. Just as with traditional class settings, feedback for distance learning classes can be delivered in both written and verbal contexts. It is up to the instructor to take the two forms of feedback, written and verbal, and apply them to existing technology platforms within the digital world. The platforms include Youtube, video conferencing, bulletin boards and finally email. With proper planning, effective feedback can be as useful and successful as traditional classroom settings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:S-N curves.PNG|thumb|left|alt=Wöhler curves of Steel and Aluminum|Wöhler curves of Steel and Aluminum]]

The Wöhler curve, also referred to as the S-N curve, describes the function &lt;math&gt; \sigma_a(N_f) &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \sigma_m(N_f) &lt;/math&gt;.  It is based on empirical results and often represents the median of the data scatter.



A significant interval of the curve can be approximated by the Basquin relation


&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_a^m N = C
&lt;/math&gt;   


Where &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is a constant specific to the test case.


The Basquin relation is often presented in the form


&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \sigma = \Delta \sigma_C (\frac{N_C}{N})^\frac{1}{m}
&lt;/math&gt;


where

* &lt;math&gt; N_C = 2 \cdot 10^6 &lt;/math&gt; cycles

* &lt;math&gt; \Delta \sigma_C = &lt;/math&gt; is the so called [[#Detail Category Number|&lt;u&gt;detail category number&lt;/u&gt;]].


==Detail Category Number==

The fatigue detail number defines the Basquin relation and specifies a Wöhler curve.  The property is often denoted FAT, C, or in mathematical expressions: &lt;math&gt;\Delta\sigma_C&lt;/math&gt;.  


If there are more than one FAT tied to a geometry-type, they refer to different specifics such as weld quality, loading direction etc.  Moreover, the FAT normally corresponds to a fatigue life of &lt;math&gt; N = 2 \cdot 10 &lt;/math&gt; cycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wöhler curves relate directly to specific test specimens and environments.  Test specimens for assessment of the fatigue properties of materials are often small unnotched peaces of material with smooth surfaces.  Thus, the corresponding Wöhler curve represents something that is very dissimilar, and therefore not immediately pertinent to many structural elements in real engineering applications.

One important concept in expanding the applicability domain of fatigue test data is the ''Similarity Principle'' which implies that high cycle fatigue at a local surface is governed by the local stress field.  Consequently, according to the similarity principle, the Wöhler curve of an unnotched material can be directly applied to a notched specimen of the same material, if the analysis is based on the local stress field of the considered regions.  For instance.

&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{fNotched} = \frac{\sigma_f}{K_t}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt; \sigma_{fNotched} =&lt;/math&gt; the nominal fatigue limit of a notched specimen

&lt;math&gt; \sigma_f = &lt;/math&gt;  the fatigue limit of the unnotched reference specimen

&lt;math&gt; K_t = &lt;/math&gt; the stress concentration factor of the notch

It should be noted that experiments indicate that the Similarity Principle is conservative.

Clearly, detailed finite element analysis may yield the local stress level directly, and thus eliminate the need to assess any stress concentration factors.

=Introduction=

Fatigue life is influenced by virtually every thinkable aspect of the applied loading history, such as:

*Stress amplitude
*Mean stress
*Loading frequency
*Waveform
*Loading direction
*Combined effect of complex stress filed
*Chronology

The effect of some of these influences can be quantified with fairly good accuracy whilst the effect of other influences must be regarded in a more qualitative sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Residual stress==
An engineering structure may contain internal stress components that are independent of external loads and body loads.  Such internal stresses are commonly called ''Residual Stresses'' and may be substantial in magnitude.

As was established in the section [[#Influence of Mean Stress|&lt;u&gt;Influence of Mean Stress&lt;/u&gt;&quot;]], a perturbation of the mean stress may have a significant positive or negative impact on the fatigue life.  Residual stresses are in effect perturbations of mean stress, when cyclic loading is present.  Thus, predictions of the fatigue life can be thrown off by the residual stresses, which do not relate to the external loads.

The following are sources of residual stress:
*Pre-tensioned design elements such as bolts
*Inhomogeneous plastic deformation 
*Thermal effects

==Surface Treatments==
*Roughness
*Residual stress

==Fretting Corrosion==
Fretting corrosion is the combined effect on fatigue life caused by fretting and corrosion.  The mechanism is a surface effect and can have a detrimental impact on the crack initiation period, and consequently the high-cycle fatigue life.  However, it has little or no effect on crack growth and consequently plays only a small role in low-cycle fatigue.  

Note that fretting corrosion may reduce the fatigue limit, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_f&lt;/math&gt;.

Fretting occurs when two surfaces are rubbing against each other during cyclic loading.  Fretting corrosion can be significant even when rubbing displacements are very small, -displacements in the order of the elastic deformation of the rubbing parts can have a dramatic effect on the fatigue life.  Corrosion has an important role even in normal air.

The effects of fretting corrosion can be reduced or even avoided by:

*Separating surfaces where fretting would otherwise occur
*Making sure the fretting zone is not also a stress concentration
*Lubrication

==Corrosion==
Corrosion may reduce the fatigue life and fatigue limit significantly.  The presence of liquids such as salt-water magnifies the effect and should be avoided if at all possible.

==Temperature==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

A Homebound Instruction Program is a special service where a certified teacher provides instruction commensurate with a school district's curriculum to students in their personal homes, a hospital or convalescent home, or any other facility not within the bounds of the students' assigned school building.

Students may require homebound instruction due to prolonged illness, injury, pregnancy, or any other type of temporary or long term exclusion, such as a long term suspension.


== Rationale ==

Whenever a student misses classes for any substantial length of time due to illness or any other type of temporary or permanent physical or emotional condition or disability, they are often met with extensive work to be completed upon their return.  This often presents a very difficult situation for students, whose health may already be compromised.  For this reason,many school districts have implemented a Homebound Instruction program designed to meet the needs of these students.  Distance learning presents a viable platform for delivering appropriate instruction on an as needed basis.  

Traditionally, when a student is placed on homebound instruction, a certified teacher comes to the student's home or place of residence for an hour or two two to three times a week.  Assignments are provided by the &quot;regular&quot; classroom teacher.  Although the obvious advantage of this approach is the ability of the student to stay current with assignments, many aspects of the educational program are absent with this method.  First is the absence of social interaction with other students.  Homebound instruction, by its vary nature, is usually between the student and the homebound teacher.  In this environment, students miss out on the social skill attainment which is also crucial for balanced development of the whole child.  Another disadvantage of homebound instruction are the limited types of instructional strategies available in this setting.  In my experience, I have noticed that in most cases, the instruction is provided through a more or less &quot;traditional&quot; means of reading a text, answering the questions at the end of a chapter, doing worksheets, and passing paper and pencil quizzes and tests.  Distance learning would allow for a variety of instructional approaches, including cooperative and collaborative learning, synchronous and asynchronous discussions,and simulations
such as virtual field trips.


== Applications in K-12 Education ==


Distance learning has traditionally been utilized in higher education and industry. It is possible to earn a college degree without leaving the comfort of one's home and pajamas. Likewise, companies use DL as a tool for distribution of training classes, thereby saving costs that would ordinarily be incurred with bringing in a trainer or consultant.

Distance learning has not been as prevalent in the K-12 learning environment. There are, however, forms of DL that are becoming more commonplace in elementary and secondary schools. &quot;Online learning - for students and for teachers - is one of the fastest growing trends in educational uses of technology&quot; (Means, Toyama, Murphy, Bakia, &amp; Jones, 2009, p. xi). Further, in a 2009 survey conducted by Picciano and Seamon, they estimated that more than a million K-12 students took advantage of some sort of DL platform during the 2007-08 school year.


Applications for K-12 education include:


  Instruction for Homeschooled Students
  Virtual High Schools
  Instruction for Distributed Classes
  Interactions with Outside Experts
  Mentoring and Tutoring 
  Collaborative Projects
  Access to Remote Resources
  Staff Development Programs

I propose that DL would be a valuable resource for homebound students as well. According to a 2009 study by Planty, Hussar, Snyder, Kena, Kewal/Rumani, Kemp, Bianco &amp; Dinkes &quot;Over 1.5 million children in the United States were homeschooled in 2007 for reasons related to school environments, religious reason, special needs, etc.&quot; Distance learning technologies offer an immense variety of options for students and parents. Access to the internet opens a wide world of online resources, virtual technologies, and videoconferencing with others.

&lt;u&gt;Example 1&lt;/u&gt;

Phyllis is a seventeen year old high school Junior with special needs. Phyllis has been identified under Missouri state guidelines as MR/Intellectual Disability with a secondary condition of autism. Additionally, she has been categorized under Section 504 of IDEA as ADHD. Because of her impulsive nature, Phyllis frequently is involved in altercations with other students and adults, often resulting in in or out of school suspensions. Because of the number of suspensions between August and October of the current school year, it has been recommended that Phyllis enter a program of homebound instruction.

&lt;u&gt;Example 2&lt;/u&gt;

Sharon is a thirteen year old seventh grader with sickle cell anemia. Due to her health condition, Sharon often misses school. In fact, she has been hospitalized for most of the first quarter. Sharon's IEP team has suggested homebound instruction, in either the home or hospital setting, for Sharon.

&lt;u&gt;Example 3&lt;/u&gt;

Abby lives in a remote area of the Genoa City School District. She is a seven year old first grader who would be on the school bus from 6:30 AM until 6:30 PM. For at least half of the school year, she would be leaving and arriving home after dark. Because of her age, Abby's parents have requested homebound instruction for her during the winter months.


== Affordances of Distance Learning ==

Distance learning offers a variety of advantages for K-12 homebound students, including convenience, flexibility, effectiveness, and efficiency.


&lt;u&gt;Convenience&lt;/u&gt;

Distance learning provides convenience in location for both instructors and students.  Most DL technologies, such as the internet and telephone, can be easily accessed at home. Likewise, others, such as videoconferencing, can be viewed at home from transmissions either live or prerecorded from specific sites.

&lt;u&gt;Flexibility&lt;/u&gt; 

Distance learning provides students with the option to participate whenever possible on an individualized basis.  This would be beneficial to homebound students because they could then view a lesson when a parent would be home from work, and therefore available to help with homework.  Additionally, time constraints would be virtually eliminated, thereby allowing one student 30 minutes to complete a lesson, while another may take an hour.

&lt;u&gt;Effectiveness&lt;/u&gt;

Distance learning is both convenient and effective.  Research studies have shown that DL is at least equal in effectiveness to traditional instruction &quot;when the method and technologies used are appropriate to the instructional tasks, when there is student-to-student interaction, and when there is timely teacher to student feedback&quot;(Moore &amp; Thompson, 1990; Verdin &amp; Clark, 1991).

&lt;u&gt;Affordability&lt;/u&gt;

Most homes have access to a telephone line, wireless connection, and the internet, enabling usage of voicemail and tele/video/audio conferencing.  For those students whose homes are without a computer, district laptops may be signed out for the duration of the student's homebound instruction.

&lt;u&gt;Multi-sensory&lt;/u&gt;

In distance learning, a wide variety of materials are available to meet an equally wide variety of learning styles.  For instance, some students may be primarily visual learners.  These students will benefit greatly from the video aspect of DL.  Other students may be more attuned to the audio learning style.  For these students, interactivity may result in higher achievement.  In any case. a well designed DL platform offers learners a wide range of choices, thereby increasing the likelihood of higher motivation and recall of educational concepts.

&lt;u&gt;Interactivity&lt;/u&gt;

Contrary to popular belief, DL can offer increased opportunities for interaction.  For example, a shy student who is reticent to speak up in class may be more inclined to communicate via email or other electronic means.  Additionally, a student who is lacking in social skills (such as the student in Example 1 above) may, through DL, have the opportunity to practice appropriate social interaction without fear of reprisal.  In any event, through increased interactions, teachers are provided with the ability to more effectively meet the individual needs of each child.



== Implementing Distance Learning ==

   Conduct Needs Assessment
      Course Analysis
      Audience Analysis
      Instructor Analysis
      Technology Analysis

   Outline Instructional Goals and Objectives; Provide Instructional Materials

   Provide Training and Practice for Instructors and Facilitators

   Implement the Program
      Conduct Ongoing Evaluation
      Conduct Summative Evaluation


== Summary ==

The various technologies that may be incorporated into a distance learning platform for serving homebound students may be roughly divided into four categories; print, audio (voice), computer (data), and video.  Each of these categories has a number of subdivisions, and some may overlap into another category.  Any of these technologies may have its own advantages and disadvantages, but each may be implemented at various times to best serve the homebound student.

&lt;u&gt;Print&lt;/u&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter Six: Cicero's Public and the Greek Tradition== 
*Cicero, ''On Oratory'', Books One, Two, and Three

===Reading Notes / Lecture Material===
Cicero. On Oratory and Orators. Trans. J. S. Watson. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois UP, 1970. 

===Ralph A. Micken's Introduction===
&lt;p&gt;
Micken testifies to Cicero's &quot;lost&quot; importance (xiv), and increasing invective against him: &quot;Cicero has been condemned on the grounds of style, called an Asian, a wordmonger, accused of being fascinated with his own verbosity, a stylistic show-off&quot;(xv). Much of this invective can be traced back to the Enlightenment's preoccupation with a &quot;plain&quot; style. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deeper criticism of Cicero regards whethe''Italic text''r he offers rhetorical theory anything original or merely collects and repeats the work of others. Is there anything new in Cicero?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the characters: Crassus is essentially Cicero, but so too, might Antony and Scaevola represent some of Cicero's skepticisms toward oratory (xvi).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mickens on the political climate of Cicero's Rome (the transition from the republic to the empire):

:If we accept the theory so often advanced that rhetoric prospers and burgeons in times when society is free, and reaches its greatest heights when freedom is being threatened, an ambitious orator could scarcely have hoped for a more favorable time (xvii)

&lt;p&gt;Mickens traces Cicero's successes and failures (and eventual demise). The short version: Cicero often chose to back the wrong horse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mickens notes Isocrates' influence on Cicero (xx), and concludes: &quot;In summary, one may say that Cicero, having reviewed the theory of rhetoric in terms of its functions and methods and having examined it in all of its ramifications, returns to the Isocratic emphasis. To Cicero, rhetoric was training for leadership.&quot; (xlix)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can debate how accurate this assessment actually is; my feeling is that Cicero places much more emphasis on philosophy than Isocrates would have cared to--Isocrates seems, to me, to be reflected in Antony's discussion of philosophy in Book II. But Crassus in Book I and III seems to demand far more depth in (Platonic, Socratean) &quot;philosophy&quot; than I Isocrates (although here we might debate whether Crassus' philosophy is Platonic or Isocratic--what does it mean to study &quot;every thing that relates to human life&quot; (207). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of interest to me was Mickens' swipe at Quintilian; he writes, in regards to Cicero's insistence upon philosophy and technique: &quot;How can we emphasize adequately the philosopher-statesman concept without neglecting the admittedly less attractive but still very important matters of language and oral presentation? Cicero did not solve this problem in his day but his comments are useful. Shortly Quintilian was found not to be so insistent upon philosophy for the orator, and the rhetoricians of the empire for the most part soon turned away to the empty stylized approach. There might be a warning here for the scholars of the second half of this century with all of our communications theory, behavioral modifications studies, and narrowly focused research projects based upon statistics&quot; (xxvii).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mickens has an interesting note on the default social constructionism of ancient Rome (see the Duncan quote xxvii-xxviii). The 20th century's work on social construction, and 21st century work on network theory (such as ANT) or even OOO can be seen as recovering this &quot;default&quot; knowledge of how language, relations, and objects &quot;create and sustain social bonds&quot; (xxviii). 
&lt;/p&gt;
===Thinking about the Speakers===
&lt;p&gt;Mickens covers this in the introduction, I think--Crassus is the Idealist Cicero; Antonius the younger Cicero (author of De Invention).&lt;/p&gt;
===Is There Anything New in Cicero?===
&lt;p&gt; See the Meador write up below): possible responses:&lt;/p&gt;
#Critique of Greek learning (specifically, the breaking up of learning into different disciplines)
#Lack of attention to politics
#Emphasis on writing as a method for training
===What is Eloquence?===
&lt;p&gt;Of importance: the question of whether oratory can exist without philosophy? Crassus might put this question otherwise: &quot;should philosophy (and history, disputation, physics) exist without oratory?&quot; Zach: &quot;Does philosophy matter without oratory?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cicero to his brother, setting the stage for Crassus vs. Scaevola/Antonius: &quot;I consider eloquence to be the offspring of the accomplishments of the most learned mean; but you think it must be regarded as independent of elegant learning, and attributable to a peculiar kind of talent and practice&quot; (pg. 7, I.ii)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's two ways to think through this question: 1) what is the techne of oratory (components, etc); and 2) what is the scope of rhetoric (purpose, its place in the intellectual pantheon).
&lt;/p&gt;

===The Scarcity of Great Orators===
&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps an early version of the &quot;Johnny Can't Write&quot; article, Cicero notes in his letter to his brother how few effective speakers there are--stressing that there are even fewer orators than poets (pg. 9, I.iv; this is a theme throughout the book, the proximity between poetry and oratory, see pg. 199). See below for Crassus' remarks on the learning required of the orator--which leaves little doubt as to why there are so few of quality. 
&lt;/p&gt;

===Populist vs Elitist===
&lt;p&gt;
Throughout ''On Oratory'', Cicero is cautious to endorse a &quot;Gorgian&quot; view of style and discourse; much of Crassus and Antony's debate circles around how obscure the orator's reading list should be. In Book III, Crassus makes his rejection of academic audiences quite clear, and remarks that style should be seen in places, but shouldn't overwhelm a discourse. An early indication of the tension that will permeate the text comes in Cicero's discussion of the scarcity of great orators:&lt;/p&gt;

:&quot;This ought to seem to more wonderful, as attainments in other sciences are drawn from recluse and hidden springs; but the whole art of speaking lies before us, and is concerned with common usage and the custom and language of all men; so that while in other things that is most excellent which is most remote from the knowledge and understanding of the illiterate, it is in speaking even the greatest of faults to vary from the ordinary kind of language, and the practice sanctioned by universal reason&quot; (pg 9, I.iv). 
&lt;p&gt;
Antonius's response to Crassus' call for the great Ideal orator; and language reserved for &quot;academic&quot; conversations versus &quot;the tumults of the city and forum&quot; (pg. 26, I. xviii). Antonius rejects the necessity of studying philosophy and defines the scope of the orator as: &quot;I account him a good speaker who could express his thoughts with accuracy and perspicuity, according to the ordinary judgement of mankind, before an audience of moderate capacity; but I considered him alone eloquent, who could in a more admirable and noble manner amplify and adorn whatever subjects he chose, and who embraced in thought and memory all the principles of every thing related to oratory&quot; (pg 29-30, I.xxiv). Notice Antonius' version of eloquence circles around style (amplification, adornment) and does not, as does Crassus's, relate to substance. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Responding to Antonius, Crassus strives to &quot;keep myself under such restraint as not to seem to speak like a master, or artist, but like one of the number of private citizens, moderately versed in the practice of the forum, and not altogether ignorant&quot; (pg. 33, I.xxiv). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crassus: &quot;Your retired lucubrations must be exposed to the light of reality&quot; (pg. 44 I.xxxiv).&lt;/p&gt;
===The Value and Scope of Oratory===

&lt;p&gt;Cicero holds that oratory played a central role in the elevation of Rome over other cities and states (pg. 9, I.iv).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cicero, channeling Isocrates: &quot;For it is by this one gift that we are most distinguished from brute animals, that we converse together, and can express our thoughts by speech&quot; (p. 14, I.ix). Cicero continues to argue that it is speech that assembled humans into cities, generated laws and social institutions, and helped us articulate laws and rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cicero also acknowledges &quot;the Q Question&quot; (&quot;I could cite more instances of mischief than of benefit done to the public affairs by men of eminent eloquence&quot; (p. 15, I.ix). But Cicero argues that such danger is the result of a lack of training--for those well-versed in philosophy and wisdom would be inoculated against such mischief. Hence, there is an Aristotelian ring to Cicero here--to study rhetorical means of persuasion is also to build up a measure of resistance to them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first catalogues comes from Cicero himself in the opening to Book I:&lt;/p&gt;

:A knowledge of a vast number of things is necessary, without which volubility of words is empty and ridiculous; speech itself is to be formed, not merely by choice, but by careful consideration of words, and all the emotions of the mind, which nature has given to man, must be intimately known; for all the force and art of speaking must be employed in allaying or exciting the feelings of those who listen. To this must be added a certain portion of grace and wit, learning worthy of a well-bred man, and quickness and brevity in replying as well as attacking, accompanied with a refined decorum and urbanity. Besides, the whole of antiquity and a multitude of examples is to be kept in the memory; nor is the knowledge of laws in general, or of the civil law in particular, to be neglected. And why need I add any remarks on delivery itself, which is to be ordered by action of body, by gesture, by look, and by modulation and variation of the voice, the great power of which, alone and in itself, the comparatively trivial art of actors and the stage proves, on which though all bestow their utmost labor to form their look, voice, and gesture, who knows not how few there are, and have ever been, to whom we can attend with patience? [...]

:Let us, then, cease to wonder what is the cause of the scarcity of good speakers, since eloquence results from all those qualifications, in each of which singly it is a great merit to labor successfully; and let us rather exhort our children, and others whose glory and honor is dear to us, to contemplate in their minds the full magnitude of the object [oratory], and not to trust that they can reach the height at which they aim, by the aid of precepts, masters, and exercises, that they are all now following, but to understand that they must adopt others of a different character. (pg 10-11, I.v) 

&lt;p&gt;Let us add to the list of precepts, masters, and exercises, notions of standardized examinations, rubrics, and inter-relator reliablities. Antonius rails against the rule books (pg. 27, xviii), but he aligns the rule books with the an over emphasis on philosophy. Note, too, that Cicero's use of &quot;rhetorician&quot; seems to echo the ancient Greek word for &quot;sophistry.&quot; 
&lt;p&gt;
In the beginning of Book I, the skeptic Scaevola articulates a more modest scope for rhetoric than the one expressed by Cicero in the opening introduction (and the one articulated by Crassus throughout the rest of the Book). For Scaevola, the study or rhetoric pertains to juridical matters, in which &quot;the cause you plead shall seem the better and more probable that in public assemblies, and in delivering opions, your oratory shall have the most power to persuade; that, finally, you shall seem to the wise to speak with eloquence, and even to the simple to speak with truth&quot; (p. 17, I.xi). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Responding to Scaevola's depiction of the orator (above), Crassus wonders: &quot;But if you allow nothing to belong to the orator but to speak aptly, ornately, and copiously, how can he even attain these qualities without that knowledge which you do not allow him? For there can be no true merit in speaking, unless what is said is thoroughly understood by him who says it&quot; (p. 18, I.xi). &quot;For what savors so much of madness, as the empty sound of words, even the choicest and most elegant, when there is no sense or knowledge contained in them?&quot; (p. 19, I.xii). Later, Crassus directly refutes Socrates' critique of Gorgias in the Gorgias dialogue:
&lt;/p&gt;

:What Socrates used to say, that &lt;em&gt;all men are sufficiently eloquent in that which they understand&lt;/em&gt;, is very plausible, but not true. It would have been nearer truth to say that no man can be eloquent on a subject that he does not understand; and that, if he understands a subject ever so well, but is ignorant of how to form and polish his speech, he can not express himself eloquently even about what he understands&quot; (pg. 22, I.xiv). 

&lt;p&gt;For Crassus, the scope of oratory isn't merely juridical; although I think this point is a bit more implicit than explicit. Crassus: &quot;For the proper concern of an orator, as I have already often said, is language of power and elegance accommodated to the feelings and understandings of mankind&quot; (pg. 20, I.xvii). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crassus on the scope of learning: &quot;I am of this opinion, that no one is to be numbered among orators who is not thoroughly accomplished in all branches of knowledge requisite for a man of good breeding&quot; (pg. 24, I.vi). Interesting here is the follow up, redargind how one recognizes the subtle traces of training (interesting because of Crassus's close to the dialogue, and his comment regarding Antony that &quot;he did not offend me so much when he pulled our civil law to pieces, as he amused me when he professed himself ignorant of it&quot; (pg. 82, I.lxii; see also Crassus's comment &quot;I am not certain whether you are not really of another opinion, and whether you are practicing upon us your wonderful skill in refutation&quot; (pg. 81)). Resonances, here, of Crassus's comments regarding Plato as a rhetorician, defacing rhetoric?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Crassus, the role of the orator is akin to a technical writer; s/he penetrates into the specialized learning of the expert enough to speak on the &quot;subject with variety and copiousness&quot; (pg. 21, I.xiii). Antonius gives us a WAC sensibility: &quot;but as an orator can speak best of all men on subjects that belong to other arts, if he makes himself acquainted with them (as Crassus observed yesterday), so the professors of other arts speak more eloquently on their own subjects, if they have acquired any instruction from this art&quot; (pg. 92, II.ix). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Crassus, thorough study of philosophy and psychology are requisite to oratorical training, since it is only by &quot;a thorough insight into the nature of mankind, and all the passions of humanity, and those causes by which our minds are either impelled or restrained&quot; that the orator can &quot;effect its object by eloquence&quot; (p. 19, I. xii). (See also I.xv, see Antonius's challenge to this program of study, pg. 37 Ixxviii). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A difference, then: Scaevola's orator is confined to the courtroom. S/he is interested in effecting a decision. Cicero's orator is distributed among all the institutions of the commonwealth. S/he is interested in promoting action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Crassus on the power of oratory: pg. 60 (I.xlvi); another stress upon the ability of the orator to defend herself from enemies (contra Socrates in the Apology) and to move the passions of audiences. 
&lt;/p&gt;
===Cicero's Response to Plato===

&lt;p&gt;Crassus's notes that Plato &quot;seemed to me to prove himself an eminent orator, even in ridiculing orators. A controversy indeed on the word ORATOR has long disturbed the minute Grecians, who are fonder of argument than of truth&quot; (p. 18, I.xi).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crassus notes that the ancient teachers of language were also teachers of morality; he, like Antonius, traces an opposition to academia for academia's sake; the proper channel for learning and intellectual energy is the polis (see pg 207-208, III.xv). Cicero/Crassus's chief villain, Socrates, who inspired &quot;that divorce, as it were, of the tongue from the heart, a division certainly absurd, useless, and reprehensible, that one class of persons should teach us to think, and other, to speak, rightly&quot; (pg. 209). Note, too, the Crassus vigorously opposes the divorce of philosophy from the realms of everyday discussion. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Crassus seeks to restore the study of oratory to its pre-Socratic roots, as a meta-discpline that governed more than juridical proceedings. (see pg 212, III.cxix). Crassus:&lt;/p&gt;

:&quot;The real power of eloquence is such, that it embraces the origin, the influence, the changes of all things in the world, all virtues, duties, and all nature, so far as it affects the manners, minds, and lives of mankind. It can give an account of customs, laws, and rights, can govern a state, and speak on every thing relating to any subject whatsoever with elegance and force&quot; (pg. 213-14, III.cxxi).

&lt;p&gt;Crassus frames his project (and one must think Cicero is loud here), as stealing back ancient wisdom from those who original stole it--see pg. 227, III.cxxxi). Part of this is a program of study that we might call interdisciplinary, one that would re-unite learning and challenge the breaking up of learning into discrete, stand-alone subjects (see 229, III.cxxxiii, the distribution of the sciences). 
&lt;/p&gt;
===The Study of Oratory===

&lt;p&gt;Like Isocrates, Crassus argues that &quot;nature and genius in the first place contribute most aid to speaking [...] for there ought to be certain lively powers in the mind and understanding, which may be acute to invent, fertile to explain and adorn, and strong and retentive to remember; and if anyone imagines that these powers may be acquired by art (which is false, for it is very well if they can be animated and excited by art; but they certainly can not by art be ingrafted or instilled, since they are all gifts of nature)...&quot; (pg. 34, I.xxiv). Here again, the premises behind No Child Left Behind, that every child can succeed and that lack of success must indicate a systemic problem, are called into question by Cicero's Crassus. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of oratory, for Crassus, is grounded not only in natural ability, but also in authentic desire; he tells the young Cotta: &quot;What do you think is wanting to you, Cotta, but a passionate inclination, and a sort of ardor like that of love, without which no man will ever attain any thing great in life, and especially such distinction as you desire?&quot; (pg. 39, I.xxx). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important element of Crassus's pedagogy is his thoughts on writing (see pg. 42, I.xxxiv). Essentially, writing makes us slow down and think. Cicero's discussion of writing here lines up nicely with Ong's &quot;Writing is a Technology That Restructures Thought,&quot; it shows how the medium of writing came to influence the expectations of public speech. What would Crassus have us write? Praise, interpretation, correction, censure, refutation (pg. 44, Ixxxiv). Over and over and over again. In Book II, Antonius also calls for an imitative pedagogy (see pg. 107).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with writing as practice, Crassus insists upon a very broad course of reading; this course grounds the studias humanitas, or Humanities--acting, military strategy, Greek, poetry, history, sciences, disputation, civil law, antiquity, politics. To this list Crassus later adds the more &quot;philosophical&quot; arts (he stresses that these are not agreed on by everyone, everywhere, as were the others: &lt;/p&gt;

:If you think it scarcely worthy my age to listen to those ordinary precepts, commonly known every where, can we possibly neglect those other matters which you said must be known by the orator, respecting the dispositions and manners of mankind, the means by which the minds of men are excited or calmed, history, antiquity, the administration of the republic, and finally, or our own civil law itself? (pg. 46, I.xxxvi). 

&lt;p&gt;There is then a long discussion of civil law as one of the hearts of what the orator must wield, most of the examples demonstrate the power of stasis theory. It also testifies to the influence of Aristotelian ontology, since much of Crassus/Cicero's articulation of civil law operates via ontological definition. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crassus: &quot;Let, then, the end proposed in civil law be the preservation of legitimate and practical equity in the affairs and causes of the citizens&quot; (pg. 55, I.cxlii). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting element in Crassus--he seems to refuse the idea that one can be taught (though he very much believes that one can learn), see especially pg 61, I.xlvi)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Antonius steps back from Crassus's Ideal (and unrealistic?) depiction of the orator (see pg. 64-71); a few highlights from Antonius's response to Crassus:
&lt;/p&gt;
:&quot;Our friend Crassus seemed to me to define the faculty of an orator, not by the proper limits of his art, but by the almost immense limits of his own genius&quot; (pg. 64)

:&quot;...it is necessary for a good orator to have heard and seen much, to have gone over many subjects in thought and reflection, and many also in reading; though not so as to have taken possession of them as his own property, but to have tasted of them as things belonging to others. For I confess that the orator should be a knowing man, not quite a tyro or a novice in any subject, not utterly ignorant or inexperienced in any business of life&quot; (pg. 65-66)

:&quot;for us who are engaged in so busy a state, and such occupations in the forum, it is sufficient to know and say just so much about the manners of mankind as is not inconsistent with human nature&quot; (pg. 66). 

&lt;p&gt;Antonius resumes this line of argument toward the end of his speech, noting that Crassus' long litany of requirements would have &quot; a greater tendency to deter than to encourage&quot; (pg. 80, I.clxi). In fact, I would argue that is Cicero/Crassus's point: the idea is to attract only the most dedicated to the craft of oratory, and to scare away those looking for an easy ride. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antonius represents the pragmatist and the populist; he continues: &lt;/p&gt;

:But the orator, by his eloquence, represents all those things which, in the common affairs of life, are considered evil and troublesome, and to be avoided, as heavier and more grievous than they really are; and at the same time amplifies and embellishes, by power of language, those things which to the generality of mankind seem inviting and desirable; nor does he wish to appear so very wise among fools as that his audience should think him impertinent or a pedantic Greek, or, though they very much approve his understanding, and admire his wisdom, yet should feel uneasy that they themselves are but idiots to him; but he so effectually penetrates the minds of men, so works upon their senses and feelings, that he has no occasion for the definitions of philosophers, or to consider in the course of his speech 'whether the chief good lies in the mind or in the body';&quot; [...] but we seek something of a far different character; we want a man of superior intelligence, sagacious by nature and from experience, who can acutely divine what his fellow-citizens, and all those whom he wishes to convince on any subject by his eloquence, think, feel, imagine, or hope&quot; (pg. 67 I.clii)
&lt;p&gt;
Antonius is clear that reading Plato is something to do behind closed doors, and that Plato's imaginary community is far removed from the proper audience of the orator (not only above, but also at pg. 70, I.clv). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A passage in Book II sheds some light on Antonius's sense of reading:&lt;/p&gt;

:[...] my custom is to read these books, and some others, when I have leisure, not to hunt for any thing that may improve me in speaking, but for my own amusement. What profit is there from it, then? I own that there is not much; yet there is some; for as, when I walk in the sun, though I may walk for another purpose, yet it naturally happens that I gain a deeper color; so, when I have read those books attentively at Misenum (for at Rome I have scarcely opportunity to do so), I can perceive that my language acquires a complexion, as it were, from my intercourse with them. But, that you may not take what I say in too wide a sense, I only understand such of the Greek writings as their authors wished to be understood by the generality of people. (pg 98, see also his resistance to philosophy and poetry, 99). 

&lt;p&gt;To see Antonius's resistance to logicians (deconstructive philosophy, represented by Diogenes):&lt;/p&gt;

:For our mode of speaking is to be adapted to the ear of the multitude, to fascinate and excite their minds, and to prove matters that are not weighed in the scales of the goldsmith, but in the balance, as it were, of popular opinion; we may therefore entirely dismiss an art which is too silent about the invention of arguments, and too full of words in pronouncing judgement on them. (II.cxxxviii)

&lt;p&gt;Note that Crassus repeats this objection, in less forceful terms, in Book III, in regards to Stoic philosophy and even the descendants of Socrates and Plato, for &quot;if we should adopt their notions [that there is nothing certain to be known], we should never be able to expedite any business by speaking&quot; (pg. 211). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crassus and Antonius charge us with the question: &quot;to what extent can oratory exist without philosophy?&quot; (see pg. 71, I.civ). In the introduction to Book II, Cicero comes down clearly on the side of Crassus: &quot;It is pertinent, however, to the treatise which I have commenced, and to this portion of it, to remark, that no man could ever excel and reach eminence in eloquence without learning, not only the art of oratory, but every branch of useful knowledge&quot; (pg. 84, II.i). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Antonius characterizes Aristotle as someone who profoundly recognized the power of rhetoric yet, at the same time, considered it &quot;beneath him.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of Book II covers the elements of oratorical practice. There is a lot of familiar Greek notions here (and one new one, stasis theory, articulated below). Some other highlights from Antonius:&lt;/p&gt;

:&quot;Thus the whole business of speaking rests upon three things for success in persuasion: that we prove what we maintain to be true; that we conciliate those who hear; that we produce in our minds whatever feeling our cause may require&quot; (pg. 114). What is missing?

&lt;p&gt;Book II's (unfortunately long?) discussion of humor, see as representative page 157. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of strategic digression, pg. 175&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crassus's response to Antonius in Book III warrants attention. Crassus stresses that, given the power of the orator to influence public action, s/he must be held to the highest of standards. Clearly, while Cicero might (in the voice of Antony) be skeptical of Plato's rampant elitism, he is not (in the voice of Crassus) opposed to the rigor of studies to be adopted by oratorical-philosopher kings. Crassus:&lt;/p&gt;

:On my authority, therefore, deride and despise all those who can imagine that from the precepts of such as are now called rhetoricians they have gained all the powers of oratory, and have not yet been able to understand what character they hold, or what they profess; for indeed, by an orator, everything that relates to human life, since that is the field on which his abilities are displayed, and is the subject for his eloquence, should be examined, heard, read, discussed, handled, and considered; since eloquence is one of the most eminent virtues; and though all the virtues are in their nature equal and alike, yet one species is more beautiful and noble than another; as is the power, which comprehending a knowledge of things, expresses the thoughts and purposes of the mind in such a manner, that it can impel the audience whithersoever it inclines its force; and, the greater its influence, the more necessary it is that it should be united with probity and eminent judgement; for if we bestow the faculty of eloquence on persons destitute of these virtues, we shall not make them orators, but give arms to madmen. (pg. 207). 

===Nascent Social Construction?===

&lt;p&gt;I borrow this heading from McComiskey's explication of Gorgias. I believe Crassus's response to Antonius (in Book III), his insistence upon style as substantive, echoes the Gorgian/McComiskean/Latourian emphasis on discourse sustaining reality (note: this does not mean that reality is discursive, as we stressed in our discussions of Gorgias). To what extent does Crassus embody Protagoras's fragment? Crassus:&lt;/p&gt;

:Antonius, when he assumed to himself the part of speaking upon those matters which form the subject of the orator's speech, and left me to explain how they should be embellished, divided things which are in their nature incapable of separation; for as every speech consists of the matter and the language, the language can have no place if you take away the matter, nor the matter receive any illustration if you take away the language. Indeed, the great men of antiquity, embracing something of superior magnificence in their ideas, appear to me to have seen farther into the nature of things than the visual faculties of our minds can penetrate; as they said that all these things, above and below, formed one system, and were linked together in strict union, by one and the same power, and one principle of universal harmony in nature; for there is no order of things which can either of itself, if forcibly separated from the rest, preserve a permanent existence, or without which the rest can maintain their power and eternal duration. (pg. 197-98, III.v)

&lt;p&gt;In simpler form: &quot;thoughts cannot be made to shine without the light of language&quot; (pg. 199, III.vi). &lt;/p&gt;

===Stasis Theory===

&lt;p&gt;Crassus proceeds to provide Cotta with an outline of study; the long passage in I.xxxi provides an overview of the major elements of Roman rhetoric. Note: Crassus later stresses that none of this outline is &quot;new&quot; (in other words, he is simply highlighting the basics). Distinct to Cicero (since we did not explicitly hit upon this in our study of the Greeks), is his discussion of stasis theory:&lt;/p&gt;

:first, it is the business of an orator to speak in a manner adapted to persuade; next, that every speech is either upon a question concerning a matter in general, without specification of persons or times, or concerning a matter referring to certain persons or times. But that, in either case, whatever falls under controversy, the question with regard to it is usually, whether such a thing has been done, or, if it has been done, of what nature it is, or by what name it should be called; or, as some add, whether it seems to have been done rightly or not. (pg. 40, I.xxxi). 

&lt;p&gt;Antonius discusses stasis a bit more in Book II, adding:&lt;/p&gt;

:There are in all, therefore, three sorts of matters which may possibly fall under doubt and discussion--what is now done, what has been done, or what is to be done; what the nature of a thing is, or how it should be designated; for as to the question which some Greeks add, whether a thing be rightly done, it is wholly included in the inquiry what the nature of the thing is&quot; (pg. 114, II.cxxviii). 

&lt;p&gt;Crassus goes into more depth regarding conjectural stasis in Book III:&lt;/p&gt;

:But to conjecture they return again, and divide it into four kinds; for the question is either, &quot;what a thing is&quot; as &quot;whether law among mankind is from nature or from opinions?&quot; or &quot;What the origin of a thins is,&quot; as &quot;What is the foundation of civil laws and governments?' or the cause and reason of it; as if it is asked &quot;Why do the most learned men differ upon points of great importance?&quot; or as to the possible changes in any thing; as if it is disputed &quot;Whether virtue can die in men, or whether it be convertible into vice?&quot; (there is more here, too, on definition and consequences, see pg. 225, III.cxxix). 

&lt;p&gt;Richard Lanham, in his &lt;em&gt;Handlist of Rhetorical Terms&lt;/em&gt;, explicates: &quot;Cicero argued that the whole matter [stasis, issue, schematizing what an argument was about] was contained in three questions: does it exist? (Sitne?); what is it (Quid sit?); what kind of thing is it? (Quale sit?). For Lanham, this is the root of the modern &quot;journalist's litany, Who? What? When? Why? Where?&quot; (93). Lanham credits Hermagoras with articulating four different types of theses related to stasis:&lt;/p&gt;
# conjectural, dispute over a fact, was the deed done? 
# definitional, dispute over a definition, what KIND of deed was done?
# qualitative, dispute over the value, quality, or nature of an act, was it a LEGAL deed?
# translative, dispute over moving the issue from one court of jurisdiction to another, are we trying the case in the right court. (94)

&lt;p&gt;Each of these theses emphasizes a different mode of evidence--for instance, a conjectural thesis seeks to present physical evidence. A definitional or translative thesis, however, will need to provide discursive evidence (to demonstrate the legitimacy of a definition based on standards already established). A qualitative thesis is the most open to exploring circumstantial evidence, since it often makes contextual justifications for negative definitions. Think of defending a wife accused of murdering an abusive husband. Clearly, stabbing him in the chest is murder in the eyes of the law books--the discursive/textual frameworks--but can be qualified as self-defense and thus valued as a justified act. Similarly, qualitative arguments can change the ways in which we define things. &lt;/p&gt;

===Is Oratory an Art (or Science)?===

&lt;p&gt;Note that Crassus rejects the idea that oratory is an art (by which word he means, in more modern language, &quot;science,&quot; see pg. 33, I.xxiv). Recall Isocrates's similar discussion in Antidosis, wherein he charges that one of the great mistakes of the sophists is that they claim to treat what is a vital &quot;art&quot; as an exact &quot;science.&quot; Ultimately, and a swipe at Plato, Crassus reminds us that while the question of whether oratory is an art isn't inconsequential, &quot;we must understand that there are other things of more consequence for the attainment of eloquence&quot; (pg. 33, I.xxiv). 
&lt;/p&gt;
===Cicero and Style===

&lt;p&gt;While the discussion of style is generally dominant in Book III, it shows up in Book I as well; Crassus: &quot;one thing there will certainly be, which those who speak well will exhibit as their own; a graceful and elegant style, distinguished by a peculiar artifice and polish&quot; (pg. 19, I.xii). Peculiar strikes as a perhaps peculiar word here (but think through the great orators of the 20th century--can't we &quot;hear&quot; them in terms of style?).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Crassus reminds us that reading is about more than just learning content: &quot;A certain intellectual grace must also be extracted from every kind of refinement, with which, as with salt, every oration must be seasoned&quot; (pg 45, I. xxxiv). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note, Antonius's mocking of sophistry, pg. 90, II.iv. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is important to Crassus, in Book III, is that we recognize that there is no one style--rather, there are many styles. The great orators, self-directed individuals, learn to cultivate their own style (even if, as both Crassus and Antonius suggest, they begin their studies via direct imitation). (see 201, that each teacher learn to discern the tendencies and potential of each individual student). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Crassus's discussion of style is linked to the term &quot;gracefully&quot;: &quot;Him who speaks distinctly, explicitly, copiously, and luminously, both as to matter and words, who produces in his language a sort of rhythm and harmony; who speaks, as I call it, gracefully. Also, there is the key word congruity--the ability to match content and form to audience (this echoes some of Antonius's concerns about speaking to a general audience). See page 207, III.cxiv.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crassus argues that style shouldn't be overwhelming, a little bit goes a long way (pg. 219-220, III.cxxv). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amplification is at the core of oratorical style (pg. 222, III.xxviii). &lt;/p&gt;


===Worthy of Note===

&lt;p&gt;Cicero's discussion of how fear can be productive, how the good orator recognizes the &quot;difficulties of speaking,&quot; by recognizing how much is at stake (pg. 35-36, I.xxvi).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crassus, reflecting on the connections between the Twelve Tables and the philosopher's disputations: &lt;/p&gt;

:&quot;For from these we perceive that virtue is above all things desirable, since honest, just, and conscientious industry is ennobled with honors, rewards, and distinctions; but the vices and frauds of mankind are punished by fines, ignominy, imprisonment, stripes, banishments, and death; and we are taught, not by disputations endless and full of discord, but by the authority and mandate of the laws, to hold our appetites in subjection, to restrain all our passions, to defend our own property, and to keep our thoughts, eyes, and hands, from that of others&quot; (pg 57, cxliv). 

&lt;p&gt;Crassus on Aristotle's disdain for Isocrates, see 232-233 (III.xxxv).&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter Eight: Rhetoric's Medieval Resurgence (?)==
&lt;p&gt;The title for this week isn't a statement it is a question. Do what extent does Augustine promote rhetoric? The answer to this question, I believe, will be imbricated in the Q Question, to whether rhetoric &lt;em&gt;refers&lt;/em&gt; to a reality and transmits Truths already in existence or instantiates reality and transforms our experience of it. &lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter Seven: Is Quintilian Worth Reading? (Or, Should We Just Read More Cicero?)==
*Quintilian, ''Institutes of Oratory'', Books One, Two, Ten, and Twelve

Kennedy (representing a dominant historical tradition in Rhetoric and Composition historiography) sees Quintilian as simply regurgitating the Greek tradition. Similarly, Ong preferences the Greek tradition and treats the Romans as little more than editors annotating &quot;rhetoric's greatest hits&quot; (Logie 358). However, others read in Quintilian robust intellectual work that, while borrowing from Greek philosophy and rhetoric, differs significantly (especially in its goals) from Plato, Aristotle, Isocrates and the rest of the Greek tradition(s). 

Quintilian famously echoes Cato's description of the ideal orator as ''vir bonus dicendi peritus.'' While commonly translated as the &quot;good man speaking well,&quot; it might also be read as the &quot;good man expressing expertly.&quot;

===Rhetoric and Philosophy===

&lt;p&gt;Quintilian is explicit in his opposition to philosophy as the sole ethical art (although later approves of Socrates's martyrdom) and to philosophy's disdain for rhetoric (see preface, paragraph 11). As with Isocrates and Cicero, Quintilian's &quot;perfect orator&quot; is a judge and citizen, one who is equally concerned with his private person and public duties (and recognizes that these are not two distinct things to be taught by different arts). Philosophy, through its disciplinary turf wars, claims sole possession of something that rightly belongs to many disciplines. See particularly [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/2C*.html#21 2.21 for Quintilian's portrayal of philosophers as &quot;trespassers.&quot;]
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Book 11, on Socrates, dealing with ethos, kairos, to prepon, and becoming and appropriateness/expedience :&lt;/p&gt;
:Too much insistence cannot be laid upon the point that no one can be said to speak appropriately who has not considered not merely what it is expedient, but also what it is becoming to say. I am well aware that these two considerations generally go hand in hand. For whatever is becoming is, as a rule, useful, and there is nothing that does more to conciliate the good-will of the judge than the observance or to alienate it than the disregard of these considerations. 9 Sometimes, however, the two are at variance. Now, whenever this occurs, expediency must yield to the demands of what is becoming. Who is there who does not realise that nothing would have contributed more to secure the acquittal of Socrates than if he had employed the ordinary forensic methods of defence and had conciliated the minds of his judges by adopting a submissive tone and had devoted his attention to refuting the actual charge against him? 10 But such a course would have been unworthy of his character, and, therefore, he pleaded as one who would account the penalty to which he might be sentenced as the highest of honours. The wisest of men preferred to sacrifice the remnant of his days rather than to cancel all his past life. And since he was but ill understood by the men of his own day, he reserved this case for the approval of posterity and at the cost of a few last declining years achieved though all the ages life everlasting. (11.1.8-10).

&lt;p&gt;Of interest, too, is the division Quintilian makes between oratory and rhetoric: &quot;For although the orator's task is to speak well, rhetoric is the science of speaking well&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quintilian on Philosophy and its role in education:&lt;/p&gt;
:But we must use the same critical caution in studying the philosophers that we require in reading history or poetry; that is to say, we must bear in mind that, even when we are dealing with the same subjects, there is a wide difference between forensic disputes and philosophical discussions, between the law-courts and the lecture-room, between the precepts of theory and the perils of the bar. (10.1.35)
&lt;p&gt;This is ultimately the grounds upon which he condemns Isocrates--that while he agrees with Isocrates's theories, he cannot approve of his style or practice: &lt;/p&gt;
:Isocrates was an exponent of a different style of oratory: he is neat and polished and better suited to the fencing-school than to the battlefield. He elaborated all the graces of style, nor was he without justification. For he had trained himself for the lecture-room and not the law-courts. He is ready in invention, his moral ideals are high and the care which he bestows upon his rhythm is such as to be a positive fault. (10.1.79-80).

===Quintilian's Strong Defense===
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting passages in Quintilian, an implicit response to Socrates's exchange with Gorgias:&lt;/p&gt;

:Doctors have been caught using poisons, and those who falsely assume the name of philosopher have occasionally been detected in the gravest of crimes. Let us give up eating, it often makes us ill; let us never go inside houses, for sometimes they collapse on their occupants; let never a sword be forged for a soldier, since it might be used by a robber. And who does not realise that fire adn water, both necessities of life, and, to leave merely earthly things, even the sun and moon, the greatest of heavenly bodies, are occasionally 
capable of doing harm. (2.16.5)

&lt;p&gt;The big line, from Cato, comes in Book XII: &quot;Vir bonus dicendi peritus&quot; (12.1.1). A good man skilled in the art of speaking /  skilled man speaking well. a good man speaking with expertise. In the following explication, we learn that the &quot;vir bonus&quot; is intelligent and prudent. There is dedication not to self-interest, but to the commonweal (an excellent citizen)(12.1.14). The vir bonus is explicated further at the close of chapter 9: &lt;/p&gt;
:But whether we have to improvise a reply, or are obliged to speak extempore by some other reason, the orator on whom training, study and practice have conferred the gift of facility, will never regard himself as lost or taken at hopeless disadvantage. 21 He stands armed for battle, ever ready for the fray, and his eloquence will no more fail him in the courts than speech will fail him in domestic affairs and the daily concerns of life: and he will never shirk his burden for fear of failing to find words, provided he has time to study his case: for all other knowledge will always be his at command. (12.9.20-21)
&lt;p&gt;Let us take pause to read, here, Burke's description of rhetoric from the opening of ''The Rhetoric of Motives'':&lt;/p&gt;
:“Insofar as the individual is involved in conflict with other individuals or groups, the study of this same individual would fall under the head of Rhetoric. . . . The Rhetoric must lead us through the Scramble, the Wrangle of the Market Place, the flurries and flare-ups of the Human Barnyard, the Give and Take, the wavering line of pressure and counterpressure, the Logomachy, the onus of ownership, the War of Nerves, the War.” (23)


===Rhetorical Training===

&lt;p&gt;In 2.12, Quintilian is skeptical of hard and fast systems of rhetoric--it is not that easy. Rules are suggestions, but the rhetorician knows when and how to break them. This is echoed in his later critique of Aristotelian ''topoi,'' for Quintilian, the rhetor is s/he who attunes herself to reading the possibilities of a situation, rather than one who memorizes ''a priori'' formulae suitable to any situation (see Byron Hawk's discussion of kairotic techne and specific occasions in ''A Counter History of Composition,'' 206, 258).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in response to the Socrates of Plato's ''Gorgias'', Quintilian reminds us that &quot;there is no such thing as eloquence if we only speak with one person&quot; (p55). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Cicero, we find in Quintilian a passage dealing with the pedagogical advantages of writing:&lt;/p&gt;
:For, when we write, however great our speed, the fact that the hand cannot follow the rapidity of our thoughts gives us time to think, whereas the presence of our amanuensis hurries us on, at times we feel ashamed to hesitate or pause, or make some alteration, as though we were afraid to display such weakness before a witness. 

===Style===

&lt;p&gt;Quintilian is skeptical of Cicero's &quot;Asiatic&quot; style; I believe this relates to his stern manliness and opposition to anything effeminate (see specifically 1.8.2 and 1.10.3, p175). 
Quintilian is also critical of Aristotle's lack of attending to style, or of recognizing style as epistemic. So, we might conclude that he is a goldilocks when it comes to style:&lt;/p&gt;
:Thus the works of the orator will be great not extravagant, sublime not bombastic, bold not rash, severe but not gloomy, grave but not slow, rich but not luxuriant, pleasing but not effeminate, grand but not grandiose. It is the same with other qualities: the mean is  safest, for the worst of all faults is to fly to extremes. (12.10.80)

===Quintilian's Metaphors===
&lt;p&gt;Insipid students:Barren Soil&lt;/p&gt;
:There is however one point which I must emphasise before I begin, which is this. Without natural gifts technical rules are useless. Consequently the student who is devoid of talent will derive no more profit from this work than barren soil from a treatise on agriculture. (p 20)
&lt;p&gt;Reason:man::flying:birds&lt;/p&gt;
:Reasoning comes as naturally to man as flying to birds, speed to horses and ferocity to beasts of prey: our minds are endowed by nature with such activity and sagacity that the soul is believed to proceed from heaven. (p21)
&lt;p&gt;medicine:healing::teaching:learning&lt;/p&gt;
:So too the teacher of geometry, music or other subjects which I would class with these, will not be able to create the perfect orator (who like the philosopher ought to be a wise man), but none the less these arts will assist in his perfection. I may draw a parallel from the use of antidotes and other remedies applied to the eyes or to wounds. We know that these are composed of ingredients which produce many and sometimes contrary effects, but mixed together they make a single compound resembling no one of its component parts, but deriving its peculiar properties from all: 7 so too dumb insects produce honey, whose taste is beyond the skill of man to imitate, from different kinds of flowers and juices. Shall we marvel then, if oratory, the highest gift of providence to man, needs the assistance of many arts, which, although they do not reveal or intrude themselves in actual speaking, supply hidden forces and make their silent presence felt. (1.10.6, p163)
&lt;p&gt;studies:food&lt;/p&gt;
:Change of studies is like change of foods: the stomach is refreshed by their variety and derives greater nourishment from variety of viands. (1.12.5- p195).
&lt;p&gt;learning:oratory::file:stone&lt;/p&gt;
:Again, their epigrams, the sole objects of their quest, seem all the more striking because of the dreariness and squalor of their context, since flashes are more clearly seen against a background, not of mere &quot;shade,&quot; as Cicero22 says, but of pitchy darkness. Well, let the world credit them with as much genius as it pleases, so long as it is admitted that such praise is an insult to any man of real eloquence. 8 None the less it must be confessed that learning does take something from oratory, just as the file takes something from rough surfaces or the whet-stone from blunt edges or age from wine; it takes away defects, and if the results produced after subjection to the polish of literary study are less, they are less only because they are better. (II.12.7-8)(p287)
&lt;p&gt;Ploughing:soil::Writing:intellect&lt;/p&gt;
:We must therefore write as much as possible and with the utmost care. For as deep ploughing makes the soil more fertile for the production and support of crops, so, if we improve our minds by something more than mere superficial study, we shall produce a richer growth of knowledge and shall retain it with greater accuracy. For without the consciousness of such preliminary study our powers of speaking extempore will give us nothing but an empty flow of words, springing from the lips and not from the brain. (10. 3.2)
&lt;p&gt;physician:orator&lt;/p&gt;
:Now, though my reply to these critics will in the first place be a defence of my own work, it will also explain what I consider to be the duty of a good man on occasions when circumstances have caused him to undertake the defence of the guilty. For it is by no means useless to consider how at times we should speak in defence of falsehood or even of injustice, if only for this reason, that such an investigation will enable us to detect and defeat them with the greater ease, just as the physician who has a thorough knowledge of all that can injure the health will be all the more skilful in the prescription of remedies. (12.1.34)
&lt;p&gt;trainers:teachers&lt;/p&gt;
:And just as the trainers of the wrestling school do not impart the various throws to their pupils that those who have learnt them may make use of all of them in actual wrestling matches (for weight and strength and wind count for more than these), but that they may have a store from which to draw one or two of such tricks, as occasion may offer; 13 even so the science of dialectic, or if you prefer it of disputation, while it is often useful in definition, inference, differentiation, resolution of ambiguity, distinction and classification, as also in luring on or entangling our opponents, yet if it claim to assume the entire direction of the struggles of the forum, will merely stand in the way of arts superior to itself and by its very subtlety will exhaust the strength that has been pared down to suit its limitations. 14 As a result you will find that certain persons who show astonishing skill in philosophical debate, as soon as they quit the sphere of their quibbles, are as helpless in any case that demands more serious pleading as those small animals which, though nimble enough in a confined space, are easily captured in an open field.

=== SYNOPSIS ===
 '''struct''' [[../buffer_head/]] * __bread('''struct''' [[../block_device/]] * bdev, [[../sector_t/]] block, '''unsigned''' size);

* bdev: the block device to read from
* block: the block number of the first block to be read
* size: the number of ''bytes'' to read.

=== SHORT DESCRIPTION ===
Reads the specified block(s) and returns a buffer head to the data just read. On error, NULL will be returned.

=== FULL DESCRIPTION ===
The function obtains the buffer head by a call to the function [[../getblk|__getblk]](bdev,block,size) &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;FIXME: '''Implications?'''&lt;/span&gt;. It then checks whether the data pointed to by the returned buffer head is up to date by a call to [[../buffer_uptodate/]]. If not, a call to [[../bread_slow|__bread_slow]](bh returned by [[../getblk|__getblk]]) will bring the data up to date and return the bh on success. This call will suspend the calling thread putting it into the task state [[../TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE/]].

=== RETURN ===
The buffer head to the data, which was just read or already cached, or NULL on any error (i.e. I/O error).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the section Color Models, I think the end sentence is misplaced.  The placement may cause confusion, for the term 'devices' refers to either the hardware or software.  I would prefer to read the end sentence in a new paragraph as a transition to explain 'subtractive colour', that is the current next paragraph.  This paragraph may also explain how a value RGB in software is translated to a value ink that is printed to a mediuam.

I suggest an alternative to the term 'device' is to rephrase the sentence as,

RGB is often the set of values to conform inkjet printers in software (despite some having ink sets that may resemble CMYK inks.)


The reason I have posted a suggestion rather than changed the page is that I think I lack some knowledge.  I would rather not write incorrectly, or decrease the context of the section.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A Boring Lecture==

By Janpha Thadphoothon
*Level: Pre-intermediate to Advanced
*Aim: To create a dialogue or a story

*Rationale:&lt;br&gt;

Have you ever attended a lecture that you found to be a bit boring? I think most students have. I once attended a lecture and it was boring. Other participants, I felt, shared this feeling. We came up with an activity. Our group was sitting around a big table at that time. It was held in a hotel or rather a conference center. I took a blank sheet of paper and passed it around the table. I wrote the first line: “Do you understand what the lecture is about?” The next person to my left responded to my initiation by writing that “How long this lecture will continue like this. Somebody stop that man!”
&lt;br&gt;
The rationale is that a boring lecture can create an interesting story. There are stories within a story. It is a testimony of the ability of the brain to do many things at the same time. 
&lt;br&gt;
We can create a story based on the words or phrases we randomly selected from the other story. 
&lt;br&gt;
*Materials: Notebook or note pad, pencils or pens
&lt;br&gt;
*Procedure:
#Have five to nine students sit around a big table.
#Explain to them that they are required listen to a lecture from a tape recorder. As they are listening to the lecture, they have to share idea by talking about something by writing about 
#Each of them needs to contribute. 
#Share the story with other students.
&lt;br&gt;

*Variations

This activity can be done by having students watch a boring film or documentary on wild animals or frogs. As they are watching, they share ideas and feelings about the film.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creating a Text (Story) from Words from Other Texts==

There are stories within stories, texts within texts.

*Level: Pre-intermediate to Advanced
*Aim: To create a story using words or phrases from the other story

*Rationale: There are stories within stories. Random words or phrases from other stories such as short stories, textbooks, or lecture notes can help us create another story based on our imagination.

We can create a story based on the words or phrases we randomly selected from the other story. 

*Materials: Notebook or note pad, pencils or pens

*Procedure:
#Randomly select words or phrases from stories or reading passages. For example, select every seventh word from the text. Set the target number, say, 10.
#Construct a story based on the words selected.
#Share the story with other students.

*Variations
This activity can be modified to cover other skills.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creating a Story from Photos/Pictures==
*Level: Beginners to Advanced Learners
*Aim: To create a story using pictures/photos
&lt;br&gt;
*Rationale: A picture tells stories. There are stories within stories. Pictures or photos are effective materials that can help students create stories and apply their imagination.

We can create a story based on pictures or photographs. 

*Materials: Notebook or note pad, pencils or pens, photos or pictures from printed materials such newspapers or magazines

*Procedure:

#Prepare photos or pictures.
#Ask students to construct a story based on the stimuli (pictures)
#Plots or words may be provided to support their writing
#Share the story with other students.

*Variations
This activity can be modified to cover other skills.

=='''What is Mobile Learning ( m-learning) ?'''==

Mobile Learning ( m-learning) is a educational approach of use of mobile or wireless devices. Students can m-learning from any location at any time. They can be done within school classrooms, workplaces, at home, in field work and in a bus.

:Mobile tools;
::*mobile phones
::*smartphones
::*PDAs
::*MP3/ MP4 players (e.g. iPODs)
::*handheld gaming devices (e.g. Sony PSP, Nintendo DS)
::*Ultramobile PCs (UMPCs)
::*mini notebooks or netbooks 
::*handheld GPS
::*specialist portable technologies used in science, engineering, agricultural study

:Mobile technology do;
::*connectivity for downloading, uploading 
::*online working via wireless networks, mobile phone networks or both
::*linking to institutional systems such as virtual learning environments  and management information systems

More than 1.5 million mobile phones are used in the world. A half Billion new cell phones sold every year which is more than three times the number of personal computers. In the US, 76% of students age 12-18 have their own cell phone.
USA k-12 schools are banning cell phones while millions of students in China, Japan and Germany are using their mobile phones to learn English.
In Asia, like Japan, has been developing mobile learning system using games to teach. 
Japan m-Learning Consortium defined the m-learning as follows.
&quot;for the office workers who have their outside-work, or for the students to use their time in the train, the technology is expected to be used any place and any time to study.&quot; [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Mobile_learning wikiversity]

More Japanese own cell phones than PCs. English m-learning system has been commonly used and has been a major industry in japan. Ubiquitous cell phone in Japan helps people to move and learn and cellphones now have the power of a PC from the1990's.

=='''History'''==

The first handheld portable computer, Dynabook, was invented by Alan Kay and his colleagues from Xerox Palo Alto Research Center [PARC] in 1968. in 1990's, Palm corporation offered grants to universities and companies who has studied and tested the use of PalmOS platform for Mobile Learning. Asian and European universities joined to tested the use of mobile learning.  Knowledgility made the first mobile learning modules for CCNA, A+ and MCSE certification using the core tools that later became LMA.

in 2000s, the European Commission funds the MOBIlearn project, which is to create a system to support learning using mobile technology. The project team consisted of representatives from more than 15 organizations from seven European countries plus one Middle Eastern country.

=='''Japan'''==

North America is behind in the mobile space. Data service in North America is much more expensive than in Japan. Japanese educational software developers believe more smarter learning software will be created for m-learning.

In Japan, the phone is a ubiquitous platform that uses Java. This creates a flexible environment for applications running on mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), TV set-top boxes, and printers. The Ubiquitous Platform Project has been joined by Hitachi, Panasonic, KDDI, NTT DOCOMO, OKI, NEC, Mitsubishi Electric and Pasco.

Cell phone culture has played a major role in encouraging use in young Japanese. Some cell phone novels became great hits among teenagers and got published as actual books and TV series. The Learning Game Software published for cell phones is now available for Nintendo DS in Japan. Gadget-loving Japanese even created a cell phone college class. The most popular subject used in the Japanese m-learning system is language education. Language education is a huge industry in Japan. 

One of the Japanese m-learning language education programs is ALC Press Inc., a publisher of foreign-language study materials and NTT DoCoMo. 

NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet service has more than 40 million subscribers and lists study and reference sites on its main menu. Last month, No. 4 on DoCoMo's &quot;dictionary list&quot; was Pocket Eijiro (Japanese), an English-language learning site provided by ALC. The Pocket Eijiro site started in December 2002 [http://ojr.org/japan/wireless/1080854640.php ojr.org]. ALC takes a scientific approach. The company carefully examines their learning technology with psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists and information scientists. The company's software allows teachers to monitor their students' progress. Teachers can check out how often their students work, how correctly they answer questions and how quickly they can respond. It uses artificial intelligence technology to find the users' strengths and weaknesses.

=='''Problems regarding the use of cell phones in School'''==

The ethical and moral issue regarding cell phone use is a major topic of discussion in schools in Japan and in the U.S. How should teachers deal with phones in class? Cell phones are viewed as disruptive and unwanted in class rooms. This attitude is similar to the arguments about the use of calculators in schools over twenty years ago .
In Japan, teachers allow students to use cell phones for learning both inside and outside the classroom.  No cell phones can be used in a classroom unless it is chosen to be used as a learning tool. There is software that allows teachers to turn off the cell phone computers during exams or other times when they should not be used.

Use of cell phones for non educational purposes is banned in Japan, where the cell phone is a fundamental part of people's life styles. They should be left in their lockers/shoe boxes unless specifically allowed for instruction. [http://www.japantoday.com JapanToday]

=='''Use of cell phones outside of school, How about using cell phones for a field trip or for a homework assignment?'''==

Cell phones are putting tremendous capabilities. Students can access music, so why not a homework assignment? A lecture? Notes on a painting they're looking at? Commentary on a project that was presented by a student? If students can text message each other, why can't they text message a teacher during a field trip with their impressions? 

Edutopia.org blogs say they exchange cell phone numbers with their students and use them to cultivate strong relationships through checking up on absent kids, helping students with problems after class, and contacting parents. Can cell phones be used inappropriately? Sure, these teachers say, but it's the behavior, not the device, that's the problem.

One teacher set up a scavenger hunt for a museum field trip where students had to send her photos of the exhibits and items on the list over their phones. A physical education teacher sent a homework assignment via cellphones, a video of a golf lesson that students have to observe and critique.

What about the cell phone calendar to track study reminders, homework &amp; assignment due dates?

There is a new iPhone application from Blackboard, a company that helps automate schools and colleges. Through the application, students can check their homework, e-mail teachers and see their grades, all while listening to music and careening through back lots on a skateboard. [http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/dad-i-need-an-iphone-to-do-my-homework bits.blogs.nytimes.com].

Modern cell phones offer a variety of capabilities which are being used effectively by educators.


=='''Cell Phone for personal use and for school work'''==

Laptops are deemed acceptable, but not cell phones. Digital cameras are ok but not an iPod? The  cell phone is viewed as a cheating tool and a platform for cyber bullying, or just to keep in touch with friends and for parents to keep in touch with their children in times of emergency. 

Children do not know when to use cell phones for personal use and for school work. Teachers have to teach them how to balance personal life and school work cell phone use. It is easy for teachers to give students excuses to avoid new learning tools and to stick to traditional, old-fashioned learning styles.

At present, cell phone use is banned in NYC Schools.

However, Mayor Bloomberg announced the Wireless Pilot Program for New York City Police and Fire Departments so that they can quickly access and download information including city maps, building plans and federal and state counter-terrorism and crime databases from police vehicles and fire and EMS apparatus. [http://www.govtech.com/gt/articles/99883 govtech.com]

However, more and more officers are looking at a cell phone screen and laughing when they are on duty and should be controlling traffic. Misuse may be hard to eradicate.

Mayor Bloomberg's message to students, &quot; You come to school to learn, not to play games or send text messages.&quot; However, US secretary of Education, Arne Ducan, came out in support of cell phone use saying, &quot; Finding ways to use cell phones to deliver lesson plans to students would improve education and meet federal guidelines.&quot;

Students have the access to information they want. Is getting instant answers from internet &quot;cheating?&quot; Are teachers teaching students how to get info? or teaching only to memorize? Teachers tend to be threatened by new technology but teachers who cannot use technology could be helped through mobile learning. One teacher commented on a blog that when his DVD player did not work while he was giving a lecture, one student called Sanyo's 1800 number to get a solution. He was so pleased.

[http://www.acu.edu/news/2008/080225_iphone.html ACU], Abilene Christian University, is the first university in the nation to provide iPhone or iPod touch to all incoming freshmen. There are 2 functionalities that make the iPhone useful at Abilene Christian University:

*mymobile application to search for class information like the teacher’s name, and 3D map of campus  

*using Xythos (online document management system) to read PDF files, assignments, and more.

=='''M-learning tools'''==

Some Mobile Learning Tools are, PDA, Podcast, Nintendo DS, Mobile phone, iPod touch, PSP
A PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) is a computer that fits in your hand. Podcasting is online audio content that is delivered via an RSS feed. DS is a dual-screen handheld game console. One of the DS's games,Professor Kageyama's Math Training (Nintendo DS), is getting a great review in Japan. 

The biggest feature of Nintendo DS, as a mobile device for the learning tool, is that people use actual games for study. DS, which developed the package with Sharp, says it hopes to persuade schools to take the bundle and issue a DS to each student. Once students and teachers are connected through the DS Wi-Fi link they should be able to share study materials instantly, with students also filing some work and test answers on the handhelds.

DS is widely used in Japanese k-12 classrooms. The supplied PC software will also make it simple for teachers to keep track of student progress and, theoretically, cut down on administrative paperwork. Nintendo aims to start selling the as-yet-unpriced DS Classroom tool from next February, initially in Japan, with overseas launches likely if the reception is positive.

U.S.A. is also opening up for mobile learning.

M4E software use cellphones as homework assignment tools. Students can respond to tests as homework assignments away from campus.[http://www.messaging4education.com/ messaging4education.com]

Muppet Elmo, on the children's television show Sesame Street, is recommending cell phones for children. According to a recent PBS KIDS Ready To Learn Study in October 19, 2006, Parents reported that videos of Sesame Street’s “Learning Letters with Elmo” streamed on cell phones by GoTV Network increased literacy skills among preschoolers [http://pbskids.org//read/images/pdf/PBS_CPS_Report.pdf pbskids.org]

The iPod, the most ubiquitous student tool in America, is enabling students to tap into lectures on their own time, and in the K–12 space, podcasting is opening up the classroom to parents and to the community.

:Below are some  of the activities that utilize mobile devices for learning outcomes.;
::*Assist teachers and students in scheduling tasks and appointments
::*Digital Storytelling
::*Phone Casting
::*Photo sharing
::*Mobile Video casting
::*Google SMS
::*iTunes U
::*Surveys/Polls
::*homework Alerts ; such as [http://homeworknow.com/ homeworknow ]

=='''The future of m-learning'''==

Educators and cognitive scientists need to explore what mobiles technology for learning means, and start to get an idea of mobile technology as capable of supporting us to enhance students' learning experience.

K-12 students in USA and Japan --- this is a generation that does not have to be taught how to use these mobile communication devices. Unlike PCs,it is not difficult for teachers to learn how to use mobile communication tools. Students have their own cell phone and they are very motivated to use them as a learning tool. Teachers have to teach children when to use and when not to use cell phones in schools.

Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein has launched the NYC21C initiative in May 2009. The NYC Department of Education is considering the use of cell phones as an educational tool because cell phones are more affordable and accessible than PCs. Both in Japan and U.S., tech-loving teachers are expected to soon be distributing material over the cell phone, and polling students in the class to see how they are progressing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tied notes are two notes in different measures that are played as one continuous note. A group of tied notes is written as two or more separate notes held together by a curved line call a tie. For example, if a composer wants to write a note that gets eight beats in 4/4 time, he would write to whole notes (four beats) in two measures and connect them with a tie. He could do the same with one more whole note to make a note with twelve beats, and so on and so forth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Tiicoo:AFSKRB:Draft:Nav | User:Tiicoo/AFSKRB/KerberosConfig | Configuration Of Kerberos | User:Tiicoo/AFSKRB/AFSBasics | Basic Operations in an AFS cell}}

As Kerberos is running we may start with a basic configuration of Kerberos.

__TOC__

== Connect Kerberos REALM with an AFS cell ==

First of all we have to find out where the AFS configuration files are located. We can do so by typing

 bos setcellname -server torpedo-bay.secure.ilm -name secure.ilm

In case you did not copy necessary files like &lt;code&gt;ThisCell&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;CellServDB&lt;/code&gt; you will get an error message like
 root@torpedo-bay:/usr/etc# bos setcellname -server torpedo-bay.secure.ilm -name secure.ilm
 bos: can't open cell database (/usr/etc/openafs)

Hence you have to find the file &lt;code&gt;CellServDB&lt;/code&gt; in your OpenAFS distribution. If you found it copy to the relevant location give by the above command - in this case &lt;code&gt;/usr/etc/openafs&lt;/code&gt;. The file &lt;code&gt;CellServDB&lt;/code&gt; contains many global OpenAFS servers. Logically it will not know our servers. Therefore we have to add our server by appending

 &gt;secure.ilm #'secure' cell
 192.168.2.10 #torpedo-bay.secure.ilm

to &lt;code&gt;CellServDB&lt;/code&gt;. Now you have two possibilities telling AFS software what your cellname is. It can be done by either setting environment variable &lt;code&gt;AFSCELL=&quot;secure.ilm&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or by
 echo secure.ilm &gt; ThisCell

If you are nosy and would like to test the command &lt;code&gt;bos setcellname -server torpedo-bay.secure.ilm -name secure.ilm&lt;/code&gt; again you will the errors like
 bos: a pioctl failed (getting tickets)
 bos: running unauthenticated

As we did not tell AFS which tickets to get we will not receive tickets either.
'''Note:''' Some AFS packages need a subdirectory &lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; in the configuration directory containg the files &lt;code&gt;ThisCell&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CellServDB&lt;/code&gt; again.

We will add a keytab to the basic overseer by using the following command
 asetkey add 0 /etc/kdc/kdc.keytab.afs afs/secure.ilm

Number &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is necessary because keys are enumerated. In case you already added some keys to your AFS database you should use a number different from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.
If everything is OK you should see something like
 root@torpedo-bay:/usr/src# asetkey list
 kvno    0: key is: 20988f61dae6516e
 All done.

==Create one volume for the salvager and the file server==
In case you already know how many volumes you are going to need you can create the directories &lt;code&gt;/vicep[a-zA-Z]&lt;/code&gt;
Anyway the Salvager needs &quot;something to look at&quot;. In case you have a free partition or your volume manager is able to provide some free space create a file system on that partition and mount it on &lt;code&gt;/vicepa&lt;/code&gt;. In case you will have many small or sparse files you can use ReiserFS or result common comparissons on file systems to decide which file system to use.

==Start an initial cell structure==

As configuration of basic authentication via Kerberos is done we will start the basic overseer without authentication because we will ... . Please be aware that a continuous operation in this mode is not recommended because of security issues.

The basic overseer can be started by 
 bosserver -noauth

We know from chapter [[User:Tiicoo:AFSKRB:Overview|Overview on Kerberos and OpenAFS]] that AFS consists of many small components providing high funcionality. For now we will configure the basic overseer and the protection server in order to get basic functionality.
At first we will connect the host &lt;code&gt;torpedo-bay.secure.ilm&lt;/code&gt; with the cell &lt;code&gt;torpedo-bay.secure.ilm&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;bos create&lt;/code&gt; command. We have a look at all possible options here

One important service is the protection server. It is responsible for user accounting. We add the server by
 '''bos create torpedo-bay.secure.ilm ptserver simple /usr/libexec/openafs/ptserver -cell secure.ilm -noauth'''

Of course we have a look at the current status by
 root@torpedo-bay:~# '''bos listhosts -cell secure.ilm -server torpedo-bay.secure.ilm'''
 bos: a pioctl failed (getting tickets)
 bos: running unauthenticated
 Cell name is secure.ilm
     Host 1 is torpedo-bay.secure.ilm

The volume location server can be added by
 root@torpedo-bay:~# '''bos create torpedo-bay.secure.ilm vlserver simple /usr/libexec/openafs/vlserver -cell secure.ilm -noauth'''

The next step should be adding an administrator to your cell by
 '''pts createuser -name afsadmin -cell secure.ilm -noauth'''
 User afsadmin has id 1

Because the protection server needs to know that the user &lt;code&gt;afsadmin&lt;/code&gt; is supposed to be a very powerful user we add it to the administrators group by
 pts adduser afsadmin system:administrators -cell secure.ilm -noauth

Please be aware of the fact that adding the user to the protection server the basic overseer does not yet know that user.
 bos adduser torpedo-bay.secure.ilm afsadmin -noauth
changes that.
As the protection servers and volume location servers are already running we have to start the fileserver, volume server and the salvager by
 bos create torpedo-bay.secure.ilm fs fs /usr/libexec/openafs/fileserver /usr/libexec/openafs/volserver /usr/libexec/openafs/salvager -cell secure.ilm

We may now shutdown and restart the basic overseer by
 bos shutdown torpedo-bay.secure.ilm -noauth
 killall bosserver
 bosserver

==Initialize the Cache Manager and related daemons==
Because the Cache Manager needs some space for caching files and of course for caching the AFS tokens we have to find a directory serving our requirements. Please be aware that the cache size may not be above 95% of the disk space provided by the partition the cache directory is located at. The file &lt;code&gt;cacheinfo&lt;/code&gt; is structed as follows:
 &lt;cache directory&gt;:&lt;file caching directory&gt;:&lt;disk space to be utilized&gt;
 /var/openafs:/afs:5873470

The size of the partition could be &lt;code&gt;6182660&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;6182660*0.95=4873527&lt;/code&gt;. Tokens are cached in the directory &lt;code&gt;/var/openafs/&lt;/code&gt; and the cache for files located in the directory &lt;code&gt;/afs&lt;/code&gt; with 5.9GiB of disk space. Because our cache manager uses AFS system calls we have to provide the cache manager with the appropriate API by loading the kernel module &lt;code&gt;libafs&lt;/code&gt;.

Now we can start the cache manager by
 afsd -verbose
At the beginning we will use the verbose option in order to recognize errors related to a possible misconfiguration. Furthermore you can now watch the logs of the daemons. If you do not know where your daemons log actions do
 lsof | grep afs
or
 lsof | grep bos
You will see opened files on your hard disk and sockets. Find out which files are being used for logging.

&lt;big&gt;'''Carcinoma of the Appendix'''&lt;/big&gt;

This chapter is about carcinomas only. For '''carcinoid''' tumors of the appendix, see [[Radiation Oncology/Carcinoid/Appendix|Carcinoid of the appendix]]

==Staging==
Was added as a separate classification starting with the 7th edition of the AJCC Staging Manual.  Previously, this was staged using the colorectal staging system.

Carcinoid tumors of the appendix are staged separately.

'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)'''&lt;br&gt;
''Tumor''
*Tis - carcinoma in situ
*T1 - invasion of submucosa
*T2 - invasion of muscularis propria
*T3 - invasion through muscularis propria into subserosa or into mesoappendix
*T4
**T4a - penetrates visceral peritoneum, including mucinous peritoneal tumor within the right lower quadrant
**T4b - directly invades other organs or structures (includes invasion of other segments of the colorectum by way of the serosa)
''Nodes''
*N0 - no regional lymph node metastasis
*N1 - metastasis in 1-3 regional LN
*N2 - metastasis in 4 or more LN
''Distant Metastasis''
*M0 - none
*M1 - distant metastasis
**M1a - intraperitoneal metastasis beyond the right lower quadrant, including pseudomyxoma peritonei
**M1b - nonperitoneal metastasis
&lt;br&gt;
''Stage grouping''
*I - T1-2 N0
*IIA - T3 N0
*IIB - T4a N0

==Staging==
Was added as a separate classification starting with the 7th edition of the AJCC Staging Manual. Carcinoids were not previously classified by the AJCC. 

There is a separate staging system for carcinomas arising within the appendix. Carcinoid tumors arising in other segments of the gastrointestinal tract are staged separately.

''Primary Tumor''
*T1 - 2 cm or less
**T1a - 1 cm or less
**T1b - &gt;1 cm and 2cm or less
*T2 - &gt;2 cm and 4 cm or less, or with extension to the cecum
*T3 - &gt;4 cm, or with extension to the ileum
*T4 - directly invades other adjacent organs or structures (e.g., abdominal wall, skeletal muscle; penetration of the mesoappendix is not included)
''Regional Lymph Nodes''
*N0 - none
*N1 - yes
''Distant Metastasis''
*M0 - none
*M1 - yes
''Stage Grouping''

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Many Ways to Tell The Same Story===

*Aim: To practice writing using different genres

*Rational: Texts are fluid and can be deconstructed. Students need to be made aware that texts can be recontextualized. In short, there are many ways to tell the same stuff.

Materials: pens, paper, brains

*Steps 

#Select a fable (can be any generic type of texts such as news articles or short stories)
# Ask students to shorten it, making it as short as a mini saga --- exactly 50 words.
#Correct their wording and grammar. Make sure that it is a mina saga!
#Read and discuss.
#Ask them to transform a mini saga to a Janpanese-style syllabic poem or haiku (5-7-5).
#Read and share.

'''Example:'''

''The North Wind and the Sun''

The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak. 
They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. 
Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his cloak. 
And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.  (113 words)


''The North Wind and the Sun (Mini Saga: 50 words)''

The North Wind and the Sun decided to compete to see who was stronger.  
Whichever could make a man take off his cloak would win.  
The wind blew and blew, but the man wrapped his cloak tighter around him.  
Then the sun shone, and the man took off his cloak.


''Haikunized Text''


         The Sun, not the wind (5)
           Makes the man take off his cloak (7)
            Kindness triumphs force (5)

Note: You may choose to dramatize this fable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Important Terms==

'''Flashbacks''': In fiction, a flashback refers to a way of representing an incident or scene that took place before the opening scene.

'''Dialog Tag''': A dialog tag describes what a character has said. For example:

Mark said, &quot;I'm going to bed.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
Cindy said,&quot;So am I.&quot;

He said and She said are dialog tags.

'''Internal dialog''': A character's internal dialog is when he or she speaks to himself/herself. For example:

What do we do now? Karen wondered.

'''Characters''': people or human beings

'''Voices''': In a short story or novel, a voice is an answer to the question: Who is telling the story?

'''Rhyme''': Similarity between syllable sounds at the end of two or more lines. For example, a couplet is a pair of lines rhyming consecutively. 

'''Meter''': a rhythm of accented and unaccented syllables which are organized into patterns, called feet. The most common meters are (1) Iambic (a foot consisting of an unaccented and accented syllable, e.g. 'To be or not to be by Shakespeare' --- Come live with me and be my love by Marlowe), (2)Trochaic --- a foot consisting of an accented and unaccented syllable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==
The first steps to creating UC San Diego took place in the 1950s. The Board of Regents of the University of California voted to create a graduate school in La Jolla in 1956. This school was originally planned to be a school of science and engineering and was to be closely connected to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The first graduate students arrived in 1960. Eventually it was decided that a general campus of the University of California was to be built rather than just a graduate school. More land was acquired, more facilities built and more faculty hired to make this a reality. The first undergraduate students arrived in 1964. They were the first class of First College, which was renamed Revelle College the next year to honor Roger Revelle, one of the most important figures in the founding of UC San Diego. John Muir College accepted its first class in 1967 and Third College (later renamed Thurgood Marshall College) accepted its first students in 1970. Earl Warren College accepted its first students in 1974 and Eleanor Roosevelt College accepted its first students in 1988. Finally, Sixth College accepted its first students in 2002. Today, UC San Diego is an important public university in the University of California system.

==Academic Year==
At UC San Diego, the academic year is divided into quarters. Each quarter has ten weeks of instruction followed by a week devoted to final exams. The academic year begins with Fall Quarter, which starts in late September each year. After the Fall Quarter ends in December, there is a break before Winter Quarter begins in January. Spring Break divides Winter Quarter from Spring Quarter. Students can take classes during the summer as well as during the regular academic year. Summer is divided into Summer Session 1 and Summer Session 2. Each of these summer sessions in five weeks long so instructors compress a regular ten week course into only five weeks. A summer session course has twice as many weekly hours of instruction as a regular quarter course so students spend as many hours in class during a summer session as they do for a regular quarter course. There is also a Special Session for summer courses that have a different length than the regular Summer Session courses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Parking Office==
The Parking Office is on the first level of the Gilman Parking Structure and the door to this office opens to Russell Lane.[http://maps.ucsd.edu/Viewer.htm?Zoom=5&amp;Map=Parking&amp;O.x=1079&amp;O.y=880&amp;Cmnd=Mgfy&amp;View=Medium&amp;P.x=184&amp;P.y=171] At the beginning of each quarter, many students need to go to the parking office and a very long line forms at times so incoming students should plan for this. Students can buy parking permits here and also at the UCSD Bookstore.[http://bookstore.ucsd.edu/parkingpermits.htm]

==Shuttles==
There are several free shuttle routes that students can use.[http://blink.ucsd.edu/facilities/transportation/shuttles/index.html] There are two Campus Loop routes (clockwise and counterclockwise) that run throughout the day and evening. As its name states, it runs in a big loop around the main campus. There is an East/Regents route that runs from the Price Center East to East parking lot and Regents parking lot and back throughout the day and evening. There is a Mesa Housing shuttle that runs from the Mesa apartments to the main campus and back. These shuttles run Monday through Friday during the academic quarter.

==Free Bus Route Sticker==
Several public bus routes are free to UC San Diego students. These include MTS/NCTD routes 30, 41, 101, 150, 201, 202 and 921. To ride these buses for free, students must to go to the Parking Office and get a sticker attached to their Student ID. These stickers are good for one full year and enrolled students can get a new sticker each year they are a student at UC San Diego.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Plays(From text to performance)'''

EFL students should be encouraged to write a simple play and perform it.
This is a step for them to raise their awareness of textuality and intertextuality.
 
Any activity that allows them to cross-over from one medium (playscript) to the next (play) should be useful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
A '''pronoun''' replaces a noun in a sentence. The noun that is replaced is called an antecedent.

Pronouns can be classified in following different ways:

==Types of Pronoun==

===Personal Pronoun===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Type||Nominative||Possessive||Objective||Possessive Noun
|-
| rowspan=&quot;5&quot; | Singular || First Person || I || my || me || mine
|-
|| Second Person || you || your || you || yours
|-
| rowspan=&quot;3&quot; | Third Person ||he||his||him||his
|-
||she||her||her||hers
|-
||it||its||it||its
|-
| rowspan=&quot;3&quot; |Plural||First Person||we||our||us||ours
|-
|| Second Person || you || your || you || yours
|-
|| Third Person || they||their||them||theirs
|-
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Interrogative||who||whose||whom||whose
|}
Note: The possessive forms ''my, your, his, her, its,'' ''our'' and ''their'' function as adjectives when they modify a noun.

====Cases of Personal Pronouns====
#'''Nominative case''' - the pronoun is used as a subject or predicate nominative/subjective complement.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Example:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ''I'' am beautiful.(subject)&lt;/br&gt;The winner is ''she''.(predicate nominative/subjective complement)
#'''Objective case''' - the pronoun is used as a direct object, indirect object or object of the preposition. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Example:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/br&gt; We met ''them'' in Florida. (direct object) &lt;/br&gt; You have to award ''him'' the medal. (indirect object)&lt;/br&gt; Are you finally going out with ''her''? (object of the preposition)
#'''Possessive case''' - the pronoun is used to show ownership or possession. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Example:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/br&gt;That folder is ''mine''.&lt;/br&gt;These paintings are ''theirs''.
===Compound Personal Pronouns===
Compound personal pronouns are formed by adding -self or -selves to some personal pronouns.
====Reflexive Pronoun====
'''Reflexive pronoun''' may be used as a direct object or indirect object. It usually comes after the verb.
====Intensive Pronoun====
'''Intensive pronoun''' is used to emphasize that the action is done by the antecedent.
=====List of Reflexive and Intensive Pronouns=====
&lt;center&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 |'''Person'''
 |'''Singular'''
 |'''Plural'''
 |-
 |'''First Person'''
 |myself
 |ourselves
 |-
 |'''Second Person'''
 |yourself
 |yourselves
 |-
 |'''Third Person'''
 |himself, herself, itself
 |themselves
 |}
&lt;/center&gt;

===Relative Pronouns===
Relative pronouns like that, which, who, whom and whose are used to introduce most adjective clauses and to connect them to the main clause.
* That refers to either a person, animal or thing.
* Which refers to animals or things.
* Who refers to persons. It is usually used when the noun it refers to is the doer of the action or when the noun it refers to is the subject within the clause.
* Whom refers to persons. It is usually used when the noun or pronoun it refers to is the receiver of the action or when the noun or pronoun is used as the object within the clause.
* Whose refers to persons, animals or things. It is used to denote possession.

===Demonstrative Pronouns===
Demonstrative pronouns like this, that, these and those are used to point out specific persons or things.

===Interrogative Pronouns===
Interrogative pronouns are used to ask questions. They are who, whom, whose, which and what.

===Indefinite Pronouns===
Indefinite pronouns are pronouns that do not refer to a particular person or group of persons.
====Singular Indefinite Pronouns====

{{displaytitle|title=Cookbook:{{lang|es|Ají de Gallina}}}}

''{{lang|es|Ají de Gallina}}'' (Spanish for chili pepper chicken) is a traditional Peruvian dish which has its roots in the social upheaval of the French Revolution in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;[http://friendseat.com/Aji-de-Gallina-Recipe Info on ''ají de gallina'' recipe on the Friends Eat website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chefs working for wealthy families lost their jobs after French aristocrats were imprisoned and executed. Some of these chefs travelled to the New World, including Peru, bringing with them French culinary expertise. Wealthy Peruvian creole families hired them to demonstrate their wealth to the ruling Spaniards. The fusion of local cuisines with French cooking traditions led to many new recipes,  including ''ají de gallina''. 

This is a shredded chicken dish in a spicy sauce flavored with cheese, garlic, nuts and Peruvian chili peppers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grouprecipes.com/29399/aji-de-gallina.html Info on ''ají de gallina'' recipe on the Group Recipes website]&lt;/ref&gt; Peruvians love eating this dish on cold days.

{{recipesummary|Clam recipes|6|90 minutes|1|Image=[[Image:ManhattanClamChowder.jpg|300px]]}}

'''Manhattan clam chowder''' is a soup traditionally made from clams, pork, herbs, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Despite its name, it originated in ''[[w:Rhode Island|Rhode Island]],'' '''NOT''' [[w:Manhattan|Manhattan]].
 
Clam chowder, in its cream-based, [[Cookbook:New England Clam Chowder|New England version]], has existed since the mid-18th Century, and no mention of any Manhattan chowder has been found that predates the 1930s.{{fact}} Many restaurants in northern Rhode Island sell both red and white chowders, while the US southern coast favors clear and white chowders. Often they are served alongside [[wikipedia:clam cake|clam cakes]].

According to [[w:Alton Brown|Alton Brown]], who pointed this out in the installment of his program ''[[w:Good Eats|Good Eats]]'' titled &quot;Send In The Clams,&quot; the use of tomatoes instead of milk was initially the work of [[wikipedia:Portugal|Portuguese]] immigrants in Rhode Island, as tomato-based stews were already a traditional part of Portuguese cuisine. [[w:New Englanders|New Englanders]] called this modified version Manhattan-style clam chowder as a [[w:pejorative|pejorative]] because, in their snide view, calling someone a [[w:New York|New Yorker]] was an insult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcnEL8Ym4I&amp;feature=related ''Good Eats'' episode titled &quot;Send In The Clams.&quot;]{{Dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipe I== 
===Ingredients===
* 15 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] (425 [[Cookbook:gram|g]]) canned [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], or 2 small boiled potatoes
* 28 ounce (794 g) canned [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] in juice, or 2 large tomatoes and tomato juice
* 6.5 ounce (184 g) canned chopped [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]], minimum
* 2 stalks of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]

===Procedure===
#Core the tomatoes. Remove the pale parts and the seeds; the &quot;meat&quot; of the tomato will be what will be used. For canned tomatoes, a strainer will be helpful.
#Chop all non-clam ingredients to match the clams in size.
#Optionally add spices. Suggestions offered include [[Cookbook:Dill|dill seed]], [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], [[Cookbook:Celery|celery seed]], [[Cookbook:Tarragon|tarragon]], [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]], and/or fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]. Alternatively, [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] can be used in lieu of the marjoram.
#Cook the chowder, without boiling, till the celery begins to soften.

===Variations===
A sturdy type of [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] can be used in place of the clams; good choices include [[wikipedia:catfish|catfish]], tilapia, and pollock. Also, cooked [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] can be substituted for the potatoes, the celery can be replaced with [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] or [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]], or [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] can be added.

==Recipe II==
===Ingredients===
* 2 (11.5-[[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]]) jars [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]] or 2 (12-ounce) packages frozen clams
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] sliced [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]] [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] salt [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* 3 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], diced
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
* 2 cups chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 2 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], diced
* 1½ [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]] [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 cup diced raw [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
* 8 to 10 [[Cookbook:Hard Tack|soda crackers]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

''Note: Use a low-fat cut of pork to lower the fat and calories of this dish.

===Directions===
#Strain the clam juice.
# Put the clams through food chopper, using coarse blade.
# [[Cookbook:Fry|Fry]] pork in a heavy iron pot.
# Remove pork and [[Cookbook:Sauté|sauté]] onions in the fat until tender and lightly browned.
# Add tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes.
# Add water, carrots, celery, and herbs.
# Cover pot and [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmer]] for 1½ hours (''a very gentle simmer'').
# Add clams, strained clam juice, and potatoes; cook until potatoes are tender.
# Season with salt and pepper to taste.
# Bring to a [[Cookbook:Boil|boil]], pour over crumbled soda crackers in individual plates, and serve at once.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Distance Learning as a Support for Deaf Students''' ==
===Introduction===
When most people recall how they sought clarification about a homework assignment when they got back from school, they remember asking an adult or sibling for help. But what happens when you do not speak the same language as your parents or siblings?  This is the plight faced by many deaf children.  It is estimated that 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents and only a fraction of these parents will learn sign language.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, H., Hoffmeister, R., Bahan, B. (1996). A Journey into the Deaf-World. California: Dawn Sign Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The native language for most deaf people is American Sign Language (ASL). ASL is a “complete, complex language that employs signs made with the hands and other movements, including facial expressions and postures of the body... it is a language completely separate from English. It contains all the fundamental features a language needs to function on its own--it has its own rules for grammar, punctuation, and sentence order.”&lt;ref&gt; National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. American Sign Language. Retrieved from http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/asl.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This complete language, however, is not provided to a majority of deaf children for various reasons.  There is a common misconception that lip reading and residual hearing can provide a deaf person with enough information, yet only 25-30% of speech is able to read off the lips.&lt;ref&gt;California State University Northridge. People with Disabilities in the Workplace. Retrieved from http://www.csun.edu/~sp20558/dis/deaf.html&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of learning a second language may seem overwhelming to parents who struggle to accept their child’s deafness, although deaf schools offer free sign language classes for parents. These students, who enter school without language, miss the critical early years of language acquisition.  Tests have shown that most 17- and 18-year-old deaf students read at a fourth grade level.&lt;ref&gt;Gallaudet Research Institute. Literacy and Deaf Students. Retrieved from http://gri.gallaudet.edu/Literacy/.&lt;/ref&gt; So as language-less children enter school, it becomes the educator’s job to not only teach subjects, but also provide these children with the ability to communicate.  Needless to say, it is extremely difficult for educators to get their students on grade level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;       
Technological advancements may hold the promise of aiding teachers of the deaf as it has revolutionized the educational environment and given another platform for teachers to reach their students, and even the parents.  Distance learning (DL), while highly prevalent throughout the secondary education setting, should be considered in the K-12 deaf education setting as a means of providing support for students who might not have, or do not know where, to access resources once the school day ends.  As students in today’s world are increasingly technologically savvy, teachers should capitalize on this important skill set to further educational goals.  The Internet can seem a daunting world to navigate, for both parents and young students, but establishing a DL system can provide a safe and secure platform for access to resources and support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
=== Why Distance Learning? ===
If extra support is needed, it could be argued that simply assigning more homework or having the students stay for tutoring can be instated as opposed to the time consuming process of creating a DL platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
Extra homework as a reinforcer does not address the issue that many times is the root of the problem- students are unable to ask questions or seek clarifications after the school day ends.  It is reasonable to assume that many young children, regardless of the teacher’s abilities, arrive home and forget certain aspects of the lesson.  Even if they remember, the directions for the homework assignment may seem confusing if they have low reading skills.  Merely giving them more homework can simply add to their confusion and does not effectively address the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
Aside from homework, tutoring may be suggested as a means of support.  While this would be a wonderful way to address these issues, financial constraints may limit schools from implementing this strategy.  As budgets are being cut across the board, schools may not be able to fund any after school tutoring programs, which require not only paying the teachers but also paying the bus companies for a late pick-up.&lt;ref&gt;Center on Budge and Policy Priorities.  Recession Continues to Batter State Budgets.  Retrieved from http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=711&lt;/ref&gt; Tutoring during the school day may also pose challenges.  Young students may not react favorably to missing recess in order to receive more support, which can negatively impact any the tutoring session and their participation.  In addition, the precedent established by Texas Gov. Rick Perry in 2007, which required schools to provide 30 minutes of unstructured free play, has caused school districts to view recess time as sacrosanct.&lt;ref&gt;Recess and Accountability (2007) In Encyclopædia Britannica online. Retrieved from http:// www.britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A DL platform, however, would provide students and parents the opportunity to access support to fit their needs.  By providing the platform as a non-compulsory resource, since not all students may have the technology (although students should be strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with what is offered) teachers will be able to provide the necessary assistance through a medium that many children are quick to want to use.  For students without the necessary technology, use of the public library should be encouraged.  In addition, many students may be confused but do not ask questions due to a feeling of embarrassment.  DL can create a space for them to access information related to class material in a way that is more comfortable for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
It must be noted that creating a DL platform would require extra work by the staff, especially during the start-up.  To maximize the benefits the DL provides and eventually minimize the work for teachers, staff members can place the material they are using (videos, vlogs, website links, lessons etc.) on the school’s server by subject.  This would allow other teachers to access any information that may be pertinent for their lessons and include them on the DL site.  The goal would be to establish a library of texts, videos and websites would be at the disposal of the staff to facilitate the DL process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
DL can provide flexibility and convenience for the students and can allow teachers to assess student’s skills.  By tracking which areas are most visited and assessing any practice material utilized, teachers can have a greater understanding of content area that needs to be reinforced during classroom education or if materials should be altered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== Distance Learning Systems that Fit Your Needs ===
Depending on the age of the students and the issues to be address, there are multiple DL options.  In a school setting, the greatest results can be gained when the staff and administration are on the same page.  Ensuring that all participating classrooms use the same platform while individualizing their classroom sections, creates uniformity throughout the school and allows children to easy transition as they move up in the grades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
There are many different available options, but for deaf students, it would be essential to choose a platform that is easily accessed and is able to accommodate videos.  The cost for the systems vary and even free services may require the use of a server, cost of installation or, if the school does not have a computer specialist employed, the cost of hiring one to set up the system.  For information concerning the cost effectiveness of DL, please read [http://publications.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=25907 Open Source Software in Schools].  Some DL platforms that might be more conducive for deaf students are: [http://moodle.org Moodle.org], [http://edline.com Edline.com], [http://www.blackboard.com/Solutions-by-Market/K-12.aspx BlackBoard K-12], [http://www.docs.google.com GoogleDocs], [http://www.youtube.com/channels YouTube Channels], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki Wikis], Blogs and Vlogs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
=== Applications in the K-12 Deaf Setting ===
Issues schools face today range from low literacy skills, inability for students to access resources and additional support, the lack of access to language outside of school, low parental involvement and limited school revenue.  While not to say that a DL system is the cure all, it houses the potential to address and lessen these issues.&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;u&gt;Low Literacy Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the greatest challenges a teacher will face in deaf education is addressing the lack of literacy skills in the students.  Many of the students pantomimed for the first years of their life and acquiring a language to communicate is daunting.  This is just the beginning however, as students must then learn how to read and write in an entirely different language- English.  ASL and English have divergent grammatical features that can create confusion when learning them simultaneously. (For a complete explanation of the grammatical features of [http://www.handspeak.com/tour/grammar/index ASL] and [http://www.odu.edu/al/jpbroder/modengling.html English])  Despite these differences, ASL can be used to explain and teach English.  Students, however, need reinforcements and continual exposure to written English as opposed to spoken English to make comprehension possible.  Creating a DL system will allow the students to have extra practice with the nuances of English when they are home. Educators can create sections or links, depending on the system used, where students can find resources for the topics they struggle with (i.e. Tense, Parts of Speech).  These resources can range anywhere from teacher created literacy games, to links for literacy based websites, (such as [http://www2.scholastic.com. Scholastic]). For older students, in addition to the game-like approach, they can use e-documents uploaded from a Word or Excel.  E-documents can focus on particular content area and, upon completion, students can submit it for review.  Google Docs can also provide a platform for students to create stories and experiment with language at their own pace.  Submission to the teacher can then allow for a more individualized form of feedback. All these strategies are in written English, the source of the problem, but DL can also address this issue.  Teachers can create videos containing an explanation of the grammatical features of English and content in ASL.  It is with this capability that the major benefit of DL truly manifests itself.  Students would now have access to not only resources but also resources provided in their first language outside of the school setting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Resources&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;DL can be applied in the same manner for all content areas.  Students can access the material at any time and the site can function as both a source of information and the student’s archives.  As new material is learned in class, students can review past lessons or topics if they feel the need.  This ability teaches them the importance of review and also provides independent ways for them to self-educate.  The ability to research, even in the relative confines of a structured DL system, and identify areas of needed improvement are important skill sets for students to develop.  DL can introduce them to the beginnings of self-assessment and research as students identify what material they need additional help in and begin to seek out the information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Language&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;As discussed throughout, the lack of language students face is a serious challenge to their educational, not to mention their personal and physiological, development.  Providing a space where students can access their first language is an invaluable asset that DL offers.  Aside from videos with content related signs, teachers can include links to various ASL Vlog’s.  This allows students to explore their language outside the realm of the school setting.  Knowing the scope of ASL users throughout the country, different jobs obtained and success stories is important for young students.  As a member of the minority in their homes and community, exposure to the Deaf community and Deaf culture has the potential to build self-esteem and outlook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Parental Involvement&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;The role of parents in their child’s education is an essential aspect of a well-rounded education.  This, however, is missing from most students’ lives.  A clear and easy to use DL system may hold some ways to help involve parents. For many parents, they do not where or how to begin finding resources that could allow them to become more involved in their child's life.  Parents can join their child as he/she views the ASL content videos on the DL site.  This can provide parents with vocabulary and allow them to help explain or enumerate assignments for their children.  While some basic language skills can be addressed, teachers should also use their DL system as a platform to help parents who may be confused or overwhelmed by how to best accommodate their child.  By providing easy to access and concise information about Deaf events, interpreted events, deaf friendly doctors, and online resources relating to raising a deaf child etc, the educator can also teach the parent how to help give their son or daughter a rich and vibrant childhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== Conclusion ===
As the times continue to change, it is important that teachers capitalize on the technological developments that have and continue to expand.  By implementing a DL system, educators can begin to ensure that no child will be left behind.  The individualized support for students and their parents can foster a successful educational development through the use of extra resources, review material and (potentially) increased communication at home. DL also provides the ability for schools to address academic, language and parental issues that have yet to be solved the traditional way.  While there can be varying ways in which to implement DL strategies, the concept can be a boon to deaf education.  If educators are willing to put forth the effort required to launch a DL program, this method of teaching and providing support has the possibility to greatly improve students’ success.

:&lt;font size=3&gt;The first postage meter was placed into use in 1936. 
:The stamps are grouped according to appearance of the frank:
:: '''A''' - frank with columns at sides
:: '''B''' - large frank with faux-perforation outer frame 
:: '''C''' - frameless horizontal design with flying goose
:: '''D''' - vertical design with flying goose above value box
:: '''E''' - horizontal frank with straight line outer frame incorporating town mark
:: '''F''' - small frank with faux-perforation outer frame
:: '''G''' - upright frank with straight line outer frame
:: '''H''' - horizontal frank with straight line outer frame, with separate circular town mark
:: '''I''' - octagonal frank
:: '''J''' - frank of horizontal lines only
:: '''PO''' - Digital stamps from Post Office counter (window) machines, printed on self-adhesive labels
:: '''PV''' - Digital stamps from self-service vending machines, printed on self-adhesive labels
: NOTE: Dates on Chinese meter stamps can be confusing. The founding of the Republic of China in 1911 was officially designated Year One in political and business affairs. About half the meter stamps found from 1947 through 1949 show the year of the Republic (36, 37, or 38) instead of a western year date. Since no stamp except Type A1 was issued in the 1930s, any year date starting with a 3 can be assumed safely to be a year of the Republic. Use of the Year of the Republic in meter stamps was abandoned after the ascendancy of the Peoples Republic of China in late 1949.&lt;/font&gt;

==&lt;font color=blue&gt;GROUP A: Early experimental meter stamps with columns at sides==


*&lt;font size=3&gt;All franks have frames with columns at the sides and a sun emblem at top center. This frame design resembles the Martyrs issue adhesive stamps of 1932-1934.
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:59, 31 October 2009 (UTC)

== Please reduce similar contributions of that nature ==
Some Wikibookians objected to the similar edits of a commercial nature without adding real value to the works. Commercial information isn't objected if it self isn't the central point of the contribution, that will be advertisement (a very thin line before it is considered spam). I have restored 2 instances on pages that made contextual sense and made one of them clear that it was a commercial site...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:07, 31 October 2009 (UTC)

If you wish to make useful contributions, you are welcome to come back after the block expires.&lt;br&gt;To request to be unblocked, add {{tlx|unblock|reason}} to [[Special:MyTalk|your user talk page]], which you can still edit.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:45, 31 October 2009 (UTC)}}</text>

== Bot action request ==
[[Opening theory in chess]] and its hundreds of subpages need to be title-cased. To top it off, there are two categories that the pages are part of.  [[:Category:Opening theory in chess]] and [[:Category:Chess opening theory]], both of which would not match the title-cased title.  Since the larger category is the latter it would be nice to have the name be [[Chess Opening Theory]].  I fixed the template the book uses to use {{tlx|BookCat}} so they'll automatically be categorized in [[:Category:Chess Opening Theory]] after the move. I know your bot can do moves but could it also:
*Fix any links to the old title to point to the same pages at the new title to avoid redirects?
*Replace calls to {{tlx|ChessFooter}} and {{tlx|ChessOpenings}} with {{tlx|Chess Opening Theory/Footer}}? ChessFooter could then be deleted and ChessOpenings could be moved to &quot;Chess Opening Theory/Footer&quot;.
*Replace calls to {{tlx|ChessTable}} with {{tlx|Chess Opening Theory/Table}}?
*Replace calls to {{tlx|Chess Position}} with {{tlx|Chess Opening Theory/Position}}?

== Move of [[Opening theory in chess]] ==

Thanks for renaming [[Opening theory in chess]] to [[Chess Opening Theory]]. I did notice you didn't move the talk page. Why? [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 23:12, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
:Err, I just noticed it seems to be that not just one page but hundreds of pages moved without the corresponding talk page move. The problem is now imo greater then if the move wasn't made. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 23:17, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

::This yet again shows the bug with the mass move if the top-level page doesn't have a talk page.  Talk pages of subpages of that top-level page are not moved in that case.  I've learned to create a dummy talk page for the top-level page if I ever attempt to mass move pages.  It's too bad that bug hasn't been fixed yet.  Mike submitted it himself even.  Only Wikibooks makes such extensive use of subpages, so it's not a high priority. -- 03:41, 18 August 2009 (UTC)

:::Sorry, I had to stop halfway through the whole business due to a small not-quite-emergency-but-still-important-and-urgent event. Actually, it was more an issue to do with wgMaximumMovedPages being calculated incorrectly, so I finished with a bot run (the next bot run would have moved the talk pages, but I had to run [ouch, pun]). That's [[bugzilla:20289]]. Again, apologies for leaving things a mess. I'll be doing the rest of the modifications over the next couple of days. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:10, 18 August 2009 (UTC)

== Wikibook building as a class ==

Hello--I'm new here on Wikibooks. I'm a sometime-editor on Wikipedia. I have a local etiquette question, and pretty randomly picked you out as an admin to ask...

I'm starting a university course, and I'm considering having the students create a new book here as the class project. I can handle any concerns student-side, but I was curious if having 20 or so students working on a book together would run afoul of Wikibook culture. On Wikipedia for instance, it might run the risk of appearing to be &quot;meat puppets&quot;. I'm hoping/guessing that's less of a concern here, if only because of less editing-traffic.

Any thoughts? [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 03:25, 21 August 2009 (UTC)
:Absolutely not - we welcome class projects. If you haven't found [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]] already, that's a great place to start. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:15, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

== Personal Data ==
I remember a discussion some time ago about this issue (placing personal data or sensitive information outside of user pages). I'm of the opinion that HELP ME!!! at the Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance if not deleted should be edited to remove the email address. Since the user isn't registered he doesn't have a user page or talk page were it may be contacted and there is a security/privacy issue that will affect not only the owner of the email, that may even no be the same one that placed the request on Wikibooks (it is strange enough that it is placed twice on the same sentence) but to any unaware user that decides to be helpful and reply to it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:25, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

I guess I can just re-mname the original first page, and reshuffle chapters. How do I rename the first page of a book?

Mike, I moved the project, and now have two problems:
The url is still the old one, which is confusing
The old chapters do not link back to the new home page.
:You just forgot to move those pages - I've done that now, and the links have turned blue &lt;tt&gt;:)&lt;/tt&gt;
:Could you please sign at the end of your posts with four tildes? &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; turns into a [[Special:Preferences|customizable]] signature and timestamp, which makes it easier to tell who said what and when.

== Luvodicus' Talk Page ==
My photo was deleted from my User Page.

It is a self portrait, taken by me, owned by me, of me.

Can you please correct this and put it back up?

here's a direct link to a new image, of me, take by me, for me

[[User:Luvodicus|Luvodicus]] ([[User talk:Luvodicus|talk]]) 16:46, 22 August 2009 (UTC)
:You simply need to state which [[WB:MEDIA|free license]] you're releasing the image with. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:28, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

I did mention that, as well as the text below the photo stated that It was a SELF PORTRAIT. Seeing as you were the one to remove the photo, I would appreciate it if you would be the one to replace it. The FREE LICENSE you're pointing too looks gaudy and unprofessional. I don't see how this could've caused a deletion, when a notice would've sufficed. It is a hinderance, as I have to now download, upload, replace, and tag...
:&quot;Recent Picture of Luvodicus&quot; doesn't explain what license the image is release under (nor any of the other information we [[WB:MEDIA|ask for]]. If you simply tell me which one of the many acceptable licenses you wish to use, I'll undelete the image and fix the description page. I'm not sure what exactly is &quot;gaudy and unprofessional&quot; but if it is a page on this wiki, you are welcome to [[WB:BOLD|fix it]].

Mike, I honestly don't see what the problem is. I've repeatedly informed you the photo is mine, was taken by me, of me, to be used in my profile. There is no copyright infringement possible, as It's highly unlikely any court of law would entertain a lawsuit of myself suing myself for copyright infringement. The tags you are asking me to use are covering an entire length of the page, when simple information is already credited on the tag.
If you feel a further tag is needed, then I ask you to happily entertain yourself, and add the tag you feel is best representative of a photo I've taken of myself, with a digital camera, on a balcony, outside of my apartment, for the simple use of illustrating a profile.

:Maybe I can help to make it clearer.... It doesn't matter what the picture is used for, or what the picture is of, or whether a court case is likely or not. Policy requires that you release the photograph under one of the licenses that is acceptable to Wikibooks. If you don't, the photograph will be deleted. You, the author of the photograph, must login and make a clear statement that you are the copyright owner and that you have released it under the applicable license. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 10:51, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

Just say what free license you release the image with. I recommend CC-by-sa-3.0. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:44, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

I've noticed that you've been busy as a bee here recently, contributing hundreds of edits in just a few days. I just wanted to give you a quick pat on the back with thanks for your hard work! You've definitely improved the project.  --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:02, 2 January 2009 (UTC)
:Thanks. It's nice here, that's why I'm here...! &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:40, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

Since you've been so helpful here, I've been wondering how much we'll be seeing you now that the holidays are over. Do you have any idea how much time you'll be contributing to the project? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:33, 5 January 2009 (UTC)

:Ah, usually an hour or two a night during the week, and a bit more at weekends. Plus a small amount of time during the day. I'm a bit of a &quot;dog with a bone&quot; about stuff, so I'll be around for a fair while yet. For example, until I see an empty category for pages needing dewikifying, I'll be working on it! Get a nice sense of achievement that way. I'm also planning on building at least one book from scratch -&gt; so at least a year of work there. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

::Oh, and I haven't been on holiday! Apart from Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day, I've been at work. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

::: I see. Given your sudden jump to activity, I sort of just reckoned that you had extra time off. You've been at work? I'm thoroughly impressed. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:16, 6 January 2009 (UTC)

::::I doubt my boss will be. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:33, 6 January 2009 (UTC)

I noticed you started a book on [[Castles of England]]. The book looks very interesting, but I thought I'd make a quick mention that splash pages are [[WB:MOS|advised against]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:32, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

== Deleting files ==
Hi Quite Unusual.
I uploaded some files that I found I can't use.  I'm not sure how to delete them (I uploaded but they are not on a page.)  They are Punishment.jpg, Rewards.jpg, and Punishment2.jpg.  I found some others that I uploaded that I believe are acceptable.  I am really not trying to break any laws-just trying to figure out what I can use!

== Admin in the UK ==

[[User:Herbythyme]] used to perform admin functions during the UK morning hours, but he has not been active lately (and I think he turned in his tools).  If you are interested, I would gladly nominate you for adminship.  It makes fighting vandalism a lot easier, as sometimes when you start rolling back nefarious changes, the vandal attacks your own user and talk pages.  I think you're an ideal candidate.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 14:08, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

:Thanks. Sure, why not, I think I'm trustworthy ;-) Although I suspect I might be a case of &quot;too soon&quot;. I've been &quot;Wiki&quot; active for nearly three years, but only a few months here. Still, that's why we look for consensus. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

== &quot;Gaylord Twink&quot; ==

This guy has come in several times under different names and has vandalized a bunch of Wikibooks. See my comments on [[User talk:Swift#vandalism|Swift's talk page]]; the stuff he is posting is the same as was posted by the user named Big Fuk. When that text comes up, block him please. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:06, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

:Hi, will bear this in mind if I'm ever in a position to block (I'm not an admin). It's useful stuff though, I should at least recognise the style next time he comes along. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

== Welcome templates ==

Hi Qu,

I've noticed that you've been hard at work on the image copyright front. You have probably stumbled across these already, but in case you haven't, I wanted to let you know about the [[:category:welcome templates|welcome templates]]. I ususally add {{tl|bigwelcome}} when adding comments on new users' talk pages as they have a number of useful links (not that everyone seems very motivated to read up on proper practices ... *sigh*).

On a related note, I was wondering whether you had any comments on what seem to be common newcomer mistakes. Seeing how you've been active on recent changes, I figured you might have some useful insight on what aspects of our project documentation need particular clarification. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:16, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

:Hi, yes I usually add the welcomes as well, but I was a bit pressed for time yesterday morning. Common newcomer mistakes: I'll have a think - as I came over from WP I might have a totally different view to a completely new newcomer, but I'll have a go. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:36, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

:: While your personal experience would be useful, I'm actually more interested in your view on ''other'' newcomers' mistakes (not all of whom show as much sense) since you may have seen a number of these in the recent changes. My impression is that not everyone makes much of an effort to read our documentation. Granted, it's a mess so they're hardly entirely to blame. I'm a strong believer that accessibility is key and hope to work on that front. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:20, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

==Common Mistakes==

Thoughts on newcomer common mistakes:

#Images. Typical mistakes include:
##Assuming that content found on the internet on a &quot;public&quot; website is &quot;public domain&quot; - i.e., failing to comprehend that public domain is a specific legal status rather than a descriptive term.
##Uploading images with the author as &quot;self&quot; on the presumption that the &quot;author&quot; refers to who uploaded it rather than the original creator
##Not providing a proper source. For example, the source is described as &quot;the internet&quot; rather than the actual URL where the content was obtained
##Not attaching a license tag
##Attaching a license tag as if they are the author giving up rights rather than the license of the true author. For example, stating that they found it on a web site then attaching a CC attribution or GFDL license instead of the true license.
#Thinking this is Wikipedia. Typical mistakes include:
##Applying the WP manual of style. For example, converting headings from title case to sentence case
##Wikilinking everything
##Not piping links to WP so they appear as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Wikipedia Link]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
##Writing in an encyclopedic style instead of a book style. For example, slavishly applying the third person, not providing a book like introduction
#Not thinking &quot;book&quot;
##Most new &quot;books&quot; are actually a single page article with no possibility of expansion. Guidance along the lines of &quot;search for the subject you are interested in, then add new content / pages / modules to the existing books. If no book on your subject exists, before starting a new book consider whether your subject is sufficient to fill a whole book. Try writing the table of contents first to get the structure right... blah blah&quot; might be useful.

More when I think of it.
: I think it would be good to move this to [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General|the Reading room]] where it will get a wider audience. Another common &quot;Image&quot; error I see is that people tend to upload images here instead of at the Commons (when the Commons would have been a better place). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 22:52, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

Hey.  I saw the edit you made to this book, so you obviously looked at it.  Is there a reason you didn't tag it for deletion?

Feel free to tag it! &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

:Actually, it is quite a bit different, in intent if not in base subject matter. The Guide is intended to assist in the study of the series as a literary work, and as such goes into character and event analysis, and to a certain extent the intentions of the author -- though who can actually know the intentions of the author except the author herself? In any event, the Guide focuses on the books, though in order to do so it perforce must show the content of the books. ''Divination Dazzles'', and similarly the ''Hogwarts Handbook'', are fanfic, entirely involved with the series' content rather than its techniques. In my opinion, neither ''Divination Dazzles'' nor the ''Hogwarts Handbook'' actually belongs here. Of course, as one of the Guide major contributors, I am, shall we say, biased?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Introducing Self Regulation''' 

Self-regulation is a term that has increasingly moved to the forefront on pedagogical conversations. It refers to thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are oriented to attaining goals (Zimmerman, 2000). This notion therefore, focuses on what students need to know about themselves in order to manage their limitations during efforts to learn. Consequently, metacognition: the awareness of and knowledge about one’s own thinking, becomes indispensable for the development of self-regulation. 

In a study done by Shapiro (1984), he found that simply asking students to self-record some aspect of their learning, such as the completion of assignments, led to improvements in their overall functioning. Although there have been several studies establishing the relationship between self-regulation and success in school, there is still a lack of preparation for this purpose (Zimmerman, 2002). 

Schunk &amp; Zimmerman (1994;1998) have found that a student’s level of learning varies based on the presence or absence of these key self-regulatory processes: 

1. Setting specific proximal goals for oneself
2. Adopting powerful strategies for attaining the goals
3. Monitoring one’s performance selectively for sign of progress
4. Restructuring one’s physical and social context to make it compatible with one’s goals
5. Managing one’s time use efficiently 
6. Self-evaluating one’s methods
7. Attributing causation to results
8. Adapting future methods


Other authors refer to this goal as “learning to learn”, which can be understood as facilitating that each student is continuously learning how to improve their learning. The NORM acronym is an example of a set of powerful strategies, and emphasizes the importance of Note taking, Organizing, Relating, and Monitoring (Kiewra, 2002). 

However, to actually go through these processes, students need to have the motivation, self-awareness, and behavioral skill to implement these strategies. The good news is that external support and providing a structure for this purpose can greatly enhance students becoming self-regulated. 


'''The strategic distance that virtual learning environments could cover'''

Even though distance learning has not been applied in the K-12 context as extensively as in adult education, younger generations are increasingly relating to virtual environments earlier in life. This creates the potential to include blended curricula and web-based support at younger ages. As this has been progressively the case, children are interacting with and learning through virtual environments. Most of the cases these environments are designed to complement class objectives in some area of study or facilitate collaboration through online participation. As many colleagues have advocated, stimulating students’ participation on virtual environments that support their learning might allow them to develop an increasingly important skill for lifelong learning, in addition to their learning of the subject at hand. However, and even though I agree with the argument, I think that these environments should not only focus on providing a continuity and support for what’s been taught in the classroom. 

As discussed above, even when self-regulation is directly responsible for school success, very few schools actually have explicit curricula for this purpose. Reasons for this may relate to the teachers capacity to support each student’s individual process, and the pressure to focus on the what’s been taught instead of the how it’s been learned. 

The opportunity presented here is to find a way to facilitate the process of becoming a self-regulated student through the use of virtual environments. In this case, the attempted distance to be covered is not the one between the teachers’ knowledge and the student—as the notion of distance learning is usually understood, but the one between the students’ learning process and him or herself, and between this generated knowledge and the teachers and family of the child. 

The advantages of supporting this process through virtual environments are manifold. It allows the creation of a “safe space” for this conversation, where students go to instead of being seen as something they deliver to someone else (i.e., homework). Virtual environments create a much better space for ongoing interaction, giving students, teachers and parents freedom to contribute. Imagine having a the possibility of structuring a process where students reflect about their on learning continuously, receiving feedback and support from teachers and parents. Now imagine having this recorded throughout the years, where each year, teachers have the possibility of learning from the journey that a particular student has traveled. What has worked, what hasn’t, what’s their current level of self-regulation? Imagine how empowering it would be to have a personalized space where each students works out the process of learning how to learn. Formalizing this process through a fun and interactive process might make a significant difference in students overall learning, and thus in the opportunities they will have in the future (Kiewra, 2002). 

The challenge involved in this initiative consists on coming up with cues and probes that stimulate the development of the key self-regulatory processes mentioned above, and use self-reflection to support this process. The design of these contexts needs to be appropriate for each level of schooling in form and content, and role of the technical coordinator becomes crucial. They have the challenge of designing a virtual environment where students feel invited to share about their classroom experience, the way they’re relating to the material, what are they having difficulty with, what seems really easy, how are they experiencing the teaching method, what are they trying out to help themselves, are they asking for support, and if so, what kind of support? These of course are just examples of the type of knowledge this environment should generate. The level of participation of students is of course going to vary depending on their age, and therefore this environment should consider the participation of teachers and family, especially at young age. 


'''What are the new demands that this initiative involves?'''

For any new initiative to become viable, we need to consider what are the demands involved and who must be willing to satisfy them. At this point, it is clear that the process of becoming self-regulated involves an important demand on the student. The difficulty of introducing a new practice requires support, and we have been discussing how a virtual environment might provide the appropriate context to bring these supports. Teachers are clearly the critical support of this process, their participation and full involvement gives formality to the process and assures that the insights and struggles of students will inform the pedagogical relationship. Therefore, the demands that a system like this places on the teacher are not trivial. It is crucial that its design is aligned with what the teacher is willing and agreeing to do, and should facilitate their participation. 

The role of parents and other caregivers is also extremely relevant. Parents modeling self-regulatory skills as well as actively supporting their children’s use of these skills, give kids a significant advantage (Martinez-Pons, 2002). However, this type of parental support might not be easy to achieve in many homes. Family participation should be established a priori and made a priority between teachers and parents. 


'''Conclusions'''

As technology coordinators become more of a strategic partner for faculty than technical advisers, they will play a role in introducing innovative curricula emerging from the advantages that instruction technology allows. The use of distance learning environments to promote the development of students’ self regulation is a good example of this. The importance of self-regulation for academic success has been well established, though still not implemented in most schools. Creating virtual environments where teachers learn how to better support students, informed directly by students’ reflections about their learning process, has an enormous potential for enhancing the student-teacher partnership. In addition, stimulating continuous reflection about learning, creates a virtuous cycle of learning how to learn, thus contributing to students overall self-regulation and therefore to their possibility of succeeding academically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
Now more than ever, there seems to be a great debate whether Edutainment, specifically, Digital Game Based Learning (DGBL) is effective in learning of K-12 students.  

There are three factors that have brought public interest in games as learning tools:
* ongoing research conducted by DGBL proponents as researchers have published dozens of books, articles, and studies on the subject
* today’s “net generation” who have become disengaged with traditional classroom instruction
* increased popularity of games

=== Intrinsic Educational Traits of Computer Games ===
Recently, some researchers (e.g., Gee, 2003; 2005; Squire, 2005; Prensky, 2006; Shaffer, 2006) have also argued that games’ underlying cognitive, social, and cultural features can offer various educative opportunities for learners. These are games’ intrinsic traits that promote learning in a constructivist fashion from these perspectives:

* ''Motivational Perspective'': fun and enjoyment are important as learners can be more relaxed, motivated and willing to learn. Malone (1980) gave his intrinsic motivation theory, which asserts that challenge, fantasy, control, curiosity, cooperation, recognition and competition are the most significant elements that make game-playing fun and engaging, and sustain players’ continual motives.
* ''Cognitive Perspective'': the traditional school curricula are often fragmented into small and unconnected pieces (Papert, 1993). The original intention is for making learning easier, but this usually ends up with depriving the rationale behind the knowledge itself, creating unrealistic learning contexts, and making learning boring. Learning should be an active process based upon concrete experience (Piaget, 1964). A well-designed game can do well in presenting near real-life contexts for individuals to acquire knowledge and skills unintentionally rather than deliberately (Gee, 2003). 
* ''Socio-Cultural Perspective'': How to educate learners is not seen as how to build representations in each of their heads, but how to engage them in social practices (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991). Knowledge itself arises from social needs, fulfills social functions, and is tied inherently with cultural conditions (Cole, 1996). Thus, learning is not just a process of mastering facts, but rather, participating in socio-cultural practices. This requires learners to develop their own identity relative to others.

=== What is Edutainment? ===
==== Etymology ====
The noun edutainment was made by Bob Heyman while producing documentaries for the National Geographic Society. It is used to refer to the use of small portions of eLearning used to deliver key messages in an entertaining manner. Edutainment is potentially a broad term which covers the combination of educational and entertainment use on a variety of media platforms including computer games. The term is quite elastic as a lot of games are put into this category, and game companies are so inclined as to strengthen the appeal for parents (Buckingham &amp; Scanlon, 2002; Konzack, 2003). This software genre is designed and developed to focus on academic subjects. Education games can also provide students with experiences that simulate real life.

==== What is Digital Game Based Learning (DGBL)? ====
DGBL is an instructional method that incorporates educational content or learning principles into computer or video games with the goal of engaging learners. Applications of digital game-based learning draw upon the constructivist theory of education.

==== History of DGBL ====
Marc Prensky explains that the emergence of digital game-based learning came near the end 20th century along with a global technology boom. The recent generations of students in grades K-12 have lived their entire lives with access to technology. Because of this access to technology, Prensky argues that today’s students “think and process information fundamentally differently than their predecessors.” Teachers or “digital immigrants” now have to adapt to the language and learning styles of “digital natives,” the net generation students who have always been surrounded by technology. Prensky recommends that in order for teachers to adapt their instruction to meet the needs of students, they can employ computer or digital-based games as learning tools in the classroom. These games can be used in various subject areas and in a variety of ways.

==== Components of digital game-based learning ====
Digital game-based learning involves activities that can range from completing very simple tasks to the development of intricate problem-solving skills. According to Patricia Deubel, games can be categorized as “action, adventure, fighting, puzzle, role-playing, sports, and strategy.” (5) Deubel suggests that the following information should be taken into account when teachers are selecting games for students:
* Students’ age, characteristics, gender, competitiveness, and previous gaming experience
* The game’s target age level
* Special need students
* Gender and racial diversity
* Number of simultaneous players
* The role of the teacher
* Too much competitiveness and the effectiveness of the difficulty level.

Deubel suggests that there are a few necessary components required for effective digital game-based learning. 
* The games must keep learning and engagement at a high level. 
* Rules and goals are also important components of a strong game-based learning program. 
* Teachers must make the outcomes of the games clear and provide immediate feedback. 
* Students have an interactive role not only with the game, but with other students as well.

==== Characteristics ====
We should not think of edutainment as a fixed genre but rather as different titles which share some problematic assumptions about motivation, learning theory, learning principles and game design while being produced, marketed and distributed differently than commercial computer games. The characteristics are:
* Little intrinsic motivation
* No integrated learning experience
* Drill-and-practice learning principles
* Simple gameplay 
* Small budgets
* No teacher presence
* Distribution and marketing

==== Education Theories &amp; Pedagogy Used in the Field ====
Entertainment-Education uses a blend of core communication theories and fundamental entertainment pedagogy to guide the preparation of the programming. The major communication theories that influence Entertainment-Education include:
* ''Persuasion Theory'': (Aristotle, Petty, Cacioppo) Psychological characteristics effect the response of a person to messages. Also indicates the message and source factors that influence a person's response such as the credibility, attractiveness, and expertise of the source.
* ''Theory of Reasoned Action'': (Ajzen, Fishbein) Social influences effect behavior, including beliefs and perceived social norms.
* ''Social Learning Theory'': (Bandura) People learn by observing others and the consequences of their behavior. If the person so chooses, they then emulate the behavior by rehearsing the action, taking action, comparing their experiences to the experiences of others, and then adopting the new behavior.
* ''Diffusion Theory'': (Rogers) Behavior spreads through a community or group over a period of time. Television may plant the idea, but social networks reinforce it and cause it to grow.

Major education pedagogy involved with Entertainment-Education includes:
* ''Relevance'': Learning is more likely when people can see the usefulness of the knowledge they are given.
* ''Incremental Learning'': Learning is most effective when people can learn at their own pace.
* ''Distributed Learning'': (Fossard) Different people learn in different ways over different periods of time. It is important to present information differently so that people can absorb it.

== Benefits and Effectiveness ==
According to Patricia Deubel, DGBL has the potential to engage and motivate students and offer customized learning experiences while promoting long-term memory and providing practical experience. Deubel suggests that in order for teachers to effectively use DGBL they must first find non-violent games that facilitate planning and problem-solving and relate to the curriculum. Deubel recommends role-playing, simulation, and adventure games because they often appeal to the development of more than just one skill. DGBL also provides a great tool for conducting educational research. DGBL attracts students of various demographic backgrounds. It also helps students set and work towards achievement of common goals, provide helpful feedback, and maintain records for measurement purposes. Furthermore, the interactive nature of video games stimulates learning and encourages participants to challenge new topics or knowledge. It can help students develop computer skills that they may need in a society that continues to develop technologically.

This process happens rapidly and often while the game is played, with immediate feedback. Games that are too easily solved will not be engaging, so good games constantly require input from the learner and provide feedback. Games thrive as teaching tools when they create a continuous cycle of cognitive disequilibrium and resolution (via assimilation or accommodation) while also allowing the player to be successful. There are numerous other areas of research that account for how and why games are effective learning tools, including anchored instruction, feedback, behaviorism, constructivism, narrative psychology, and a host of other cognitive psychology and educational theories and principles. Each of these areas can help us, in turn, make the best use of DGBL.

== Critics and Challenges ==
Although education games are becoming more prevalent, they are no match for the quantity and the quality of games that are produced and are available solely for &quot;entertainment&quot; purposes. It is difficult for education games to compete because most education institutions cannot afford to finance such projects (Gros, 2003; Sawyer, 2004). According to Sawyer (2004), building a pedagogically sound game is expensive and time-consuming. It can cost between $500,000 and $2.5 million, and can take from 12 to 24 months to complete. Many commercial games require peripheral hardware or game devices such as the Xbox and also require a large block of time for players to complete. These criteria are not readily available to K-12 institution. In addition, education games are not designed and created to correlate with specific school curricula. 

There are critics who object to the use of educational games. Two concerns are: the addictive nature of computer games and the violence that children are exposed to while playing games. According to Okan (2003), computer games are not culturally neutral. This has raised concerns among educators and the general public. They fear that technology is sweeping through all levels of education without the benefit of input from individuals who can help to shape and restrain this forward momentum.

By integrating technology into pedagogy, students learn cognitive and technological skills at the same time. More traditional parents and educators are skeptical of using technology especially edutainment software. They believe that if students are playing or being entertained they are not learning. They fear that technology will undermine learning processes, while at the same time encourage parents and teachers to spend scarce education dollars on technology. They suggest that this encourages a watering down of the learning process. Other concerns are that edutainment technology teaches students that learning does not require perseverance, reading critically, making connections between new information and what is already known, and that collaborating with peers is outdated and unnecessary. In other words, in addition to teaching the curriculum, technology has an unintended effect of discouraging serious learning (Okan, 2003). 

Another argument against using computer games in education is the concern that technology will be used only for the sake of &quot;using technology.&quot; Using technology does not guarantee academic success. 

* A study showed mixed results with regard to the impact of technology on learning outcomes. (McDonald and Hannafin 2003) 
* Using technology is a new approach to teaching and that teachers are trying to fit a new medium into traditional teaching methods. (Salomon 2002) Salomon suggests that traditional classrooms produce a better mastery of recalled information. Alternatively, less traditional technology and constructivist-based classrooms produce improved skills for developing questions, formulating hypotheses, and the ability to intelligently address new problems. 
* According to Okan (2003), the use of technology results in acquiring passive information in the form of entertainment rather than though the more challenging critical thinking process. It is argued that, when used effectively, digital games develop critical thinking skills through the process of active problem solving (Hostetter, 2002). 
* When student are having fun, they are motivated to persist for longer periods of time or to approach the learning activity more often. According to Rieber (2001), motivation is inseparable from learning and is considered by some to be the most important learning factor. When students are motivated, they spend more time on task and learning becomes an incidental part of the activity. Alternatively, some think that technology, although motivating, often diminishes the need to review prior knowledge, to strategize, to analyze, to make new connections and to engage in other high-level learning activities. However, through solving puzzles, conquering enemies, and creating digital cities and theme parks, students are categorizing, analyzing, and using prior knowledge for problem solving (Hostetter, 2002). 

DGBL probably do teach children bits of things, but mostly edutainment is simple in its facilitation of learning experiences. Learning in relation to spelling and reading for pre-school and early school children may see some gains from edutainment. However, edutainment does not really teach the player about a certain area, but rather lets the player perform mechanic operations. This will lead to memorization of the practiced aspects but probably not a deep understanding of the skill or content – not really grasped by the student and although this may work for some limited areas, like spelling and reading, this is a quite limited scope. In general, this will result in weak transfer and application of the skills as it is not fundamentally understood, but only memorized as a mechanic action in the game environment (Gee et al., 2004; Jonassen, 2001; Schank, 1999). 

There is also common agreement that edutainment fails to integrate the learning with the computer game. Hence, a change of focus in the learning experience from the educational part to the game part. This result in weak learning experiences especially if you consider the time-on-task issue – the player won’t spend a lot of time on educational experiences, but rather gain a lot of game experience. (Brody, 1993; Fabricatore, 2000; Facer et al., 2003; Vandeventer, 1997)

Overall the shortcomings of edutainment have created an overall negative attitude towards edutainment titles. There is, to put it mildly, widespread skepticism towards almost any aspects of edutainment.

== Some Examples ==
''River City'': “multi-user virtual environment” game funded by the National Science Foundation and developed by programmers at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Targeted at students in grades six through nine, River City looks a bit like Second Life and portrays how three diseases simultaneously affect health in a fictitious city. As students explore the ailments, they learn how disease is spread and the impact of human interactions far and wide.

''Food Force'': a U.N. produced game on the mechanics of food aid distribution, and Whyville, another game that takes place in a virtual world, each has about four million players, a number that far exceeds the number of students graduating each year with a bachelor’s degree in science, technology, engineering or math.

''Learning Federation'': Microsoft is bringing researchers and businesses together to develop a game-based computer learning environment to be used by classroom teachers. The idea behind this partnership is to take the same video-game technology that lets you virtually fly airplanes or build amusement parks, and use it for educational purposes. Microsoft has teamed up with several academic partners, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), to build some prototypes. Some prototypes include:
* One CD focuses on a bio-hazard attack in a city and how an emergency team would respond. 
* Another CD explores engineering principles as students have to rebuild the world on another planet after Earth is evacuated. 
* A third one has students build houses in unusual places, such as under the ocean or suspended in air. As in popular computer games, students can use different &quot;virtual&quot; tools, like a crane, to help complete their quest. 

''Age of Empires'' (history), ''Sim City'' (engineering &amp; geography), ''CSI'' (criminal justice &amp; forensic science), ''Tycoon'' series (business, economics, and management) are also known as educational games.

== Conclusion ==
We are past the point of questioning whether or not DGBL is good for learning. The inclusion of computer games within formal learning is a necessity and should be commonplace. It is really an issue of curriculum and teaching methodology rather than a technological issue. Technological moderating factors can be overcome, what is more important is that teachers are able to align the use of computer games with their existing notions of pedagogy and their approaches to learning. To do this the negative perceptions of games playing needs to be challenged, teachers who do understand the potential of games need to work with those who don’t and the use of games in learning needs to be legitimized by dialogue with organizations and parents. 

Teachers may need to recognize that games promote interactivity and problem solving skills and adjust their pedagogies accordingly but more than anything it is the social status of games that needs to be recognized within the formal environment alongside the skills that learners can accrue from playing those games. Schools and teachers need to adjust their pedagogical approaches rather than looking at wholesale curriculum redesign and look for areas of transfer that can be planned into lessons to maximize the learning potential available to them, not only of computer games but also of other ubiquitous technologies that can aid learning and break the boundaries between 21st century bedroom and 20th century classroom. 
DGBL is opening up new potential for learning in formal situations and in innovative ways. The emergence of DGBL is offering the learning and teaching communities new opportunities to reach and motivate hard-to-engage learner groups, support differentiated and personalized learning, address vocational and training-based course materials and provide new tools for teaching basic and key skills, science and math education. 

Clearly, DGBL has been effective in these situations and offers a wide diversity of approaches and tools for teachers to make use of in their practice. But DGBL also offers the learner a chance to become more central in their own learning through generating their own content, learning collaboratively in teams and becoming more engaged in the processes of learning. 

'''5 reasons to develop computer game based learning'''&lt;br&gt;
There are some potential benefits in developing computer games to teach children:
# Dissemination of information
# Motivation
# Effectiveness
# Addressing reasons for learning difficulties
# Computer is patient

It makes a lot of sense to develop computer game based learning on a widespread basis.  To produce good computer game based learning requires a combination of great games design, cleaver programming to build in some of the important factors discussed above and expertise in teaching/ child neuropsychological development. There are thousands of learning games out there but very few based on knowledge of neuropsychological development, with good game play and research to show their effectiveness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;Distance Learning and K-12 Music Education&lt;/big&gt;'''


=='''Standards in Music Education'''==


In a 1991 report titled ''Growing up complete: The imperative for music education'', the National Commission on Music Education made the following statement:


“Music is a highway for exploring the emotional and aesthetic dimensions of experience. Indeed, here is where music and the other arts make their unique and most visible contribution. Education ''without'' music shortchanges our children and their futures.”


K-12 music education encompasses general music classes, vocal instruction, instrumental instruction, performing ensembles, music theory classes, and music history classes. The Consortium of National Arts Education Associations (1994) has established nine national standards for K-12 music education:


# Singing, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.
# Performing on instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.
# Improvising melodies, variations, and accompaniments.
# Composing and arranging music within specified guidelines.
# Reading and notating music.
# Listening to, analyzing, and describing music.
# Evaluating music and music performances.
# Understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts.
# Understanding music in relation to history and culture.


The Consortium also provides specific goals that students should achieve under each of the nine standards at the K-4 level, the 5-8 level, the 9-12 “proficient” level, and the 9-12 “advanced” level. 


However, state music education requirements vary widely and do not always honor these standards. Within a given state, there are also large differences between school districts. The quality of music education can be affected by socioeconomic issues or by problems of access (for example, in remote rural areas). One district may have a thriving program, covering everything from elementary instrumental instruction to AP classes for high school students, while another may have no formal music instruction at all. Even in districts with strong programs, instrumental teachers are sometimes shared between several schools, spending what could be instructional time on commutes.


Distance learning has the potential to level the playing field, giving more students the chance to experience music education. It also opens the opportunity for music educators to learn new skills without physically returning to school.


=='''Non-interactive online lessons'''==


A program at the Berklee College of Music called “[http://www.berkleeshares.com/ Berklee Shares]” offers a library of free music lessons under the topic headings “Production &amp; Technology,” Songwriting &amp; Arranging,” “Music Business &amp; Careers,” “Music Education,” and “Music Improvisation.” The library also includes lessons on specific musical instruments. The “Music Education” topic consists largely of lessons on music theory; in K-12 education, these lessons would be most suited to advanced high school students. This section also includes resources for music educators. The lessons are in video, audio, and written formats; the books and DVDs from which the lessons are derived are available for purchase at [http://www.berkleepress.com/ http://www.berkleepress.com/].


The stated goal of the program is “to provide free access to faculty-authored Berklee music lessons designed for musicians, music students, and music educators” ([http://www.berkleeshares.com/faq http://www.berkleeshares.com/faq]). The college also has an online school at [http://www.berkleemusic.com/ http://www.berkleemusic.com/] - the school offers individual 12-week music courses as well as college credit certificate programs.


While programs like Berklee Shares are great online resources, they lack interaction with and feedback from a live teacher. 


=='''Semi-interactive online lessons'''==


The Australian National Training Authority created an action learning research project to explore the use of the internet to teach instrumental music to students in remote regions (Bond, 2002). A website was set up with 14 graded lessons, which included video and audio demonstrations; students were able to choose the order in which they accessed the lessons. The site also included notes on technique and theory and links to other music resources. Students submitted video and audio materials for assessment by the tutor, who then provided feedback. 


The 12 students who participated in the study were assigned to three groups:

# Local group – a control group. These students used the same online materials as the others, but were able to make in-person contact with the tutor.
# Regional group 1 – this group’s program was based on a constructivist methodology; students were encouraged to approach the learning materials holistically. The students formed groups and were expected to work together by playing for each other, discussing the lessons, offering feedback, sharing information, and providing support. Contact with the tutor was irregular and took place via telephone, email, or fax. 
# Regional group 2 – This group’s program was based on an objectivist methodology; these students were given a more defined learning sequence and worked as individuals. The tutor monitored these students more closely.


Despite great publicity efforts, the researchers had difficulty recruiting subjects, indicating that many potential students may not have been prepared to learn music this way. The results of the study demonstrated that both regional groups performed less effectively than the local group. The researchers attributed this, and the recruitment difficulties, to several factors, including technical barriers, the cost of equipment, lack of a strong support infrastructure, student difficulties in maintaining regular email contact and preparing video material for feedback, and difficulty with the more open, unscheduled learning environment (e.g., other obligations interfering with the program). 


The researchers concluded that increasing the physical distance between instructor and student has a negative effect on the quality of performance, the level of student engagement in learning activities, and the development of knowledge and skill. However, they remained optimistic about the potential of this type of instruction, suggesting further research into web pedagogy and student learning styles, and a larger component of synchronous and face-to-face communication between instructor and student in future distance learning models.


=='''Semi-interactive online lessons for younger children'''==


As part of her Master’s degree program, Florida Atlantic University student Joline Long created an online distance learning music course for students in grades 3-5 called “Recorder 101” (Musgrove &amp; Musgrove, 2004). Long used WebCT, a distance learning software program often used by colleges and universities. Although Recorder 101 was designed as a completely online class, it was offered as a pilot study in a classroom environment with guidance from an in-person teacher (Ms. Long). Students initially needed assistance with the technology but were soon able to navigate the site and use WebCT features like discussion boards and chat rooms. They also benefitted from face-to-face collaboration with other students. In a survey given at the end of the class, 98% of the students responded positively to the program.


After reviewing this pilot study, Musgrove &amp; Musgrove (2004) drew the following conclusion:

“Where a fully online, autonomous program may be satisfactory for high school or adult learners, it may not be beneficial for younger children. It makes sense to combine the best of both traditional face-to-face and online delivery to produce web-enhanced learning environments for the younger end of the K-12 spectrum. Ideally, distance learning programs should augment, rather than replace the existing classroom expanding the elementary curriculum and filling gaps in traditional course offerings while keeping learning firmly centered within the school.” 


=='''Interactive lessons through videoconferencing'''==


“Technologies such as videoconferencing used for distance education are creating ways for schools to extend their learning communities to connect youth with professional communities of practice that approximate the face-to-face interactions in traditional classrooms” (Knight, Dixon ''et al'', 2004)


Videoconferencing can be an effective way to create opportunities for K-12 students from disadvantaged backgrounds to learn from professional musicians. One study examined a distance learning program in which faculty members and music education students at a music conservatory taught sessions to high school students through videoconferencing as educational outreach to the community (Knight, Dixon ''et al'', 2004). One of the partner high schools served a population consisting primarily of economically disadvantaged Black and Latino students; the students who participated in the program were chosen because of their talent and interest in the areas of music that were emphasized by the conservatory outreach instructors. 


The teachers, administrators, and students at this high school all viewed the program not just as an opportunity to extend the students’ learning community, but also as a motivator for the students to attend college. Positive aspects of the program mentioned by teachers and students included the musical information provided, the inspiration of seeing skilled performers, the convenience of not having to leave the school building, the ability to ask questions of the college students, the different styles of music to which the students were exposed, and the advice the students received. Negative aspects included the limited time, the density of information packed into each lesson, the poor sound quality, and technical glitches.


A case study by Dye (2007) examined desktop videoconferencing as an environment for applied music lessons. “Applied music” is defined as individual instruction in an instrument or voice. The study focused on comparing behaviors seen in these lessons to those found in prior studies of applied lessons. Three experienced music education majors taught lessons to six middle school band students, using Apple Macintosh computers and the iChat software program. 


The results showed that most of the behaviors observed in these lessons were consistent with those found in previous applied music research. Some differences were that the instructors modeled music less often and the students asked more questions than in traditional lessons. There was a high degree of focus in the lessons, with little time spent off-task. Other positive elements mentioned were convenience, good rapport between teacher and student, and the fact that students reported feeling less anxious in the distance-learning environment. Negative elements included technical obstacles (e.g. malfunctioning hardware, poor sound quality); instructors felt that they were less effective because of these problems. Instructors also felt limited by their inability to physically assist the students.


Dye concluded that videoconferencing has the potential to become a reasonable substitute for in-person learning if certain obstacles can be overcome. In particular, he mentioned the need for reliable technology, appropriate training in the use of the tools, and careful instructional design that includes an awareness of how given instructional strategies might be affected by the distance-learning format. 


=='''Conclusion'''==


Distance learning of music is still in its infancy, and it may take time to overcome the traditional paradigm of in-person instruction. One of the biggest obstacles to acceptance is the availability of necessary technologies and the deficiencies of those currently in existence. Because music is a sound-based art, there is a strong need for clear audio; this is frequently mentioned as one of the biggest drawbacks to distance learning. As technologies improve, this obstacle is being overcome.


It also seems clear that while some music subjects can be taught by accessing online learning modules, applied music instruction requires a synchronous interpersonal element. Videoconferencing appears to have the most potential for this subject. Hybrid instruction, combining asynchronous materials with live videoconferencing, may also be a method with potential in the area of applied music.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
The Columbia University Center for Career Education (CCE) provides career education programming to students at: 

•	Columbia College

•	The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science

•	School of General Studies

•	School of Continuing Education (Master of Science Programs and Post-Baccalaureate Certificate Programs)

•	Graduate School of Arts and Sciences

•	School of the Arts

•	Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation

As young adults make increasing use of Web 2.0 technologies in their daily lives, educators and career development professionals must keep pace with that change. Columbia University's Center for Career Education has recognized the potential to proactively use Web 2.0 technologies to not only aid in how career centers communicate with students; but to help make students more employable based on their knowledge and use of these technologies.

== Creating a Coherent, Cost-Effective and Sustainable Web 2.0 Strategy to Engage Students ==

Case studies can be used by career services professionals to provide them with information regarding the potential of innovatively using Web 2.0 technologies in career development initiatives. These specific technologies including Facebook, Twitter, Alumwire, Drupal and other emerging technologies can demonstrate compromises and trade-offs in the establishment of student support systems in higher education. Tait states that “the increasing domination of the social by the business environment brings challenges for educational institutions to retain their role when the marketization of education means that commercial companies with to enter the field in pursuit of revenue” (Tait 2000).

Through the use of a Web 2.0 technologies the Center for Career Education has continuously evaluated and vetted shifting technologies; established their career center as a relevant resource for students and created a sustainable strategy to implement various social media solutions. Students are then able to use their experience as digital natives to navigate career options as well as network in an extremely competitive workforce.In this way, the support services for counseling are no longer relegated to face-to-face communication and various psychological testing tools such as the MBTI and/or PET analysis.


== Experiential Learning and Student Support ==

The Center for Career Education uses a variety of experiential education opportunities for students interested in international internships, as well as careers in the arts. Additionally, Columbia Student Enterprises provides students with a unique opportunity to cultivate and develop transferable entrepreneurship and enterprise management skills through developing, managing, and working for student-run businesses. Program participants emerge as experienced entrepreneurs, with a strong foundation of service leadership, business ethics, professional responsibility and recognition of the limitless career opportunities they will gain from this experience. Unfortunately, there are no systems in place to measure whether students are actually achieving learning objectives and goals of the experiential learning programs. Furthermore, an emphasis has recently been put on critical reflection by sending student participants a series of questions via email, that they are required to respond. Although this method seems on it's surface to encourage critical reflection, Web 2.0 technologies can be used to support these students while encouraging reflective learning and career development tools. For example, through use of blogs, students can write about their international work experiences.  Wikis would allow students to come up with a mock proposal of how they would prepare subsequent students who would participate in an experiential learning program. Moreover, YouTube would allow students to post videos and other visuals of their experiences while sharing their learning with their peers.

== Example of Experiential learning through Critical Reflection ==

Considering of Columbia Experience Overseas program, students/participants are sent the following via electronic mail:


Hello CEO London participants! 

It was great to see you all last week at dinner and the alumni club event. I hope you had a wonderful time and are now fully settled in to your internship and accommodations.  Just wanted to let you know that I’ll be sending you an email about a different topic weekly to help guide you through your internship and provide some points for reflecting on your experience abroad. I hope you will read these carefully and put some thought into these topics, as discussing and reflecting on your experiences will help you learn, do well and have fun in your internship.  We want you to have a great experience out there, and I hope I can guide you in this. I will also be checking in with you guys via Skype or g-chat next week sometime. Decide with your roommate when you would like to chat with me and one of you send me the date and time that works for you both.  

This week’s reflection topic is Expectations &amp; Goal Setting. Now is a good time to think about what you expected going into your internship, as well as what you expected from moving to London for the summer. 

Here are some things to consider:

Are you doing what you thought you would be doing? If not, why? 
Are your expectations about the internship being met? What about the organization you are working for? 
Are your expectations about living in London being met? Have there been any surprises? 
Take some time to jot down your feelings and thoughts on these questions. If there are significant differences between your expectations and your reality, why do you think this is? Discussing this with your peers, as well as writing down your own thoughts, will help you understand yourself better.  Samuel Johnson’s quote above is insightful: understanding where the difference lies in what you expected and what you experience is key to finding satisfaction in what you are doing. The smaller the distance between the two, the more satisfying an experience you will have. If the distance between your expectations and your reality are quite substantial, it is time to rethink and regroup. It’s also a great time to revisit your goals. 

Setting goals is a great way to actively construct an experience so that you can get the most out of it. Remember to set specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely goals. For example, if you are interested in networking, a SMART goal is “to actively network with two people per week at my organization for the next six weeks”. An example of a vague goal would be “to learn networking”. The latter goal is so vague, that the end result can take too many forms and you may not have any idea if you achieved this or not by the end of your internship.

This week, set two or three concrete, SMART goals for yourself. What do you want to get out of this internship experience? Do you know specifically what it is you want to get and how to get it? Think about your expectations and how they have or have not been met thus far. Do you need to change your expectations?  If your expectations were too high, it’s time to recalibrate. If your expectations were too low, think about what you didn’t realize before hand. Write down your thoughts and keep them for yourself. In the end of your internship, you will be able to see how much you’ve learned about yourself and how much you’ve grown.

Good luck this week and I’ll talk to you guys soon!
 
&lt;u&gt;Beginning WEEK 4&lt;/u&gt;
 

 “Thinking is easy, acting is difficult, and to put one's thoughts into action is the most difficult thing in the world.”
 
 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe quotes (German Playwright, Poet, Novelist and Dramatist. 1749-1832)
 

Hello CEO London participants! 

It was nice chatting with you last week and I’m glad you are enjoying yourselves in London.  

This week’s reflection topic is Mindful Working. At this point, you are all immersed in your internships and most likely have gotten comfortable with your supervisors, co-workers and surroundings. Day to day, your tasks might change but you’re most likely used to your work environment and your activities in your internship. 

Now is the time to resist the urge to go into auto-pilot mode! Make sure you are thinking about the work you are doing and keeping your mind actively involved in your internship. This is not limited to your projects, but also the people around you, your supervisors, the goals of the company you are working for and larger projects that are going on that you may not be involved in.  

Some reflection questions to consider:

Who are the different entities that are benefiting from you being in this role? 
Do you think what you do is meaningful and worthwhile? Why or why not? 
Would you do the same job on a permanent basis and what is the reason for your answer? 
Answering these questions will help you keep yourself in check as to what you are getting and giving in your role. It will also ensure that you are having a meaningful experience and learning while you are working. 

Even if you are in an internship that is more unstructured than you prefer or your supervisors are not available to answer questions, it is important to think about what it is that makes you work hard, what makes you disengage and all that is in between. Working through what is murky or confusing at work will help you clarify what you need to do your job well. Remember to stay engaged and get yourself back on track when you have become distracted. Those who are most satisfied at work and most successful in their roles actively think about what they are doing each and every day. We all know the summer is distracting but learning how to motivate yourself and keep yourself actively interested in your work tasks will make your experience that much better.  

Good luck this week at work and have a great time in London! 

Take care,
 

&lt;u&gt;WEEK 5&lt;/u&gt;

“The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.”

 George Bernard Shaw quotes (Irish literary Critic, Playwright and Essayist. 1925 Nobel Prize for Literature, 1856-1950)

Hello CEO London participants! 

I hope this email finds you well and you are enjoying your internships and London.

This week’s reflection topic is Communication.  Improving communication skills is something that just about everyone can do.  It is an essential component of all relationships, personal and professional, and you’ll be using this skill the rest of your life. 

At this point in your experience, there have likely been moments that you may have been unclear on a task or question your supervisor asked or maybe you had something to offer up to a supervisor, but didn’t feel it was your place to do so. Learning what to say and when to say it is a priceless tool.  The sooner you are able to master this, the better off you’ll be in the majority of all situations (this also goes for living with people too).

Things to consider when communicating:

Why are we coming together right now? What’s the reason I am trying to communicate this? 
Are there any assumptions or anything implied that I want to clear up?   
What do I really want to communicate to this person? Have I asked enough questions to understand this person fully? 
It’s also important to realize that everyone processes information differently. Don’t assume that because you said something in a way that makes sense to you, that everyone you’ve communicated with understands it the same way. Make sure you verify by asking questions to make sure you’re on the same page.  Don’t assume you have communicated something without working with the person you’re speaking with to make sure that what you said is what they have interpreted.  It only takes an extra couple of questions to go from “I get it”, to “I totally understand”, so make sure you take that extra step. 

There is another crucial component to communicating: listening. Make sure you are listening to the person you are trying to communicate with.  Learn your biases, your assumptions, and your expectations before engaging with that person.  Take these into account when you are listening, so you can get a gauge of whether any of those things are playing into your communication.  Remember to verify what you are hearing with questions for the person speaking to you so that you can interpret it the way they intend. Listening is half of the trick in communication, so be sure to be all ears when someone is trying to communicate with you.

I hope this helps you out and I’m looking forward to hearing from you soon about your internships. 

Take care, 


&lt;u&gt;WEEK 6&lt;/u&gt;

Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.”   - John Dewey (American philosopher, psychologist and educational reformer)

“Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.”   

- John Dewey (American philosopher, psychologist and educational reformer)

Hi guys, 

I hope you had a nice weekend and are enjoying yourselves as you enter the last stretch of your internships.

This week’s reflection topic is Formal vs. informal education.  Your education is a mix of both formal and informal learning.  As Columbia students, you are getting arguably the best education out there.  But remember, what you are getting in the classroom is just one way in which you are learning.  Everything that you are doing day to day, all of the interactions you have had with other students, alumni and co-workers as well as all of the exploration you have done in the city is your informal education. Getting a Columbia education doesn’t just mean the rigorous academic work you’ve done; it includes all of the opportunities, connections, people and places that it has allowed you to incorporate into your life.    

For this week, consider how your formal education has informed or influenced what you are learning in your internships this summer. 

Some questions to reflect upon:

1. What did you learn about the field you are in, compared to what you studied in class? 

2. Was there a specific class or teacher that helped you understand something about your field that you got to see in person while you were working?

3. What classes, specific assignments, papers or labs have you done that you’re glad you did before your internship?  

Take some time this week to reflect on these questions. What are your thoughts on your formal and informal educational experiences? It’s critical to analyze what you’re learning in school and how it can play out in the real world.  Many times there won’t be a direct connection from book to real life, which is, simultaneously, the challenge and the beauty of a liberal arts education.  It’s up to you to use your critical thinking skills to synthesize what you’ve learned in class with the world around you to make the most of your experiences. 

Hope all else is well! 

&lt;u&gt;WEEK 7&lt;/u&gt;


“Really great people make you feel that you, too, can become great.” ~ Mark Twain quotes

 “Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean.” ~Ryunosuke Satoro, Japanese poet 

Hi guys, 

This will sadly be my second to the last reflection e-mail as you’ll be ending your internships in about a week and a half! I know the summer has flown for you and I hope you are enjoying the last bits of your London experience. *Tear*…anyway…

This week’s reflection topic is Interpersonal Skills.  What are interpersonal skills? They are the skill set you need to interact with all types of people in different situations. This isn’t strictly communication, but how you actually relate to people.  The core of interpersonal skills is the person, which brings me to the most important part: the people you have been involved with throughout your internship.

People are the driving force behind everything.  It might seem like a very obvious statement (and it is), but it’s often something that can be overlooked or forgotten completely. It’s easy to put our heads down, type away all day at the computer or research all day long and forget that there are people all around you.  Remember that everything you are doing is affecting more than one person. Don’t forget this! You’re making an impact on someone, directly or indirectly, with the work you are doing.  Additionally, whatever you are doing or working on is because of a person, not an entity. Entities, committees, organizations and companies don’t generate ideas and solve problems- people do, collectively and individually. Once you are a professional in the working world, you may be part of a larger group like a company, but you, the person, is who will be hired, not your degree or your credentials. That might get you the interview, but ultimately what you can say about yourself as a person is what will convince others to continue their interaction with you.  

 All of the interactions you have had thus far throughout your London experience should tell you more about yourself, as well as the diversity of perspectives that exist in the world around you.  People are very different and it’s very likely that you’ll work with people who do not share your beliefs, viewpoints or methods of communication.  It’s imperative that you make a concerted effort to learn as much as you can from your interactions about others and about yourself. 

Also, don’t forget to stay connected. The connections you’ve made can end up being life long relationships and great things can come of it. Thank the people that are around you and make sure they understand what kind of impact they have had on you.  It’s not only a great thing to do for someone else, but it can be very empowering to make those around you aware of their influence on you.  They, in turn, may share your impact on them. This can be very powerful for you personally and professionally. 

Some questions to reflect upon for this week:

If you had to choose, what would be your top three interactions you had this summer? 
 What feedback from roommates, co-workers, supervisors and friends did you receive that you would like to remember? What has resonated with you? 
What have you shared with others that you thought was helpful to them? 
What can you say about your interpersonal skills? How were they at the beginning of your summer and how are they now? 
Feel free to reflect on these questions as you approach your final week in London. Have a great weekend and I’ll talk to you guys very soon! 

Take care,

== Observations ==

Although the phrasing of the questions encourage reflection, there are other means in which we could use distance learning tools. For example, would it be feasible to TWEET some of the quotes? Could these questions be posted on a wiki and then multiple students can respond and support each other? Would something similar to Blackboard or Courseweb be sufficient in tracking the experiential learning of the students.

Email is adequate, but does it really cater to the mindset of the millennial or digital native?

== Final Thoughts ==
Tait states that the primary functions of student support are proposed as being threefold:

1. Cognitive: Support and developing learning through the mediation of the standard and uniform elements of course materials and learning resources for individual students.

2. Affective: Providing an environment which supports students, creates commitment and enhances self-esteem;

3. Systemic: Establishing administrative processes and information management systems which are effective, transparent and overall student friendly.

I think distance learning, when defined as &quot;a formalized teaching and learning system specifically designed to be carried out remotely by using electronic communication&quot; can and should be used in student support services and career development. However, this does require an instructor who is comfortable using a variety of technologies such as Itunes, podcasts, YouTube video and other emerging technologies.

Students self-esteem would increase, as students would be using tools that encourage creativity and reflection on their part.

Finally, these tools invoke a sense of familiarity to millennials, thus instructors will need to become more savvy at using these tools and understanding the administrative processes and not only assuring that the technologies are student-friendly, but allow for adequate educator flexibility.

Thanks for your work on the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Outreach/Christian Storytelling|Christian Storytelling]] honor.  I really like the way you expanded it.  However, you probably need to remove the story excerpted from ''Best Ever Mission Stories'' by Charlotte Ishkanian, as including it here is in violation of its copyright.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Introduction''' ==
As distance learning becomes more popular with the educational practice of K-12 curricula, it is essential to keep students engaged with not only the material, but the whole experience as well. Through the use of virtual worlds, students are able to experience a lesson plan that mimics characteristics of face to face, &quot;real world&quot; activity, without having to leave their computer screen. Implementing virtual worlds as tools for k-12 education allows for a more enriching distance learning experience.

== '''Virtual Worlds''' ==
Virtual worlds are simulated environments accessed via computer. In these environments users interact with the scenery in the form of avatars.  In virtual worlds, the scenery can be 2 or 3 dimensional and feature content similar to a fantasy or real world. Virtual worlds are platforms used in video games as well as in online social environments. In many, but not all virtual worlds, avatars can engage with each other in various manners of communication. Some interact via text, graphical actions, voice, sound and in some cases sensory equipment controlled by the user.

== '''Teen Second Life''' ==
Teen Second Life is a virtual world specifically designed for teens 13-17 and is accessible by the Internet. The platform is a part of the traditional Second Life virtual world designed by Linden Labs for Adults 18 and older. Teen second life is intended for teens to use as a social platform to make and communicate with friends, play, interact, learn, and create. The platform allows users to develop their own avatar, as a virtual representation of themselves. The platform is also user driven, so members can design content from buildings to grass blades for use in the game. The platform differs from a video game in that there is no defined goal for play. Users can essentially do what they wish while following teen second life's terms of service. Users can interact with other members for free, but to attain land and objects there are fees involved. Second life works vigorously to ensure that all members are between the ages of 13-17. The only adult members allowed in Teen Second Life are Linden Labs administrators and developers and educators that are granted permission through Linden Labs. All adult users are identified in a distinct matter.


== '''Application and Examples''' ==

Using Teen Second Life [http://teen.secondlife.com/], an international 3-D virtual world that enables teens from age 13-17 students from a Brooklyn High school were able to participate in lessons on physical science. After being awarded the Motorola Innovation Generation Grant, Cathy Arreguin, a curriculum developer from the Global Kids organization [http://globalkids.org/] assisted in developing a new curriculum for the freshmen physical science class at the High school for Global Citizenship [http://hs-gc.org]. The goal of the endeavor was to allow educators to use second life as medium to engage students in the fields of science, technology and programming. As an introductory task, educators used Teen second life to serve as a supplement to traditional face to face courses.

&lt;u&gt;Example 1&lt;/u&gt;

One project asked students to conduct a trash dump survey. Students toured a virtual replica of Naples, Italy and interacted with programmed chat bots. The chat bots were designed to represent different perspectives; from varying socio-economic status, ethnicity to varying in gender. The robots talked about the environment and allowed the students to experience what a scientist would have to do when conducting a survey. The students were then told to make a comparison to their real life trash disposal and create a comic, to tell the story of what they learned by exploring the city of Naples.

&lt;u&gt;Example 2&lt;/u&gt;
In another project, students were asked to explore a coal mine in a project based on fossil fuels and mining. The assignment allowed students to study data and develop ideas about alternate sources of fuel, an important aspect of the science curriculum. During the project students were asked to collect data on the amount of real life waste produced. Then students used teen second life to attribute that information to a virtual brownstone to calculate the carbon footprint of the household. The project was designed to allow the students to think about individual energy consumption within a household.


== '''Whyville''' ==

Whyville [http://www.whyville.net] is an educational virtual world designed for use by preteens. It is accessed for free via the Internet. The registered users or citizens of Whyville interact with each other in a simulation based environment. In this virtual world, citizens learn about topics ranging from the art, geography, business and science. Whyville is designed for users to play games, role play and chat in a virtual world that was designed for the purpose of education. Whyville is sponsored by government, corporate and non-profit entities.


== '''Applications and Examples''' ==
In 2007 Whyville received funding from the Texas workforce Commission to help users 14-15 learn about bio technology and expose them to career paths in this field. The Texas Business and Education Coalition Biotech advisory team, San Antonio Manufacturers Association San Antonio Acadamies, Kelly Aviation Center and Texas biotech and advanced manufacturing companies contributed funding for educational content in Whyville.

whyville Texas challenge was a contest where teachers could sign-up students to play educational games in Whyville Bioplex and Whyville Plane Works to win prizes and  encourage students to learn about different career areas.

&lt;u&gt;Example 1&lt;/u&gt;

Whyville Bioplex allows teen users to learn about vaccines. In the virtual world, the users learned how to develop a vaccine against whypox a virus that is similar to the flu and caused avatars to break out with red spots if they were not treated properly. Users were exposed to the field of drug design and the elements involved in creating vaccines for ailments

&lt;u&gt;Example 2&lt;/u&gt;

Whyville Plane works is an area of Whyville that allows users to build planes. This allows users to become familiar with the field of aviation and aspects involved in designing aircraft. This experience allows users to engage and interact in an area that they most likely would not have access to in the real world.

== '''Educational Benefits of Virtual Worlds''' ==



     ''-More interaction among students''
     ''-Students put at ease''
     ''-Engaging environment''
     ''-More opportunities for learning''
     ''-Students more willing to take risks''

== ''' Implementing Virtual worlds into the classroom''' ==
In order to implement virtual worlds into the classroom it is important to analyze the needs of the organization. Analysis of the types of goals that need to be accomplished can help determine if the use of virtual world would be beneficial to the organization. It will be important to understand if the use of teen second life will provide a benefit to the curriculum or if its use would be optional. During the needs assessment the needs of the students and the needs of the faculty should be addressed. 

Following a needs assessment, there needs to be an analysis of budgetary costs and training time. In regards to budget, the factors that need to be accounted for are development and user privileges. For maximum user privilege there is a fee per membership. This needs to be counted into the assessment for a complete idea of what implementation of second life involves. The curricula should be analyzed to determine the type of access required.

Another aspect that needs to be factored into the planning is the cost of a developer. For ease in developing  learning environments, it is recommended that a developer be hired to create virtual learning environments within the teen second life platform. Rather than relying on volunteers or fellow educators, a developer can be paid to focus on the fast execution of developing specified content. The cost of hiring the developer as well as the fees required for using land and resources within teen second life would have to be factored in.

Staff training will be a necessary step to initiating the implementation of virtual worlds into k-12 education. Educators will need to learn how to use the second life environment. Learning how to travel from island to island, customize the avatar and if necessary develop user content are all steps that need to be learned by the educators. It will be ineffective for the educator to instruct students in an environment in which they are not well versed.

==''' Summary''' ==
Using virtual worlds like Teen second life, second life, and Whyville educators can be very creative in developing classroom curricula.  For instance if budgetary concerns restrict the process of having a class related field trip, an exact replica of a location can be visited in second life. Also if an educator wanted students to understand a concept that occurs in a dangerous location, it is possible to do so in a virtual world. Virtual world simulations can be mapped out to compliment most lesson plans and provide an enlightening experience for the learner. The use of virtual worlds allows for a different type of distance learning environment. The learning environment is more versatile and no longer limited to simply message boards and discussion threads. Currently educators are using virtual worlds like Second life to hold online classes completely conducted in the virtual environment. This is becoming a new trend in adult education and it won't be long before the k-12 sector catches up. With more virtual k-12 schools developing, virtual worlds are becoming useful tools for distance learning.

This chapter will be collapsed into the new chapter that will be the business plan template. The methods here, will directly link to the fields of the business plan.

Need to check the NZTE business plan template is complete as compared with orther business plans --[[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 23:48, 24 February 2010 (UTC)

==Sustainability references within linked Booklets==
There are a number of things I have picked up as I have gone through the booklets - there is a large quantity of text when you pull all the booklets in arent there.

Firstly, if we were to integrate sustainability into all the booklets it would be a large task. So instead I have made changes where the concept of sustainability could be confused - such as where the language of sustainability is being used to denote business continuity. I have also changed references and related egs from environment to sustainability. Only in minimal places have I made changes that broaden the discussion to include sustainability - and i tend to have made reference to this in the related section in the business plan 

It would pay for you also to skim through the booklets and make sure this job is complete and there isnt some obvious place where a sustainability reference would be easy and valuable.

I suggest if there is a way of searching for a word in text that you do that for sustainability to make sure i have picked up all references to the word in all the booklets and ensured that they are in the right vein. 

I started to record what changes i was making in the doc - starting each comment with Leigh - however it occured to me that this wasnt the right way of drawing your attn to what i had done so stopped this after a while. anything i think you need to know i have putting in this note --[[User:Leanneholdsworth|Leanneholdsworth]] ([[User talk:Leanneholdsworth|talk]]) 00:12, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

:Great. I will look out for the changes to Business Continutity as different to Sustainability.. my only thought was it might lead people towards thinking we mean sustainability to be only ecological.. I'll take a look in my next round of editing to answer this question.. [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 00:06, 16 March 2010 (UTC)

==References to templates in booklets==
in some of the booklets like how to reduce the risk there are references to templates - do we have those in this doc and therefore should we be including references to them? --[[User:Leanneholdsworth|Leanneholdsworth]] ([[User talk:Leanneholdsworth|talk]]) 00:22, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

:These references to Templates where the original structure of the NZTE texts. Where a booklet refers to a Template, it was actually referingto a section within the Business Plan. We have effectively reversed the relationship - knowing that most people just want to get straight into writing their Business Plan, and that we refer them out to info in the Booklets when they encounter a section in the business plan that needs more info. So, we should delete all reference to the word's Template. Please, if you see it, delete it. In saying that, it might be good to check if we are referring to the booklet from the business plan first. We don't want to break a link all together. [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 00:06, 16 March 2010 (UTC)

==Broken links==

i have added an external link that is not working - its to the sbn. perhaps you can let me know what i have done wrong - think its in that booklet above. --[[User:Leanneholdsworth|Leanneholdsworth]] ([[User talk:Leanneholdsworth|talk]]) 00:22, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

:I'll look out for it Leanne.. perhaps log any broken links you find here so we can track them [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 00:06, 16 March 2010 (UTC)

==Images==

where there are pics in the booklets such as in planning fo the future, manufacturing and industry sector influences it says they will be being updated in march 2010. you probably need to get in touch with them to make sure that there isnt a new version of the booklets etc on the boil and if we should be using a more updated version - i hope not.... and see what we need to be doing about the  --[[User:Leanneholdsworth|Leanneholdsworth]] ([[User talk:Leanneholdsworth|talk]]) 00:22, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

:The images currently there are placeholders. I added them just to illustrate to others what and where an image might go. Ideally, I hope to find at least 1 image for each booklet that the designer can use as a basis for designing the covers for each booklet. I will send an email to the NZTE reps to check if they are moving to create a new set of books, and that they might consider joining us on the wiki at some stage. That would be quite an outcome of this project if that were to happen! [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 00:06, 16 March 2010 (UTC)

==Booklets==
in booklet index not sure 1-12 and 13+ need to be seperated - that made sense in the business plan but doesnt work i dont think when refered to as additional booklets 

I have struggled with where to put  a booklet on sustainable business practice. i know we are integrating the concept but i still have generic sustainability content i think needs to be added somewhere. see what you think about where i have put it - in the profile with a reference to a booklet

In terms of the booklets i still ahve some work to do on the manufacturing one and whats important to you and the sustainable business practice. otherwise i am done with the booklets. 

i will now be putting my attention back onto text in the business plan. --[[User:Leanneholdsworth|Leanneholdsworth]] ([[User talk:Leanneholdsworth|talk]]) 00:22, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

:Re: 1-12 and 13+ I'll take a look... 

:Regarding a new booklet for Sustainable Business Practice: Ok, great. I think it would certainly be worth creating a Sustainable Business Practice booklet, and for that booklet to be the aggregation of all the content we have attempted to intergrate. Perhaps the Chapter we have for Sustainability becomes that booklet with additional content such as examples and practical steps? Then we would end up with only 2 chapters: The Business Plan and Booklets :) For now, let's just go with the creation of Sustainable Business Practice and consider this later. 

:Re minor edits and additions.. great. Not far to go now, just some close eye work in ironing out copyedit and spotting as many chances for adding sustainability related content into as many of the existing booklets as time permits us.

==Comments from Leanne''s edits from 19 March to 1 April==
Leigh, can you please address these as they are posted. Thanks
* What is your view on whether there should be a distinction between what's important to me and Why I started this business? It may be too subtle - thoughts plse

:If there is an opprtunity to consolidate content into one, we shoudl take it. In this case, it seem logical to me. [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 05:17, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

* I'm having difficulty with wiki accpeting my selection of text for italics. I am managing to get some of each of my changes italicised though. and my signature is at the end of each one. So hopefully this is going to be enough to alert you to putting the information in the right booklet/example section

:No worries, Basically italics need a double inverted comma around each paragraph of text [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 05:17, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

* the competition section - alludes to list any other points that are not mentioned above - that confuses me - may need clarification? 

:Yeah, I was trying to think of a wayto get rid of the competition section for where it conflicts with sustainability.. you know, protectionism and avoidence of collaboration has adverse affects on sustainability. Imagine if this text was to follow such advice? We wouldn't be on a wiki and we would be using permissive copyrights. And yet there are non-protectionist business models.. a whole nother booklet though [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 05:17, 19 March 2010 (UTC) 

* the stakeholder engagement section - used to be customer engagement or some such. anyway the bullet on customers seems pretty meaningless to me? needs explanation. perhaps it can be linked to a booklet that explains more?

:Will look into it.. [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 05:17, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

*Thanks for above and you have done good work since i worked on it on friday. I have 5 hours of nanny time from now so hopefully you will notice i big chunk from me today. no doubt this point is just the beninning of todays points...

WIth internal links, its great the way the link points to the part within the sustianable business chapter - eg return to sender eco coffins. i note that at the end of the section where it says useful booklets, it doesnt take them directly to the place in the booklet. does that matter?

:Still thinking about it. So far I think its better to be general with the &quot;useful booklets&quot; list, and link specifically in the ''see case study on..''. I'm thinking mainly about print.. you'll notice that the Useful Booklet also says (section...) this is for print. Perhaps when the Booklets are stable enough, we can rethink this linking.. --[[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 09:56, 24 March 2010 (UTC) 
Having spent some hours navigating around yesterday I think you may be right to keep the booklets ref general --[[User:Leanneholdsworth|Leanneholdsworth]] ([[User talk:Leanneholdsworth|talk]]) 23:20, 24 March 2010 (UTC)

The Stakeholder engagement link to the sustainable business chapter seems to be a bit wonky
:Not sure.. works find for me here. Sometimes on differing resolution screens, the anchor (the link to a section) get's out because the page fits differently within a screen. --[[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 09:56, 24 March 2010 (UTC)
What I meant was, in the useful booklet section at end of stakeholder engagement, the text reads: Sustainable Business/Sustainable business practice (Section: Stakeholder engagement) - i dont think it is supposed to start with sustainable business before sustainable business practice? --[[User:Leanneholdsworth|Leanneholdsworth]] ([[User talk:Leanneholdsworth|talk]]) 23:20, 24 March 2010 (UTC) 
 

Finance Section - I have added an intro sentance - you may not feel it necessary. have also added a couple of sustainability sentances. havent updated the tables to reflect my comments - not confident to do so - dont think it matters but if you do then add in a Sustainability expense in admin expense area

:Sentences makes sense to me. Table updated. Link to Finance example added. --[[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 09:56, 24 March 2010 (UTC)

Key success factors is a heading right at the end of the business plan. Seems misplaced at the end of the business plan. i would delete it. i think we ask enough similar questions at the start of the business plan

:I love it when you tell me to delete things. Less is more. This deletion made perfect sense to me. --[[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 09:56, 24 March 2010 (UTC)

the industry sector headings - last section in BP arent quite the same - think the headings need to include industry sector so the sectioin is not confused with the industry influences section earlier in the BP

:Was a little confused by this.. please check I've done it right. --[[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 09:56, 24 March 2010 (UTC)
Done right :)--[[User:Leanneholdsworth|Leanneholdsworth]] ([[User talk:Leanneholdsworth|talk]]) 23:20, 24 March 2010 (UTC)

I would delete the key ratios heading - doesnt add anything that is not in the kpi section
: :) --[[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 09:56, 24 March 2010 (UTC)

do we need to worry about this message on the sustainable business bookletpage - Warning: This page is 39 kilobytes long; some browsers may have problems editing pages approaching or longer than 32kb. Please consider breaking the page into smaller sections. ?

: We should try and think of ways to shorten the page. Its no big deal, but it is getting to be a large booklet... on second thoughts, the table that explains how the principles map, could become an appendix if need be... --[[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 09:56, 24 March 2010 (UTC) 
I like that idea --[[User:Leanneholdsworth|Leanneholdsworth]] ([[User talk:Leanneholdsworth|talk]]) 23:20, 24 March 2010 (UTC)

*the way the examples have worked out I have not done what we discussed which was have a consistent business (3of them in fact) throughout the business plan.

the reasons for starting business is still not where i had envisaged it. i was thinking it would be integrated inot the booklet business profile - however, leave this in your camp - not an arm and a leg. thd content needs formatting as well
&lt;br&gt;
i see the case studies have been changed to examples of sustianable business. that is ok except there are examples peppered throughout the buisness plan. over to you though
&lt;br&gt;
yesterday i emailed through a para re gri - no worries if you have decided not to use it but incase it has been overlooked

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''INTRODUCTION'''
----

One feature of an effective school is the degree to which the faculty and staff are provided opportunities to learn and grow as professionals.  Visionary administrators and school leaders take the time to thoughtfully deliberate and plan the professional development of their teachers. In recent years, the use of technology in the curriculum has emerged as one of the “hot” topics for in-service trainings, colloquiums, and workshops. For example, no issue is more current now (and more hotly debated) than that of the place that social networks like Facebook have in schools. Should teachers be permitted to “friend” students? Should schools take a hardline stance on what their students can do and say on a social network? 

As a member of several independent school web listservs, I participate in robust discussions with colleagues around the globe regarding school policies and curriculum.  The one theme that permeates most of my conversations is how middle and high schools can most effectively help students learn internet safety and cyber-ethics. Students in most K-12 environments are bombarded daily with ethical dilemmas, and teachers are essential role models, mentors, and voices in the learning process. To help students navigate through the depths of these murky waters, they must first educate themselves about the ethical use of technology.

In a previous age, prior to the 1980’s digital revolution, teachers had an easier time making the case that they were the sole experts with knowledge to impart. This knowledge was transferred via an arguably more static curriculum and vis a vis simplistic, predictable tools such as the standard textbook and chalkboard. These easily manipulated non-tech tools gave educators a sense that they indeed were the gurus whose role was to move students along life’s highway toward predictable career destinations. In that era, most adults despite the maturity and age differential could at least feign being on the same “playing field” with kids; conversations about common values and ethics could happen without having to reference a technological tool. Whereas most teachers can still easily speak about ethics and “the right thing to do” they have a tougher time when the ethical lesson hinges upon a reference to a technological tool or system(e.g. Facebook, i-phone, etc.).  To illustrate, consider the scenario in which a tech savvy child receives a lecture on the “evils” of texting by an adult that may not even know what texting is. The problem is inherently one of credibility.  

The current generational digital divide makes things a bit more challenging.  Many of today’s educators are playing “catch up” to learn about the devices and digital tools that most of their students already use on a daily basis. At the turn of the 21st century, Prensky (2001) introduced the concepts of digital native and digital immigrant.  I cannot conceive of a more relevant paradigmatic lens through which to look at the curricular and technological tensions that persist in many schools. In K-12 environments where the chasm between Prensky’s native and immigrant populations is significantly cavernous, institutional policies and curriculum focusing on technology’s use can seem anti-tech and draconian. Technology and the ways children use it are often demonized and stigmatized as the “things” that are wrong with our culture. Conversely, many good schools have embraced technology and positive teacher aimed publications like Edutopia(published by The George Lucas Foundation), make the case that the natives and immigrants are embracing each other in myriad ways. In doing this, such trailblazing schools are moving steadily toward Prensky’s (2009) techno-nirvanic state of “digital wisdom.” It is this latter (more harmonious) model that interests me, for in it lies the promise of good schools becoming great learning centers; places where bridges are being built that can cross any digital divide that exists.


'''WHY A CYBER-ETHICS CURRICULUM?'''
----

Strom &amp;Strom (2007) highlight the need for adults to be able to communicate more effectively and thoughtfully with kids by accentuating a call for more emphasis on cyber ethics in schools. They reflected on multiple ways in which recently developed technological tools and skills have created new ways in which cheating can occur.  Cheating is at the core an ethical issue and not a technological issue, but technology has made it easier. To illustrate, they stated, “when students lack training regarding ethical practices for searching the Internet, they may suppose it is alright to present the words and views of another person as their own thinking.” 

Bartlett (2009) described the world of essay mills about which many teachers only know very little. This, again, suggests a place where teachers and administrators must educate themselves if they are going to be able to help students gain a more ethical use of technology. Ackey (2008) argued that “not until November 1990 did schools’ curricula have any ethical or social applications with regard to the web.” He delineates the central ethical issues as: “privacy and confidentiality, hacking and spamming, property/copyright, netiquette, vandalism, access, and accuracy.” I know of few schools that fully address these issues on any kind of ongoing basis with students.

Kruger (2003) suggested several ways in which schools can start the cyber ethics conversation with students. Among them, he advocated, “work cyber ethics into assignments and discussions. Include terms such as copyright and intellectual property 
into vocabulary lists.”  He added, “When students see you working at your computer, take a moment to show them your software license. Point out the copyright symbol and explain what it means.”  Researchers like Rader (2002) also add to the voices that offer suggestions. Ashmore and Herman (2006) described the legal issues related to schools and cyber ethics. Again, this is an area in which teachers and students seem to be inadequately informed. 


'''DISTANCE LEARNING: AN EFFECTIVE TRAINING AND DELIVERY METHOD FOR TEACHER IN-SERVICE'''
----

Regarding the aforementioned challenges facing our schools, distance learning holds great promise as a training tool for teachers. Merely talking about a cyber-ethics curriculum in abstract terms will not adequately address the issue.  An effective teacher professional development in-service on cyber-ethics needs to be delivered utilizing distance learning modalities. To do the contrary seems illogical. To illustrate, how can one purport to teach educators about ways in which the internet makes cheating accessible without showing myriad examples of the websites that entice K-12 students to do so?  Again, when many teachers were school-aged children, the concept of cyber-ethics did not even exist. The very nature of cheating on a school assignment has changed radically. For a digital immigrant, plagiarizing or copying the work of another was a  basic act of looking on another’s paper or possibly copying passages from an encyclopedia. Conversely, for the digital native, the methods seem infinite. There exist a plethora of ways to cheat using technology and using the web.

In the fall of 2009, I had the honor of presenting an in-service on cyber-ethics and social networking to a group of K-9 teachers. I cited the landmark research by The Josephson Institute of Ethics. They conducted a qualitative study using surveys and self-reporting on the subject of cheating. Their population was a cross-section of students (N= 36,000). When asked if they had ever cheated, these teens opened up and their responses left most of the teachers in my workshop aghast. 
60% said they had cheated on tests and assignments

95% said they were never caught and consider themselves to be morally responsible people

63% of parents said their child would not cheat under any circumstances

Interestingly, the researchers at The Josephson Institute of Ethics also tested a hypothesis that mostly underperforming kids choose to cheat. The researchers separated 3,000 kids from the aggregate. These students were all members of the Who’s Who List.  Again, 80% indicated that they had cheated on teacher tests. The numbers alone are not the most revelatory feature of these findings, but rather the reasons  students gave to explain their behavior. Among the top reasons they cited were that web sites make it easy and a lack of understanding about what cheating is. Our kids are speaking to us. Are we listening? In their  clamorous voices, I hear a clear imperative for cyber-ethics in the curriculum.


'''DISTANCE LEARNING TOOLS FOR A TEACHER IN-SERVICE ON CYBER-ETHICS IN K-12 CURRICULUM'''
----

In this final section, I will illustrate some specific ways in which distance learning can be used to design a powerful professional development workshop for teachers. Of the dozens and dozens of staff professional development trainings that I have attended, none of utilized distance learning tools. Typically, they all follow the same structure: presentation of an issue or problem, lecture or presentation, break out group work, and a commitment to action goals for the school year. While this model can work, in my experience it often doesn’t.  The missing piece to an effective training is to incorporate distance learning opportunities. There are several reasons for this: (1) distance learning allows for the conversation to continue long after the seminar ends. The use of discussion boards or a website would enhance the training and render it free of time and space constraints. (2) distance learning allows for knowledge and networks to build and burgeon over time. The use of a wiki on the topic of cyber-ethics in K-12 schools could be an extremely useful resource to teachers throughout a school year. I close now with several more specific ideas. 


'''YOU TUBE'''
----

You Tube and Teacher Tube are great resources for delivering a distance learning experience for teachers. First, teachers can find video uploads from their colleagues around the country and world. Teacher Tube, especially, features educators providing instruction in all subject areas. Second, a teacher could learn a great deal from viewing sites like YouTube.  For example, videos on “how to plagiarize” are rife on the internet, and give teachers insight and awareness as to what is available for free to their students. A good in-service would include these real examples of distance learning on the web. As an administrator I am alarmed by the numbers of teachers are not even aware of what one can find on sites like Teacher Tube and You Tube. 


'''CHEAT WEBSITES'''
----

As a second dimension of a quality distance learning in-service, I would spend a few hours with teachers actually visiting any of the thousands of self titled “cheat sites” that exist on the web. Again, most teachers and parents I have worked with seem shocked to learn about these “portals to plagiarism.” Distance learning provides a trainer with “real world” examples to share. In preparing for the inservice that I facilitated in the summer of 2009, I researched online cheat sites, and was shocked by the level of sophistication and unabashed pride the designers seemed to take in their controversial craft. Many of these essay mills actually come with toll free customer support and fully developed mission statements. As a facilitator, I would recommend giving teachers time (with guided questions and tasks) to visit any of the cheat sites listed below:

www.schoolsucks.com – this is a free warehouse for everything one would ever need. They boast having over 100,000 essays. 

www.termpaper.com  - On my last visit to this site, they had a fee of 20.00 to 35.00 per essay. One search of a common book read by middle schoolers across this country yielded about 20 pages of results.

www.cheater.com – This site includes a mission statement that almost makes them sound noble. It states,“Cheater.com is one of the largest FREE online research resources available to students today. We have content in over 100 different subjects from Art History to reports on the history of the Internet and new content is being added daily. While somewhat controversial, we believe the best way to learn is by example. With over 40,000 term papers online available for you to search through to gather information for your own reports or papers we have created a fantastic resource available to students around the world.”


'''DISCUSSION BOARDS, NINGS, AND WIKIS'''
----

A final distance learning component would be the establishment of a teacher, administrator, and parent network in the form of a NING, discussion board, or wiki. This would be the post-workshop feature that would allow ongoing collaboration by all constituents. I would strongly recommend that teachers post items, questions, additions throughout the school year so that these issues stay on the proverbial front burner. In addition, I can foresee this type of distance learning collaboration  leading to real change in schools. There could be links to lesson plans on cyber-ethics, internet safety, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Using Distance Learning to Re-Invent Extracurricular Activities'''

It is well documented that extracurricular activities are vital to a student’s overall performance in school and can be linked to their later successes. Extracurricular activities provide an avenue for self-expression in a “safe” environment, encourage development of a broader range of interests, teach responsibility and carry on the work of education after traditional classroom time has ended. 

Further, many activities, sports and student government in particular, encourage the development of integral leadership skills and abilities, healthy competitive drive, and help development key interpersonal skills. 


&lt;u&gt;Extracurriculars as Informal Learning Spaces&lt;/u&gt;

Drawing on concepts introduced by Henry Jenkins in the paper &lt;u&gt;Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture&lt;/u&gt;, connections can be made between distance learning and the “non-curriculum”, informal learning environment of clubs and activities. A program that revolves around the concept of informal learning would need to be one of “participatory culture” or one in which every child or student would play a role. By its very definition, a participatory culture is the perfect medium for expression within an extracurricular activity. Of Jenkins’ five key elements, most brick and mortar extracurriculars meet or exceed each expectation:

     1.	relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement
     2.	strong support for creating and sharing creations with others, 
     3.	some type of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the most experienced is passed     
        along to novices, 
     4.	members who believe that their contribution matters, 
     5.	members who feel some degree of social connection with one another (Jenkins, 5-6)

Jenkins cites James Gee when discussing the related topic of affinity spaces, which can be used as a main component of such a learning program, both distance and traditional brick and mortar. Using affinity spaces(a digital center of informal, voluntary learning) to translate a brick and mortar participatory culture into a digital one, children can be taught higher level thinking, can move at their own pace and can develop the skills of their choosing.


&lt;u&gt;Why Distance Learning?&lt;/u&gt;

Generally speaking, most schools’ clubs and activities meet either after classes have let out for the day, at lunchtime, or in the morning. This schedule theoretically works well for all involved: moderators (generally a teacher), students (who are already in the building) parents, and administrators who need not worry about opening the building on a non-school day. However, moderators face any number of unforeseen challenges when working with this schedule. At 3PM, students are looking to unwind, to socialize, to decompress, and some higher achievers are seeking to complete their homework. The success of any planned activity will often depend solely not on the skill of the teacher, but on the performance level of the students involved.

Researchers in the Health, Emotion, &amp; Behavior Laboratory at Yale University have created a program dealing with Emotional Literacy. It is their belief, currently supported by extensive research, that emotions and mood play key roles in the success of interpersonal, creative, and academic endeavors. A component of the program as introduced to K-12 students is the Mood Meter, whereby children are encouraged to rate their mood on an XY axis chart( Energy scaled -5 Low to +5 High, Feeling scaled -5 Low to +5 high). Mood will fall into one of four categories or colors: Blue, red, yellow or green. Yale researchers have found that each quadrant can be associated with a variety of activities. For instance, a student who ranks in the blue quadrant, that is, one who ranks both their feeling and energy level as less than zero, will be less likely to do well at experiential learning (''Yale - eischools.org'') and more likely to do well at an activity that deals with repetition and less active learning. At the same time, a student who ranks both their feeling and energy as more than zero(yellow) will find sports, or other high energy activities, “including” experiential learning, as more to their liking. At the end of a school day, it is difficult to maneuver all participating students into the proper mood and energy level for the kind of learning necessary to a specific club. Moderators have two choices when faced with students who are all over the Mood Meter graph (or for non-participating schools, very simply put, with children who are either excited to be there, worn out from the day’s activities, stressed, cranky, etc, or generally being children or young adults); A moderator can force the students to work past their sometimes counterproductive or clashing moods, or they can create a variety of activities that appeals to all participants and their chosen degree of participation. The pitfalls of this approach are evident to any experienced classroom teacher. It is for this reason that the Yale researchers have set about designing a program that will not only help alleviate these common classroom issues, but will help moderators and teachers get the highest level of participation from their students. 

Emotional literacy can and does tie in with both James Gee’s concept of affinity spaces and Jenkins’ idea of participatory culture. Both tout the idea of voluntary learning as being one of the most effective methodologies of education. A child who is self-motivated will naturally seek to succeed more than a child whose only motivation is to get through the assigned work. An extracurricular or club should be a place of participatory culture: it should be fun, it should be interesting, and the students are there of their own accord. Ideally, each student should be allowed to proceed at their own self-directed pace, but within traditional time constraints, this is not always possible. 

However, when you make the shift and transfer the extracurricular activity to a digital environment, the playing field is suddenly leveled. The robotics student who was too stressed from an exam to concentrate on engineering in the lab can choose to concentrate on a task that suits their mood at that moment. That same student can then sit down at a PC at 9PM, log onto a group website, and upload a sketch of a mechanical concept, critique the designing that occurred in the lab that day or offer valuable input that might have otherwise been lost. 

Continuing to draw on the concept of affinity spaces, that same student can begin a critique and realize that they lack the particular term or knowledge about a specific area. With their mood now firmly in the proper emotional mood quadrant, they can then seek out a digital learning environment online, research the concept that interests them, reformulate their opinion based on newly acquired knowledge, and pass that on to the rest of the group. 

In a traditional setting, this sequence of events might have occurred, but the structure does not encourage the same level of self-directed learning. In the newly envisioned environment of participatory culture, this methodology will be taught and become second nature to all students. All will be aware of and treat the digital world as a vast compendium of resources, information and even entertainment. 

Further, valuable discussion can be saved and added to in the future. It is a simple task to record audio of planned brainstorming sessions, post the audio file for members to listen to, or to create a transcript as a jumping off point for a forum discussion. 

In the same vein, using Smartboard or other interactive whiteboard technology, sketches and concepts can be saved and rebroadcast to the entire group. In this way, learning can become a time efficient blend of both brick and mortar and distance learning. The structure would ensure that both methodologies are utilized to their fullest extent. 

&lt;u&gt;
Structure of a Participatory Culture Model&lt;/u&gt;

Drawing on personal experience, it is easiest to lay out a foundation for this approach with a familiar topic: robotics. 

Based on ideas above, a social network can be created for the group: for instance, on Ning.com. Ning is a free service that provides for forums, blogs, images, music and chat. A moderator can post ideas for discussion, pertinent documents, upload whiteboard images, post audio transcripts of podcasts, create lists of links, and create their own virtual compendium of knowledge. Students can alter and add to this compendium – it has the ability to grow along with the needs of the group. 

Topics can be posted for discussion: the students who cringe at the thought of public speaking can find their voices, take time to think about their words, and contribute valuable material to ongoing dialogues at their own pace.

In terms of research, a space such as this will hopefully eliminate instances of “I found this great piece of research, but I forgot it at home (or didn’t have a printer)”. Links and articles can be quickly added and accessed from all locations. Affinity spaces can be utilized to their full extent, as they can be found and included nearly instantly. 

All of this can then be accessed at a time when a student is most capable and ready to handle the wealth of information available, to do their most effective higher-level thinking, and is in the proper mindset to solve problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The aldehyde is a functional group underneath the general group known as carbonyls.  An aldehyde is a compound which contains a terminal carbon that is bound to any generic “R” group, doubly bonded to an oxygen, and single-bonded to a hydrogen. The “R” group is normally a simple aliphatic chain. When the “R” group is hydrogen, the resulting aldehyde is the simplest one, and is known as formaldehyde. 

The carbon doubly bound to the oxygen is labeled as the alpha-carbon. Thus, the hydrogen bound to that carbon is the alpha-hydrogen. Because of the resonance stabilization from the carbonyl oxygen, the hydrogen is more acidic and has a pKa around 17. Of course, this pKa varies on the “R” group that the carbon is bound to.

==Nomenclature==

[[Image:Iupac-aldehyde.png|frame|right|244px|Examples of IUPAC nomenclature for aldehydes.]]

When naming aldehydes use the IUPAC rules. For some aldehydes, it is much easier to use their common name.

'''IUPAC rules:&lt;br&gt;'''
1.	The carbonyl carbon is designated as carbon #1. &lt;br&gt;
2.	The longest alkyl chain including&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; the carbonyl carbon is designated and named according to normal alkyl rules. &lt;br&gt;
3.	 The suffix for an aldehyde is –al. The “e” in the alkane chain is replaced with “-al” to designate that the molecule is an aldehyde. &lt;br&gt;
4.	 Exception: If the carbonyl carbon of an aldehyde is part of a ring, the compound is now a cycloalkane carbaldehyde. The carbon of the ring to which the aldehyde is attached is now carbon #1. &lt;br&gt;
5.	An aldehyde takes higher priority than an alcohol group. &lt;br&gt;
6.	If an aldehyde is a substituent because there are multiple carbonyl groups present, the carbonyl with the longer alkyl chain predominates and then presence of the other carbonyl group is designated by –oxo. &lt;br&gt;

'''Several Common Names: &lt;br&gt;'''
[[Image:37.gif|frame|right|244px|Benzaldehyde.]]
In some cases, the aldehyde can be named by removing the suffix and replacing it with aldehyde.
For example: &lt;br&gt;
HCHO is named formaldehyde. &lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO is named acetaldehyde.&lt;br&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CHO is named benzaldehyde.&lt;br&gt;

==Reactivity==

Like all the carbonyl compounds, the carbonyl carbon in the aldehyde is positively charged due to the electronegative atom. Thus, the carbonyl carbon is an electrophile. 

'''Nucleophilic Attack:''' Because of the polarity of the carbonyl carbon, nucleophilic attack is a typical reaction aldehydes undergo. Thus, the carbon is subject to nucleophilic attack from other excellent nucleophiles such as cyanide and hydroxide ions.  In nucleophilic attack, the lone pair of electrons on the nucleophile attacks the positively charged carbon, which moves one of the two bonds shared between the carbon and oxygen onto the oxygen. Now the oxygen bears a full negative charge. This oxygen can be worked up with acid resulting in the alcohol. 

'''Reducing and Oxidizing Aldehydes''' &lt;br&gt;
1.  Aldehydes can be reduced to primary alcohols by using reducing agents such as sodium borohydrate and lithium aluminum hydride.  For example, ethanol is reduced to ethanol by using one of those two reducing agents. &lt;br&gt;
2. Aldehydes can also be oxidized to carboxylic acids using reducing acids such as permanganate or nitric oxide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ketone-displayed.png|150px|right|thumb|A '''ketone'''. Carbonyl is in between two hydrocarbons.]]
A ketone is another functional group under the general groups of carbonyls.  In a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is doubly-bonded to an oxygen, and single bonded to two alkyl groups, which can be either identical or different. It is important for both “R” groups to be alkyl groups – if the “R” group is an “H”, it becomes an aldehyde, a carboxylic acid if the “R” group is an “OH”, and an ester if the “R” group is “OR.”&lt;br&gt;

The carbon atom next to the carbonyl carbon is the alpha-carbon. By analogy, the hydrogen’s attached to the alpha-carbon are the alpha-hydrogens. 

==Nomenclature==
[[Image:Iupac-ketone.png|frame|right|244px|Examples of IUPAC nomenclature for ketones.]] [[Image:O_P281777.jpg‎ |frame|right|150px|Acetone.]] 
'''IUPAC Nomenclature'''&lt;br&gt;
1. In terms of functional group priority, ketones take priority over everything but carboxylic groups and aldehydes.If an aldehyde or carboxylic acid group is there, the ketone is no longer the highest priority and thus, becomes an ''oxo''- prefix. &lt;br&gt;
2. First count the longest carbon chain which contains the carbonyl compound. Name this chain according to normal IUPAC rules. &lt;br&gt;
3. Number the chain such that the carbonyl carbon has the lowest number. &lt;br&gt;
4. The oxygen is designated in the name with the number of the carbon it is on. &lt;br&gt;
5. The suffix of ketones is ''&quot;-one&quot;'' so the ''&quot;e&quot;'' in the alkyl chain is replaced with ''&quot;-one.&quot;'' &lt;br&gt;

Another method of naming ketones exists though this method is not used as much. In this method of nomenclature, the two alkyl groups on either side of the carbonyl group are mentioned separately. For example, look at the example of propan-2-one or 2-propanone. Another way of naming this, would be to take the carbons #2 and #3 as one group and #1 as another. The carbonyl carbon becomes a part of the longer alkyl chain - in this example, both are equivalent so it does not matter. Then each side is named and the word ''&quot;ketone&quot;'' put at the end of it. Thus, 2-propanone could also be referred to as ethyl methyl ketone. 

'''Common Names'''&lt;br&gt;
Like other carbonyl compounds, ketones have common names that are used more often in everyday jargon. An example is acetone. The chemical formular of acetone is C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O. The IUPAC name is propanone but is often referred to as acetone.

==Reactivity==

Like the other carbonyl groups, the carbonyl carbon has a large positive charge due to the very electronegative oxygen atom. This characteristic of the ketones allows it to undergo numerous reactions as detailed below:

1. Nucleophilic addition – nucleophilic addition is very common for ketones. Because of the polarity of the carbonyl carbon, nucleophilic attack is a typical reaction ketones undergo. Thus, the  carbonylcarbon is subject to nucleophilic attack from other excellent nucleophiles such as cyanide and hydroxide ions. The lone pair of electrons on the nucleophile attacks the positively charged carbon, which moves one of the two bonds shared between the carbon and oxygen onto the oxygen, in the process giving oxygen a full negative charge. For example, a reaction of a ketone and water results in geminal diols. 

2. Gnignard – Ketones can be completely transformed, resulting in another functional group. For example, gnignard reagents or organometallic reagants will result in a tertiary alcohol.  Of course, this is after an aqueous workup is used – aqueous work up in this case is a solution of acid and water. When using gnignard reagants it is important to remember that a carbon-carbon bond is formed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Economy''' refers to the ways people use their environment to meet their material needs. It is the realized economic system of a country or other area. It includes the  [[w:Manufacturing|production]], [[w:Trade|exchange]], [[w:Distribution (economics)|distribution]], and [[w:Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[w:goods (economics)|goods]] and services of that area.  A given economy is the end result of a process that involves its [[w:technological evolution|technological evolution]], history and social organization, as well as its geography, natural resource endowment, and [[w:ecology|ecology]], among other factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. 

==History==
[[Image:BMC 06.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 640 BC one-third stater coin from Lydia, shown larger.]]

As long as someone has been making and distributing goods or services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex. The ancient economy was mainly based on [[w:subsistence farming|subsistence farming]]. According to [[w:Herodotus|Herodotus]], and most modern scholars, the [[w:Lydians|Lydians]] were the first people to introduce the use of gold and silver coin.&lt;ref name=&quot;HerodotusI&quot;&gt;Herodotus. ''Histories'', I, 94&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that these first stamped coins were minted around 650-600 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldsborough&quot;&gt;http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html Goldsborough, Reid. &quot;World's First Coin&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

For most people the exchange of goods occurred through social relationships.  There were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces. The Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed economic ideas comparable to those employed today.&lt;ref name=&quot;yale2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hammint.htm|title=The Code of Hammurabi : Introduction|accessdate=September 14 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=Yale University|year=1915|author=Charles F. Horne, Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records.&lt;ref name=Sheila&gt;Sheila C. Dow (2005), &quot;Axioms and Babylonian thought: a reply&quot;, ''Journal of Post Keynesian Economics'' '''27''' (3), p. 385-391.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several centuries after the invention of [[w:cuneiform|cuneiform]], the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, and astronomical records.  Ways to divide private property, when it is contended, amounts of interest on debt, rules as to property and monetary compensation concerning property damage or physical damage to a person, fines for 'wrong doing', and compensation in money for various infractions of formalized law were standardized for the first time in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheila&quot;/&gt;

In [[w:Medieval|Medieval]] times, what we now call economy was not far from the subsistence level.  Most exchange occurred within social groups. On top of this, the great conquerors raised [[w:venture capital|venture capital]] to finance their land captures. The capital investment would be returned to the investor when goods from the newly discovered or captured lands were returned by the conquerors.  The endeavors of [[w:Marco Polo|Marco Polo]] (1254-1324), [[w:Christopher Columbus|Christopher Columbus]] (1451-1506) and [[w:Vasco de Gama|Vasco de Gama]] (1469-1524) set the foundations for a  [[w:globalization|global]] economy.  Note that while these historical figures are often referred to as &quot;discoverers&quot; among dominant groups, there is ample archeological evidence suggesting that the places they &quot;found&quot; were visited by many other expeditions dating back to BC times and that many others attempted to conquer these same lands.  Rather than a process of discovery,  what separated them from earlier attempts was the devastating effects of massive plagues upon Native populations, which allowed them to conquer native lands that had fought off such assaults previously (see [[w: Lies my teacher told me|Lies my teacher told me]] for summaries of many of these findings). Following these events, the first [[w:Company|enterprises]] were trading establishments. In 1513 the first [[w:stock exchange|stock exchange]] was founded in [[w:Antwerpen|Antwerpen]].

The European captures became branches of the European states, the so-called &quot;colonies&quot;. The rising nation-states Spain, Portugal, France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands tried to control the trade through [[w:custom duties|custom duties]] and [[w:taxes|taxes]] in order to protect their national economy. [[w:Mercantilism|Mercantilism]] was a first approach to intermediate between private wealth and [[w:public interest|public interest]].

The first [[w:economist|economist]] in the true meaning of the word was the Scotsman [[w:Adam Smith|Adam Smith]] (1723-1790). He defined the elements of a national economy: [[w:Product (business)|products]] are offered at a [[w:natural price|natural price]] generated by the use of [[w:competition|competition]] - [[w:supply and demand|supply and demand]] - and the [[w:division of labour|division of labour]]. He maintained that the basic motive for [[w:free trade|free trade]] is human [[w:self interest|self interest]]. In Europe, capitalism (see below) started to replace the system of [[w:mercantilism|mercantilism]] and led to [[w:economic growth|economic growth]]. The period today is called the [[w:industrial revolution|industrial revolution]] because the system of [[w:Production, costs, and pricing|production]] and division of labour enabled the [[w:mass production|mass production]] of [[w:goods|goods]].

==Capitalism==
'''Capitalism''' is an [[w:Economic system|economic]] and [[w:social system|social system]] in which [[w:Capital (economics)|capital]] and the non-labor [[w:Factors_of_production|factors of production]] or the [[w:means of production|means of production]] are [[w:Private property|privately controlled]]; [[w:labor|labor]], goods and capital are [[w:trade|traded]] in [[w:market|markets]]; [[w:Profit (economics)|profits]] are taken by owners or invested in [[w:technology|technologies]] and [[w:industry|industries]]; and wages are paid to labor. 

Capitalism as a system developed incrementally from the 16th century on in Europe, although capitalist-like organizations existed in the [[w:Ancient history|ancient world]], and early aspects of [[w:merchant capitalism|merchant capitalism]] flourished during the [[w:Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Braudel1982&quot;&gt;Braudel, Fernand. 1982.

===History===
The origins of modern markets can be traced back to the Roman Empire&lt;ref name=&quot;Erdkamp2005&quot;&gt;Erdkamp, Paul (2005), &quot;The Grain Market in the Roman Empire&quot;, (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[w:Islamic Golden Age|Islamic Golden Age]] and [[w:Muslim Agricultural Revolution|Muslim Agricultural Revolution]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hasan1987&quot;&gt;Hasan, M (1987) &quot;History of Islam&quot;.

Labib (1969), &quot;Capitalism in Medieval Islam&quot;, ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''29''' (1), pp. 79–96.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A vigorous [[w:monetary economy|monetary economy]] was created by Muslims on the basis of the expanding levels of [[w:List of circulating currencies|circulation]] of a stable high-value [[w:currency|currency]] and the integration of monetary areas that were previously independent.

The economic system employed between the 16th and 18th centuries is commonly described as [[w:mercantilism|mercantilism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham2003&quot;&gt;Burnham, Peter (2003). Capitalism: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This period was associated with geographic &quot;discoveries&quot; by merchant overseas traders, especially from England, and the rapid growth in overseas trade. Mercantilism was a system of trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist production methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott2005&quot;/&gt; While some scholars see mercantilism as the earliest stage of modern capitalism, others argue that modern capitalism did not emerge until later. For example, [[w:Karl Polanyi|Karl Polanyi]], noted that &quot;mercantilism, with all its tendency toward commercialization, never attacked the safeguards which protected [the] two basic elements of production - labor and land - from becoming the elements of commerce&quot;; thus mercantilist attitudes towards economic regulation were closer to feudalist attitudes, &quot;they disagreed only on the methods of regulation.&quot; Moreover Polanyi argued that the hallmark of capitalism is the establishment of generalized markets for what he referred to as the &quot;fictitious commodities&quot;: land, labor, and money. Accordingly, &quot;not until 1834 was a competitive labor market established in England, hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Polanyi1944&quot;&gt;Polanyi, Karl. 1944. The Great Transformation. Beacon Press,Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The commercial stage of capitalism began with the founding of the British [[w:East India Company|East India Company]] and the [[w:Dutch East India Company|Dutch East India Company]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Banaji&quot;/&gt;  During this era, merchants, who had traded under the previous stage of mercantilism, invested capital in the East India Companies and other colonies, seeking a [[w:return on investment|return on investment]], setting the stage for capitalism.

[[File:london.bankofengland.arp.jpg|thumb||right|200px|The [[w:Bank of England|Bank of England]] is one of the oldest [[w:central bank|central bank]]s. It was founded in 1694 and nationalised in 1946.]]

During the [[w:Industrial Revolution|Industrial Revolution]], the industrialist replaced the merchant as a dominant actor in the capitalist system and effected the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of [[w:artisan|artisan]]s, [[w:guild|guild]]s, and [[w:journeyman|journeymen]]. Also during this period, the surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture. Industrial capitalism marked the development of the [[w:factory|factory]] system of manufacturing, characterized by a complex [[w:division of labor|division of labor]] between and within the work process and the routinization of work tasks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham2003&quot;/&gt;

In the late 19th century, the control and direction of large areas of industry came into the hands of trusts, [[w:financiers|financiers]] and [[w:holding company|holding companies]]. This period was dominated by an increasing number of oligopolistic firms earning supernormal profits.&lt;ref name=&quot;EconomyProfessor&quot;&gt;[Economy Professor http://www.economyprofessor.com/economictheories/monopoly-capitalism.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Major characteristics of capitalism in this period included the establishment of large industrial [[w:monopoly|monopolies]]; the ownership and management of industry by financiers divorced from the production process; and the development of a complex system of banking, an [[w:equity market|equity market]], and corporate holdings of capital through [[w:stock|stock]] ownership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott2005&quot;/&gt; Inside these [[w:corporation|corporation]]s, a division of labor separates [[w:shareholder|shareholder]]s, owners, managers, and actual laborers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott2005&quot;&gt;Scott, John. 2005. A Dictionary of Sociology. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the last quarter of the 19th century, the emergence of large industrial trusts had provoked legislation in the US to reduce the monopolistic tendencies of the period. Gradually, during this era, the US government played a larger and larger role in passing [[w:United States antitrust law|antitrust]] laws and regulation of industrial standards for key industries of special public concern. By the end of the 19th century, [[w:Depression (economics)|economic depressions]] and [[w:boom and bust|boom and bust]] business cycles had become a recurring problem. In particular, the [[w:Long Depression|Long Depression]] of the 1870s and 1880s and the [[w:Great Depression|Great Depression]] of the 1930s affected almost the entire capitalist world, and generated discussion about capitalism’s long-term survival prospects. During the 1930s, Marxist commentators often posited the possibility of capitalism's decline or demise, often in contrast to the ability of the Soviet Union to avoid suffering the effects of the global depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Engerman2001&quot;&gt;Engerman, Stanley L. 2001. The Oxford Companion to United States History. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[w:The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1904-1905), Max Weber sought to trace how a particular form of religious spirit, infused into traditional modes of economic activity, was a condition of possibility of modern western capitalism.  For Weber, the 'spirit of capitalism' was, in general, that of ascetic Protestantism; this ideology was able to motivate extreme rationalization of daily life, a propensity to accumulate capital by a religious ethic to advance economically, and thus also the propensity to reinvest capital: this was sufficient, then, to create &quot;self-mediating capital&quot; as conceived by Marx.  This is pictured in Proverbs 22:29, “Seest thou a man diligent in his calling? He shall stand before kings” and in Colossians 3:23, &quot;Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men.&quot;  In the ''Protestant Ethic'', Weber further stated that “moneymaking – provided it is done legally – is, within the modern economic order, the result and the expression of diligence in one’s calling…”  And, &quot;If God show you a way in which you may lawfully get more than in another way (without wrong to your soul or to any other), if you refuse this, and choose the less gainful way, you cross one of the ends of your calling, and you refuse to be God's steward, and to accept His gifts and use them for him when He requierth it: you may labour to be rich for God, though not for the flesh and sin&quot; (p. 108).

=== How capitalism works ===
The economics of capitalism developed out of the interactions of the following five items:

1. [[w:Commodities|Commodities]]: There are two types of commodities: [[w:capital goods|capital goods]] and [[w:consumer goods|consumer goods]]. Capital goods are products not produced for immediate consumption (i.e. land, raw materials, tools machines and factories), but serve as the raw materials for consumer goods (i.e. televisions, cars, computers, houses) to be sold to others. 

2. [[w:Money|Money]]: Money is primarily a standardized means of exchange which serves to reduce all goods and commodities to a standard value. It eliminates the cumbersome system of [[w:barter|barter]] by separating the transactions involved in the exchange of products, thus greatly facilitating specialization and trade through encouraging the exchange of commodities. 

3. [[w:Labour power|Labour power]]: Labour includes all mental and physical human resources, including entrepreneurial capacity and management skills, which are needed to transform one type of commodity into another. 

4. [[w:Means of production|Means of production]]: All manufacturing aids to production such as tools, machinery, and buildings. 

5. [[w:Production, costs, and pricing|Production]]: The act of making goods or services through the combination of labour power and means of production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ragan2008&quot;&gt;Ragan, Christopher T.S., and Richard G. Lipsey. Microeconomics. Twelfth Canadian Edition ed. Toronto: Pearson Education Canada, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins2007&quot;&gt;Robbins, Richard H. Global problems and the culture of capitalism. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals engage in the economy as [[w:consumers|consumers]], [[w:labourers|labourers]], and [[w:investors|investors]], providing both money and labour power. For example, as consumers, individuals influence production patterns through their purchase decisions, as producers will change production to produce what consumers want to buy. As labourers, individuals may decide which jobs to prepare for and in which markets to look for work. As investors they decide how much of their income to save and how to invest their savings. These savings, which become investments, provide much of the money that businesses need to grow. 

Business firms decide what to produce and where this production should occur. They also purchase capital goods to convert them into consumer goods. Businesses try to influence consumer purchase decisions through [[w:marketing|marketing]] as well as the creation of new and improved products. What drives the capitalist economy is the constant search for profits (revenues minus expenses). This need for profits, known as the ''[[w:profit motive|profit motive]]'', ensures that companies produce the goods and services that consumers desire and are able to buy. In order to be successful, firms must sell a certain quantity of their products at a price high enough to yield a profit. A business may consequently lose money if sales fall too low or costs are incurred that are too high. The profit motive also encourages firms to operate efficiently by using their resources in the most productive manner. By using less materials, labour or capital, a firm can cut its production costs which can lead to increased profits. 

Following [[w:Adam Smith|Adam Smith]], Karl Marx distinguished the [[w:use value|use value]] of commodities from their [[w:exchange value|exchange value]] in the market. Capital, according to Marx, is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [[w:labor power|labor power]] had itself become a commodity under capitalism; the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist. This difference in values, he argues, constitutes [[w:surplus value|surplus value]], which the capitalists extract and accumulate.  The extraction of surplus value from workers is called [[w:exploitation|exploitation]].  In his book ''[[w:Das Kapital|Capital]]'', Marx argues that the [[w:capitalist mode of production|capitalist mode of production]] is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers: all prior class societies had extracted [[w:surplus labor|surplus labor]], but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx1894&quot;&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm Capital. v. 3. Chapter 47: Genesis of capitalist ground rent]&lt;/ref&gt; Marx argues that a core requirement of a capitalist society is that a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-sustenance that would allow them to be independent, and must instead be compelled, in order to survive, to sell their labor for a living wage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx25&quot;&gt;Karl Marx. Chapter Twenty-Five: The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation. ''Das Kapital''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobb1947&quot;&gt;Dobb, Maurice. 1947.  ''Studies in the Development of Capitalism.''  New York: International Publishers Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvey1989&quot;&gt;Harvey, David. 1989. ''The Condition of Postmodernity.''&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was Marx's belief that exploited labor would be the driving force behind a revolution to a socialist-style economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheen2006&quot;&gt;Wheen, Francis ''Books That Shook the World: Marx's Das Kapital''1st ed. London: Atlantic Books, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, this cycle of the extraction of the surplus value by the owners of capital or the bourgeoisie becomes the basis of [[w:class struggle|class struggle]]. This argument is intertwined with Marx's version of the [[w:labor theory of value|labor theory of value]] asserting that labor is the source of all value, and thus of profit.  How capitalists generate profit is illustrated in the figure below.

[[File:Graphic depiction of capitalism.png|center|600px|Capitalism generates profit for capitalists, who own the means of production, through exploitation, or paying workers less than they are worth.]]

The [[w:market|market]] is a term used by economists to describe a central exchange through which people are able to buy and sell goods and services.&lt;ref name=&quot;swedberg2007&quot;&gt;swedberg, richard. 2007. “the market.” Contexts 6:64-66.&lt;/ref&gt; In a capitalist economy, the prices of goods and services are controlled mainly through ''[[w:supply and demand|supply and demand]]'' and ''[[w:competition|competition]]''. Supply is the amount of a good or service produced by a firm and available for sale. Demand is the amount that people are willing to buy at a specific price. Prices tend to rise when demand exceeds supply and fall when supply exceeds demand, so that the market is able to coordinate itself through pricing until a new equilibrium price and quantity is reached. Competition arises when many producers are trying to sell the same or similar kinds of products to the same buyers. Competition is important in capitalist economies because it leads to innovation and more reasonable prices as firms that charge lower prices or improve the quality of their product can take buyers away from competitors (i.e., increase [[w:market share|market share]]. Furthermore, without competition, a ''[[w:monopoly|monopoly]]'' or ''[[w:cartel|cartel]]'' may develop. A monopoly occurs when a firm supplies the total output in the market. When this occurs, the firm can limit output and raise prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and raise prices. Many countries have [[w:competition law|competition laws]] and [[w:anti-trust|anti-trust laws]] that prohibit monopolies and cartels from forming. In many capitalist nations, public utilities (communications, gas, electricity, etc), are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation due to high economies of scale.

[[Image:Supply-and-demand.svg|thumb|right|240px|The price P of a product is determined by a balance between production at each price (supply S) and the desires of those with [[w:purchasing power|purchasing power]] at each price (demand D).  This results in a market equilibrium, with a given quantity (Q) sold of the product. A rise in demand from D1 to D2 would result in an increase in price from P1 to P2 and an increase in output from Q1 to Q2.]]

Income in a capitalist economy depends primarily on what skills are in demand and what skills are currently being supplied. People who have skills that are in scarce supply are worth a lot more in the market and can attract higher incomes.  Competition among employers for workers and among workers for jobs, helps determine wage rates. Firms need to pay high enough wages to attract the appropriate workers; however, when jobs are scarce workers may accept lower wages than when jobs are plentiful.  [[w:Labour unions|Labour unions]] and the government also influence wages in capitalist nations. Unions act to represent labourers in negotiations with employers over such things as wage rates and acceptable working conditions. Most countries have an established minimum wage and other government agencies work to establish safety standards. [[w:unemployed|Unemployment]] is a necessary component of a capitalist economy to insure an excessive pool of laborers.  Without unemployed individuals in a capitalist economy, capitalists would be unable to exploit their workers because workers could demand to be paid what they are worth.  What's more, when people leave the employed workforce and experience a period of unemployment, the longer they stay out of the workforce, the longer it takes to find work and the lower their returning salaries will be when they return to the workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arranz2010&quot;&gt;Arranz, Jose M., Carlos Garcia-Serrano, and Maria A. Davia. 2010. “Worker Turnover and Wages in Europe: The Influence of Unemployment and Inactivity.” The Manchester School 78:678-701.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, not only do the unemployed help drive down the wages of those who are employed, they also suffer financially when they do return to the paid workforce.

In capitalist nations, the government allows for [[w:private property|private property]] and individuals are allowed to work where they please. The government also generally permits firms to determine what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. The government also carries out a number of important economic functions. For instance, it issues money, supervises public utilities and enforces private contracts. Laws, such as policy competition, protect against competition and prohibit unfair business practices. Government agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting, as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses things such as the interest rate to control factors such as inflation and unemployment.

===Criticisms of Capitalism===
Critics argue that capitalism is associated with the unfair [[w:distribution of wealth|distribution of wealth]] and power; a tendency toward market monopoly or [[w:oligopoly|oligopoly]] (and government by [[w:oligarchy|oligarchy]]); [[w:imperialism|imperialism]], [[w:counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionary]] wars and various forms of economic and cultural [[w:exploitation|exploitation]]; repression of workers and [[w:trade union|trade union]]ists, and phenomena such as [[w:social alienation|social alienation]], [[w:economic inequality|economic inequality]], [[w:unemployment|unemployment]], and economic instability. Critics have argued that there is an inherent tendency towards oligopolistic structures when laissez-faire laws are combined with capitalist private property. Capitalism is regarded by many socialists to be irrational in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned, creating inconsistencies and internal contradictions and thus should be controlled through public policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brander2006&quot;&gt;Brander, James A. Government policy toward business. 4th ed. Mississauga, Ontario: John Wiley &amp; Sons Canada, Ltd., 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[w:Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Lenin]] argued that state use of military power to defend capitalist interests abroad was an inevitable corollary of monopoly capitalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenin1916&quot;&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm Lenin, Vladimir. 1916. Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[w:Branko Horvat|Branko Horvat]] states, &quot;it is now well known that capitalist development leads to the concentration of capital, employment and power. It is somewhat less known that it leads to the almost complete destruction of economic freedom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horvat&quot;&gt;Horvat, B. The Political Economy of Socialism. Armonk, NY. M.E.Sharpe Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:Ravi Batra|Ravi Batra]] argues that excessive income and wealth inequalities are a fundamental cause of financial crisis and economic depression, which will lead to the [[w:The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism|collapse of capitalism]] and the emergence of a new social order.

[[w:Environmentalist|Environmentalist]]s have argued that capitalism requires continual economic growth, and will inevitably deplete the finite natural resources of the earth, and other broadly utilized resources. [[w:Murray Bookchin|Murray Bookchin]] has argued that capitalist production [[w:Externalities|externalizes]] environmental costs to all of society, and is unable to adequately mitigate its impact upon ecosystems and the biosphere at large. [[w:Labor history (discipline)|Labor historians]] and scholars, such as [[w:Immanuel Wallerstein|Immanuel Wallerstein]] have argued that [[w:Unfree labour|unfree labor]] — by [[w:Slavery|slaves]], [[w:indentured servant|indentured servant]]s, prisoners, and other coerced persons — is compatible with (and in many ways necessary for) capitalist relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cass1999&quot;&gt;Cass. 1999. ''Towards a Comparative Political Economy of Unfree Labor''&lt;/ref&gt;

A common response to the criticism that capitalism leads to inequality is the argument that capitalism also leads to economic growth and generally improved standards of living.  Capitalism does promote economic growth, as measured by [[w:Gross Domestic Product|Gross Domestic Product or GDP]]), [[w:capacity utilization|capacity utilization]] or [[w:standard of living|standard of living]]. This argument was central, for example, to Adam Smith's advocacy of letting a free market control production and price, and allocate resources. Many theorists have noted that this increase in global GDP over time coincides with the emergence of the modern world capitalist system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucas2003&quot;&gt;Lucas, Robert E. Jr. The Industrial Revolution: Past and Future.

Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living. http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html Accessed: 2008-02-26&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these claims, however, capitalists systems to date - despite increasing GDP in many places and ways overall - have never spurred economic growth and / or improved standards of living for whole populations, but rather, have offered significant growth and improvement for some while others remain without basic necessities (e.g., food, running or clean water, shelter, indoor plumbing) in even the most successful capitalist countries (like the United States).  The ability of capitalism to spur economic growth and improved standards of living thus appears (thus far) to actually represent another way capitalism creates and sustains social inequalities within and between societies.  &lt;ref&gt;Prasad, Monica.  2012.

==Socialism==
'''Socialism''' refers to various theories of economic organization advocating public or direct worker ownership and administration of the [[w:means of production|means of production]] and allocation of resources, and a society characterized by equal access to resources for all individuals with a method of compensation based on the amount of labor expended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman2005&quot;&gt;Newman, Michael. 2005. ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-280431-6&lt;/ref&gt; Most socialists share the view that capitalism unfairly concentrates power and wealth among a small segment of society that controls [[w:Capital (economics)|capital]] and derives its wealth through [[w:exploitation|exploitation]], creates an [[w:Social equality|unequal]] society, does not provide equal opportunities for everyone to maximise their potentialities&lt;ref&gt;Socialism, (2009), in Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved October 14, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551569/socialism, &quot;Main&quot; summary: &quot;Socialists complain that capitalism necessarily leads to unfair and exploitative concentrations of wealth and power in the hands of the relative few who emerge victorious from free-market competition—people who then use their wealth and power to reinforce their dominance in society.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and does not utilise technology and resources to their maximum potential nor in the interests of the public.&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Engels Selected Works, Lawrence and Wishart, 1968, p. 40. Capitalist property relations put a &quot;fetter&quot; on the productive forces.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Socialism in pictures.png|right|thumb|600px|This figure illustrates the basic ideas of socialism.  The government (which is the people) owns the means of production.  Through centralized planning, it determines what should be produced then dictates production quotas to the factories and workers.  The goods that are produced are owned by the government (which is the people) and are then divided up among the workers.]]

In one example of socialism, the [[w:economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]], state ownership was combined with central planning. In this scenario, the government determined which goods and services were produced, how they were to be produced, the quantities, and the sale prices.  Centralized planning is an alternative to allowing the market ([[w:supply and demand|supply and demand]]) to determine prices and production. In the West, neoclassical [[w:Economic liberalism|liberal economists]] such as [[w:Friedrich Hayek|Friedrich Hayek]] and [[w:Milton Friedman|Milton Friedman]] said that socialist planned economies would fail because planners could not have the business information inherent to a market economy (cf. [[w:economic calculation problem|economic calculation problem]]), nor could managers in Soviet-style socialist economies match the motivation of profit. Consequent to Soviet economic stagnation in the 1970s and 1980s, socialists began to accept parts of these critiques. Polish economist [[w:Oskar Lange|Oskar Lange]], an early proponent of [[w:market socialism|market socialism]], proposed a central planning board establishing prices and controls of investment. The prices of producer goods would be determined through trial and error. The prices of consumer goods would be determined by supply and demand, with the supply coming from state-owned firms that would set their prices equal to the [[w:marginal cost|marginal cost]], as in [[w:Perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] markets. The central planning board would distribute a &quot;social dividend&quot; to ensure reasonable income equality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosser2004&quot;&gt;John Barkley Rosser and Marina V. Rosser, ''Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy'' (Cambridge, MA.: MIT Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In western Europe, particularly in the period after World War II, many socialist parties in government implemented what became known as mixed economies. In the biography of the 1945 UK Labour Party Prime Minister Clement Attlee, Francis Beckett states: &quot;the government... wanted what would become known as a mixed economy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett2007&quot;&gt;Beckett, Francis, ''Clem Attlee'', (2007) Politico's.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett also states that &quot;Everyone called the 1945 government 'socialist'.&quot; These governments [[w:Nationalisation|nationalised]] major and economically vital industries while permitting a free market to continue in the rest. These were most often monopolistic or infrastructural industries like mail, railways, power and other utilities. In some instances a number of small, competing and often relatively poorly financed companies in the same sector were nationalised to form one government monopoly for the purpose of competent management, of economic rescue (in the UK, [[w:British Leyland|British Leyland]], [[w:Rolls Royce|Rolls Royce]]), or of competing on the world market.

Typically, this was achieved through compulsory purchase of the industry (i.e. with compensation). In the UK, the nationalisation of the coal mines in 1947 created a coal board charged with running the coal industry commercially so as to be able to meet the interest payable on the bonds which the former mine owners' shares had been converted into.&lt;ref name=&quot;SocialistParty1985&quot;&gt;Socialist Party of Great Britain. 1985.

Marxist and non-Marxist social theorists agree that socialism developed in reaction to modern industrial capitalism, but disagree on the nature of their relationship. [[w:Émile Durkheim|Émile Durkheim]] posits that socialism is rooted in the desire to bring the state closer to the realm of individual activity, in countering the [[w:anomie|anomie]] of a capitalist society. In socialism, [[w:Max Weber|Max Weber]] saw acceleration of the rationalisation started in capitalism. As a critic of socialism, he warned that placing the economy entirely in the state's bureaucratic control would result in an &quot;[[w:iron cage|iron cage]] of future bondage&quot;.

The Marxist conception of socialism is that of a specific historical phase that will displace capitalism and be a precursor to communism. The major characteristics of socialism  are that the proletariat will control the means of production through a [[w:socialist state|workers' state]] erected by the workers in their interests. Economic activity is still organised through the use of incentive systems and social classes would still exist but to a lesser and diminishing extent than under capitalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;economictheories&quot;&gt;http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html&lt;/ref&gt; For orthodox Marxists, socialism is the lower stage of communism based on the principle of &quot;[[w:To each according to his contribution|from each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]&quot; while upper stage communism is based on the principle of &quot;[[w:from each according to his ability, to each according to his need|from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]&quot;; the upper stage becoming possible only after the socialist stage further develops economic efficiency and the automation of production has led to a superabundance of goods and services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaff2001&quot;&gt;Schaff, Kory. 2001.

Socialism is not a concrete philosophy of fixed doctrine and program; its branches advocate a degree of [[w:social interventionism|social interventionism]] and economic rationalisation (usually in the form of economic planning), sometimes opposing each other. Some socialists advocate complete [[w:nationalisation|nationalisation]] of the means of production, distribution, and exchange; others advocate [[w:State ownership|state control]] of capital within the framework of a market economy. 

Socialists inspired by the [[w:Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet model of economic development]] have advocated the creation of [[w:Planned economy|centrally planned economies]] directed by a state that owns all the means of production. Others, including Yugoslavian, Hungarian, German and Chinese Communists in the 1970s and 1980s, instituted various forms of [[w:market socialism|market socialism]], combining co-operative and state ownership models with the free market [[w:trade|exchange]] and [[w:free price system|free price system]] (but not free prices for the means of production).&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002&quot;&gt;&quot;Market socialism,&quot; ''Dictionary of the Social Sciences''.

[[w:Social democracy|Social democrats]] propose selective nationalisation of key national industries in [[w:Mixed economy|mixed economies]], while maintaining private ownership of capital and private business enterprise. Social democrats also promote tax-funded welfare programs and regulation of markets. Many social democrats, particularly in European [[w:welfare state|welfare state]]s, refer to themselves as socialists, introducing a degree of ambiguity to the understanding of what the term means. 

Modern socialism originated in the late 18th-century intellectual and [[w:working class|working class]] political movement that criticised the effects of industrialisation and [[w:Private enterprise|private ownership]] on society. The [[w:Utopian socialism|utopian socialists]], including [[w:Robert Owen]] (1771–1858), tried to found self-sustaining communes by secession from a [[w:Capitalism|capitalist]] society. [[w:Henri de Saint Simon|Henri de Saint Simon]] (1760–1825), the first individual to coin the term ''socialisme'', was the original thinker who advocated [[w:Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]] and industrial planning.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsmitha&quot;&gt;http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first socialists predicted a world improved by harnessing technology and better social organisation; many contemporary socialists share this belief. Early socialist thinkers tended to favour an authentic [[w:meritocracy|meritocracy]] combined with rational social planning.

The [[w:Financial crisis of 2007–2009|Financial crisis of 2007–2009]] led to mainstream discussions as to whether &quot;Marx was right&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheTimes2008&quot;&gt;''Karl Marx: did he get it all right?, The Times (UK), October 21, 2008, http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4981065.ece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHerald2008&quot;&gt;''Capitalism has proven Karl Marx right again, The Herald (Scotland), 17 Sep 2008, http://www.heraldscotland.com/capitalism-has-proven-karl-marx-right-again-1.889708&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] ran an article titled &quot;Rethinking Marx&quot; and put Karl Marx on the cover of its 28th of January 2009 European edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gumbell2009&quot;&gt;Gumbell, Peter.

===Examples of Socialism===
==== Asia ====
The People's Republic of China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam are Asian states remaining from the first wave of socialism in the 20th century. States with socialist economies have largely moved away from centralised economic planning in the 21st century, placing a greater emphasis on markets, as in the case of the Chinese [[w:Socialist market economy|Socialist market economy]] and Vietnamese [[w:Socialist-oriented market economy|Socialist-oriented market economy]]. In China, the [[w:Chinese Communist Party|Chinese Communist Party]] has led a transition from the command economy of the [[w:Mao|Mao]] period to an economic program called the [[w:socialist market economy|socialist market economy]] or &quot;[[w:socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialism with Chinese characteristics]].&quot;  Under [[w:Deng Xiaoping|Deng Xiaoping]], the leadership of China embarked upon a program of market-based reform that was more sweeping than had been Soviet leader [[w:Mikhail Gorbachev|Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[w:perestroika|perestroika]] program of the late 1980s. Deng's program, however, maintained state ownership rights over land, state or cooperative ownership of much of the heavy industrial and manufacturing sectors and state influence in the banking and financial sectors.

Elsewhere in Asia, some elected socialist parties and communist parties remain prominent, particularly in India and Nepal. The Communist Party of Nepal in particular calls for multi-party democracy, social equality, and economic prosperity.&lt;ref name=&quot;CPNM&quot;&gt;[http://www.cpnm.org/ ''Communist Party of Nepal' '']&lt;/ref&gt; In Singapore, a majority of the GDP is still generated from the state sector comprised of government-linked companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;countryrisk&quot;&gt;[http://www.countryrisk.com/editorials/archives/cat_singapore.html CountryRisk Maintaining Singapore's Miracle&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, there has been a resurgent interest in the [[w:Japanese Communist Party|Japanese Communist Party]] among workers and youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/3218944/Japans-young-turn-to-Communist-Party-as-they-decide-capitalism-has-let-them-down.html Japan's young turn to Communist Party as they decide capitalism has let them down] - Daily Telegraph October 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2009&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8027397.stm &quot;Communism on rise in recession-hit Japan&quot;], BBC, May 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
In Europe, [[w:The Left (Germany)|the Left Party]] in Germany has grown in popularity,&lt;ref name=&quot;WSWS2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/feb2008/hess-f15.shtml ''Germany’s Left Party woos the SPD' '']&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the fourth biggest party in parliament in the general election on 27 September 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenleft2009&quot;&gt;''Germany: Left makes big gains in poll'' https://archive.is/20120803142254/www.greenleft.org.au/2009/813/41841&lt;/ref&gt; Communist candidate [[w:Dimitris Christofias|Dimitris Christofias]] won a crucial presidential runoff in [[w:Cyprus]], defeating his conservative rival with a majority of 53% of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElPasoTimes&quot;&gt;[http://www.elpasotimes.com/nationworld/ci_835244 ''Christofias wins Cyprus presidency' '']&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, in the general election on 4 October 2009, the Communist KKE got 7.5% of the votes and the new Socialist grouping, [[w:Coalition of the Radical Left|Syriza]] or &quot;Coalition of the Radical Left&quot;, won 4.6% or 361,000 votes. 

In Ireland, in the [[w:European_Parliament_election,_2009_(Ireland)|2009 European election]], Joe Higgins of the [[w:Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]] took one of four seats in the capital [[w:Dublin_(European_Parliament_constituency)|Dublin European constituency]]. In Denmark, the [[w:Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] more than doubled its parliamentary representation to 23 seats from 11, making it the fourth largest party.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_Danish&quot;&gt;''Danish centre-right wins election'' http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7091941.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the [[w:Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Revolutionary Communist League]] candidate in the 2007 presidential election, [[w:Olivier Besancenot|Olivier Besancenot]], received 1,498,581 votes, 4.08%, double that of the Communist candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;SocialismToday&quot;&gt;''Has France moved to the right?'' http://www.socialismtoday.org/110/france.html&lt;/ref&gt; The LCR abolished itself in 2009 to initiate a broad anti-capitalist party, the [[w:New Anticapitalist Party|New Anticapitalist Party]], whose stated aim is to &quot;build a new socialist, democratic perspective for the twenty-first century&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgenceFrancePresse2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-politique/le-nouveau-parti-anticapitaliste-d-olivier-besancenot-est-lance/917/0/256540 Le Nouveau parti anticapitaliste d'Olivier Besancenot est lancé] Agence France-Presse, June 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latin America====
In some Latin American countries, socialism has re-emerged in recent years, with an [[w:anti-imperialist|anti-imperialist]] stance, the rejection of the policies of [[w:neoliberalism|neoliberalism]], and the [[w:nationalisation|nationalisation]] or part nationalisation of oil production, land and other assets. Venezuelan President [[w:Hugo Chávez|Hugo Chávez]], Bolivian President [[w:Evo Morales|Evo Morales]], and Ecuadorian president [[w:Rafael Correa|Rafael Correa]] for instance, refer to their political programs as socialist.

====United States====
An April 2009 Rasmussen Reports poll conducted during the [[w:Financial crisis of 2007–2009|Financial crisis of 2007–2009]] suggested there had been a growth of support for socialism in the United States. The poll results stated that 53% of American adults thought capitalism was better than socialism, and that &quot;Adults under 30 are essentially evenly divided: 37% prefer capitalism, 33% socialism, and 30% are undecided&quot;. The question posed by Rasmussen Reports did not define either capitalism or socialism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rasmussen&quot;&gt;Rasmussen Reports http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/april_2009/just_53_say_capitalism_better_than_socialism , accessed October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Criticisms of Socialism===
Criticisms of socialism range from claims that socialist economic and political models are inefficient or incompatible with [[w:civil liberties|civil liberties]] to condemnation of specific [[w:socialist state|socialist state]]s. In the [[w:Economic calculation problem|economic calculation debate]], [[w:classical liberalism|classical liberal]] [[w:Friedrich Hayek|Friedrich Hayek]] argued that a socialist [[w:command economy|command economy]] could not adequately transmit information about prices and productive quotas due to the lack of a [[w:price mechanism|price mechanism]], and as a result it could not make rational economic decisions. [[w:Ludwig von Mises|Ludwig von Mises]] argued that a socialist economy was not possible at all, because of the impossibility of rational pricing of capital goods in a socialist economy since the state is the only owner of the capital goods. Hayek further argued that the social control over distribution of wealth and private property advocated by socialists cannot be achieved without reduced prosperity for the general populace, and a loss of political and economic freedoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayek1994&quot;&gt;Hayek, Friedrich. 1994. The Road to Serfdom. University of Chicago Press. ISBN 0-226-32061-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopppe&quot;&gt;Hoppe, Hans-Hermann [http://www.mises.org/etexts/Soc&amp;Cap.pdf ''A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism'']. Kluwer Academic Publishers. page 46 in PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic measures==
There are a number of ways to measure economic activity of a nation. These methods of measuring economic activity include:

* [[w:Consumer spending|Consumer spending]]
* [[w:Exchange Rate|Exchange Rate]]
* [[w:Gross domestic product|Gross domestic product]]
* [[w:GDP per capita|GDP per capita]]
* [[w:GNP|GNP or Gross National Product]]
* [[w:Stock Market|Stock Market]]
* [[w:Interest Rate|Interest Rate]]
* [[w:National Debt|National Debt]]
* [[w:Inflation|Rate of Inflation]]
* [[w:Unemployment|Unemployment]]
* [[w:Balance of Trade|Balance of Trade]]

===GDP===
The [[w:GDP|Gross Domestic Product or GDP]] of a country is a measure of the size of its economy.  While often useful, it should be noted that GDP only includes economic activity for which money is exchanged. GDP and GDP per capita are widely used indicators of a country's wealth.  The map below shows GDP per capita of countries around the world:

[[File:Map_of_world_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_in_US$.png|center|thumb|600px|A map of world economies by size of GDP (nominal) in $US, CIA World Factbook, 2012.]]

===Gini Coefficient===
The Gini coefficient (also known as the Gini index or Gini ratio) is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income distribution of a nation's residents. The Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution. A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (for example, where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of one (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values (for example where only one person has all the income). However, a value greater than one may occur if some persons represent negative contribution to the total (e.g., have negative income or wealth). For larger groups, values close to or above 1 are very unlikely in practice. The Gini coefficient was originally proposed as a measure of inequality of income or wealth. For [[w:OECD|OECD]] countries, in the late 2000s, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 to 0.49, with Slovenia the lowest and Chile the highest. The countries in Africa had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 2008–2009, with South Africa the world's highest, variously estimated to be between 0.63 to 0.7. The global income inequality Gini coefficient in 2005, for all human beings taken together, has been estimated to be between 0.61 and 0.68. 

[[File:GINI_Index_SVG.svg|thumb|600px|center|Gini coefficient of national income distribution around the world. This is based on 1989 to 2009 data, estimated by the CIA. Darker colors indicate greater degrees of income inequality.]]

==Informal economy==
An informal economy is economic activity that is neither taxed nor monitored by a government and is contrasted with the formal economy as described above. The informal economy is thus not included in a government's [[w:Gross National Product|Gross National Product or GNP]]. Although the informal economy is often associated with [[w:developing countries|developing countries]], all economic systems contain an informal economy in some proportion. Informal economic activity is a dynamic process which includes many aspects of economic and social theory including exchange, regulation, and enforcement. By its nature, it is necessarily difficult to observe, study, define, and measure. The terms &quot;under the table&quot; and &quot;off the books&quot; typically refer to this type of economy. The term [[w:black market|black market]] refers to a specific subset of the informal economy. Examples of informal economic activity include: the sale and distribution of illegal drugs and unreported payments for house cleaning or baby sitting.

== Wikibooks and Gutenberg ==

I download fiction and non-fiction plain .txt files from Gutenberg, restore the chapter titles, recreate the table of contents, format and clean the text and paginate the documents, ready for printing, or onscreen reading. This is one of my hobbies, and I give copies to anyone for their reading enjoyment, in MS Word .doc, .html or .pdf format.

I know that Wikibooks does not accept fiction, and my question is about books like Gibbon's ''The History of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''. Is this an acceptable book for the history project? [[User:Ineuw|Ineuw]] ([[User talk:Ineuw|talk]]) 16:36, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

:For direct copy you should first use [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikisource] then request a transwiki to Wikibooks if it bares appropriate content (see [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]]) and has the possibility of evolving.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:33, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

::Thanks for the reply. This book is not, and will not evolve, simply because it was written over 200 years ago. :-) [[User:Ineuw|Ineuw]] ([[User talk:Ineuw|talk]]) 18:35, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

:::It depends on the book. The age of a work doesn't equate to how static the subject it covers is or how the content can be reformulated. In the subject of  ''The History of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' there are new facts that result in new and failed hypothesis, those could be put into the book's content. In Wikisource it will remain static, traswikis to Wikibooks or Wikipedia can be done later if people wish to use the content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:35, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

:::Panic2k4, a belated thanks for your reply. I jogged over to Wikisource (which is exactly what I was looking for at the time), and did some proofreading. I contribute to various projects on various wikis, and plan to do so here as well, and I put my next question under a new heading.

== Help on a Wikibook without a Cover Page ==

Hello. I came across a Wiki book with a single page and I thought I would expand it with articles from Wikipedia. The book is &quot;Hinduism&quot; and I tried to add a subpage &quot;Etymology of the words Hindu and Hinduism&quot;. I used the slash convention and created the category &quot;Hinduism&quot;. I cannot work out how to arrange a Cover Page with contents list. Can anyone help. Thanks

::If there ae some pictures on commons related to this book, you can add them to cover page. [[User:Srhat|Srhat]] ([[User talk:Srhat|talk]]) 19:03, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for the reply. I eventually worked out how to do it. One other problem I need to address is the &quot;language template&quot; that allows words to appear as Indian characters. I don't know much about language templates or even if they are allowed in a Wiki book. I've added &quot;The Puranas&quot; module which also has all the Wikipedia references intact - do I need to remove them? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
--[[User:Sluffs|Sluffs]] ([[User talk:Sluffs|talk]]) 10:39, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

:I brought in [[Template:Transl]] which unifies all many templates on Wikipedia providing multilingual support and replaced the references in the Puranas page with references to that template.  I also added the necessary classes to the Mediawiki CSS page.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:07, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

== The reason for being of the book River Fishing (and why someone might consider contributing) ==

I have been an avid poster on public forums since I discovered the internet nearly 15 years ago.  While internet forums have there ugly moments, they allow me to connect to people whom share my interests.  Being in Rural Northwest Pennsylvania, there really isn't so many people willing to share hints or interested in giving hints.  Thus by being a nice, courteous participant.. I could ask questions, get information, and connect with people.

of course Internet forums have their down sides; they are often rude, irrelevant, promotional, and self seeking.  Often information needs to be said nearly incessantly and older nuggets of information are quickly buried amoungst irrelevant threads.  It is clearly a good way to connect with people (which Might not be such a good thing), but a pretty disorganized, and unfocused way to get information.  It was with these weakenesses in mind that I explored the wikiproject, (with contributions to wikibook and wikiversity) last year.

Here in wikiMedia, I feel There is a clearly better solution, to the limitations of sharing information on an internet forum.  Information from the group; self-serving no one, organized, succinct.. With appropriate places for questions, comments and working out minor differences.  I gradually sought to become more involved with my hobbies and interests...

There is just one problem.  So far, I see little representation in the wiki-project as a whole for hobbies and (relatively) aim-less interests.  Without the group, the whole sharing of information isn't working too well.  My own writing skills are mediocre; (Writing skills are not required within internet forums)and the sense of audience is missing.  I started the book [[River_Fishing]] and pretty much left it after a while.  It was not much more than a stub.

Well, I've come back, not so much looking for people but partly motivated to reach a sence of finality with the project... perhaps it might be useful to someone!  Certainly as a stub its not very useful to anyone.  And who knows perhaps if I'm asked questions during conversations on these forums- I could refer a person to the appropriate page here in Wikibooks. 

I close here by reiterated by thought last year; wouldn't it be nice to have a little place in WB for this interesting hobby?  someplace where questions can still be asked and people can still disuss things, but also some place where knowledge is kept (and not lost in threads), organized and becomes something useful and helpful for all concerned.  IF anybody here is fishermen, even a relatively untalented one, there are more than welcome to help me out. --[[User:JoliePA|JoliePA]] ([[User talk:JoliePA|talk]]) 16:47, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

:I'm glad you came back.  WB needs contributors like you.  I have found that my Wikibooks project has two distinct and largely separate communities.  The first is the people here at WB who visit the reading room, patrol recent changes, and engage in discussions here.  The other is the people who actually use and read my book.  Sometimes my readers cross over and contribute, but that's pretty rare.  I think the &quot;dual communities&quot; thing is not unique though.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 17:21, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

== Fixing the Table of Contents of a book ==

I want to create a new book but I'd like to have some control on the''''' table of contents'''''. Is it possible ? If someone wants to add a chapter or remove one I must agree.

If it is possible can you give me a link to a page.

Thank you.
[[User:Pierre-Yves|PY]] ([[User talk:Pierre-Yves|talk]]) 19:18, 10 October 2009 (UTC).

:You can't stop changes to the table of content, any edit falls under the [[Wikibooks:Be bold]] '''guideline'''. What you can do is adopt a convention specific to that project (fallow the normal practice of proposal - time for objections (&gt;7days) - adoption/refusal), for example the proposed convention can state that a discussion to validate such changes is required (see [[Wikibooks:Decision making]]). Note that a convention that requires your personal consent to such changes will be against the Wikibooks project policy (&lt;u&gt;local conventions are superseded by Wikibooks policies and guidelines&lt;/u&gt;).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:24, 10 October 2009 (UTC)
== Help Book Knowledge Level ==

Being an MS Access and SQL programmer, I began organizing the [[Microsoft Access]] book, to which I intend to contribute as time permits. However, I don't know what user knowledge level do I write to? Also, I specialize in a specific version of the software, and the page title is too general. Any direction would be greatly appreciated. [[User:Ineuw|Ineuw]] ([[User talk:Ineuw|talk]]) 21:10, 12 October 2009 (UTC)

:See what content is there, what content you are capable of submitting (or merge from other sources), post something on the talk page and establish a scope for the project, see if it can be better referenced with a new title (propose the new title on the book talk page and if not opposed request a title change on the administrative assistance forum).
:Keep in mind that Wikibooks aren't restricted by space not even by the format they present here and the finalization of a project is near utopian. By definition Wikibooks are always open for editing (you can establish static versions and upload them as PDFs, but few examples exist). A static copy of a version of a Wikibook could be moved to Wikisource after someone publishes it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:37, 13 October 2009 (UTC)

== [[Mandarin Chinese Grammar for Pimsleur Students]] ==

I figured that I will not finish this book. It is the whole concept of the book that I dislike, so I wouldn't even want to leave it to someone else to finish. I would like to have the book deleted, and leave tabula rasa for the potential creation of a general Chinese grammar book (which makes more sense to me than a grammar book that only caters to Pimsleur students). If this is okay, I would tackle the deletion within the next days. [[User:Stilfehler|Stilfehler]] ([[User talk:Stilfehler|talk]]) 13:40, 14 October 2009 (UTC)
:In theory, if you are the only contributor to the book, you can tag it with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and it can be [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deleted]]. Given the amount of content, the &quot;speedy delete&quot; might be declined, in which case you should request the deletion at [[WB:VFD|votes for deletion]]. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

::The main problem with the concept of the book is probably that you have to avoid copyright issues: systematically citing examples from a commercial language course would probably be a copyright violation.

== Restriction of image uploads ==

I would like to propose restricting image uploads to administrators only and for fair use images only.  There are 4,168 [[:Category:GFDL_images|GFDL images]], 595 [[:Category:GPL images|GPL images]], 369 [[:Category:Public domain works|public domain works]], and 753 [[:Category:Wikibooks free screenshots|free screenshots]] that all have valid licenses and could be moved to Commons with [http://toolserver.org/~magnus/commonshelper.php CommonsHelper].  I've done so myself for some.  There's no point in me doing so if more could be uploaded, however.  These images are unable to be used by any other project by keeping them here.  Allowing image uploading puts additional burden on our administrators to not only check for licensing, but to also ensure said licensing is valid for the images in question.  Administrators on Commons have become experts in their field and the tools on commons are far better suited to handling images.  In addition, the fact that people can upload images here means we get a great number of [http://toolserver.org/~daniel/WikiSense/CommonsClash.php?wikilang=en&amp;wikifam=.wikibooks.org&amp;order=img_name&amp;max=100&amp;format=html images conflicting with those on Commons], meaning that people can effectively prevent others from using images thought to be generally available. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:56, 4 August 2009 (UTC)
:I advise separating out upload as a separate right, because this would become a PITA as non admins couldn't upload PDFs [[User:Geoff Plourde|Geoff Plourde]] ([[User talk:Geoff Plourde|talk]]) 02:02, 4 August 2009 (UTC)
:[[File:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] '''Support'''. Also worth mentioning in this proposal discussion is that the only reason why we should keep and support fair use images is because they aren't supported on [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikimedia Commons] (see their [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:FAQ#Why_doesn.27t_the_Commons_include_fair_use_content.3F FAQ] for the reason]. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:14, 4 August 2009 (UTC)
: I think that would only increase work for admins from requests to upload fair use files. If upload was made a separate right that admins could give out and take from users than perhaps. Wikimedia Commons accepts PDFs too so I don't think what Geoff Plourde raised would be an issue. As an experiment down that road perhaps first uploads could be limited to users with the editors flag? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:22, 4 August 2009 (UTC)
:: Seems reasonable. Since the project is primarily text based and only editors would require uploading PDFs (mostly as static snapshots of the works), this would avoid errors and permit commons to be used to deal with everyday image issues (granting the right to more experienced/invested users would also reduce issues of verifying the fair use status).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:31, 4 August 2009 (UTC)
::Darklama, this is wikibooks, Commons may appreciate the PDF files, but people would be snickering as to why the books aren't on the bookcase. [[User:Geoff Plourde|Geoff Plourde]] ([[User talk:Geoff Plourde|talk]]) 02:34, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

: I support restricting the rights in some way. I'd prefer it to be to those with the editor right or a separate upload right rather than Admins only. We do, however, allow uploading of personal images (e.g., for a user page) that the user may not want to put on Commons. Not sure if this is a big issue. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

:: I wouldn't say uploads of images for personal use on user pages was allowed. I think that is another problem area. [[WB:HOST]] and image requirements would both disqualify them. Of course that is another area of repeated discussion. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:31, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

:: If they lack licensing, I've deleted pictures used on user pages just as if they were used elsewhere in the wiki. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:16, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

:::Sure, I delete them too. I meant sending people over to Commons to upload a personal image would possibly discourage them from doing so (a properly licensed personal image that is) - was that a big problem? Of course, the other issue with this proposal is we then create loads of work for Admins at Commons dealing with our problem - i.e., handling incorrectly licensed media uploaded by Wikibooks contributors. They might not be pleased! &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

: I support disabling uploads of images to Wikibooks. Keep it simple, stupid! ;) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 11:40, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

:&lt;s&gt;[[File:Symbol oppose vote.svg|15px]] I'm not so sure this is a great idea.&lt;/s&gt; (I no longer oppose this restriction - [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 02:58, 28 August 2009 (UTC)) Book covers really don't belong at the Commons, as they aren't generally applicable.  Several people have &quot;About the Author&quot; pages in their user space, and I could see them not wanting their pictures so broadly available.  As for them not being allowed, I have never seen that as a policy, and I think having author images is highly useful (especially when arranging meet-ups with fellow Wikimedians).  The Board of Trustees election features images of the [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Board_elections/2009/Candidates candidates] too.   Restricting rights should be the last option exercised for solving a problem, and I just don't see that this is a huge one.  I don't think it warrants the restriction anyhow. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 14:13, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

::Your very example with the candidates, when examined, shows that many of the candidates are using pictures hosted at Commons.  If a picture is using a license compatible with commons, there's nothing prohibiting me or someone else (as far as I'm aware) from using CommonsHelper to move it and then delete the local copy.  Also, why wouldn't someone want their picture at Commons to easily use it on their user pages across all projects? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:22, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

:::That example was intended to demonstrate that hard-core Wikimedians do upload their own images to Wikimedia servers.  New Wikibookians may not want their images as widely available, but I would concede the point that we could force them to upload those to the Commons.  But take a look at who mostly does this - class projects.  They are new to WB, and adding an additional barrier to their participation here seems like an ill-advised move.  Those are exactly the people we want to attract to this project.  As to why they wouldn't want them available for all WM projects, I think I can make a case for that.  They may want to test the waters here before jumping into the larger WM ocean.  When I started here, I wanted to be about as low-key as I could, not wanting to advertise my presence far and wide, and I certainly did not want to attract any attention.  I had no idea if the folk here were friendly or hostile (turns out they are friendly!) Once I was comfortable here, I was willing to branch out to other projects. IMO, this project is already hard enough for the newbie without us erecting more barriers to participation. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 14:55, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

:::: Sure hardcore Wikimedians upload images of themselves, but they need to be properly licensed. Images &quot;for personal use&quot; aren't compatible with WMFs licensing requirements. I think the barrier for new Wikibookians is that they don't understand there is no difference in using an image uploaded to Wikimedia Commons because often times new Wikibookians ask &quot;How do I use an image I've uploaded to Commons?&quot; The upload link could be made to point directly to Wikimedia Commons' upload forum to reduce confusion on what needs to be done to upload files there which I think would reduce any barriers for new Wikibookians. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:13, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

Now that I look at it, I think that we could change the link, but still have the special page available, and have an uploader right (I think we might have that already). This would be better. But what would we do with registered users? [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 12:40, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

*{{comment}} While I think this is a good idea in general, I strongly recommend setting this up as a usergroup (like &quot;Uploader&quot;), rather than restricting to admins. It could also easily be set up as revocable by either admins or 'crats, if there's any concern about that. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]]  &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:56, 13 September 2009 (UTC)

:Why should we? This point was already covered above  and there is already viable solutions to reduce the barriers to Wikibookians. The images would be ok on commons.
:If you feel that all your points have now been resolved or have been given a viable resolution, please consider altering you vote so we can work out the details and start reducing duplications and move some of the pictures to commons this in itself will take some time.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:45, 13 September 2009 (UTC)

Ok, this closes any of the objections put forward so far. Some solutions were given to the raised issues and the last post to the thread was done in 14 Sep. So I'm moving for a close on this proposal as adopted if no new objection is raised in the next 7 days.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:37, 24 September 2009 (UTC)

This proposal by [[User:Adrignola]] in 4 August 2009 should now be considered as adopted without any standing opposition.&lt;br&gt;
A resume of the positions and solution expressed above and resulting pending tasks by steps (if something is missing or can be better stated, feel free to correct it).
*The upload page will be redesigned so to indicate Wikibookians to use Commons by changing $wgUploadNavigationUrl in LocalSettings.php will simply direct them to Commons. 
*All the images and PDFs GFDL, GPL, public domain works, and free screenshots that have valid licenses  should be moved to Commons with CommonsHelper. 
*Local Image uploads will be restricted to fair use images only.
*Image uploads will be by default restricted to administrators+ (they will have the flag on by default).
*Adminstration will create a separate right/usergroup (like &quot;Uploader&quot;) that can then be requested/given to other registered Wikibookians.
*A standard solution to address conflicting images with those on Commons must be created.
*Any files still using the [[Template:No license]], [[Template:Nfur]], [[Template:No license alternate]] or [[Template:Nld]] should be deleted and the templates merged/deleted. We should probably add [[Template:GFDL-presumed]] files to that list too.

== Volunteers still needed ==

Hi all,&lt;br /&gt; Although we soon will remove the centralnotice that is up, the Wikimedia Foundation is still looking for volunteers to serve as subject area experts or to sit on [[strategy:Task forces|task forces]] that will study particular areas and make recommendations to the Foundation about its strategic plan.  You may apply to serve on a task force or register your name as an expert in a specific area at http://volunteer.wikimedia.org.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Foundation's strategy project is a year-long collaborative process which is hosted on the strategy wiki, at http://strategy.wikimedia.org. Your input is welcome (and greatly desired) there.  When the task forces begin to meet, they will do their work transparently and on that wiki, and any member of the community may join fully in their work.  This process is specifically designed to involve as many community members as possible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Any questions can be addressed to me either on my talk page here or [[strategy:User talk:Philippe|on the strategy wiki]] or by email to philippe at wikimedia.org.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I hope you'll consider joining us!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  ([[strategy:User talk:Philippe|strategy:User:Philippe]]) 01:56, 1 October 2009 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol oppose vote.svg|15px]] '''Oppose''' Wikijunior should already be using English of a simpler nature.  And there's already enough confusion out there with people believing Wikijunior and Simple English Wikibooks have the same target audience.  The niche positioning of a Wikijunior within Simple English Wikibooks would be even harder to distinguish for those people.  On a practical level, creating a sub-project of a project that is not that active in the first place will proceed slowly at best. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:14, 24 October 2009 (UTC)

== [[Template:Dropimage|Dropimage]] show/hide link ==

The link takes up too much space.    Ever since it was improved by somebody, there has been an excessive space to the right of the link, within the heading box.

See the examples in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Editing_Wikitext/Making_Templates_A101 Making_Templates_A101] and I think that you will agree that it was better before.   The only change that is needed really is to place the link close to the right margin of the header box.   I assume that this is done in the NavFrame script set but I cannot do this myself;  my lack of experience with this writing this script and having no access.

Perhaps an admin would know whether this idea would be better.  I mean, is there an existing option to change the position of the link? Maybe an option could be made in the script to allow it.    

While I realise that the trend is towards the use of collapsible tables, I nonetheless would appreciate any assistance in making the improvement. Regards, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 19:42, 21 October 2009 (UTC)

Write a C++ program to implement employee directory, which will let the organization to perform the following functions:

1)	Insert the record of new employee
2)	Delete the record of an existing employee
3)	Find the record of an existing employee
4)	Display Report

Following information of each employee will be stored

Employee ID: an integer value to store the unique id for each employee
Employee Name: the name of each employee.
Employee Address: Address of each employee
Employee Salary:  a float value to store salary of each employee.


Hint:


Following information of each employee will be stored

Employee ID: an integer value to store the unique id for each employee
Employee Name: the name of each employee.
Employee Address: Address of each employee
Employee Salary:  a float value to store salary of each employee.

You can use the following structure to store the information of a single employee:

Struct Employee {

Int empID;
Char *empName;
Char *empAddress;
Float empSalary;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lekh Lekha   &quot;go for your own sake&quot;  Genesis 12:1 -17:27
 
Now Yahweh said to Abram, &quot;Go forth from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.&quot; (Gen. 12:1)

The Test of Obedience
The message is Lekh lekha! &quot;pick your self up and go&quot; from the land of your kinsmen.  These are stronger words than are indicated by translation without embellishment.  The indication is that a clean break with the past is required.  A new direction is given and history is being made.  Abraham was told to change everything, to learn new ways and change his heart as well as to depart from there.   Rashi explains that the unusual phrase, &quot;lech lecha,” means: &quot;for your own benefit and for your own good.&quot;

Abram was probably the most tested individual in the Bible, he was tested by God from day one.  His ultimate test came with the &quot;Akeidah&quot; the offering of his son Isaac on the altar of sacrifice.

Avram had from all indication, established a very comfortable life in Haran.  He was living among all his relatives and had obviously amassed wealth and servants.  There was one problem however; Avram believed in one God while the rest of his family were still stuck in idol worship.  Avram chose God over his family and in obedience to Yahweh he moved himself, his wife and all his belongings, along with his late brother's son, away from all his relatives, to the land of Cana'an.

&quot;If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.&quot;   Luke 14:26

Every believer after receiving his or her call will be ultimately faced with the same choice as Avram.  Our loyalty can not be to our family, who in many cases are not believers we must follow the voice of God.   He does not want us to put any loyalties before Him.  If you do, whatever you put before Him becomes your god and God hates idolatry.

Abram was 75 years old, married to (his half-sister) Sarai, and guardian of his nephew Lot (his deceased brother Haran’s son) when he received the promise of divine inheritance.  In obedience to Yahweh’s call, he left Haran, journeyed to the land of Canaan, and there built an altar to Yahweh (between Bethel and Ai).
He then journeyed south, toward the Negev, when his faith was immediately tested.  A famine in the Promised Land forced him to leave for Egypt, where he conspired with Sarai to pretend to be brother and sister (rather than husband and wife) so that he would not be killed for her sake.  Sure enough, Sarai was taken to Pharaoh's palace to be part of the royal harem, and the Pharaoh gave Abram livestock, camels and servants for her sake.  However, Yahweh sent “great plagues” to Pharaoh’s household until it was known that the reason for the trouble was that Sarai was Abram’s wife.  Pharaoh then released Sarai and dismissed Abram with all his possessions.

After Abram returned to the land of Canaan, Lot separated from him and chose to settle in the evil city of Sodom, where he became a captive during the war of Chedorlaomer (and his three allies) against the five cities of the Sodom Valley.  Upon learning that his nephew was a prisoner, Abram set out with a small band and rescued him, defeating the four kings on account of divine intervention on his behalf.

Dwelling in the Land of Cana'an
Abraham entered Canaan by way of Shechem and it was here that Yahweh first announced to Abraham that this was the land he was giving him along with the other provisions of the Abrahamic Covenant.
 
Shekhem represents the place in Abraham’s life where he  died to himself and confessed Yahweh as his only true God.  It was in that place that Yahweh for the first time promised that Avram’s descendants would receive the land as his inheritance.  Previous to this there is no mention of the land to which he was to go becoming his possession.  But this was the reward of his obedience.
In the same way that Abraham had that experience, so must we all come to our Shechem where we die to ourselves and become entitled to receive our spiritual inheritance. 

From there he goes to Egypt because of the famine and then moves back - this time to Bethel  (13:1,3) &quot;And Abram went up out of Egypt... even to Bethel&quot;. The rabbis note the significance of this passage in that one always speaks of &quot;going up&quot; or &quot;making aliyah&quot; (ascending) to the land of Israel and Jerusalem.  Doesn't this speak of the spiritual journey we are all on leaving the spiritual servitude and slavery of the world, the flesh and the devil seeking to &quot;dwell in the house of Yahweh forever&quot; Ps.23:6
We must continually be going on (ascending) in our spiritual lives from our initial dying to self commitment.

“And Avram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre, which are in Hevron, and built there an altar unto Yahweh.” (13:18  JPS revised) – According to Rashi, Mamre is the name of a person, see 14:24. The name Mamre means “strength”, “firmness” and “fatness”. Hevron means “unity”, “unification”.  Hevron is the place where, according to tradition, Adam and Eve were buried.  Here Abraham built his third altar. This altar represents the resurrection power of being united with Yahweh.  Here the patriarchs were later buried. And from this place Yahweh will one day resurrect their dead bodies, so that they can be united with Messiah in the air when he comes back and later moves to Yerushalayim.

The Abrahamic Covenant
Yahweh reveals himself to Abram as El Shaddai, the All Sufficient or Powerful One and then between verses two and eight states the seven &quot;I will&quot; provisions of the Abrahamic Covenant (17:1).   Abram believed the promises of Yahweh and it was accounted to him as righteousness and he entered into covenant with Yahweh.

Abraham was the archetype of acts of kindness and drawing people close to God.  Abraham embodied the character trait of loving kindness. His entire being was dedicated to doing acts of charity and kindness for others.  In this way, through Abraham himself, God's promise that he will be a blessing to others, was fulfilled apart from the covenantal promises.

The placing of animals that have been cut in half, opposite each other, was the ancient way of entering a covenant. The persons who entered into covenant with each other, walked together between the pieces of the animals in a figure eight formation, which symbolizes eternity thus confirming it as an everlasting covenant  -  Verse 19 speaks of an &quot;everlasting covenant.&quot; 

When Paul was referring to Yahweh's covenants (plural) of promise in Ephesians 2:12 this covenant as well as the previous covenants and the Sinai covenant were included.   The believers were now Israelite citizens through Yeshua and no longer strangers or aliens to these covenants.   see Jeremiah 34:19 and Ephesians 2:11-19.

This covenant confirmed the duration of the promise that Avram’s descendants would inherit the land.
“And He said unto him: ‘Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young dove.’”(15:9  JPS revised)

Abraham fell to doubt and unbelief after waiting for years for a son. The result was his taking matters into his own hands and working out Yahweh's plans and purposes in his life through fleshly means. The result was Ishmael, the father of the Arab Moslem people (16:1-16). The desire for a son had been Yahweh's will but it took time to prepare his chosen vessel.

His primary goal in our life is NOT to bring OUR dreams to pass, but to form in us the person and character of Yeshua (Rom. 8:28-29).  This only comes through time, heat and pressure of spiritual refinement.  That is the message of Genesis 15:12-14.  The birds of the air (Satan and his demons) wanted to interrupt this process (verse 11).  But will we rest (sleep, verse 12) in Yahweh and allow him to work his purposes out in our lives that we may become the refined vessel he wants us to be in Messiah Yeshua  -  this is the process of sanctification and spiritual maturity.

Yahweh told Abraham as part of the covenant to walk before Him and to be perfect.  (17: 1)
&quot;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&quot;   Romans 12:2 

We Must renew our minds by not conforming to the things of the world but rather focusing on the things that are good and acceptable to God.  It's accomplished through reading and absorbing of the word of God and coming to an understanding f what is His good and perfect will for all situations.  We become perfect as the nature of God is revealed in us by living out the principles of His word. Through the revelation of God's word we are able to evaluate ourselves and see whether or not we're being conformed to the world or being perfected in God! When we consider our behaviour, or motivations, our attitudes and the way we express them, in the light of the word of God, we can grade the level of our perfection.

Some people never want to leave their kingdom of self, they feel comfortable there. They feel entitled to their outrages, entitled to their hurt feelings, entitled to their anger, entitled to their unforgiveness.  But in order to be perfect in God's eyes we have to take our focus off self and put it on Yeshua.  If we as believers, believe that Yeshua died for our sin, then we should believe that He can also eliminate our concern for self.  We as believers should be so confident in Yeshua and who we are in Him, that we do not have to defend ourselves.We are to be perfect because Yeshua died to make that possible.  (Matthew 5:48)

The key to perfection is love!  We are called to be vessels of God's love!  Yeshua is telling us that even in the midst of the pressures of this world, the conflicts, the heartless irritating people, the insults and the hurts, we are to LOVE. God's character is love.  By this they will know that we are His disciples.

People will not recognize us by the correctness of our doctrine, they'll recognize us by our love.  If we're afraid to love because we might be exposing ourselves to being humiliated or hurt, then we have not completely died to self, we're still being conformed to the world.  If we are conformed to the world then we're not being perfected!

Is Yahweh separating the wheat from the chaff in your spiritual life?  Are you passing through the fires of refinement and being given a new direction and purpose in life, a fresh start and a new beginning?  The old religious paradigms need to be replaced by a higher, more righteous, more obedient, and a more intimate walk with him. 
 
Everyone of us has to pitch our tent in some direction.  Lot pitched his tent towards Sodom,  Avram pitched his tent towards Bethel (the house of God), which way will you pitch your tent?

The financial part of your business plan is where you pull together all of the various elements of your business and express them in a common denominator: dollars. It is the part of the exercise where you see whether all your efforts and plans will result in you making a profit or not.

It should particularly highlight the timing of any required cash injections (borrowings or investment), by answering questions such as: How much money is needed? When is it needed? What for? Where is the money to come from?

==Three key documents==
A good finance section should include three key interrelated documents.

* Profit and loss forecast (sometimes called the income and expenditure statement)
* Cashflow forecast
* Balance sheet forecast

These three documents collectively and separately depict the impacts of profitability, liquidity and growth on your business over the planning horizon you have chosen.
These financial statements are essential. Not only do potential lenders and investors want to see them, but research shows that small business owners with a good grasp of the financial side of their business are much more likely to succeed.

;Managing your finances
In order to keep your finger on the pulse of your business you should try to gain a working understanding of these financial management tools and the way they interact. However, you should also recognise that in many cases you will need the advice and support of your accountant or business adviser to compile and interpret the information these statements contain.

You will use the financial forecasts as an important yardstick for measuring the performance of your business over the life of your business plan. In addition, your financial section is a key component of your business plan when you present a case to investors or lenders.

Such people will be keen to gain an understanding of your business from your description of the market, your  Competition, products and services, the skills and experience of you and your staff and the various productive resources you have assembled, or intend to assemble, to achieve your production targets.

They will ultimately, however, be most interested to see clear statements of the projected financial health of the business. They will also hope to draw comfort from the soundness and sustainability of the assumptions behind the numbers.

;Specific points of interest to lenders or investors
In particular, they will be looking to see that:

* The profitability of the business reflects a sound relationship between market-driven sales projections and accurately based costs of production and overhead costs
* You have planned to have enough cash to meet both your regular bills and also non-regular items (such as once-yearly insurance payments)
* The financial position of the business continues to remain sound as growth takes place
* You maintain a sensible balance of debt and equity finance
* Your short and long-term obligations are matched with relevant finance options
* The key business ratios (see Glossary) remain within sensible bounds.

;Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Financial accounts for all businesses are prepared exclusive of GST (because the GST isn’t retained by the business). So your Profit and Loss Statement and Balance Sheet always show
the net amounts (GST exclusive).

Your cashflow projections should be prepared GST inclusive, however, as this document projects what happens to your cash each month.

;Preparing your financial forecasts
So how do you go about preparing your financial forecasts?
Clearly it will be easier for you to forecast the future performance of your business if it is already up and running. You will have your past trading results to act as a guide in terms of sales and the relationship of sales to costs. In the case of a new business you will to some degree be flying
blind, but this should not be used as an excuse to skimp on your planning.

==The profit and loss forecast==
The profit and loss forecast is the starting point for your financial planning exercise. It is the document that pulls together key elements of information from your business plan.
Because it is impossible to accurately predict the future, it is a good idea to prepare three variations of your profit and loss forecast:

* An optimistic option: what would eventuate if everything goes right?
* A pessimistic option: what would the results look like in a worst case scenario?
* The most realistic: your best estimate of sales and costs

By completing these alternatives you gain a valuable insight into the various risks associated with your business. Avoid the temptation to prepare more than three alternatives. 
Computergenerated spreadsheet programs make it easy to produce multiple scenarios by varying any number of factors. But masses of printouts will only confuse you and possibly annoy other readers of your finished business plan.

Remember, three-year forecasts are acceptable for most businesses, but you should prepare a five-year forecast if you want to challenge your thinking.

;Step 1, your sales forecast
Start with your sales forecast, simply because the level of sales is, in the overwhelming majority of businesses, the dominant influence on the performance of the business and because most cost items are directly or indirectly linked to the level of sales.

For most existing businesses the past sales levels are the best indicator of future levels of market penetration. For new businesses it is less simple, but you will find that the accuracy of your sales forecasts will improve with time as you gain a better understanding of the relationship of your products and their markets. You must keep detailed records of all aspects of sales; as it is these records that provide you with the growing ability to forecast income levels.

If you have a new business with no past sales history, or an existing business facing a changing market, it may still be possible to get some useful information by doing the Following:

;Talk to industry experts
Suppliers (those who supply your competitors and would like to supply to you too), industry associations, and others in the industry familiar with products or services like yours.

;Talk to potential customers
Observe the activity of your competitors and any customer buying patterns, and talk to customers about what they need, how much, and when.

;Remember your capacity limits
Determine your ability to meet demand and how many units you can produce per month.

Forecasting sales should be undertaken in two steps.

1. First, forecast the number of units you expect to sell during the period.

* Begin with an analysis of current performance (if available)
* Divide sales into appropriate categories

Consider factors that affect each category:

* Internal factors might include staffing changes, profit expectations, promotional plans, capacity restrictions, etc.
* External factors might include the impact of inflation, unemployment, competition, business trends, government policies, etc.
* Now attempt to forecast unit sales in each category for the future period (note that this may require breaking the period down into weeks or days to produce a total).

Remember that considering first a best case scenario, then a worst case scenario, will help you to determine the most likely unit sales forecast.

2. Then multiply by price (excluding any GST you add if GST registered) to calculate the expected dollar value of sales.
In estimating sales figures for the coming period use past figures to see any trends.

* Examine your annual totals for the last five years to help estimate this year’s total sales
* Examine monthly totals for the last two years to see monthly variances and seasons.
* Take into account new sales opportunities you expect to achieve in the forecast period.

;Step 2, your direct costs
On the expenditure side the first section to address relates to the ‘direct costs of sales’.

These are costs that generally move or change consistently with the level of sales; they are said to be ‘variable’ or ‘directly’ related to the level of sales.

Some examples of direct costs of sales:

* A retail store: the price you paid to purchase the products sold
* A manufacturing business: raw materials, factory wages, packaging
* A restaurant: the cost of food, wages of kitchen and waiting staff
* A painter and decorator: the cost of material, painters’ wages.

The amount left over after deducting direct costs from sales revenue is usually called the gross profit or gross margin of the business.

;Step 3, your overhead expenses
From your gross profit you then deduct the ‘overhead’ costs or ‘fixed’ costs to calculate the final net profit of the business.

Overhead costs are sometimes listed alphabetically in the profit and loss statement but it is probably more useful to group them by type. For example:
* Selling: costs associated with marketing your products and services and generating sales
* Administration: costs involved in administrating the business and running the office
* Finance: costs of funding the business and other financial losses.
These overheads or fixed costs are generally the expenses that do not vary (in the short term) with the volume of activity. For example your rent and insurance premiums do not reduce if you sell fewer goods this year. Fixed costs can therefore be estimated in advance with some accuracy because they do not change if your business is busy or quiet.

As you prepare your cost figures remember to give consideration to any other relevant influences. For example:

* Internal factors might include a planned change in staff numbers, anticipated wage increases, commitments to new leases, etc.
* External factors might include the impact of inflation over the next year, anticipated changes to supplier prices, changes in tax rates, changes to power and telephone prices, etc.

Remember again that if you are GST registered your profit and loss statements are prepared GST exclusive (as the GST component of all revenues and expenses is merely passed on to the IRD). If you are not GST registered then simply record the sales you expect to make and the full value of expenses you will incur (including GST as you are deemed an end user and cannot claim it back).

==Cashflow budget==
Once you have completed your profit and loss forecast, which reflects the likely profit performance of your business, you need to convert the information it contains into a cashflow
budget. As the name suggests, what you are endeavouring to do here is identify, usually on a monthly basis, the inward and outward flows of cash for your business.

This is important, because profit is not the same thing as cash in the bank. In the short term a business needs liquidity, which means having enough cashflow to pay the bills as they become due.

* If the cash flowing into your business exceeds the cash flowing out, you can continue to operate.
* If the cash flowing out of your business exceeds the cash flowing in, you eventually run out of cash and creditors may seek to have the business liquidated in order to recover their losses.

;Capital expenditure budget
Many businesses will have to plan for capital expenditure, such as replacing or updating old or obsolete equipment, or buying new equipment. This includes the upgrading of computers and software. Capital expenditure has a massive impact on cashflow, especially for those businesses
that use expensive equipment.

To avoid liquidity problems it is important to anticipate and plan the cashflow for your business.

A cashflow forecast anticipates the flow of cash in and out of the business on a monthly basis, in an attempt to ensure that there is sufficient cash coming in to pay bills as they fall due.

The first step is to ensure you are able to break down your profit and loss forecast into monthly sections.

Having achieved this, you need to convert the information to reflect when the actual cash from a sale is received and when you actually pay the cash for an item of expenditure.

The key here is to remember that in many cases some of the cash coming in will arrive in a month other than that of the actual sale, and some of the cash going out will be in a month other than when you received the goods or services.

Your business policies regarding the credit you offer your customers and when you pay your bills will dictate when cash flows into and out of your business.

It is therefore vital that you make sure the policies you set in these areas are followed as closely as possible. For example, if you offer customers the usual ‘payment by 20th of the month following invoice’ credit terms, but then fail to collect until two months later, you will run into serious cashflow difficulties.

;GST 
If you are GST registered your financial accounts are prepared exclusive of GST , but your bank records aren’t. They show the total cash in and out, including the GST component. You should use GST inclusive figures just like your bank records (to make a comparison with your bank
statements easier). Simply use the estimates you’ve prepared for your profit and loss forecast and add GST to all figures (except items like wages and interest that don’t attract GST ).

But you must remember to include also your regular GST returns (i.e., GST to pay and GST refunds).

If you are not GST registered just use the sales and expenses figures you incur.

==Steps in preparing a cash budget==
;1. Prepare sales forecasts
Use the sales projections from your profit and loss, but remember to include GST in your cashflow sales forecasts if necessary.

;2. Identify the cash inflows that form a part of each month’s operations.

The principle sources of cash coming in will be:
* cash from cash sales (received in the month you sell)
* cash from debtors who are paying for a past month’s credit sales (so the cash receipts will be staggered over the month or two following the sale)
* any other sources of cash revenue (e.g. interest, commission, tax refunds).

Note that the sale of assets and new injections of capital will produce cash inflows also, but these do not occur regularly. Include them when relevant.

;3. Identify cash outflows
The principle sources of cash going out will be:
* cash payments for stock purchases (note that if you buy on credit you will need to stagger the cash payments to the months that you pay the bills)
* all other cash expenses (e.g. wages, rent, power, drawings, taxes paid, etc.).

Note that depreciation is not a cash expense and is ignored in the cashflow forecast.

;4. Calculate net cashflow
Subtract the cash outflows from the cash inflows.

;5. A djust the bank balance each month
By adding the net cashflow for the month to the month’s opening bank balance you can estimate the bank balance at the end of the month.

Repeat for subsequent months.

==Special points==

It is important to note the following:

* Some expenses do not occur regularly each month—for example, insurance, ACC, Provisional Tax, FBT and GST payments—so you have to reflect the timing of such irregular payments in your cashflow forecast.
* Some cash items do not appear in your profit and loss forecast but, because they involve cash going out, they must be included in your cashflow forecast. Examples are any principal repayments on a loan, capital expenditure, or tax payments.
* Some profit and loss items are not included in the cashflow budget. Depreciation is not a cash item so it is not included.

Remember the purpose of your cashflow budget is to provide you with an estimate of your cash position at the end of each month. As such it must account for all cash coming into the
business from all sources (sales, investments, loans, collections), as well as all the cash going out of the business in the same period.

The difference between the two totals, inwards and outwards, will leave you with either a surplus or deficit of cash. A surplus you manage by investing or holding the credit in an interest-bearing account. A deficit you have to cover by a loan, increasing your overdraft, or delaying payment
to certain creditors.

Cash is king in your business—without it your business will likely fail—even when underlying profitability is sound. Like a car engine without oil, your business will cease to function if there is insufficient cash on hand to meet commitments. It is therefore vital that you continually monitor your cash position via your cashflow budget.

==The balance sheet==
The balance sheet of your business provides a snapshot of its financial status at a particular point in time. For most businesses this is generally at the end of the financial year where the balance sheet gives a summary of how the previous year’s trading has affected the business.

For example, a year of sales growth would have led to greater investment in current assets to support the extra sales (for example, increased stock levels and an increase in debtors).

This would have required additional finance, either from yourself or your partners in the form of extra equity, increased creditors (who supplied your stock on credit), or greater short-term borrowing in the form of an increased overdraft. 

Growth in sales may also require cash reserves and borrowing to be committed to new plant and equipment, which in turn may leave the business short of cash. 

Curiously, periods of sales growth can result in cash shortfalls that threaten your ability to pay immediate debts. It’s important to monitor this in your cashflow forecast.

;Balanced relationship
The balance sheet highlights problems associated with growth and allows the prudent business owner to keep growth in balance.

Controlled growth, in which the rate of growth is balanced against the objectives of liquidity and profitability, brings these three business objectives into a sustainable, balanced relationship.

;Key points
Key points highlighted in a balance sheet should include:

* That the balance of types of funding (debt versus equity, long term versus short term) is appropriate for the business
* That there are sufficient current assets to cover short-term liabilities
* That profits are being retained or distributed
* The extent to which the business can grow under its existing financial structure.

The average small businessperson should not expect to understand the intricacies of the balance sheet and how it acts as a regulator of business growth. Your accountant should alert you to problems in this area.

If by this stage you have come to recognise that planning and managing a business is a continual juggling act between liquidity, profitability and growth, then you have gained a basic understanding of the importance of a comprehensive approach to financial planning.

==Break-even calculation==
Using different scenarios to forecast the financial performance of the business will give you an idea of the level of risks involved. A more precise way to gauge both the risks and potential of your business is to complete a break-even analysis. This involves working out how much
business you have to do to achieve the desired profit.

Calculate the break-even point for your business and compare this level of sales with your best estimate of the level of business activity.

A. Sales last year $&lt;br&gt;
B. Gross Profit last year $&lt;br&gt;
C. Gross Profit percentage %&lt;br&gt;
D. Total fixed expenses $&lt;br&gt;
E. Desired profit $ (if not already included as owner’s wages in fixed expenses)&lt;br&gt;
F. Required sales level $ D + E divided by C%&lt;br&gt;
G. Required sales level – units per year Units F divided by average unit price (divide by 52 for weekly)

===An example:===
Let’s presume your sales total last year was $180,000, and your gross profit was $90,000. Your gross profit percentage was 50%. 

This year your fixed expenses are expected to be $60,000 and you are seeking a profit of $50,000. Your average price is $10.


;Step 1. Work out your Gross Profit percentage

Divide your Gross Profit $90,000 by your Sales – and then multiply by 100

$180,000 Gross Profit percentage 50%


;Step 2. Fixed overheads

Add fixed expense costs $60,000 and your desired profit $50,000

Minimum needed $110,000


;Step 3. Now you can work out the target sales figure

Minimum needed to cover fixed overheads $110,000

Divided by Gross Profit percentage 50%

Required sales level $220,000


;Step 4. Finally, you can work out how many units you must sell

Target sales $220,000

Divided by average unit cost 10%

Number of units per year (required sales level) 22,000&lt;br&gt;(Note: you can leave out 
the profit estimate if you want a true break even).

==Your business idea: a quick test==
Use a trial income and expenditure statement to scope the potential of your business idea

We’ve said that it’s accepted practice to complete the financial section after you’ve completed the other key elements of your business plan. However, it can be very useful to ‘scope’ an approximate income and expenditure statement right at the start of your business planning
exercise. You can do this when you are still considering whether a new idea has the potential to form the basis of a business that will meet your personal goals.

In such circumstances it is often very difficult to get your head around the market potential of your idea, so why not work in reverse? Start with your financial goal and, by using the income and expenditure format in a ‘bottom up’ way, work out the necessary dollar sale levels you will need to achieve and what this represents in unit sales in the context of the market for your product. Are you confident you can produce the required units? Where and to whom will you sell this volume?

A step-by-step approach can be followed.

;1. Set your financial goal 
Let’s say you are earning $50,000 at your current job and feel your business idea needs to give you the ability to earn $80,000 per year to compensate for the loss of income security and to offer you a return on your investment.

;2. Determine overhead costs
To this $80,000 you have to add the expected level of overhead costs your business will incur. Roughly calculate your likely costs. Let’s say these costs total $60,000 per year.

;3. Calculate gross margin
Adding these two amounts together gives the amount of gross margin you will have to earn from sales after you have paid for the direct inputs that go into your product.

;4. Calculate cost
Let’s assume you intend to make garden bench chairs and have established that you can sell these for $560. Your trial production has shown that each unit takes four hours to
make at a labour rate of $30/hr (total $120) and uses $180 of materials (timber, screws, paint, etc.). Grand cost total, therefore, is $300.

When you combine all this information you are able to gain a ‘ball park’ insight into the level of sales you will require to meet your personal financial goals from the operation of the business:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Desired financial return
| $80,000
|-
| Level of overheads (list by item)
| $60,000
|-
| Gross margin required
| $140,000
|-
| Sales: price per unit
| $560
|-
| Cost of goods sold: labour
| $120
|-
| Cost of goods sold: material
| $180
|-
| Total cost per unit (labour plus materials)
| $300
|-
|
|
|-
| Gross margin/unit ($560-$300)
| $260
|-
| Number of units to be sold to reach target: $140,000/260 =
| 538 units
|-
| Total sales 538 units x $560 =
| $301,280
|-
| Cost of goods sold 538 x $300 =
| $161,400
|-
| Gross margin (approximately)
| $140,000
|}

You have learned a number of things from this simple scoping exercise.

* You need to sell 538 units per year or between 10 and 11 per week to meet your personal financial goal from the business.

* This has allowed you to put your business potential into a market-sized context and develop a marketing strategy.

* The exercise may have provided you with an early warning that the business will have difficulty obtaining sufficient sales to meet its goals.

* It gives an indication of the level of production required to achieve market and finance targets. For instance 10 -11 units/week at four hours per unit mean that a full 40-hour week needs to be devoted to production. With marketing, sales and administration also to be taken care of, clearly a large proportion of the production will need to be undertaken by hired labour or contracted out if you are to have time for these other important activities.

Clearly you can use this ‘scoping’ exercise to play around with options such as how many units you would need to make and sell if you were happy to take a lower return in the first two years while getting the business established. Try increasing the price, or lowering your costs to see
what difference this makes to how many units you have to sell.

==The Four Fives Rule==

Often when you have completed your financial planning exercise you may want to do some fine-tuning to see whether, by your good management, you can enhance the future
performance of the business. Improved performance is often the result of many small gains rather than major breakthroughs. This is where the Four Fives rule can offer a useful guide.

The four major areas where you can improve the financial performance of your business are the:

* level of sales
* average price of sales
* cost of sales
* level of overheads

A target of increasing the first two areas by five percent each and reducing the second two areas by five percent each can collectively result in amazing performance improvements for a business. An example will serve to illustrate.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''Projected performance''' 
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''Enhanced performance'''
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''''As per original budget''''' 
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''''The goal is to sell 5% more units at 5% higher price'''''
|-
| We plan to sell 10,000 units @ $20
| = $200,000
| We now plan to sell 10,500 units @ $21
| = $220,500
|-
| They cost 10,000 @$3 per unit
| = $30,000
| If we reduce the cost per unit by 5% and sell the 5% extra units, we have 10,500 units @ $2.85 per unit
| = $29,925
|-
| Thus the Gross Margin will be 85%
| = $170,000
| Therefore the enhanced Gross margin
| = $190,575
|-
| Subtract the 50% overhead costs
| = $100,000
| Reduce overhead costs by 5%, they become
| = $95,000
|-
| Giving a Net Margin of 35%
| = $70,000
| Giving an enhanced Net Margin of
| = $95,575
|}

The result of following the Four Fives Rule is a 36.5 percent improvement in pre-tax profit.

Notice that this improvement was brought about by making relatively small changes in a number of key areas, rather than attempting a large change in only one area.
----

To calculate the necessary level of sales for your business, use the information developed in your Profit and Loss Forecast

A. Sales last year $&lt;br&gt;
B. Gross Profit last year $&lt;br&gt;
C. Gross Profit percentage %&lt;br&gt;
D. Total fixed expenses $&lt;br&gt;
E. Desired profit $ (if not already included as owner’s wages in fixed expenses)&lt;br&gt;
F. Required sales level $ D + E divided by C%&lt;br&gt;
G. Required sales level – units per year Units F divided by average unit price (divide by 52 for weekly)

&quot;assembly is not portable at all&quot; is kind of twisting words. Nothing has ever been said that assembly isn't portable across different OS platforms. When people say assembly is not portable they mean across different architectures which have their own instruction set and set of registers, therefore no 'myth' has been shattered and I think this rather insulting line should be removed.

== &quot;FASM supports all popular syntaxes of hex numbers.&quot; ==

I just downloaded it (http://flatassembler.net/download.php) and it doesn't support the &quot;FFh&quot; format, though &quot;0xFF&quot; works.  [[User:Telanis|Telanis]] ([[User talk:Telanis|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Telanis|contribs]]) 18:53, 2 December 2011 (UTC)

Untrue. It only gives an error when the leftmost character in the literal happens to be one of the letters rather than a number. 123h, 0Ah, and 7C00h will assemble correctly. Immediates like FFh, Ah, and F53h generate assembly-time errors. Info valid for FASM version 1.71.21.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''INTRODUCTION'''
----

In recent years, the boom in online distance learning has provided today’s students with more options than ever to facilitate their learning process.  Contrary to what many people believe, the advantages of distance learning far outweigh the negative aspects of the learning medium.  The most notable advantage is that of the time and distance factor.  Students are free to take distance learning courses whenever and wherever they want.  Distance learning also allows for self-paced learning, accessibility, and convenience.  On the other hand, distance learning also has the following weaknesses: the need for initiative and motivation, lack of immediate feedback, and social isolation to name a few.  This posting will review two distance learning case studies pertaining to the College Board’s Advanced Placement Program.


'''BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON ADVANCED PLACEMENT COURSES'''
----

The College Board’s Advanced Placement Program offers college level courses for high school students at schools across the US.  Although they are much more rigorous when compared to traditional courses, AP courses offer students the following benefits: the ability to earn college credit, advanced college course placement, an edge in the college admissions process, and the benefit of learning from great teachers.  More importantly, students can potentially save college tuition and graduate faster by receiving the required score on the AP exams.  In addition, AP courses offer students the ability to raise their weighted grade point averages since a majority of colleges offer higher grade points for AP courses.  As a result, students who have performed well in AP courses have an advantage in applying to the most competitive universities.  As of November, 2009, there are thirty one AP courses available for students willing to take on the additional challenge.  Unfortunately, there is a big inequity in terms of the number of AP courses offered in schools across the US.


'''CASE STUDY I – ADVANCED PLACEMENT DISTANCE LEARNING PROJECT'''
----

Whereas boarding schools and schools in affluent areas offer students nearly the full AP course offering, students from poorer communities may not even get a chance to take an AP course prior to graduation.  To further exacerbate matters, students from poorer districts have a higher tendency to be taught by lesser quality teachers who lack experience and do not have access to professional development opportunities.  To illustrate, Beverly Hills High School, a school located in one of the wealthiest cities in the US with a 9% black and Hispanic population, offers over thirty AP courses.  On the other hand, Inglewood High School, which is located in a low-income community with a 97% black and Hispanic population, offers three AP courses.


In order to bridge the inequity gap surrounding AP courses, a pilot program was launched in a low-income community in California.  The idea was to enable students from the low-income communities to take the AP courses not offered in their schools via distance learning.  Students at the community took the courses after school in the comforts of their home.  Unfortunately, the pilot program was deemed a failure – over 73% of the students ended up dropping out of the courses before year’s end.  The major reason for students dropping out was the lack of personal, face-to-face contact and supervision.  As stated in Human Resources Development, the teacher is a source of support and motivation.  In general, the teacher can increase student motivation in various ways through direct interaction, encouragement, positive criticism, mentoring and coaching, and comradeship to name a few.  Without such a figure present, students felt isolated, which resulted in their dropping out.  Another source of failure was the inability of the distance learning medium to address the various different learning styles of students.  As a result, students who learned best via physical instruction ended up dropping out as well.


Rather than marking the project as a failure, a second run was implemented taking into account the previous reasons for the first collapse.  Two important changes were made to the program.  The first was that the students taking the distance learning courses were provided with much greater teacher support.  The second change was to have the students take the courses at schools.  By taking the courses at the school’s computer lab, students were provided with access to a teacher, who served the role of technology expert and offered general guidance.  Another benefit of having the students take the courses at school was the social factor that was not present the first time around.  Various literature point to the social factor as a very important one when it comes to learning.  Unfortunately, it is the part that is often left out in distance learning programs.  In learning together in a single location, students were able to offer each other social support and enjoy each other’s company at the same time.  Although the social aspect came at a price of flexibility, it was well-worth it for the students in this case.  Ultimately, the second run of the AP distance learning pilot program was a success.  By the end of the second year, student dropout rates fell from 73% the year before to an astonishing 14%.


There have been similar case studies at the teacher training and university level as well.  A teacher training distance learning program reported a 46% dropout rate before face-to-face meetings were integrated into the program.  After the change, dropout rates fell to 8%.  The UK’s Open University, a rather well-known distance learning university, also noted similar problems during its developmental stages.  As it has been confirmed by the US Department of Education, distance learning is maximized when combined with traditional teaching methods.  As stated previously, face-to-face meetings can be used as a source of motivation and focus.  In short, educators must not take lightly the decision to include face-to-face learning sessions within a distance learning program to further raise its effectiveness for both the students and instructors.


'''CASE STUDY II – ADVANCED PLACEMENT IN RURAL PLACES'''
----

Schools in low-income communities and rural communities share a similarity: the lack of access to AP courses.  Take students at Madison Central High School in Richmond, Kentucky, for example.  They’re offered a number of AP courses that can aid them in securing college credit and possibly even saving college tuition in the future.  The school offers thirteen AP courses, which is a fair number to say the least.  On the other end of the spectrum, we have Estill County High School, a small school located in rural Kentucky.  In a stark contrast with the former school, this school does not offer any AP courses, putting their students at a disadvantage in the college admissions process.


According to the US Department of Education, over forty percent of schools in the US do not offer AP courses.  In 2002, a law was passed in Kentucky that required high schools to offer students college credit-based courses, including AP courses.  Unfortunately, the rural high schools were too small in size to justify offering AP courses to a small number of students.  Moreover, the challenge of recruiting qualified teachers to teach AP subjects proved extremely difficult.  In an effort to level the playing field, students attending rural high schools across the state were given the opportunity to take over twenty AP courses online via distance learning courses offered by the Kentucky Virtual High School.


The results have been excellent.  According to Trevor Pecker, The College Board’s vice-president for Advanced Placement, the quality of AP courses taught online is superior when compared to traditional courses.  He points that a lot of it has to do with teacher quality.  It is explained that organizations and virtual schools that offer AP courses go after the highest quality teachers to ensure the success of their programs.  As of September, 2009, thirty-two states offer meaningful supplemental online learning programs that offer a state virtual school or online courses provided by a private vendor.  Unfortunately, more than a third of the states are still unable to offer their students AP courses through distance learning.


As of today, Florida boasts the nation’s largest virtual school.  In 2008, a state law was passed that required every school district in Florida to offer online learning programs.  In 2008, over 2,500 students enrolled in ten AP courses offered at the virtual school.  Teachers teaching AP through distance learning courses stated that they liked the individualized approach the online medium offered.  Moreover, statistics show that Florida students are more likely to pass an AP exam after taking an online course than a traditional course.  According to statistics, Florida virtual school students receiving a passing score of 3 or higher were reported at 55.3%, whereas students from traditional classes were reported at 42.5%.


In virtual schools throughout the country, students are provided with the following key elements in their distance learning courses: textbooks, a computer, a study area, software, and a mentor.  Researchers indicate that although distance learning may offer a lot of advantages for students living in remote areas, it’s never going to replace the traditional teacher-student interaction that is deemed important in the learning process.  While the implementation of virtual schools have somewhat leveled the playing field to a great extent for rural students, the lack of a human and social element still remains.  Like the previous case study, the role and the importance of a physical teacher are emphasized.  Nevertheless, the remaining states need to play catch up in offering virtual schools and online AP course options to high school students in their respective states before other issues are addressed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Table all wrong ==
After staring at this table for quite a while it occured to me, that it doesn't actually list DTFT transforms, but ordinary Fourier transforms for angular frequency.  Some books use  &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; for both normalized frequency and angular frequency.  Wikipedia also follows this retarded convention, which got somebody really confused.  I would suggest, that  &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is used for normalized frequency instead, which would be much clearer.

[[Special:Contributions/92.229.110.117|92.229.110.117]] ([[User talk:92.229.110.117|talk]])

: I am not sure why you say this table lists Fourier transforms for angular frequencies.  Without speaking on the convention wikipedia uses (I have had plenty of arguments over there.)  The use of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; for frequency variable is not unusual in this context.  For example this is the convention used by G. Strang &amp; T. Nguyen &quot;Wavelets and Filter Banks&quot;.  Could you please explain a bit more as to why you feel this table is all wrong? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:32, 9 November 2009 (UTC)


:: The table is wrong because in the discrete-time Fourier domain every function &lt;math&gt;F(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; must give the same result as &lt;math&gt;F(\omega + 2\pi)&lt;/math&gt;, which is not the case for the correspondencies listed in this table.  Some books use the notation &lt;math&gt;F(e^{\omega})&lt;/math&gt; to emphasize that fact (obviously &lt;math&gt;e^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{\omega + 2\pi}&lt;/math&gt; are identical).  Other books use &lt;math&gt;F(e^{\Omega})&lt;/math&gt;, which I find even better, as in this case there is no ambiguity: &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ordinary frequency, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is angular frequency and &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is normalized frequency (normalized to the sampling rate).  In Wikipedia &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ordinary frequency, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; can refer to both angular frequency or normalized frequency, which is very confusing.

:: After reading your comment again, I realized what maybe got you confused: the discrete-time Fourier domain is _not_ the same thing as the Fourier domain.  The Fourier domain is infinite, while the discrete-time Fourier domain &quot;repeats&quot; after two &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. To give you an idea, about the connection: Every discrete signal can be seen as a sampled continuous signal.  If the sampes are taken with a sampling interval of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, in the Fourier domain the baseband spectrum of the original continuous signal is repeated around multiples of &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{sampling}} = \frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\text{sampling}} = 2\pi\frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt; if you prefer angular frequencies for some reason).  The samples of the discrete signal contain no information about the sampling interval or the sampling frequency, therefore the discrete-time Fourier transform maps the discrete samples into the interval &lt;math&gt;(-\pi:\pi)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;-\pi&lt;/math&gt; would correspond (it would, but the information is lost) to the half of the negative sampling frequency (&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{2}f_{\text{sampling}}&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to half of the positive one (&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}f_{\text{sampling}}&lt;/math&gt;) in the ordinary frequency domain, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\Omega = 2\pi\frac{1}{f_{\text{sampling}}}&lt;/math&gt;. As mentioned earlier, Wikipedia writes &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; not &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; as I just did, to refer to the normalized frequency.  This is confusing because the angular frequency is &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2\pi f&lt;/math&gt;, which of course is something completely unrelated.[[Special:Contributions/85.179.124.162|85.179.124.162]] ([[User talk:85.179.124.162|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is the section on copyright infringement that I removed from the main module:

&quot;Since many famous songs often use only three or four chords, it is sometimes difficult to post a simple chord progression without infringing on the copyright on several hundred songs. If you are adding a chord progression, please do not list specific copyrighted songs that use that progression. Instead, allow players the opportunity to discover these musical connections for themselves. However, please give suggestions about rhythm and playing style.&quot;

I understand the original editor's concern but I feel that this has not been a problem with this module. The editors have not provided any chord progressions of famous songs.

===PROJECT 2===
====Create a Projected Profit Spreadsheet - Instructions====
The FBLA is going to purchase a screen printing machine to start a business of creating shirts for the various teams and clubs of the school.  They will need to find an organization to put up the initial cost of $8000 for the machine.  They proposal will be to pay back this organization the full amount by making payments of 50% of the profit on each batch/sale.  Analyze the data to figure out about how long it will take to pay back the loan.

GNU Hurd is a free Unix-like operating system developed by the GNU Project. Hurd was initiated in 1990 to add the only missing feature in the GNU operating system ‒ a kernel. Although under development for over 20 years, there is still no stable release.

It consists of a group of 24 server processes that run on the Mach microkernel. These servers provide most OS features, from authentication to filesystems.

'''When creating a business document/ proposal how can you grasp your reader’s attention and persuade them that what you are writing is beneficial to them?'''

*Be very direct and clear when explaining your topic
*Avoid vague, non-descriptive sentences
*Be straight forward and state your topic first
*Then express that what they are reading has many benefits to them as readers (State the benefits)
*Be sure to write in your reader's perspective. Pretend that you are the reader, what will you want to see on the proposal?

Remember that the number one thing that writers do wrong when presenting their proposal/ documents is assuming that the readers understand the value of the information you present. (Paul V. Anderson, Technical Communication, A Reader- Centered Approach). To avoid this error, put yourself in the reader’s position and make sure you explain the value of your topic and that all your key points are being met. 

== 'Proposal' ==

'''When creating your proposal, how can you tell that you have included all the information necessary to sell your product?'''

''In the book Technical Communication, A Reader-Centered Approach, by Paul V. Anderson, they have created a list of key points to include in your proposal. The following key points can determine how well your proposal will sell.'' 

*Having an introduction
*Introducing the problem
*Projecting the objective 
*Proposing a solution 
*Producing a method 
*Identifying all the resources needed 
*Creating a schedule of deadlines 
*Sharing your qualifications 
*Showing you have management skills 
*Explaining all costs involved
*Show that your idea or plan can be profitable

== Positive vs. Negative==

'''When writing a business letter should more positive or negative words be used?'''

*Generally people respond to positive wording rather than negative wording. Words are powerful and the way they are presented can affect how the reader will respond to the letter one is writing. Positive wording can persuade the reader into getting on board with what your letter is trying to convey. In contrast, negative words can build a roadblock and create resistance to the key points in your business letter. The effects of positive vs. negative writing can also be seen in other types of business writing. It is a good rule of thumb to write in a positive manner when writing to promote the completion of your objective.'

'''What if you have to incorporate negative words within your business letter?'''

*The Owl at Purdue says:  When you need to present negative information, soften its effects by superimposing a positive picture on a negative one. 

The Owl at Purdue emphasizes in the following to help with incorporating negative information.

*Stress what something is rather than what it is not. 
*Emphasize what the firm or product can and will do rather than what it cannot. 
*Open with words of action rather than an apology or explanation. 
*Avoid words which convey unpleasant facts.
*Turn the negative into a positive.

== Words to Use==

'''When writing your business document, memo, or proposal, how do you know when the words you are using are too descriptive?'''

* The number one thing you should never include is short phrases. An example of a type of short phrase is, &quot;In order to&quot; when all you need to say was &quot;To&quot;. If you were writing an English paper, you would say &quot;In order to&quot;, but for a professional business document that phrase is wordy and unnecessary. Using &quot;to&quot; instead is straight and to the point.
* Next, using words ending in -ly, are extra and make the document very wordy. Again this is not straight to the point.
* Another key point is to not use the words &quot;very&quot;, &quot;so&quot; or &quot;really&quot;. These are redundant and do not need to be included in documents. 
* Lastly, being over descriptive could potentially hurt you. In the business world things are fast pace. Employees, client, etc, don’t have time to read lengthy documents. Less can be better and getting straight to the key points when writing your business document, memo, or proposal is big part of being successful. Make your reader wants to read your document and never feels it is a waste of their time.

==Business Writing vs. Academic Writing==

'''How is technical writing different from academic writing?'''

Technical writing is short, concise, and to the point. Academic writing is lengthy and uses strict grammar techniques. In business as long as it all makes sense you can get a way with improper grammar. For example, ending a sentence with a preposition is okay in business. When writing in business, the shorter the document is (as long as it has the right information) the better. Also, in business the more charts, graphs, and pictures that can be used to make the document easier to read and quicker to read, the more it is effective. 

'''What are some examples of when technical writing is appropriate?'''
*Resumes 
*Memos 
*Instructions
*Business Proposals
*Marketing Plans 
*Outlines
*Cover Letters
*E-mails
*Feasibility Studies

== Memo ==

'''When writing a memo, how should you format it? How many pages should it be? What key point should be included?''' 

* Memos should always be placed in a template to insure order. 
* Usually when writing a memo you only want it to be one page, this allows only key points to be presented. But sometimes you may be asked to write a longer memo, and that is okay, as long as all the content pertains to your project and is important.
* Generally, key points include dates, times, deadlines, or overview on what you are working on.
* Make sure to include a specific, informative subject line so the reader knows what the memo is about.
* A memo can be used as a legal document and can get you in trouble, so make sure that you are stating facts and including dates, so it doesn't hurt you in the long run.
* To make sure you keep organized and in order, headings are used often in memos.

== Revision ==

When revising your document, how can you decided what changes are the most significant to make?

In the text book ''Technical Communication'', they talk about having your document hold:
*Correctness
*Consistency
*Conformity
*Attractiveness

Before you begin making revisions, it is important to postpone on making mechanical corrections until the final revision. Remember when writing documents it is best to stay on point. This will eliminate potential mechanical errors that can occur. Lastly, when looking to make improvements on your documents revisions follow this list that is proved by the textbook Technical Communication:

*Adding essential information that was overlooked
*Correcting misspellings
*Repairing obvious errors in grammar
*Fixing major organizational difficulties
*Supplying missing topic sentences
*Revising sentences that are tangled but still understandable
*Correcting less obvious problems in grammar

== Organization ==

How can you organize your information before writing your business letter?

According to the text ''Technical Communication'', a writer should first:
*Classify 
*Describe the objective
*Explain the process
*Show competitors 
*Cause and effect
*Problem and solution
*Combination of solutions

This can help in the strengthening the communication and allow your readers to identify the main points you are focusing on whether it is a memo, proposal, business letter, or other document. Also when organizing your information remember that there is a place for all your information and that information only has one place and one place ONLY (Technical Communication). Headings and subheadings can be used to create distinct sections of where information can be founds. This also makes writing the document easier if you are organized prior. Being repetitive throughout your writing can be detracting and make your reader lose interest. That is why it is important to classify all your information. This can insure a positive outcome of the key points within your memo, proposal, business letter, feasibility study, or other business documents.

== Feasibility Study ==
'''What is the importance of a feasibility study?'''
*A feasibility study is defined in the text book, ''Technical Communication'', as an evaluation of the practicality and desirability of pursuing a course of action.
* Feasibility studies are designed to help future investors decide on which course of action or product to invest in. 
Having a well structured feasibility study serves as important framework for the people you are presenting for. It provides an effective way on presenting your information. Our textbook, ''Technical Communication'' by Paul V. Anderson, gives an outline for us to be able to create a feasibility study efficiently. 

'''What is the superstructure for a feasibility report?'''

*Introduction
*Criteria
*Method
*Overview of alternative
*Evaluation
*Conclusion
*Recommendation

'''What are important tips for preparing a feasibility report?'''
* Don't cut corners on this report it will entice investors.
* Read through example feasibility reports to get a better idea of what is expected.
* Ask potential investors or grant-giving organizations what information they need to make a decision and then include that in your feasibility study. 
* Be realistic in your projections, as investors may be wary of an over-stated financial projection.
* Do your homework. Don't just make up numbers as your investors will probably do research on their own and if the numbers aren't close, they will question your business management abilities.
*Come prepared, give your investors examples for what you are preparing for them, visual aid will help them see your vision for them clearly.

==Word Processing Software==

'''Rules of Thumb'''
#Always use 1 space between sentences when using a non-typewriting font such as Arial, Times New Roman, etc.
#Format Document using 1 inch margins for professional look and feel, if binding the left hand side of the document, change the the '''left''' margin to 1.25 inches.
#Never leave excess space between paragraphs, graphics, etc.
#Make use of the header and footer tool for information to organize the document. In case it becomes separated it can easily be reorganized
#For all reports, use a Table of Contents to easily organize information into sections, to aid the reader in finding the necessary information.
#Never use a font size, bigger than 12 point for body text and avoid going below 10 point
#Single space for a professional look (only double space if professors or business's outline so)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==

You want to take simple, short, intuitive and well designed incoming URLs and map them to the appropriate structures in your database.  You want to achieve the ideal of 'cool URLs' and make your XQuery apps portable within your database and to other databases.

== Method ==

A typical URL in eXist has a format similar to the following:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
http://www.example.com:8080/exist/rest/db/app/search.xq?q=apple
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

You want users to access this page through a [http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI cooler], less platform-dependent URL such as:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
http://www.example.com/search?q=apple
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In order to go transform your URLs into the latter cool form, you need to understand the fundamentals of URLs in eXist.

=== Parts of a URL ===

Fundamentally, eXist's URLs consist of 3 parts:

# The '''Hostname and Port''':  In the example above the hostname is '''www.example.com''' and the port is '''8080'''
# The '''Web Application Context''':  In the example above the context is  '''/exist'''
# The '''Path''':  In the example above the path is '''/rest/db/app/search.xq?q=apple'''

Customizing an eXist URL can mean targetting 1 or more of the 3 parts.

=== Rewriting Primer ===

Some methods below make use of eXist's URL-rewriting facility, that conceptually will let your application follow a '''MVC''' (model-view-controller) design. eXist 1.5 comes preconfigured with a working setup that embodies these principles:

# The collection that lives below '''/db/myapp/''', which is exposed through the REST servlet via /exist/rest/db/myapp/, can at the same time be reached through URL-rewriting in the location '''/exist/apps/myapp/'''.
# Placing a controller.xql inside of /db/myapp/ will determine how the data, a.k.a. model inside of this collection gets presented in the space created by URL-rewriting - so to say: ''it controls the view at the model''.

&lt;small&gt;Please read farther below on how to configure URL-rewriting in version 1.4.1 of eXist to get the same setup.&lt;/small&gt;

== Customizing URLs ==

=== Changing the Port ===

The port for eXist's default web server (Jetty) is 8080, and it is set in $EXIST_HOME/tools/jetty/etc/jetty.xml line 51.  You can modify this file, or you can set the port on startup by setting the '''-Djetty.port=80''' flag upon startup.

Note that how you change the port is different based on how you start eXist. If you start eXist from the bin/startup using a UNIX or DOS shell you must change the startup.sh or startup.bat file. If you start eXist automatically using the UNIT tools/wrapper/exist.sh tools or the Windows Services you need to change the jetty.xml file.  

Restart eXist.  Now, with this change made, your URL will now look like: 

&lt;nowiki&gt;
http://www.example.com/exist/rest/db/app/search.xq?q=apple
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

instead of:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
http://www.example.com:8080/exist/rest/db/app/search.xq?q=apple
&lt;/nowiki&gt;


On Unix (including Mac OS X) and Linux, you will need to run eXist as root in order to bind to port 80. Otherwise the server won't start.

=== Changing the Web Application Context ===

To trim your server's web application context from '''/exist''' to '''/''', go to line 134 of the same $EXIST_HOME/tools/jetty/etc/jetty.xml file and change the following:

From:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;Arg&gt;/exist&lt;/Arg&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

To:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;Arg&gt;/&lt;/Arg&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Restart eXist.  Now, with this change made, your URL will now look like: 

&lt;nowiki&gt;
http://www.example.com/rest/db/app/search.xq?q=apple
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

instead of:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
http://www.example.com/exist/rest/db/app/search.xq?q=apple
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Customizing the Remainder of the URL ===

In customizing the remainder of the URL, eXist's URL Rewriting feature becomes both powerful and challenging.  (See [http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/urlrewrite.xml eXist Documentation on URL rewriting] for complete documentation on this aspect of URLs in eXist.)  

The heart of eXist's URL Rewriting is a file that controls the URLs for its portion of your site; this file is called '''controller.xql''', and you place it at the root of your web application directory.  It controls all of the URLs in its directory and in child directories (although child directories can contain their own controller.xql files - more on this later).  If your web application is stored on the filesystem, you would likely place 'controller.xql' in the '''/webapp''' directory.  If your web application is stored in the eXist database, you might put it in the '''/db''' collection.  In our running example app, where would you store your controller.xql?

Current form: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.com/rest/db/app/search.xq?q=apple&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Goal URL: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.com/search?q=apple&lt;/nowiki&gt;

A natural location for the controller.xql would be the '''/db/app''' directory, because the search.xq file (and presumably the other .xq files) are stored in this directory or beneath.

Given this location for our app's root controller.xql, we need to tell eXist to look for the root controller.xql in the '/db/app' directory.  We do this by editing the '''controller-config.xml''' file in the '''/webapp/WEB-INF''' folder.  Comment out lines 27-28, and add the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;root pattern=&quot;/*&quot; path=&quot;xmldb:exist:///db/app&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Then restart eXist.  This new root pattern will forward all URL requests (/*) to the /db/app directory.  Now, with this change made, your URL will now look like: 

&lt;nowiki&gt;
http://www.example.com/search.xq?q=apple
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

instead of:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
http://www.example.com/rest/db/app/search.xq?q=apple
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The final step to customizing the URL is to create a controller.xql file that will take a request for '''/search?q=apple''' and pass this request to the search.xq file along with the q parameter.

A basic controller.xql file that will accomplish this goal is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

(:~
    Default controller XQuery.
    Forwards '/search' to search.xq in the same directory 
    and passes all other requests through.
:)

(: Root path: forward to search.xq in the same collection 
   (or directory) as the controller.xql :)
    if (starts-with($exist:path, '/search')) then
        let $query := request:get-parameter(&quot;q&quot;, ())
        return
            &lt;dispatch xmlns=&quot;http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist&quot;&gt;
                &lt;forward url=&quot;search.xq&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;set-attribute name=&quot;q&quot; value=&quot;{$query}&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/dispatch&gt;

(: Let everything else pass through :)
else
    &lt;ignore xmlns=&quot;http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist&quot;&gt;
        &lt;cache-control cache=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/ignore&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the '''$exist:path''' variable is a variable that eXist makes available to controller.xql files.  The value of $exist:path is always equal to the portion of the requested URL that comes after the controller's root directory.  A request to '/search' will cause $exist:path to be '/search'.  

Save this query as controller.xql and place it in your /db/app directory.  Congratulations!  Our URL is now in the very cool form we had envisioned:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
http://www.example.com/search?q=apple
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

instead of:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
http://www.example.com/search.xq?q=apple
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This '''$exist:path''' variable is one of 5 such variables available to controller.xql files.  (See the full URL Rewriting documentation for more information on each.)  These variables give you very fine control over the URLs requested as well as eXist's own internal paths to your app's resources.

Since you may wish to re-route a URL request based on the URL parameters (e.g. q=apple), you may wish to retrieve the URL parameter using the request:get-parameter() function, and then to explicitly pass this parameter to the target query using the &lt;add-parameter&gt; element, as in the example controller.xql file.

Thus, in customizing the &quot;path&quot; section of the URL, we have actually paid attention to 3 items:

# The '''root pattern''' and '''path''' to its '''root controller directory''' (recall the &lt;root&gt; element inside the '''controller-config.xml''' file)
# The '''remainder of the path''' after the controller directory
# The '''URL parameters''' included as part of the URL

This simple example only touches the surface of what you can do with URL Rewriting.  Using URL Rewriting not only gives your apps 'cool URLs', but it also allows your apps to be much more portable, both on your server and in getting your apps onto other servers.

== Further considerations ==

=== Defining multiple 'roots' ===   

If you want your main app to live in /db/app but you still want to access apps such as the admin app ('/webapp/admin') stored on the filesystem, add a &lt;root&gt; element to controller-config.xml declaring the root pattern you want to associate with the filesystem's /webapp directory.  Replace your current root elements with the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;root pattern=&quot;/fs&quot; path=&quot;/&quot;/&gt;
&lt;root pattern=&quot;/*&quot; path=&quot;xmldb:exist:///db/app&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This will pass all URL requests beginning with '''/fs''' to the filesystem's '''webapp''' directory.  All other URLs will still go to the '''/db/app''' directory.

=== Using multiple controller.xql files ===

While you can get along fine with only one '''controller.xql''' (or even none!), eXist allows controller.xql files to be placed at any level of a root controller hierarchy, as defined in the '''controller-config.xml''''s &lt;root&gt; element(s).  This allows the controller.xql files to be highly specific to the concerns of a given directory.  eXist searches for the deepest controller.xql file that matches the deepest level of the URL request, working up toward the root controller.xql.

=== The importance of order in the controller.xql logic ===

Make sure that you arrange your conditional expressions in the
proper order so that the rules are evaluated in that order, and no  rules are inadverently evaluated first.  In other words, if another rule matches URLs beginning with '/sea', the URL rewriter would always pass '/search' URLs to that rule instead of your '/search' rule.

=== Variable Standards ===

The code inside of controller.xql gets passed some variables in addition to the usual ones.
Below controller.xql does not do any forwarding, but instead prints their values,
and the path to the document requested, if there is one there…

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to validate a single field based on a rule and alert the user if they enter an invalid value.

== Method ==
We will use an XForms bind expression:
   &lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;PositiveDecimalAmount&quot; 
       type=&quot;xs:decimal&quot; 
       constraint=&quot;. &amp;gt; 0&quot;/&gt;

This last line says that if the current element is greater than zero then the rule passes and the field is valid.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to check to see if a field is upper or lower case.

Note: This does not seem to work in FireFox or XSLTForms.

== Method ==
We will use a bind constraint.


   &lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;UpperCaseText&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;  
            constraint=&quot;
                  . eq translate(., 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') 
                      &quot;/&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
    xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
    xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;

        &lt;title&gt;Case Test&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
        &lt;![CDATA[
            body {
            font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
            }
        ]]&gt;
        &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;xf:model&gt;
            &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
               &lt;data&gt;
                    &lt;LowerCaseText&gt;abc&lt;/LowerCaseText&gt;
                    &lt;UpperCaseText&gt;ABC&lt;/UpperCaseText&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
            &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
            
            
            &lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;UpperCaseText&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;  
            constraint=&quot;
                  . eq translate(., 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') &quot;/&gt;
           
            &lt;!-- compare the string to the lower-case version.  If they are the same we pass --&gt;
            &lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;LowerCaseText&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot; 
            constraint=&quot;
                    . eq translate(., 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz') &quot;/&gt;
   
        &lt;/xf:model&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Case Test&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To pass this test the form must warn the user if they enter an invalid string. 
        The XForms alert message
        must also be visible.&lt;/p&gt;
        
            &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;LowerCaseText&quot; incremental=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xf:label&gt;Lower Case String:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                &lt;xf:alert&gt;The string must contain lowercase only.&lt;/xf:alert&gt;
            &lt;/xf:input&gt;
            &lt;br/&gt;
            
            &lt;xf:input  ref=&quot;UpperCaseText&quot; incremental=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xf:label&gt;Upper Case String:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                &lt;xf:alert&gt;The string must contain uppercase only.&lt;/xf:alert&gt;
            &lt;/xf:input&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In general, there are two ways that mutations in [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] sequences could occur:
  
==Environmental effects ==

'''Altering Nucleotide bases:'''
[[File:Environmental agents damage DNA.jpg]]Environmental effects such as Ultraviolet light, radiation, or toxic chemicals could modify nucleotide bases to make them look like other nucleotide bases, resulting in damages of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]]. For example, certain environmental agent will change the structure of Guanine base so that it has the shape like Adenine. Thus, during the [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] replication, that “Guanine base” can no longer bind to Cytosine, instead, because it has a shape of Adenine, it will bind to Thymine. 

'''Breaking the Phosphate backbone:'''
Environmental agents can also break phosphodiester bonds between oxygen and phosphate groups. By breaking the phosphate backbone of DNA within a gene, a mutated form of that gene could form. And this mutated gene might results in a mutated protein that functions differently, and might cause [[Wikipedia: protein misfolding|protein misfolding diseases]]. 

However, cells usually attempt to fix the broken dens of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] by joining free ends to other DNA fragments in the cell. This creates “translocation,” another kind of mutation. If this translocation breakpoint happens inside or near a gene, that gene’s functions may be influenced.

==DNA replication mistakes==
During [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] replication, [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] helicase first separates the [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] double-strand into two single strands. Then, DNA polymerase helps add corresponding nucleotides to both template strands, creating two double-stranded DNA molecules. However, DNA polymerase could make mistakes during this process at the rate of once every 100,000,000 bases. The result is mutations of genes, which could lead to many malfunction of translated protein. 

In fact, most of the mistakes can be repaired by a type of protein later in the replication process. This protein will replace incorrectly paired nucleotides with correct ones. So that the number of mutations of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] is actually lower.

==Frameshift mutations==
Frameshift mutation is caused by insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. It often occurs when the addition or loss of DNA bases disrupts a gene’s reading frame. A reading frame consists of groups of three [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] bases (codons), which each code represents one specific amino acid. The resulting protein is usually nonfunctional because the wrong reading frame of the gene translate a very different protein sequence from the normal reading frame. 

For example, mRNA with sequence AUG CAG AUA AAC GCU UAA
Normal amino acid sequence reading frame should be: MET GLN ILE ASN ALA STOP However, a wrong reading frame (a deletion of the first base 'A') could give a traslation of mRNA of: UGC AGA UAA ACG CUU AA
an abnormal amino acid sequence translate would be: CYS ARG STOP

In the case above, a frameshift mutation causes the reading of all codons after the mutation to code for different amino acids. The stop codon (&quot;UAA&quot;)cannot be read, which a stop codon could be created at an earlier or later site. The protein being created above is abnormally short, which contain the wrong amino acid; thus, it is nonfunctional.

Frameshift mutations can result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease, which is caused by the missing enzyme due to genetic mutation that result in the accumulation of fatty substance (Gangliosides) in the nervous system. However, frameshift mutation can be beneficial. For example, a frameshift mutation was responsible for the creation of nylonase, which is capable to digest certain byproducts of nylon 6 manufacture.

==Chromosomal Translocation==
Another type of DNA mutation that can occur is chromosomal translocation, which is a chromosome abnormality that is caused by the rearrangement of parts of nonhomologous chromosomes. There are instances where the two separated genes are joined together, forming a fusion gene, which is common in cancer. This fusion gene can be detected on a karyotype of affected cells. There are two main types of chromosomal translocation that can occur: reciprocal (non-Robertsonian) and Robertsonian. Translocations can also be balanced, where there is an even exchange of genetic material with no information extra or missing, or unbalanced, where the exchange of chromosomal material is uneven resulting in extra or missing genes. Some diseases that result from translocation include cancer, infertility, and Down Syndrome.

===Reciprocal Translocation===
Reciprocal translocations are usually an exchange of material between nonhomologous chromosomes. These kinds of translocations are, for the most part, harmless because the amount of genetic material exchanged is the same. They can usually be detected through prenatal diagnosis. However, carriers of balanced reciprocal translocations have an increased risk of creating gametes that have unbalanced chromosome translocations that end up leading to miscarriages or even children with abnormalities. 

===Robertsonian Translocation===
The Robertsonian translocation is most commonly found in children with Down Syndrome. The parents of children with Down syndrome are carriers of unbalanced gametes which lead to miscarriages and/or abnormal offspring. The case of translocation in children with Down syndrome is called trisomy. 

[[File:Inversion.jpg|right|thumb|An example of an inversion mutation.]]
==Chromosomal Inversion==
An inversion is a rearrangement of the chromosomes where a segment of the chromosome is reversed end to end. An inversion occurs when a single chromosome undergoes breakage and rearrangement within itself. There are two types of inversions: paracentric and pericentric. Paracentric inversions do not include the centromere and so both breaks occur in one arm of the chromosome. Pericentric inversions do include the centromere and so there is a break point in each arm. 

Inversions usually do not cause any abnormalities in carriers so long as the arrangement is balanced. This means there are no extra or missing genetic information. However, those who are heterozygous for an inversion have an increased production of abnormal chromatids, which leads to lowered fertility due to the production of unbalanced gametes. 

==Point Mutations==
A point mutation is a mutation where a single base nucleotide is replaced with another nucleotide of the genetic material, DNA or RNA. The term point mutation often includes insertion and/or deletions of a single base pair. Point mutations can be categorized as one of two types:

'''Transitions''': the replacement of a purine base with another purine or the replacement of a pyrimidine with another pyrimidine

'''Transversions''': the replacement of a purine with a pyrimidine or vice versa

Point mutations can also be categorized functionally:

'''Nonsense mutations''': code for a stop, which can truncate the protein

'''Missense mutations''': code for a different amino acid

'''Silent mutations''': code for the same or a different amino acid but there is no functional change in the protein

An example of a missense mutation is sickle-cell disease. A missense mutation occurs in the beta-hemoglobin gene that converts a GAG codon into a GTG codon, which encodes for the amino acid valine rather than glutamic acid. 

[[File:Mutation insertion.jpg|right|thumb|An example of an insertion mutation.]]
==Insertion==
Insertion is the addition of one or more nucleotide base pairs into a [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] sequence. This can happen often when DNA polymerase is slipping in microsatellite regions. Insertions can vary in size, some being only a single nucleotide base pair whereas others can be a section of another chromosome being inserted into the DNA sequence. On the chromosomal level, an insertion refers to the insertion of a larger sequence into a chromosome. This usually occurs due to unequal crossover during meiosis. There are a couple different kinds of insertions that can occur based on how and what is inserted. An N region addition is the addition of non-coded nucleotides during recombination by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. A P nucleotide insertion is the insertion of a palindromic sequence encoded by the ends of the recombining gene segments.

[[File:Mutation deletion.jpg|right|thumb|An example of a deletion mutation.]]
==Deletion==
Deletion is a mutation in which a part of the chromosome or a sequence of DNA is missing. Deletion is the loss of genetic material. Any number of nucleotides can be deleted, ranging from a single base pair to an entire piece of the chromosome. Deletions are usually caused by errors in chromosomal crossover during meiosis. Some of the causes of deletions include losses from translocation, chromosomal crossovers within a chromosomal inversion, unequal crossing over, and breaking without rejoining. Some types of deletions are terminal deletion and interstitial deletion. Terminal deletion is a deletion that occurs near the end of a chromosome. Interstitial deletion is a deletion that occurs from the interior of the chromosome. 

Small deletions are less likely to be fatal while large deletions can be more fatal because there are always variations based on what genes are lost. Some of the medium-sized deletions can lead to recognizable human disorders. Deletions are responsible for a variety of genetic disorders, such as male infertility and two thirds of cases of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 

[[File:Gene-duplication.png|right|thumb|An example of the amplification of a segment of DNA.]]
==Amplification==
Amplification is the duplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene and can occur as an error in homologous recombination, a retrotransposition event, duplication of an entire chromosome. This duplication arises from unequal crossing-over that takes place during meiosis between misaligned homologous chromosomes. Amplification does not usually constitute a lasting change in a species' genome, not lasting longer than the initial host organism. Amplification is actually a way for a gene to be overexpressed. It can occur artificially via polymerase chain reaction or it can occur naturally, as was just explained. 

Gene amplification is believed to play a major role in evolution and this belief has lasted for over 100 years in the scientific community. The duplication of a gene results in an additional copy that is free from selective pressure. The new copy of the gene is then allowed to mutate without deleterious consequences to the organism. With this freedom from these consequences, the mutation of novel genes can occur which could potentially increase the fitness of the organism or code for a brand new function. The two genes that are present after the gene duplication are paralogs and they usually code for proteins that have similar function and/or structure.

== Deamination ==

[[File:Uracil-DNA glycosidase.jpg|thumb|The enzyme hydrolyzes the N-glycosidic bond between the deoxyribose ring and the uracil base]]
Deamination is removing the amino group from the amino acid and converting to ammonia. Since the bases cytosine, adenine and guanine have amino groups on them that can be deaminated, Deamination can cause mutation in DNA. For example, If a cytosine were to be deaminated to form uracil (uracil is an analog of thymine) in the template strand of DNA, then the polymerase would put in an adenine at the corresponding position on the nascent DNA strand instead of a guanine. The hydrolysis reaction (deamination) of cytosine into uracil is spontaneous.


In response to this mutation the cell has a repair process. In this process the cell utilizes the enzyme uracil-DNA glycosidase to recognize these uracils and removes them. This enzyme hydrolyzes the N-glycosidic bond between the deoxyribose ring and the uracil base. Therefore, the uracil base is removed. 


[[File:DNA polymerase I.jpg|thumb|DNA polymerase I inserts a cytosine unit at the AP site on the broken DNA strand]]

Since this site on the DNA duplex is without either purine base or a pyrimidine base is called an AP site (either apurinic or apyrimidinic). Then the enzyme AP endonuclease cut the bond on the 3' side of the phosphodiester bond of the nucleotide. In this phase DNA polymerase I recognizes phosphodiester bond at the 3'end on the next nucleotide unit and cleaves the bond. After the ribose-phosphate unit is removed, DNA polymerase I analyzes the complementary strand and finds that the base that corresponds to the AP site is guanine. Then the enzyme inserts a cytosine unit at the AP site on the broken DNA strand. Finally, DNA ligase seals the inserted cytosine into the damaged strand. Spontaneously deamination of cytosine to form uracil can be repaired by the cell. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg| first = Jeremy M. | year = 2010 | title = Biochemistry| edition = 7th Ed. | publisher = W.

==Quickchange Method==
Quickchange is a technique used to generate site-specific mutations with minimal hands-on manipulation. The sites of mutations are incorporated in the two complementary primers and the rest of the plasmid DNA is synthesized with a high fidelity DNA polymerase in a thermal cycler. Therefore the whole process is considered quick.

Although the reaction is done in a thermal cycler, it is not PCR. Since the template is circular, the newly synthesized single stranded DNA will terminate at the beginning of the primer on the same strand. This product will not overlap with the primer on the complementary strand. Therefore the newly made DNA cannot be used as a template for further DNA synthesis. Only the original template DNA can be used as templates. In each cycle, the amount of newly synthesized DNA is equal to the template. This is considered linear amplified, rather than exponential amplification in PCR.

Since the template DNA is isolated from bacteria, it contains methylated nucleotides. That makes it sensitive to methylation dependent nucleases, such as DpnI. For example, after 20 cycles of amplification, 10&amp;nbsp;ng plasmid will be amplified 20 fold and produce 200&amp;nbsp;ng new DNA. At this moment, restriction endonuclease DpnI will be used to eliminate the original plasmid DNA. The mixture of DNA is then put into bacteria and each DNA species will be separated in different bacteria cells. To see whether a cell contains the right mutation, a single cell needs to be picked, grown up, and the DNA it contains analyzed. Designing the primers is critical. A minimal annealing temperature of 78oC has to be met. Otherwise, the primer will not be attached to its template and the termination will not be stopped precisely.

===Quickchange Protocol===
In general, the way in which quickchange if performed is in the steps below. This technique is similar to PCR.
1. If oligos are from IDT:
	Spin oligos down at high speed for 1 minute using a table top centrifuge and resuspend in H2O or TE buffer to a 10x stock (1250&amp;nbsp;ng/µl)
	If oligos are from Allele:
	Dilute oligos in H2O or TE buffer to a 10x stock (1250&amp;nbsp;ng/µl)
2. Further dilute oligos to 1x (125&amp;nbsp;ng/µl) in H2O or TE buffer
3. Dilute Template DNA to 20-50&amp;nbsp;ng/µl in H2O or TE buffer
4. Thaw 10x pfu ultra buffer and dNTP mix to room temperature
5. Set up quick change reaction in a 100µl thin walled PCR Tube:
	 H2O: 			40µl
	10x PFU Ultra Buffer: 		5µl
	dNTP mix (10mM): 		1µl
	Template DNA (20-50&amp;nbsp;ng/µl): 	1µl
	Forward Primer (125&amp;nbsp;ng/µl): 	1µl
	Reverse Primer (125&amp;nbsp;ng/µl): 	1µl
	PFU Ultra HF (2.5u/µl): 	1µl
	Total:			50µl
6. Mix contents of PCR tube gently and place in the thermocycler. Program the thermocycler according to what is needed for the experiment
7. When the reaction has finished, remove the PCR tube from the thermocycler and add 1µl of Dpn1 directly to the contents of the PCR tube and incubate for 1 hour at 37°C
8. Perform a transformation (see transformation protocol) using 2-3µl of the Dpn1 treated PCR reaction into XL1 Blue competent cells and plate the entire volume onto LB agar plates that contain the antibiotic that corresponds to the template DNA. Incubate overnight at  37°C
9. Check plates for colonies the following day. If there are colonies, use them to inoculate 5 ml overnight cultures and perform mini preps the following day. Send 5µl of the mini prep DNA for sequencing and analyze the results

      <comment>/* Leucylation and phenyllanylation in prokaryotic N-end rule pathway */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

Proteolysis is a process of breaking down proteins into simpler compounds under the aid of proteases. This process takes place throughout the body for a variety of purposes. For example, food is digested into compounds that the body can use for cellular processes. Proteolysis can also link to some disease processes such as the venom causes tissue death by breaking down proteins of the person whom is bitten by a snake.&lt;ref&gt;S.E., Smith. &quot;What Is Proteolysis?.&quot; wiseGEEK: clear answers for common questions. N.p., n.d. Web. 6 Dec. 2012. &lt;http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-proteolysis.htm&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

A protease is an [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] that breaks down[[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] through a process called proteolysis. Proteolysis breaks the[[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Important Organic Reactions in Biochemistry/Peptide Bonding|polypeptide bond]] that link amino acids together.

The selectivity in regulated proteolysis is controlled by generation and recognition of specific degrons on substrates.

Scientists have found that the N-end rule pathway is also a proteolytic system, in which N-terminal residues of short-lived proteins are recognized by recognition components (N-recognins) as components of degrons (called N-degrons). Substrates of N-recognins can be produced during the exposure of embedded destablizing residues at the N terminus by protyolytic cleavage. In addition, N-degrons can also be produced through the modifications of posttranslationally exposed pro-N-degrons of stable proteins. The Modifications include oxidation, arginylation, leucylation, phenylalanylation, and acetylation. Proteolytic systems that base on generation and recognition of N-degrons have been seen in both prokaryots and eukaryotes. In general, the N-rule pathway regulates homeostasis of a number of physiological processes.&lt;ref&gt;asaki, Takafumi . &quot;The N-End Rule Pathway.&quot; Biochemistry. N.p., n.d. Web. 6 Dec. 2012. &lt;http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-biochem-051710-093308?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&amp;&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Proteases: types and functions==

The proteases are categorized by the pH the enzymes work best in. There are acid proteases, neutral proteases, and basic proteases.

A protease's function is to cleave peptide bonds. They are enzymes that work best under acidic
conditions. There actually many types of proteases; some examples include
glutamic acid proteases and threonine proteases. Although most proteases operate
under acidic conditions, there are also a few that operate under basic conditions, these 
are called alkaline proteases. 

[[File:protease.gif]]


[[File:protsite.jpg]]

Proteases occur in all organisms. The cleaving action
of a protease can either halt a protein's function or activate it. Proteases
catalyze this peptide cleaving reaction by hydrolysis in which a water group acts as a
nucleophile and attacks the peptide bond. Proteases can cleave other proteases. These enzymes
play a huge role in digestion in that they cut proteins into fragments so the body can
salvage and absorb the freed amino acids. The use of proteases in medicine is also popular as
the study of proteases have helped us better understand inflammatory conditions and immune regulation.
If a protein is part of a living cell and necessary for that cell to carry out interactions with other
cells then proteases will not cleave it because normal living cells contain an ihibitor mechanism that stops
the cleaving process. Protease deficiency can cause many health related problems. The acidity
created in the stomach through protein digestion; if there are not enough proteases then
this acidic equilibrium is disturbed causing an increase in alkaline character in the blood which could
lead to insomnia or anxiety.

The study of protease structure has also been useful in providing a means for a structure-based drug design strategy to develop new products. For instance, HIV protease is an enzyme that is crucial to the development of HIV. Inhibiting this enzyme would help prevent the HIV virus from spreading throughout the body. By studying the structure of this enzyme, researchers hoped to determine types of molecules with the capability of blocking HIV protease. Thus giving us more insight into the effect that this disease has on the immune system so we can strive to minimize or eliminate the fatal consequences of fully-blown HIV. This strategy would prove faster and more efficient than the typical trial-and-error process, which could be lengthy and unsuccessful.

==Generation of N-degrons by conjugation of amino acids==

In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (bacteria), conjugation of destabilizing amino acids to pro-N-degrons is the main way of producing primary destabilizing residues in the N-end rule pathway. This process is interceded by evolutionary conserved aminoacyl tRNA tranferases, which allows pro-N-degrons to be recognized by N-recognins under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Balzi E, Choder M, Chen WN, Varshavsky A, Goffeau A. 1990.

===Arginylation in Eukaryotic N-rule pathway===

In eukaryotes, the N-terminal Arg is structurally favored degron for the UBR box of N-recognins. The degron Arg can be induced by ATE1-encoded arginyl R-tranferases. The Arg from Arg-tRNA is transferred to the N-terminal ɑ-amino group of acceptor subatrates. In mammalian, the ATE1 gene expresses at least six isoforms through alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. The importance of protein arginylation has been confirmed by the discorvery in which mouse embryos die because of defects in cardiac and vascular development due to ATE1 deficient.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon YT, Kashina AS, Varshavsky A. 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to concentrate DNA and remove detergents, salts, and other low molecular weight contaminants from our synthesized DNA, Alcohol precipitation is used. The nucleic acids will not precipitate if there is a monovalent cation to neutralize the negative charges and permit the DNA to aggregate. Na or Cl acetate are most often used in the lab to precipitate DNA because it can also serve as a buffer around PH 5.2. which provide an acidic environment that favors precipitation of DNA. NH4 acetate will be use when there are free deoxynucleotide since they co-precipitate less with NH4 than with Na or Cl. After adding salts, isopropanol or ethanol will be added to reduce solubility which will favor DNA precipitation. Alcohol will form hydrogen bonds with water, in other words, reduces the amount of water for dissolved substance. In addition, the polarizability, or capacity of alcohols to shield opposite charges (keep them away from each other) is less than that of water.

== ECL operation ==

To answer the questions above, please let me scrutinize the circuit operation. Maybe, you will get bored but I suggest to do that once and for all to reach consensus on how ECL operates. After that we may draw final conclusions. To make my detailed explanations more concrete and to link them to the [[:Image:ECL voltage current picture 1000.jpeg|picture]], I will try to determine roughly the circuit parameters as wells. Let's assume we investigate an ECL inverter: the input voltage is applied to T1's base and T2's input is unused (T2 does not exist). Assume also the circuit has low voltage threshold V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.7 V and high voltage threshold V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.9 V that are situated symmetrically (±0.4 V) with respect to the reference voltage V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.3 V. [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] 

=== Below the low voltage threshold ===
''(this situation will never occur if the circuit is driven by another identical ECL circuit; it will occur only if the circuit is driven by an input voltage source with lower voltage than the low voltage threshold).''

Imagine the input voltage has got down vastly below the low voltage threshold V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g., we have connected T1 base to V&lt;sub&gt;EE&lt;/sub&gt; = -5.2 V). At this stage, think of the voltage divider R1-R2 and the emitter follower T3 as of a voltage source (voltage stabilizer) that fixes T1 emitter voltage at V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE3&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.3 - 0.7 = -2 V. As a result, T1 base-emitter junction  becomes backward biased (V&lt;sub&gt;BE1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = -5.2 + 2 = -3.2 V); T1 is cut off and its collector voltage is almost 0 V. If we continue decreasing the input voltage, at given point a zener breakdown will occur.

In this state, the circuit does not consume a current from the previous stage since T1 base-emitter voltage is less than the cut-in voltage or T1 base-emitter junction is backward biased. So, the input resistance is extremely high.

=== Low input voltage (logical &quot;0&quot;) ===
''(there is no picture for this case)''

'''Left part.''' Now imagine our circuit is driven by another identical ECL circuit whose output stage (the emitter follower T5') has placed low input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.7 V at T1 base. Its base-emitter voltage is V&lt;sub&gt;BE1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.7 + 2 = 0.3 V; T1 is cut off and its collector voltage is almost 0 V.The T4 base current flows through R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; and creates only a small voltage drop about V&lt;sub&gt;Rc1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2 V. So, the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 - V&lt;sub&gt;Rc1&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE4&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.2 - 0.7 = -0.9 V (logical 1&quot;) and does not depend on the gate input voltage. The left part of the long-tailed pair is disconnected from the right part and does not affect it.

In this state, the circuit does not consume a current from the previous stage since T1 base-emitter voltage is less than the cut-in voltage. So, the input resistance is high. 

'''Right part.''' Now, think of the voltage divider R1-R2, the emitter follower T3 and the emitter resistor R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; as a current source passing a current I&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE3&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; through the T3 collector resistor R&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; (this current will determine the maximum T1 collector current in the [[#High input voltage (logical &quot;1&quot;)|next state]] when it will be steered to flow through T1; so, it has to be lower than T1 saturation current to prevent saturation). Or, if you prefer, think of the combination R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, T3 and R&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; as of a common-emitter amplifier (actually, it is not an amplifier but an attenuator with K = Rc3/Re &lt; 1) with emitter degeneration driven by the constant voltage V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. The resistance R&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; (245 Ω) is chosen so that, at the reference input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.3 V, the T3 collector current to create voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;Rc3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 V across it. So, the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 - V&lt;sub&gt;Rc3&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE5&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 - 1 - 0.7 = -1.7 V (logical &quot;0&quot;). The voltage drop across T3 (V&lt;sub&gt;CE3&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = -1 + 2 = 1 V) is high enough to keep T3 in the active region. The output voltage depends on the resistances R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;, R1 and R2 and will vary if they vary. But these variations will not accumulate after next several stages since the input transistor T1 (T2) of the next ECL gate will be cut off and its collector voltage (accordingly, the output voltage  V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) will not depend on the gate input voltage. T3 collector voltage (accordingly, the output voltage  V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;) of the next gate will not depend on the gate input voltage as well; it will depend on its reference voltage.

=== Low-to-high transition ===
''(scrutinizing the current steering idea)''

Now imagine the input voltage begins rising over the low treshold V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.7 V. T1 begins opening; it increases its emitter current and voltage drop across R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;. Figuratively speaking, T1 begins &quot;pulling up&quot; T3 emitter:) thus closing gradually T3 and taking bit by bit its current. The situation is very interesting and it is worth to be generalized as other legendary circuits (e.g., common-base amplifying stage) are based on the same idea.

During the transition, two voltage sources (more precisely, two voltage-stable elements) are connected in parallel (T1 emitter follower from the left side and T3 emitter follower from the right side) and are supplied by a common current source (the emitter resistor R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; supplied by V&lt;sub&gt;EE&lt;/sub&gt;). Figuratively speaking, the two voltage sources are in conflict:) as the right voltage source does its best to keep a steady emitter voltage while the left voltage source tries to increase it. Note these voltage sources are negative feedback systems that react to any intervention applied to their outputs. So, when T1 begins opening to increase its emitter current and emitter voltage, as an answer, T3 begins closing to lower its emitter current and accordingly to decrease the emitter voltage. As a result, ''the collector current redirects (fades) rapidly from the right to the left side at approximately constant emitter voltage''.

During the middle of transition the input resistance is low since the circuit behaves as a common-emitter stage with relatively steady emitter voltage.

This evening, my colleague V. Mollov made a SPICE simulation and we observed how the two collector currents were changing during the transition. At the middle area, the two currents change (fade) rapidly. Approaching the high threshold V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.7 V, T3 collector current becomes almost zero while T1 collector current begins changing slowly. How do we explain this behavior? Let's try answering this question.

During the transition, the right (reference) emitter follower T3 is connected to T1 emitter and fixes its voltage (makes it &quot;stiff&quot;, &quot;hard&quot;, stable...)  Figuratively speaking, the reference emitter follower T3 shorts the emitter resistance during the transition. So, there is no negative feedback in the input stage and it acts almost as a CE amplifier with high gain (transconductance G). At the end of the transition, the reference emitter follower T3 &quot;unhooks&quot; from T1 emitter; the emitter resistor &quot;appears&quot; and introduces a series negative feedback (the so-called ''emitter degeneration''). The input stage already acts as a real CC amplifier (emitter follower) with &quot;soft&quot; emitter voltage that follows the input one. As a result, the T1 collector current becomes I&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;RE&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE1&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; and its curve begins loosing its nerve:) Accordingly, V&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; continues changing slowly (&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;'s logical &quot;0&quot; depends slightly on the input voltage). Note there is no such a problem with T3 collector current in the beginning of transition as it is set by the steady reference voltage (Y's logical &quot;0&quot; does not depend on the input voltage).

At the end of the transistion, when the input voltage reaches the high threshold V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.7 V, all the T3 collector current is taken by T1. This is its maximum collector current that is lower than its saturation current I&lt;sub&gt;SAT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;EE&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) and T1 is prevented against saturation. Note '''''the final collector current does not depend on T1's β (on particualar transistor). It depends only on V&lt;sub&gt;EE&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; and this is the benefit of using the powerful current steering idea here!'''''

If we are curoius and penetrative enough, we may see the same trick ('''''connecting in parallel two voltage-stable elements with different thresholds to redirect the current to the element with the lower threshold''''') in many other circuits. For example, when we ground a TTL (or DTL) input, we connect one base-emitter junction (of the multiple-emitter transistor) in parallel to two series-connected junctions (the base-collector junction of the multiple-emitter transistor and the base-emitter junction of the second transistor); as a result, the input single junction sinks all the base curent. The same trick is applied in the [[:File:7400 Circuit.svg|TTL totem-pole output stage]] where, at output logical &quot;0&quot;, the transistor V2 connects the V4 base-emitter junction in parallel to the series-connected V3 base-emitter junction and deliberately inserted V5 junction; as a result, the single V4 base-emitter junction deprives all the V3 base curent. This trick can be easily demonstrated by connecting in parallel different LEDs as they show where current flows and how big they are without connecting an ammeter. A month ago, in the beginning of TTL labs, I made my students conduct this extremely simple but very attractive experiment in the laboratory. I scаttered handful of different colored LEDs and made students connect consecutively a 2 V red LED to the same 2 V red (green, yellow) LED, then to a 3 V blue LED and finally, to a composed 4 V &quot;LED&quot; (two connected in series 2 V red LEDs). They were deeply impressed when saw how the single red LED extinguished LEDs or combination of LEDs having higher forward voltage. BTW, in 1983, I invented and patented maybe the simplest zero voltage LED indicator (- 0 +) containing only two transistors, two resistors and, of course, three LEDs (one green and two red). Later, I developed this idea to linear and 2-dimensional LED indicators (I managed to patent the latter). If you show interest in these clever circuits, I will show them to you; for now, I give an opportunity to you to disclose their mistery:) [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 07:28, 23 October 2009 (UTC)

=== High input voltage (logical &quot;1&quot;) ===
''See the [[:Image:ECL voltage current picture 1000.jpeg|picture]] (there is a little mistake - V&lt;sub&gt;CE3&lt;/sub&gt; is actually V&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;).''

'''Left part.''' The preceding output stage (the emitter follower T5') has already set high input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.9 V at T1 base. As [[#Low input voltage (logical &quot;0&quot;)|above]], you may think of the emitter follower T1 and the emitter resistor R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; as a voltage-controlled current source (voltage-to-current converter or a transconductance amplifier) passing a current I&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;RE5'&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE1&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; through the collector resistor R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt;. Or you may think again of the combination R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, T1 and R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; as of a common-emitter amplifier (as above, it is sooner an attenuator with K = Rc1/Re &lt; 1) with emitter degeneration driven by the constant voltage V&lt;sub&gt;RE5'&lt;/sub&gt;. The resistance R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; (220 Ω) is chosen so that, at high input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 V, the T1 collector current to create voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;Rc1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 V across it. So, the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;  = 0 - V&lt;sub&gt;Rc1&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE4&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 - 1 - 0.7 = -1.7 V (logical &quot;0&quot;). The voltage drop across T1 is V&lt;sub&gt;CE1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = - 1 + 1.6 = 0.6 V and the transistor is still not saturated. The output voltage depends on the resistances R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; and the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;; so, it will vary if they vary. As Rc1/Re = 0.22 the output voltage depends slightly on the input voltage (it won't depend at all if we replace R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; by a constant current source). But again, as above, these variations will not accumulate after next several stages since the input transistor T1 (T2) of the next ECL gate will be cut off and its collector voltage (accordingly, the output voltage  V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) will not depend on the gate input voltage. T3 collector voltage (accordingly, the output voltage  V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;) of the next gate will not depend on the gate input voltage as well; it will depend on its reference voltage. [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 10:00, 23 October 2009 (UTC)

At this stage, the input resistance becomes very high since the circuit begins acting as emitter follower (common-collector stage).

'''Right part.''' At this point, the input emitter follower T1 has &quot;pulled-up&quot; the T3 emitter to a level of V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.6 V. As a result, the base-emitter voltage of T3 is V&lt;sub&gt;BE3&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.3 + 1.6 = 0.3 V; so, T3 is cut off and its collector voltage is almost 0 V. Only the T5 base current flows through R&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; and creates small voltage drop about V&lt;sub&gt;Rc3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2 V. So, the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 - V&lt;sub&gt;Rc3&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE5&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.2 - 0.7 = -0.9 V (logical 1&quot;) and does not depend on the gate input voltage. The right part of the long-tailed pair is disconnected from the left part and does not affect it.

=== Above the high voltage threshold ===
''(this situation will never occur if the circuit is driven by the same ECL circuit; it will occur only if the circuit is driven by an input voltage source with higher voltage than the high voltage threshold).''

If we continue increasing the input voltage above this level (e.g., if we connect T1 base to ground or to a positive voltage source), T1 will saturate presently. The collector and emitter points join and the input voltage transfers directly through T1 base-emitter junction to this point (V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; follows V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;). The input part behaves as a voltage divider; so, the input resistance becomes relatively low again (R&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = Rc1||Re).

Nevertheless, T1 continues &quot;moving up&quot; T3 emitter. After the point where V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.6 V, T3 base-emitter junction becomes backward biased and, at given point, a zener breakdown occurs.

Emitter resistors are included in the early [http://wps.com/archives/solid-state-datasheets/Motorola/MECL/images/IC11-2.jpg MC306G gate] and later they are omitted in the next [http://wps.com/archives/solid-state-datasheets/Motorola/MECL/images/IC11-3.jpg MC307G gate] (see more in [http://wps.com/archives/solid-state-datasheets/Motorola/MECL/index.html Motorola MECL logic family datasheets, 1963].

I agree with you and would like to add some words about the difference between an emitter coupled pair (ECP) and a differential amplifier (DA). ECP is a particualar case of DA. ECP is a partial DA operating only in a &quot;single-input varying&quot; mode (I'm not sure how to name this regime; &quot;differential&quot; is doubtful). ECP does not operate in a common mode. That is why, a bare emitter resistor can act as an almost perfect current source (as the voltage across it is almost constant). DA with single-ended output needs a perfect current source to be connected as a &quot;tail&quot; to suppress the output voltage variations in common mode. [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] (old ''Circuit-fantasist'') ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 22:43, 20 October 2009 (UTC)


In all the logic families, we can distinguish two main parts: an ''input part that implements the logical functions'' and an ''output part that boosts the weak input part''. The input parts of NMOS logic, DCTL and ECL are based on the same simplest logical structure - a few ''connected in parallel voltage-controlled (MOS) or current-controlled (BJT) electronic switches supplied by a current source''. As these switches are implemented by enhancement mode transistors (i.e., when the input voltage increases, the transistor opens) and the voltage drop across the transistors is taken as an output, this structure is inverting and performs logical NOR function. Ooh, I will not sleep again this night:) [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 20:43, 20 October 2009 (UTC)


Saying &quot;current source&quot; I mean the combination of the voltage supply and the collector (drain) resistor that constitute a simple current source. If you prefer, you may name it &quot;imperfect voltage source&quot;. Another wide-spread viewpoint: the pull-up resistor and the lower group of parallel-connected switches constitute a voltage divider. Saying &quot;In many families, the input logic switches are the same transistors that drive the output...&quot; you probably mean complementary structures (e.g., CMOS). But note I've confined only to &quot;simple inverter&quot; structures with pull-up resistor (ECL, DCTL and NMOS). [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 21:45, 20 October 2009 (UTC)


You have made me ponder seriously... Really, I always try to arrange circuit evolution in a logical (instead historical) succession to reveal basic ideas to my students. IMO TTL and DTL (AND implementation) are relations since both they use exotic diode switches in the logical input part; TTL is an improved version of DTL (only in some respect). About complementary outputs...I can't assess how important it is. I can't realize why I try to find some relationship between different logic families regarding to the input logical part but you - regarding to the output stage... But my mind turns off and I go to bed:) Thank you for the interesting talk. [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 23:38, 20 October 2009 (UTC)


== About the picture ==

I have drawn the picture and place it in [[Emitter-coupled logic#Circuit operation|Circuit operation]] section with the purpose to show a generalized (generic) circuit diagram of a typical ECL circuit. It differs slightly from the particular [[:File:ECL.svg|MECL 10k]] (the additional reference emitter follower Q4 is omitted and additional resistors are connected in the emitters of the output transistors). I have arranged uniformly the circuit components and stretched the circuit diagram so that it to fill out the drawing. Then, to [[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/Philosophy#Visualisation|visualize]] the invisible electrical attributes, I have overlaid a picture of voltage and current relief. In this attractive presentation, voltages and voltage drops are represented by red colored bars, whose heights are proportional to the corresponding voltage magnitudes (an association with a water column); currents are represented by green colored loops with corresponding topology and thickness that is proportional to the magnitude of the current (an association with a water flow). Having a look at this picture, we can instantly get a notion of how &quot;high&quot; voltages (drops) are and how they are related; we can see how big currents are and how they flow. I have been using this technique since 80's and I have been trying to popularize it... but without any success... just because I was (and still am:) nobody... In 90's, I was drawing a lot of such colorful pictures by using ''Corel draw'' editor (see for example our favorite [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my_work/conferences/cs_2005/figures/paper2/diff_dyn_load.jpg differential amplifier] but here with dynamic load). In the early 00's, when I started [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com circuit-fantasia], I was creating a lot of such but animated presentations implementing them as Flash movies (see for example, one [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/v-to-v-sum-old.html &quot;serious&quot;] and one [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/strange-things.html funny] story that I gave to Tom Hayes). I have been even using on-line presentations where graphical voltage bar (diagram) representations are driven by the very real circuit under investigation (see for example, the [[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film#How to visualize the voltage diagram on the screen|story about Ohm's law]]). It would be very useful if simulating programs had such a graphical output... Finally, when I realized that content is more important than form, I began drawing manually such colorful pictures using only fiber pens with various colors...

I like this picture as it is informative and self-explaining. But if you think it is too ornate, I can redraw it in this manner but retaining only the essential differential part and removing some of the more inessential circuits (the previous stage, the output emitter followers or/and the reference voltage divider). In this case, I can afford to draw another picture for the case of low input voltage (logical &quot;0&quot;). Thus we may describe the two circuit states linking the texts to the two figures.

[[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] and [[User:Jc3s5h|Jc3s5h]], thank you for your appreciation! I have a compromised solution to the problem that will satisfy both the ordinary and profound Wikipedia readers - to draw three versions of this picture with identical dimensions and then to give an opportunity to the very readers to choose the desired version. The three versions can be:
#Pure circuit diagram (without overlaid voltage bars and current loops)
#Circuit diagram with overlaid voltage bars and current loops at low input voltage (logical &quot;0&quot;)
#Circuit diagram with overlaid voltage bars and current loops at high input voltage (logical &quot;1&quot;)
The first picture will be placed in the article and two links inserted in the capture will point to the other two versions (see the exemplary figure on the right). A more sophisticated implementation may be based on dynamic HTML (mouseover effect); but I'm not sure if wiki markup supports this feature.

== Summarizing the key points of the discussion ==

I suggest to begin extracting and summarizing as final conclusions the key points of our discussion upon which we have reached some agreement. After that we may move them to the main article and to other related articles as well. I start the list with the hope that you will enrich it with more wisdom:) [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 17:56, 26 October 2009 (UTC)

* Digital circuits are actually analog circuits that are made operate as digital ones at the ends of the input range. They operate as analog circuits in the transition area.

* The simplest 1-transistor amplifying stages are inverting as they are implemented by &quot;enhancement mode&quot; transistors (when the input voltage increases, the collector current increases as well) and the voltage drops across their collector-emitter parts are taken as output voltages.

* Logic gates are overdriven DC analog amplifiers without biasing. The transistors of DCTL, RTL, DTL and TTL can stay in three conditions: saturated (at logical &quot;1&quot;), in active regime (during the transition) or cut-off (at logical &quot;0&quot;).

* ECL transistors can't operate only in active regime (in both the logical &quot;0&quot; and logical &quot;1&quot; input signal) since, when cascaded, they will amplify the input voltages (the big problem); a DC drift will propagate and accumulate through the consecutively connected stages as well (the smaller problem).

* ECL (input) transistors can stay in two conditions: in active regime (at logical 1 and in transition area) or cut-off (at logical 0). As a result, they change alternatively their condition (...active -&gt; cut-off -&gt; active -&gt; cut-off...) along the chain. The cut-off transistors stop the drift by separating the output voltage from the input voltage; they replace the input voltage by the constant supply voltage (0 V).

* These logic gates consist of two parts: an input part that implements the logical functions and an output part that boosts the weak input part.

* DCTL and ECL have the same logical parts consisting of parallel connected electronic switches (BJT transistors with parallel connected collector-emitter parts). An ECL gate includes a DCTL gate; ECL is an improved version of DCTL in regard to saturation problems.

* To avoid saturation, the current steering idea is used in ECL. It is implemented by a 3-component structure where a current-stable element (or just an ohmic resistor) is conected in series to two connected in parallel (voltage-controlled) voltage-stable elements. This circuit is called by the figurative and self-explaining (in regard to the structure) descriptive name &quot;long-tailed pair&quot;.

* In regard to usage, a long-tailed pair is named &quot;differential amplifier&quot;, &quot;emitter-coupled amplifier&quot;, &quot;analog multiplier&quot;, &quot;an amplifier with voltage-controlled gain&quot;, etc.


== Revealing the truth about ECL circuits ==
''(seeing the forest for the trees)''

I am in the seventh heaven as I have finally revealed the fundamental idea of ECL... It is not 
''differential amplifier'' (more precisely, ''emitter-coupled amplifier'') or ''current steering'' although, in the middle of transition, the circuit is exactly a differential amplifier (an emitter-coupled amplifier) that steers the current between the legs. Well, I agree it steers; but imagine some curious and profound visitor like our anonymous 60.241.12.136 (see [[#DC drift of output|DC drift of output]] section above) brows through this [http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=pub-2698861478625135&amp;cof=FORID%3A1%3BGL%3A1%3BLBGC%3A336699%3BLC%3A%230000ff%3BVLC%3A%23663399%3BGFNT%3A%230000ff%3BGIMP%3A%230000ff%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3B&amp;q=Emitter-coupled+logic highest Google ranked page] in the hope of grasping the basic ECL idea. Reading &quot;current steering&quot; he/she will want to know why the emitter current is steered between the two legs; with what purpose is the current steered? Why a differential amplifier is used? What problem does it solve here? To answer these questions, we have first to show what the fundamental problem of ordinary logic circuits is and then to show how this problem is solved in ECL. I can say (and will say at the end) in a few words what this genius idea is but let me first expose it in detail as it deserves more respect. [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 07:47, 3 November 2009 (UTC)

=== The problem of saturation ===

''Differential amplifier'', ''emitter-coupled amplifier'' and ''current steering'' are misleading concepts here. They cannot explain what fundamental problem ECL has solved as they focus our attention to the middle part of transition where actually there is no any problem! In this area, the transistors of all the ordinary logic circuits (RTL, DCTL, DTL and TTL) work perfect as common-emitter stages in active regime. If we were staying in this area, there was no any need to replace them with this more sophisticated and odd 3-component structure figuratively named ''long-tailed pair'' as it would do the same - it would work as the same common-emitter stage!

A problem appears when the input voltage approaches the high threshold (logical &quot;1&quot;) and the transistors of the ordinary logic circuits (RTL, DCTL, DTL and TTL) saturate; as a result, they work slowly. But, as our curious reader would think, the differential (emitter-coupled) amplifier couldn't solve this problem as, in this area, the reference transistor T3 is cut-off and the differential amplifier is not an amplifier. That's why, to realize what happened [[#DC drift of output|above]], the reader has created his own &quot;philosophy&quot; about ECL thinking of a differential amplifier not as of an amplifier but as of a comparator. Really, the long-tailed pair is cut in two and this structure is no more a differential amplifier; its two new parts are something else. So, the paradox of this classic viewpoint is that we use a differential amplifier where actually it is not a differential amplifier!

'''Saturation is the fundamental problem that ECL circuits solve''' at high input voltage (logical &quot;1&quot;). This and only this is the amazing feature of ECL; the other advantages (as the presence of two inverse outputs) are inessential. So, it is our primary duty to show in this page the basic idea (the clever trick, the circuit solution, the remedy...) that is used to prevent saturation. But how can we prevent saturation? Let's see and compare various anti-saturation techniques.

=== How to prevent saturation: ===

We can drive the transistor from the side of the base and from the side of the emitter. So, we may prevent saturation indirectly from the side of the base by limiting the base current or directly from the side of the emitter by limiting the very collector current.

==== ...from the side of the base... ====

We have two techniques for limiting the base current that require the presence of a base resistor (i.e., they are inappropriate for direct-coupled circuits).

*The simplest and obvious solution is ''to decrease the base current by increasing the base resistance''. But the large tolerances of β make this approach unrealizable [http://www.physics.dcu.ie/~bl/digi/unitd04.pdf] as the collector current and the point of saturation will depend on the particular transistor.

*Another but reliable and wide used ''β-independent'' technique for preventing saturation is ''to detract the excessive base current by a diode negative feedback'' (connecting a Schottky diode between the collector and the base). Until the transistor is in active mode, the diode is cut-off and does not affect the base current. When it approaches the saturation point, the diode turns on and deprives the excessive base current.

==== ...from the side of the emitter. ====

Finally, we may try to avoid saturation by ''limiting the very collector (emitter) current'' and thus we will finally arrive at ECL. But we cannot set the desired emitter current in a common-emitter stage (DCTL) simply by inserting a constant current source (or, in the simpler case, an ohmic resistor) between the emitter and ground as we will not be able to control at all (or slightly, in the case of the resistor) the collector current from the base. Why? The answer is that the current source (the emitter resistor) will introduce series negative feedback and the common-emitter amplifying stage will transmute into a stage with emitter degeneration. As a result, when we change the input base voltage to change the collector current, the transistor changes in the same manner its emitter voltage and we do... nothing:( Figuratively speaking, when we &quot;move&quot; the base voltage, the transistor &quot;moves&quot; in the same manner its emitter voltage (it operates as an emitter follower). The emitter voltage has become &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;pliable&quot;, &quot;movable&quot;...; but to control the collector current the emitter voltage has to be &quot;hard&quot;, steady, fixed...

This is a fundamental problem of analog circuit design - how to set the desired collector current (the quiescent point) without loosing control from the base. Or, in other words, how to make the emitter voltage &quot;soft&quot; for the undesired influences and &quot;hard&quot; for the useful input voltage applied to the base. Typical examples: an AC amplifier with emitter degeneration suppresses the slow DC variations and amplifies rapidly changing AC input variations; a differential transistor amplifier suppresses common-mode signals and amplifies differential input signals; finally, an '''''ECL gate suppresses the input voltage variations near to the high threshold (input logical &quot;1&quot;) and amplifies them significantly during the transition'''''. It is clear that there is some common powerful idea in these apparently different circuits... What is it?

Obviously, to make the emitter voltage &quot;soft&quot;, we have to insert a constant current source (actully, a current-stable element) and v.v., to make the emitter voltage &quot;hard&quot;, we have to insert a constant voltage source (a voltage-stable element). Instead to replace the current source with a voltage source we may just connect the voltage source in parallel to the current source as it will define the voltage across the combination of two elements. In the first two examples above, the voltage sources are permanently connected to the current ones but they appear only at useful input signals. In the AC amplifier, the bypass emitter capacitor follows the slow DC variations and does not affect the current source; but it begins acting as a constant voltage source at rapidly changing AC input variations. In the differential amplifier, the right emitter voltage follows the left one at common-mode and does not affect the current source; but it becomes steady (or opposite changing) at single-ended (or differential) mode. '''''In ECL gate, solely the constant current source is connected in the emitter when the input voltage is near to the high threshold (input logical &quot;1&quot;); both the constant current source and the constant voltage source are connected in the emitter during the transition''''' (the sources are commutated by the transistor's base-emitter &quot;diode switches&quot;). Let's consider the three possible configurations.

'''V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (logical &quot;0&quot;).''' T1 is cut off; V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 V and does not depend on V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. Both the current source (R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) and the voltage source (T3) are disconnected from the input part.

'''V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; (transition).''' T1 operates in active regime (common-emitter configuration) with both the parallel connected current source (R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) and voltage source (T3) inserted in its emitter. There is no negative feedback. V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; depends significantly on V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; since the voltage source dominates over the current one and the T1's emitter voltage is &quot;hard&quot;.

'''V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; (logical &quot;1&quot;).''' T3 is cut off and there is no voltage source. Only the current source (R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) is connected in T1's emitter (emitter degeneration). There is a series negative feeddback. V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and does not depend at all (in the case of constant current source) or depends slightly (in the case of emitter resistor) on V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; since T1's emitter voltage is &quot;soft&quot;.

Finally, let's say the truth about ECL with one sentence:

'''''ECL is based on a transistor stage with switchable voltage and current emitter sources: at low input voltage, the sources are disconnected; during the transition, both the voltage and current source are connected; at high input voltage, only the current source is connected.'''''

== rotation ==
A CELX &quot;rotation&quot; object is internally a Quaternion, which is one possibility to mathematically describe a rotation in 3 dimensions (i.e. it can be converted to a rotation matrix). A rotation can also be used to describe the orientation of objects or the observer (i.e. where the observer is looking to, and where &quot;up&quot; is).

Within a CELX script, the rotation methods need to be prefixed with the obtained &quot;rotation&quot; object, separated with a semicolon.

The following methods can be used to obtain a &quot;rotation&quot; object:
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#newrotation (axis-angle)|celestia:newrotation(axis-angle)]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#newrotation|celestia:newrotation()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx observer#getorientation|observer:getorientation()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx position#orientationto|position:orientationto()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx frame#to (rotation)|frame:to(rotation)]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx frame#from|frame:from(rotation)]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx rotation#slerp|rotation:slerp()]] method.
* Using the {{Celx:v160}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx phase#getorientation|phase:getorientation()]] method.

== Methods ==

This chapter contains a list of all available rotation methods, which can be used on &quot;rotation&quot; objects.

=== imag ===

vector {{Celx:func|rotation:imag()}} 

Return the X, Y and Z values of this rotation as a &quot;vector&quot; object.

'''Notes:'''
# A CELX &quot;vector&quot; object is a geometric object that has both a length and direction [X, Y, Z] in a 3 dimensional coordinate system.
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx vector|vector]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;vector&quot; object. &quot;Vector&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;vector&quot; object as an argument.

'''Example:'''

 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 rot1 = obs:getorientation()
 vector = rot1:imag()

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#rotation|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''rotation''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== real ===

number {{Celx:func|rotation:real()}} 

Return the W value of this rotation as a number.

'''Example:'''

 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 rot1 = obs:getorientation()
 number = rot1:real()

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#rotation|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''rotation''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== transform ===

vector {{Celx:func|rotation:transform}}({{Celx:arg|vector:vec}})

Transform a &quot;vector&quot; object by applying the rotation to that vector and return the result in a new &quot;vector&quot; object.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;vec: The vector the rotation will be applied to. Must be a &quot;vector&quot; object.
}}

=== setaxisangle ===

{{Celx:func|rotation:setaxisangle}}({{Celx:arg|vector:vec, number:angle}})

Set axis and angle, as defined in the vector and angle for this rotation.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;vec: Vector describing the [X,Y,Z] axis for this rotation. Must be a &quot;vector&quot; object.
;angle: The angle in radians for this rotation. Must be a number.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# Angles in CELX are defined in radians instead of degrees. 180 degrees (half a circle) is the same as π radians = 3.14159265 radians = math.pi radians (LUA). You can convert degrees to radians and vice versa as follows:
#* radians = math.rad( ''number:degrees'' ) = ( ''number:degrees'' / 180 * math.pi) = ( ''number:degrees'' / 180 * 3.14159265).
#* degrees = math.deg( ''number:radians'' ) = ( ''number:radians '' * 180 / math.pi) = ( ''number:radians '' * 180 / 3.14159265).
# This method is equivalent to [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#newrotation (axis-angle)|celestia:newrotation(axis-angle)]] method. Only by using this method, the &quot;rotation&quot; object needs to be present first, instead of being created by the method. To obtain such a &quot;rotation&quot; object, the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#newrotation|celestia:newrotation()]] method can be used instead, or you can use an already existing &quot;rotation&quot; object, previously defined within your script.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Change the current observer view by 180 degrees (like a rear-view mirror).

 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 -- Create a rotation object from all zero numbers.
 rot1 = celestia:newrotation(0, 0, 0, 0)
 -- Define the axis for the rotation as a vector
 up_vec = celestia:newvector(0, 1, 0)
 rot1:setaxisangle(up_vec, math.pi)
 obs:rotate(rot1)
 wait(0.0)

=== slerp ===

rotation:rot3 {{Celx:func|rotation:slerp}}({{Celx:arg|rotation:rot2, number:percent}})

Return an interpolation of this rotation and another &quot;rotation&quot; object (rot2), using number to indicate how much of each rotation should be used. Return the result in a new &quot;rotation&quot; object (rot3).

{{Celx:argdesc|
;rot2: Second rotation that will be used for the interpolation. Must be a &quot;rotation&quot; object.
;percent: The percent number used to interpolate between the two rotations. Must be a number between 0 and 1.
:* If percent is 0, this rotation is returned in rotation:rot3.
:* If percent is 1, the second rotation (rot2) is returned in rotation:rot3.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# A CELX &quot;rotation&quot; object is internally a Quaternion, which is one possibility to mathematically describe a rotation in 3 dimensions (i.e. it can be converted to a rotation matrix). A rotation can also be used to describe the orientation of objects or the observer (i.e. where the observer is looking to, and where &quot;up&quot; is).
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx rotation|rotation]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;rotation&quot; object. &quot;Rotation&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;rotation&quot; object as an argument.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Goto a position in the Earth-Moon system and set the observer orientation to the middle of the Earth-Moon positions. 

 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 -- Set frame of reference to &quot;universal&quot;.
 obs:setframe(celestia:newframe( &quot;universal&quot;))
 -- Find the actual position of the Earth.
 earth = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth&quot;)
 earthpos = earth:getposition()
 -- Find the actual position of the Moon.
 moon = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth/Moon&quot;)
 moonpos = moon:getposition()
 -- Calculate new position to goto
 newpos = earthpos + 0.5 * (moonpos - earthpos)
 newpos = newpos + celestia:newvector(0, 0, 0.075)
 obs:goto(newpos, 0.0)
 wait(0.0)
 -- Orientation from this position towards Earth
 orient_earth = newpos:orientationto(earthpos, celestia:newvector(0, 1, 0))
 -- Orientation from this position towards Moon
 orient_moon = newpos:orientationto(moonpos, celestia:newvector(0, 1, 0))
 -- Interpolate new observer orientation (middle)
 orientation = orient_earth:slerp(orient_moon, 0.5)
 obs:setorientation(orientation)

== CELscript ==

Within CELX scripting it is possible to create a &quot;celscript&quot; object from a string, containing a valid CEL script.

A &quot;celscript&quot; object can be used to execute a CEL script embedded in a CELX script. This is done by passing the CEL script in a string to the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#createcelscript|celestia:createcelscript()]] method and thus create a &quot;celscript&quot; object. If the string doesn't contain a valid CEL script, this method will cause an error.

== Methods ==
This chapter contains a list of all available celscript methods, which can be used on &quot;celscript&quot; objects. 

=== tick ===

boolean {{Celx:func|celscript:tick()}}

Return a boolean, indicating that the CEL script within the &quot;celscript&quot; object has terminated.
* true, CEL script is still running.
* false, CEL script has terminated.

'''Notes:'''
# LUA supports a syntax for long strings using double brackets which is useful here. Using this you can in nearly all cases simply copy and paste complete CEL scripts without modification into the CELX script.
# When using CEL script parts within a CELX script, the PAUSE function by pressing the ['''Spacebar'''] key will not work completely correct. Although the scene you’re looking at will pause directly, the CEL script parts will continue to run in the background, resulting in a part of the script being visually skipped when you press the ['''Spacebar'''] key again to continue the script.
#When using a &quot;celscript&quot; object &lt;u&gt;repeatedly&lt;/u&gt; within a CELX script, it is advised to first define the following function at the beginning of your script, which can be used on differt places in the main script:

 function CEL(source) 
    local script = celestia:createcelscript(source) 
    while script:tick() do 
       wait(0) 
    end 
 end
 
 &lt;''... other CELX script code ...''&gt;
 CEL([[{ ''string:cel'' }]])
 &lt;''... other CELX script code ...''&gt;

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;The following example orbits Saturn for 12 seconds, using CEL commands within a CELX script:

 function CEL(source) 
    local script = celestia:createcelscript(source) 
    while script:tick() do 
       wait(0) 
    end 
 end
 --
 CEL([[{
    select { object &quot;Sol/Saturn&quot; }
    center { }
    goto   { time 3 distance 8 up [ 0 1 0 ] upframe &quot;equatorial&quot; }
    wait   { duration 3 }
    orbit  { axis [ 0 1 0 ] rate 30 duration 12 }
    }]])

== Regarding Wikijunior questions on my userpage ==

Thanks for your message,
Regarding the question about templates - I'm not really sure of a specific policy but other books seem to mention the book title in the name of the template - e.g. [[Template:Wikijunior:Languages]] and it's in the WJ namespace.
Regarding the second question about creation of new titles.  Yesterday I added to a talk page (not sure which one) about how I was also confused as to the present policy.  I guess that the voting was abandoned because of a lack of participation.  Whether this means that people are free to create new titles as they wish I don't know.  I'd say that if you want to create a new Wikijunior title then go ahead and place it in amongst 'Wikijunior/Non-Canonical_Books'.  A few years ago I created the 'Europe' book without bothering with a vote.  If you're going to create a new Wikijunior title then be prepared to work on it - voting for new books may also have been stopped so that editors can concentrate on current titles rather than be distracted by new ones.
So no firm answers from me!--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:54, 6 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term &quot;Bioinformatics&quot; can have many meanings.  To some, it may mean the skills necessary to access large data sets through web pages.  To others, it may refer to general biology research that is performed using computers.  But perhaps the most technical definition specifies the development of computer algorithms and software to solve biological problems.  This book will provide insights into algorithms and software development skills that will help the reader to develop or modify software so solve biological problems.  Examples of bioinformatics solutions include DNA analysis to determine coding regions, secondary structure, protein folding and the phenotypes associated with DNA.  Bioinformatics is also necessary to perform association studies linking Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to genetic diseases.  Sophisticated algorithms to determine the relationship between organisms and their phylogenetic evolutionary history are also important to bioinformatics.  And there are are a large number of other topics like Mass Spectrometry that require bioinformatics to analyze the results of an experiment.  This book will focus on the algorithms needed to perform many of these tasks.  This topic falls in the overlap between Biology, Genetics, Statistics and Computer Science, so input is welcome from all interested parties.

'''Aim of this lesson:''' review adjectives, look at gradable and ungradable adjectives and focus on the order that adjectives are used in sentences.

== Gradable and Ungradable Adjectives ==

Adjectives in English can be gradable or ungradable.  A gradable adjective is one which can be graded using words like 'quite' and 'very'.  Ungradable adjectives can not be graded - it's not possible to say 'She is very starving' because the adjective 'starving is already a strong adjective because it means 'very hungry'.

Examples of gradable adjectives: big, small, pretty, ugly, cold, hot, tired

Examples of ungradable adjectives: enormous, tiny, stunning, hideous, freezing, boiling, exhausted (these adjectives are the ungradable forms of the above gradable adjectives, i.e. very big = enormous, etc.)

== Adjective Order ==

We can say 'an old blue sweater' but not 'a blue old sweater'.

Adjectives must be used in a specific order.

# Opinion (splendid, silly)
# Size (big)
# Age (new)
# Shape (round)
# Colour (blue, blonde)
# Origin (Italian)
# Material (wool, plastic)
# Purpose (sleeping, heating)

When using more than one adjective use them in the above order.  It's rare to use more than 2 or 3 adjectives together.

== Exercises ==

Try putting these sentences into the correct order.  The answers can be found [[English/English for B2 Students/Answers|here]]:
# I have a (striped, beautiful, new) jumper.
# She has (black, long, curly) hair.

==1. Write a one page paper demonstrating your knowledge of how a drum corps can be used to minister within your: a. local church b. community==
A drum corps within the local church can build excitement among the youth and make them enthusiastic about being in the church.  It effectively dispels the &quot;church is not cool&quot; myth.

A drum corps that performs in the community raises the community's awareness of the local church in a positive way.  A drum corps may be the first contact an individual within the community has had with the church.  Though this is unlikely to make a person think &quot;Hey, I ought to start going to church&quot; and show up the next Sabbath, it will give them a positive association so that when a subsequent contact is made (such as an invitation to an evangelistic event or a health seminar), it is more likely to be met with success.
Also it helps marchers stay in step.

==2. What are the four families of rudiments?==
*'''Rolls'''
*'''Diddles'''
*'''Flams'''
*'''Drags'''

==3. Be able to name five rudiments from each of the four families of rudiments.==
===Rolls===
==== Single Stroke Roll Rudiments ====
The single-stroke roll consists of alternating sticking (i.e., &lt;tt&gt;RLRL&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.) of indeterminate speed and length.

|1.
|Single Stroke Roll
|[[File:1 single stroke roll.svg|120px]]
|Evenly-spaced notes played with alternating sticking. Though usually played fast, even half notes with alternating sticking would be considered a single stroke roll.
|-
|2.
|Single Stroke Four
|[[Image:2 single stroke four.gif]]
|Four notes played with alternating sticking, usually as a triplet followed by a strong beat (as in the picture) or as three grace notes before a downbeat (like a ruff).
|-
|3.
|Single Stroke Seven
|[[Image:3 single stroke seven.gif]]
|Seven notes played with alternating sticking, usually as sextuplet followed by a strong beat. 
|-

|4.
|Multiple Bounce Roll
|[[Image:4 multiple bounce roll.gif]]
|Alternating handed strokes with no specific number of bounces. Should sound even and continuous. Also called &quot;buzz roll.&quot;
|-
|5.
|Triple Stroke Roll
|[[Image:5 triple stroke roll.gif]]
|Each stroke can be bounced or wristed. &lt;!-- needs explanation, perhaps a glossary on this article? --&gt; Also called a &quot;French roll.&quot;
|-
|}

===Double stroke open roll rudiments===

The double stroke roll is a rudiment consisting of alternating diddles (i.e., &lt;tt&gt;RR&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;LL&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.) of indeterminate speed and length. There are 10 official variants of the double-stroke roll (see below).

|6.
|Double Stroke Open Roll
|[[Image:6 double stroke open roll.gif]]
|Like the single-stroke roll, usually played fast, but even when played slowly, alternating diddles are considered a double stroke roll. Played so each individual note can be heard distinctly.

|Seven Stroke Roll
|[[Image:9 seven stroke roll.gif]]
|Three diddles followed by an accented note.

=== Diddle rudiments ===
In percussion, a diddle consists of two consecutive notes played by the same hand (either RR or LL). Compare to the [[#Drag rudiments|drag]], which also consists of two consecutive notes played by the same hand.

The paradiddle is a rudiment consisting of a four-note pattern of the form &lt;tt&gt;RLRR&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;LRLL&lt;/tt&gt;. When multiple paradiddles are played in succession, the first note always alternates between right and left. There are also several official variations of paradiddle rudiments.  Paradiddles are often used to switch hands while playing steady notes. For example, if steadily playing sixteenth notes, with right hand lead (&lt;tt&gt;RLRL&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.), then wanting to end on a drum to the left of the current drum, he may stick it as follows: &lt;tt&gt;RLRL RLRL RLRL RLRR L&lt;/tt&gt; with the final left tap on the ending drum.

=== Flam rudiments ===
A flam is a rudiment consisting of a quiet &quot;grace&quot; note on one hand followed by a louder &quot;primary&quot; stroke on the opposite hand. The two notes are played almost simultaneously, and are intended to sound like a single, 'broader' note.

|Drag
|[[Image:31 drag.gif]]
|A drag consists of two consecutive notes played by the same hand (either &lt;tt&gt;RR&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;LL&lt;/tt&gt;). This is similar to the diddle, except that by convention diddles are played the same speed as the context in which they are placed, where drags are played at twice the speed as the context in which they are placed. For example, if a sixteenth note passage is being played then any drags in that passage would by definition be thirty-second notes, where diddles would be sixteenth notes. Drags can also be played as grace notes. When played as grace notes on [[timpani]], the grace notes are alternated (&lt;tt&gt;rlR&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;lrL&lt;/tt&gt;). &lt;ref name=nasatir&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuously playing alternating drags (or diddles) results in a double-stroke roll.  

A similar rudiment is the ruff, which is a note with three grace notes, but they are usually alternated &lt;ref name=nasatir /&gt;

==4. Demonstrate ability to keep in step with the drum corps by taking part in at least one outreach program. (ex. Pathfinder Day, Conference or Local church sponsored event)==
Songs that are marches are written in either 2/4, or more commonly, 4/4 time.  When marching to such a song, the left foot leads and always hits the ground on an odd beat, while the right foot hits the ground on an even beat.  Count the beats in your head as you march, &quot;1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4&quot; etc.  The left foot touches the ground on each 1 and 3.  The right foot touches on each 2 and 4.  If you find you are out of step, a quick hop (where the feet do not cross one another) can quickly get you back into step.  But staying in step is a lot easier than getting back in step once you're out, so pay attention!

The outreach program will be something like a parade in which your drum corps marches.  This will call for a class A uniform, so make sure it is clean and pressed!

==5. What is the difference between drum carriers and drum straps? Demonstrate with drum equipment in a formation.==
Drum straps are basically a strap across your body. Drum carriers are frontal LINK: http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=snare+drum+harness&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;ion=1&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=642&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=9962442093029923537&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ig0aT5zKLOLs2AXduMX8Cw&amp;ved=0CJkBEPICMAQ

==6. What are the seven essential rudiments? Why are they essential?==
;1. Single Stroke Roll:
;2. Multiple Bounce Roll:
;3. Double Stroke Open Roll:
;4. Five Stroke Roll:
;5. Single Paradiddle:
;6. Flam:
;7. Drag:
{{TODO|Why are they essential?}}
Each rudiment as listed in the order above indicates the level of advancements once one begins to learn the rudiment families. Each rudiment builds on the knowledge of prior rudiments. With the addition of strokes, accents, and a combination of two or more rudiments, new rudiments are developed. Learning how to play rudiments in this fashion will assist the player in understanding the basic concepts of drumming.

==7. What is the difference between playing open vs. closed?==
==8. Using the open/closed method, demonstrate your knowledge of the seven essential rudiments. Execute: Open to Closed to Open==

Open, closed, open is a technique of playing snare drum rudiments, especially used during auditions.

Open, closed, open technique consists of beginning the rudiment very slow and controlled, speeding up evenly until at the maximum speed for the drummer, then slowing back down after maintaining that speed. Optimally, the drummer should end on the opposite hand as started, in case of alternating rudiments such as paradiddles. Also, the speed ended at should be approximately the same speed as the drummer began.

==9. What is the difference between traditional style and matched style stick holding? Demonstrate each style by playing a sequence consisting of no less than three rudiments.==
{| border=0 align=center
|[[File:Drumstick mached grip.jpg|thumb|300px|Matched grip]]
|[[File:Drumstick regular grip.jpg|thumb|300px|Traditional grip]]
|}
In the past, snares were typically carried with slings, and due to the discomfort of this angle for the left hand, traditional grip was created. Most modern snare drums have rigid over-the-shoulder harnesses that hold the drum with the playing surface parallel to the ground, which affords the option of performing with matched grip. The term ''matched grip'' is used because both hands are in the same position (matched). However there are many groups that are returning to a slight tilt in order to make using traditional grip more comfortable for the players.

==10. What is the difference between drumsticks used for a drum corps and those used for a percussion drum set?==
Snare drum sticks may be designed for use in particular performance contexts. Sticks that are smaller in diameter or balanced farther towards the tip may be intended for orchestral playing that requires fine control and soft dynamics. Sticks for street playing (e.g. drum corps and marching bands) are almost always thick and weighty, to promote extended production of sound at extreme dynamics.
Easy Answer:
Drum Corp: Heavy and thick
Drum Set: Light and thin usually with laminated top

==11. What are the sections that make up a drum corps?==

There are five primary sections that make up a drum corp/drumline. They are as follows: Cymbal Section, Snare Line, Tenor Line(including Tri/Quads/Quints), Bass Line, and the Pit. 

Note: Some drum corps/drumlines may opt to use a multi-tenor setup instead of having a single tenor, but they would still fall under the tenor line catergory.

==12. Based on the previous question, what purpose does each section serve?==
===Snare Drums===
Snare parts are typically unison and provide the center rhythm of the drumline. The snare drum line is the center of tempo in the ensemble, and the &quot;center snare&quot;, a position typically held by the most experienced snare drummer, is responsible for maintaining the tempo. When rehearsing or performing, the center snare may &quot;tap off&quot; the ensemble, setting the tempo with a solo rhythm.

===Tenor Drums===
Contemporary tenor drums (also called toms, tri-toms, quads, quints, squints, or sextets) are single-headed tonal drums. There are usually four to six drums in a set, but there can be as few as one or as many as seven. Tenor players add pitch variety to the drumline with drums of different sizes and tuning. 

===Cymbals===
Marching cymbals are typically pairs of crash cymbals played in a variety of ways. Cymbals are bronze with leather carrying straps. Players in cymbal lines may all carry the same size and type of cymbal, or a variety of instruments may be used. Cymbals are played being held before the body, in unison or split parts. In addition to being played by the cymbalists, snare drummers may play on the cymbals as ride cymbals or like hi-hats, thus there is typically a minimum of one cymbalist for every two snare drummers. Cymbals are also used for visual effects due to their reflectiveness while twirling or spinning them. Many contemporary field ensembles do not utilize a cymbal line, as cymbals are played in the front ensemble.

===Bass Drums===
Marching bass drums are most frequently used as tonal drums split between several percussionists. Each drummer plays a unique part, though the entire bass drum part is conceived as a whole. Marching bass drums, which produce the deepest sound in the battery, are larger drums carried on harnesses with the heads facing the front and back sidelines. The musicians carrying the bass drums typically line up in size order. Bass drummers use mallets with rounded or cylindrical heads often made of hard felt. Small bass drum lines typically consist of four or five members to ensure enough for a melody, and large lines can have eight or more drummers. Sometimes, in smaller bands, one may see only 2 or 3 bass drummers perform, when this happens, sometimes a bass drummer is required to play 2 or 3 bass drum parts to ensure full sound. In very small bands, one may only see one bass drum witch takes the place of 3 to 4 bass drums.

===Pit===
Pit plays all the percussive instruments in the band. The pit usually plays the marimba, vibraphone, xylophone, chimes, electric keyboard, and bells. They also play the suspended cymbal and other &quot;auxiliary&quot; instruments such as bongos, tambourine, cowbell, anvil, and bass drum and gong. The pit usually is the main melody in marching band, especially in drum corp. The keyboards have a different &quot;utensil&quot; for making sound. They use a mallet which is held the same way as a drum stick. It is also possible to hold two mallets in each hand, four mallet technique, and three mallers in each hand, very rare but the six mallet technique. More info will be provided when the PERCUSSION HONOR is made.

==13. Show the various types of protective devices used to secure drum corps equipment.==
==14. What are the various types and sizes of drumsticks used for a drum corps?==
There are different sizes of drum sticks for each situation, designated by a letter and number, e.g. 2b and 5b are thicker, while 5a and 7a are smaller. The number in the designation corresponds to the length of the stick, with smaller numbers being longer sticks, and the letter corresponds to the diameter or gauge of the stick, with the further along the alphabet the thicker the stick, so &quot;b&quot; is larger than &quot;a&quot;.
==15. Know what tools and equipment used for drum practice sessions.==
For Practice you would use a Practice pad.

Copied from main page

Part Four needs to be fleshed out, probably split into pieces.

Alternative, fancier titles for chapters in part 2:
        An Alignment Serves to Equate Positions Between Two or More Sequences
        An Alignment of Sequences Represents Similar Chemistry Translated Through Time and Circumstance
        Bayesian Inference from Maximum Likelihood is at the Root of Most Bioinformatics Applications
        How Biological Sequences Evolve Over Time
        How Different Circumstances Effect Sequence Evolution
        Protein Domains – Different Units with Conserved Chemistry Recombine to Form Novel Proteins
        Quantitative Measures of Properties of Sequence Alignments
        Etz'Choyim (The Tree of Life)
        The Role of Viruses - Interspecies Gene Exchange

Several chapters need to be added
        Biological databases and ontologies
        Systems biology data analysis
        Protein structure analysis 
                (sections for databases and resources, viewing, prediction, alignment, classification)

        I think I see a basic problem. 
        If this book is about bioinformatics defined as The science of the treatment of biological information, especially large quantities of
        biological information. Then a lot of these titles are off topic. As an example &quot;The genetic origins of multi-cellularity&quot; is talking about
        the past. Information only exists in the present. I would suggest a better title would be &quot;The effects of the development of multi-cellularity
        on the genome&quot;. I am sure there are other problems but this is a fundamental one.

      <comment>The article &quot;Least squares&quot; needs an example for non-linear application. It could link to wikipedia's &quot;Cooridinate measuring machines.&quot; - CMM</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''I work with measuring machines, CMM's, which use least squares algorithm to calculate a circle size and center, based on 4 or more points. Three points define a circle but in the real world a 4th point will not be a perfect fit, especially if accuracy is in the micron level. Therefore, least square is used to &quot;average&quot; out all 4 points. 
Least square is likewise used for 5 or more points on a cylinder.  The result is a diameter, center location, and 2 offset angles from the coordinate system planes, for example a ZX plane angle and a YZ plane angle. 12 to 20 points make the calculation more accurate, but greatly increases the calculations.

I've never entered info in a wiki, so I just offer this as an invitation.  Here is an incomplete article under &quot;Least Squares, non-linear use.&quot;  If I can steer someone with more details, contact me &quot;AT&quot; kcp.com - name &quot;wboyer&quot;.'''&lt;/big&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two major subtopics to economic development. The one that is focused on here is the newer, as an area of study: it is concerned mainly with urban development, and, geographically, is concerned largely, although not exclusively, with places in the already-wealthy countries of the world -- the &quot;first world.&quot;
The second dates as a major area of study from the 1950s onward: it is about how to improve the lot of the &quot;underdeveloped&quot; nations of the world -- it looks at their transition from colonialism into the modern world economy, how they have fared, what they should do and what the rich nations should do to solve their problem of poverty.

The Deardorff definition is concerned with the second of these subject areas, but the whole rest of the &quot;book&quot; so far with the first.  We need to clarify whether we are going to cover both subject areas or just one; and if both, balance things more.

: I realized this as I was writing this that I am only focused on economic development as it has occurred in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve">RNA plays a variety of roles in gene expression, from messenger, catalysis to regulations. For instance, in E.coli, 80% of RNA is ribosomal RNA, 15% is transfer RNA, and only 5% is Messenger RNA. Messenger RNA is the template for protein synthesis. Since the amount of mRNA is relatively small, affinity chromotography must be performed to purify it.

This technique exploits the structure of mRNA,which is polyadenylated at the 3' end to form a Poly A tail. The Poly(A)n can pair with the complementary base Poly(T)n through the formation of Hydrogen bonds. The Poly(A) region is used to selectively isolate mRNA from the rest of the RNA via affinity chromatography. Only mRNA with Poly A can be bound by Poly T in the column. RNA that lack Poly A tails elute out of the column at high salt concentrations. The mRNA is separated for other RNAs. Then the Poly(A) mRNA can be washed out from column by adding a low salt eluting buffer.

Affinity chromotography is very useful for the purification of RNA and the synthesis of cDNA.

* &lt;font size=3&gt;At the end of the Civil War in mainland China, when Communist forces gained control and established the Peoples Republic of China, Nationalist forces escaped to Taiwan where they re-established the Republic of China (in exile). The first such meter was placed into use in 1949.
* All stamps except Types A1 and PO-A3 are inscribed &quot;REPUBLIC OF CHINA&quot;.
* All stamps including Types A1 and PO-A3 have Chinese inscription &quot;[[File:Taiwan zhong right.jpg|90px]] &quot;, as shown, or with characters reversed with &quot;中&quot; at left.
* Many stamp types were used by both private businesses and post offices and in most cases there is no clear way to tell them apart. 
* Identification numbers found on the meter stamps are not meter numbers but location numbers.
* The stamps are grouped according to appearance of the frank and by function:
:: '''A'''  - Frank upright or square
:: '''B'''  - Horizontal frank with panels or ornaments at both sides
:: '''C'''  - Large horizontal frank without side panels or with ornaments at one side only
:: '''PO''' - Designs used only in post offices
:: '''PP''' - Designs used only for parcel post&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Its linear genome was observed to form a circle via complementary base pairing when entering a host cell. The genome was able to act in such a peculiar manner due to the presence of single stranded areas called cohesive sites (''cos''). These ''cos'' sites are able to base pair, and the nature of these sites are the same as those produced by [[Structural Biochemistry/DNA recombinant techniques/Restriction endonucleases|restriction endonucleases]]. (Ex: ''Eco''R1 produces &quot;sticky ends&quot;). This circular phage DNA is able to recombine with the host cell DNA via attachment sites. Progeny of the phage with the addition of some bacterial gene take place by the [[Structural Biochemistry/DNA recombinant techniques/Plasmid/Lysogenic Pathway|lysogenic pathway]]. What makes lambda phage extremely advantageous is the fact that it can destroy its host ([[Structural Biochemistry/DNA recombinant techniques/Plasmid/Lytic Pathway|lytic pathway]]) or it can become part of its host ([[Structural Biochemistry/DNA recombinant techniques/Plasmid/Lysogenic Pathway|lysogenic pathway]]). Studies on the control of these alternative cycles have been very important for our understanding of the regulation of gene transcription.

Lambda phage is a virus particle consisting of a head made up of double-stranded linear DNA as its genetic material, and a tail. It infects the host cell by injecting its own DNA through the tail at which point the phage will enter the lytic or lysogenic pathway. Large segments of the 48 kilobase pair DNA of the lambda phage are not essential for productive infection and can be replaced by foreign DNA, thus making lambda phage an ideal vector.

[[File:Lambda phage.jpg]]

==History==
Lambda phage was first isolated by Esther Lederberg in 1950 from Escherichia coli. It has been an intensely studied organism, and has been a useful tool in molecular biology. Lambda phage can be used for cloning of recombinant DNA, the use of its site specific recombinase (int) for the shuffling of cloned DNAs by the 'Gateway' method, and in recombineering. The discovery and study of lambda phage led to an understanding of transduction which provides a major mechanism that can explain modes of evolution.

Bacteriophage Lambda was studied by Allan Campbell in 1962 who studied the phage's integration process. He observed that lambda phage had a unique characteristic what some phages would infect and reproduce in some strains of E. coli while other strains seemed immune. Probing further into why this occurred lead to the discovery that the immune strains contained a dormant copy of the phage, but the dormant copy could be activated. Study the phage provided priceless contributions into virus life cycles, the regulation and expression of genetic material, and the mechanism of integration and excision of genetic material.

==Mutant Lambda Phages==
Mutant phages have been genetically designed to make cloning easier. And especially useful one is called lambda(gt)-(lambda)(beta) which contains only two EcoRI cleavage sites instead of the normal five. After cleavage, the middle segment of this phage DNA can be removed leaving 72% of the normal genome length which is too little to be packaged into a lambda particle. Thus, a suitably long DNA insert between the lambda segments of DNA enables a recombinant DNA molecules to be packaged. These modified viruses enter bacteria much more easily than plasmids.

==Genomic Library==
A genomic library is a large collection of DNA fragments. Such libraries assist in identifying DNA fragments that have a gene of interest. Creating a genomic library utilizes lambda phage. First, total genomic DNA is mechanically sheared to produce a random population of overlapping DNA fragments which are separated by gel electrophoresis. All fragments that are about 15 kilobase pairs long are isolated and attached with synthetic linkers to insert into a lambda phage which replicated themselves and then lyse their bacterial hosts. The resulting lysate contains fragments of DNA houssed in virus particles which constitute a genomic library. 

==Restriction &amp; Modification Systems==
Restriction: Phages grown in one bacterial cell fail to grow in other bacterial strains.
The degradation of phage lambda DNA was observed in certain bacterial strains. This was later found to be a result of restriction endonucleases which would cut the phage DNA after detecting it as being foreign. Thus, restriction endonucleases was termed because of its ability to restrict foreign DNA.

Modification: Phages are modified such that they can be grown normally in other bacterial strains.
An example of modification is the methylation of lambda phage DNA so that it would not be cut by restriction endonuclease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Regarding the use of spectral decomposition to compute the state transition matrix &lt;math&gt;e^{\mathbf{A}t}&lt;/math&gt; there's a point which I think is unclear. If a vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenvector of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, then another vector &lt;math&gt;k\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; is also an eigenvector, for a scalar constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Putting this into the spectral decomposition equation, we find that the constant comes to the front of that term of the summation.

I suspect that there's supposed to be a relationship between the right and left eigenvectors in such a way that the constant will be cancelled out when they are multiplied, but I can't seem to find a reference that defines exactly what the relationship is. I think that the matrix of left eigenvectors should be the inverse of the matrix of right eigenvectors, but someone more qualified should check this before it goes into the actual book.

I don't believe the matlab function given to calculate the state transition matrix gives correct values.  I don't believe that this should be included in the section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Pcr_machine.jpg‎|thumb|A PCR machine/Thermal Cycler]]

PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, is a technique that can be used to replicate DNA by many orders of magnitude or create mutations in DNA. PCR is a valuable technique for biochemists.  For example, it allows us to study the effects of genes and segments of DNA by inducing mutations. In addition, because PCR can be used to amplify even a small amount of DNA, it is a useful tool for forensic scientists. PCR amplifies DNA quickly by thermal cycling. With a thermal cycler, temperatures can be changed constantly through many cycles. This allows a thermal cycler to denature double stranded DNA, anneal primers to it, and then activate a DNA polymerase in order to replicate the DNA. By repeating this process multiple times, DNA is replicated exponentially, allowing us to study it further.

The PCR amplification of DNA undergoes three stages:

1. ''DNA Denaturation'': The two DNA strands are separated by heat (94&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C).
 
2. ''Oligonucleotide Annealing'': Two complementary oligonucleotides (primers) are added to each flanking sequence as the heated DNA strands are cooled (50-60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C). 

3. ''DNA Polymerization'': Heat-resistant DNA polymerase catalyzes 5'-3' DNA synthesis (70&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C).

After amplification by PCR, the gene of interest is cleaved by restriction endonucleases and ligated to the plasmid cloning vector.  The recombinant plasmid is subsequently placed in a bacterial host and propagated. 

In addition to DNA amplification, PCR can create mutations and deletions in DNA as well as introduce a restriction endonuclease site.

==History==

[[Image:PCR.svg‎|thumb||''Schematic drawing of the first four PCR cycles:&lt;br /&gt;

1)Denaturing at 96°C.&lt;br /&gt;
2)Annealing at 68°C.&lt;br /&gt;
3)Elongation at 72°C (P=Polymerase).]]

The first cycle is complete. The two resulting DNA strands make up the template DNA for the next cycle, thus doubling the amount of DNA duplicated for each new cycle.

1. Denaturation

DNA denaturation means to heat a double stranded DNA and form two separate single strands.
 
Basically, this process breaks the hydrogen bonds between the double helix bases in order to overcome the energy that keeps the bases so well stacked together. 
Many denaturation techniques exist and are possible. The most popular and used technique is by simply raising the temperature of the DNA above its melting point, Tm. The base pairs are then unstacked and can be monitored spectrophotometrically.
DNA is absorbed very strongly at 260 nm, and as DNA keeps on melting, its absorbance increases because single strands are absorbed at higher wavelengths and then it stays constant once fully separated. This process is called Hypothermic Effect. 
This whole technique can be reversed and therefore DNA can be renatured at a certain amount of time allowing the estimation of base composition according to the time. The main biological reasons for denaturing DNA is for replication and transcription. 

2. Annealing

Separated complementary strands of nucleic acids spontaneously reassociate to form a double helix when the temperature is lowered below Tm. This renaturation process is called annealing. For PCR reactions, the usual annealing time is 30-45 seconds.  Increasing this time by few more minutes does not affect the results of the PCR. On the other hand, as the polymerase has some reduced activity between 45 and 65o C (temperature interval for most annealing processes), longer annealing times may increase the likelihood of unspecific amplification products.
Annealing temperature is one of the most important parameters that need adjustment in the PCR reaction. Additionally, the flexibility of this parameter allows optimization of the reaction in the presence of variable amounts of other ingredients, especially template DNA. Annealing temperature is important in finding and documenting polymorphisms. Slight mismatches, (even 1 base-pair mutations) in one of sequences bound by the two primers used to amplify a DNA locus, can be detected by slight variations in annealing temperature and/or by multiplex PCR.

3. Polymerization

Polymerization is an endemic process which means energy input is required to achieve it. Also required joining of the sugar-phosphates, in addition to the nucleotides. Finally, it requires an enzyme, known as DNA polymerase. Triphosphate nucleotides make the polymerization process possible. These triphosphate nucleotides float freely within the nucleus of the cell, and each DNA base exists in a triphosphate nucleotide form. The energy that is released by the breaking of the triphosphate bond is what provieds the energy for the polymerization of DNA.



PCR was an idea conceived by Kary Mullis in 1983 who, at that time, was an employee at Cetus Corporation in Berkeley, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceisart.com/A_PCR/PCRhistory_2.html |title= History of PCR| publisher=[http://www.scienceisart.com/index.html#anchor] | accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mullis, he got the idea of this technique of DNA amplification while driving his car. Cetus Corporation saw great potential in this method and took Mullis and other scientists off their work to solely concentrate on perfecting PCR. 

These scientists spent a year working on PCR, but they encountered numerous obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.molecularstation.com/pcr/history-of-pcr/ |title= History of PCR| publisher=[http://www.molecularstation.com/] | accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One in particular was the use of DNA polymerase which was originally obtained from E. coli. However, PCR required heating to denature the DNA strands but this heating, in addition, would inactivate the DNA polymerase. Therefore, for each run DNA polymerase had to be added which, in total, took a lot of DNA polymerase to run the entire polymerase chain reaction. However, the discovery of Taq polymerase, which was purified and isolated from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus, led to dramatic improvements in the PCR technique since Taq polymerase is stable under high temperatures thus virtually eliminating the need to add DNA polymerase after each cycle and allowing the technique to be effectively automatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/research/videohistory_catalog9577.html |title= The History of PCR | publisher=[http://siarchives.si.edu/sia/main.html] | accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the results of the first PCR were analyzed using Southern blotting and it was shown that PCR amplified the target sequence. Cloning results also proved that PCR increased this amount while still retaining high accuracy in the final results. The patent for PCR was approved in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/kary-mullis |title= Kary Mullis | publisher=[http://www.answers.com/] | accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of 1985, Cetus started to produce commercial PCR machines and afterwards, PCR began to make its way into forensic science. In 1986, it was used by Edward Blake in the court case &quot;Pennsylvania v. Pestinikas&quot; and in 1989, Alec Jeffreys begins to amplify DNA from old cases thus increasing their sensitivity when tested and allowing innocent prisoners to be set free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/forensic-resources/historical-chronology |title= World of Forensic Science: Historical Chronology | publisher=[http://www.enotes.com/] | accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

For his contributions to DNA-based chemistry and for the development of the PCR technique, Kary Mullis was awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1993/ |title= The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1993 | publisher=[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/] | accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations of PCR==

'''Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR):''' Quantitative PCR is a technique of PCR in which a DNA sample is simultaneously amplified and quantified. The general procedure is the same as the original PCR, however, in qPCR the sample of amplified DNA is detected in real time as the reaction progresses whereas in regular PCR, the sample is measured at the end of the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amethox.com/research/QPCR.htm |title= Quantitative Real-Time PCR| publisher=[http://www.amethox.com/index.htm] |  accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two common methods are used in qPCR which are: (1) a use of fluorescent dyes which bind to any double-stranded piece of DNA (for example, the EvaGreen  dye &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1472-6750-7-76.pdf |title= Characterization of EvaGreen Dye and the implication of its physicochemical properties for qPCR applications| publisher=[http://www.biotium.com] | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2) specific fluorescent labeled probes which are detected only after hybridization with the complementary DNA strand. For both methods, an increase in measured fluorescence is proportional to an increase in DNA sample. This method of PCR is more efficient and precise than regular PCR since detection happens real time and does not require additional time running the sample on a Southern blot. There are many applications for qPCR which include, but are not limited to, the rapid diagnostic of nucleic acid diseases such as cancer and genetic abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thermo.com/com/cda/article/general/1,,20636,00.html |title= ABgene QPCR Overview | publisher=[http://www.thermo.com/com/cda/home/1,,,00.html] | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR):''' Reverse transcription PCR is a technique of PCR to amplify, detect and quantify mRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambion.com/techlib/basics/rtpcr/index.html|title= RT-PCR: The Basics | publisher=[http://www.ambion.com/index.html] | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
PCR is first modified in the beginning by first converting RNA to a cDNA by reverse transcriptase. This part of the reaction may or may not be carried out in the same tube as PCR. The next step follows PCR by denaturing the double stranded cDNA, allowing primers to bind, and activation of the DNA polymerase to amplify the amount of DNA in the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/immunology/Flash/RT_PCR.html|title= RT-PCR Methodology | publisher=[http://www.bio.davidson.edu/] | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like PCR, the products of this reaction may be viewed real time, with fluorescent dyes such as SYBER Green, or the products may be assessed post-reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/71/1/436.pdf|title= Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis of Deformed Wing Virus Infection in Honeybee | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The utility of this reaction is to amplify the amount of RNA in a given sample. In addition, since the products of this reaction is the gene template for which proteins are coded from, this sequence maybe inserted into Prokaryotes for protein production, etc.

'''Touchdown PCR:''' Touchdown PCR is a modification of the original PCR technique in which the reaction is initially run at the temperature at which the annealing primers melt. In subsequent cycles, the temperature is gradually reduced, by one degrees Celsius or so, until a specific temperature, or touchdown temperature, is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcrlinks.com/variants/touchdown.htm|title= TOUCHDOWN PCR | publisher=[http://www.pcrlinks.com/index.html] | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The utility of this technique is that it allows early accumulation of specific products which later serve as templates for later PCR amplification which lowers the non-specific PCR products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natureprotocols.com/2008/08/21/touchdown_pcr_for_increased_sp.php|title= Touchdown PCR for increased specificity and sensitivity in PCR amplification | publisher=[http://www.nature.com/] | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inverse PCR:''' Inverse PCR is a variation of the original PCR technique in which one internal sequence of the DNA to be amplified is known. One of the limitations of the original PCR is that it requires primers complimentary to the end sequences of the DNA to be amplified. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protocol-online.org/prot/Molecular_Biology/PCR/Inverse_PCR/index.html|title= Inverse PCR | publisher=[http://www.protocol-online.org/] | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the utility of this technique is that if only one site is identified, then PCR may still be carried out. This is achieved by digesting the ends of the DNA by a restriction endonuclease and ligating the two free ends of the DNA with a DNA ligase to produce a circular DNA. Then the known internal sequence is cleaved with another restriction endonuclease thereby generating a strand of DNA where the end sequences are known which allows amplification of the target through PCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcrstation.com/inverse-pcr/|title= Inverse PCR | publisher=[http://www.pcrstation.com/] | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA):''' Helicase-Dependent Amplification is a method similar to PCR. However, HDA is different in that it relies on an enzyme helicase to split apart the DNA, rather than heat up DNA to denature it. Therefore, it is a method of PCR which operates at a constant temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcrstation.com/helicase-dependent-amplification/|title=  Helicase Dependent Amplification HDA | publisher=[http://www.pcrstation.com/] | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, the methodology is similar, the helicase enzyme separates the double-stranded DNA into single strands to which primers anneal and the DNA amplified. The utility of this technique is that it may be run almost anywhere, such as at a crime scene, as opposed to PCR which is only feasible in a laboratory setting since it requires large, expensive, and bulky machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmd.amjpathol.org/cgi/content/full/10/5/452|title=Application of Isothermal Helicase-Dependent Amplification with a Disposable Detection Device in a Simple Sensitive Stool Test for Toxigenic Clostridium difficile| publisher=[http://jmd.amjpathol.org/] | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, despite these positive qualities, HDA is not used as much as PCR since most of these types of reactions, whether from a crime scene or from a hospital, are run in labs most of the time. In addition, HDA cannot run as much samples as PCR and HDA is relatively more expensive than PCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicase-dependent_amplification|title=  Helicase-dependent amplification| publisher=[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page] | accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Nested PCR:''' Nested PCR is a variation of PCR in which to minimize the results of primers binding to the wrong places in the DNA sequence thereby generating contamination. This reaction is first performed with a pair of primers that bind to the DNA in various places, but of importance is that they bind on the outside of the sequence of interest to be amplified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcrstation.com/nested-pcr/|title= Nested PCR | publisher=[http://www.pcrstation.com/]  accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the second cycle, a different pair of primers are used to bind to the specific sequence of DNA on the inside of the first two primers and this sequence is amplified. The reasoning behind this technique is that if a random sequence was amplified by the first primers by accident, the probability is very low that an internal sequence between the first primers would be amplified by the second primers thereby effectively minimizing contamination of side reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/method/NestedPCR.html|title=  Nested Primers for PCR| accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

'''Detecting Evolutionary Relationships:''' PCR can be used to amplify a small amount of DNA found in fossils. This amplified DNA can be sequenced. Using the techniques found in bioinformatics, this newly sequenced DNA can be tested for similarity with other ancient organisms as well as modern organisms. These comparisons reveal what modern species the ancient species was a common ancestor of as well as what other ancient species it was closely related to. PCR removes the restriction of bioinformatics only analyzing the DNA of modern organisms and allows distance evolutionary relationships to be more easily identified. &lt;ref name=&quot;Biochemistry by Berg, ch 5, pg 142&quot;&gt;Biochemistry, Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Detecting the Presence of Cancer Cells:''' If it is uncertain whether a trace of cancer cells exists in a tissue sample, the DNA can be isolated from the sample and purified. PCR can be performed on the purified DNA. The amplified DNA can more easily be tested for the presence of certain mutations (in growth genes) known to cause cancer. It isn't a foolproof way to detect cancer (some cancer cells might not have any of the list of &quot;cancer causing mutations&quot;), but the point is that PCR makes testing for the presence of a mutation possible when it would have been too small of a sample otherwise. &lt;ref name=&quot;Biochemistry by Berg, ch 5, pg 142&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Forensic gel.PNG|thumb|Victim's blood on suspect's shirt = GUILTY!! (probably)]]
'''Forensics:''' A small amount of DNA obtained from the somewhere at the crime scene (i.e. blood on a suspect's shirt) can be amplified using PCR and compared with the victim's and suspect's DNA. A fraction of a drop of blood or a single hair might not contain enough DNA for testing without PCR, but PCR makes testing this small amount of DNA possible. Sequencing the DNA is too laborious, so restriction enzymes are used to create a DNA fingerprint. The DNA sample is subjected to one or more restriction enzymes for a set length of time. The restriction enzymes cut the DNA at their recognition sequences, but not at every recognition sequence (they would if there was more time). If the DNA is different, the enzymes will cut different lengths of DNA and if the DNA is the same, the enzymes will cut the same distribution of lengths in both samples. The DNA fragments from each sample are run through a gel and compared. This can provide strong evidence of the innocence or guilt of a suspect. &lt;ref name=&quot;Biochemistry by Berg, ch 5, pg 142&quot; /&gt;

In order to perform PCR, it requires several components and reagents. Firstly, it requires a DNA template that contains the DNA region (target) to be amplified. Secondly, it requires forward and reverse primers complementary to the 3' ends of each strand of the DNA target. These primers can be custom designed and can be used to induce mutations. Thirdly, it requires magnesium Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and a buffer to maintain stable conditions. Instead of magnesium, sometimes manganese Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can be used. Magnesium is preferred over manganese because a higher concentration of manganese increases the error rate during DNA synthesis. The buffer solution provides a suitable chemical environment for optimum activity and stability of the DNA polymerase. Fourthly, it requires deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTP; nucleotides containing triphosphate groups) for the polymerase to use during replication. It is the building-blocks from which the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new strand of DNA. Finally, it requires a temperature stable polymerase to polymerize DNA. PCR is commonly carried out in a reaction volume of 10-200 microliters in small reaction tube in a thermal cycler. The thermal cycler heats and cools the reaction tubes to the desire temperature for each step in PCR. It uses the Peltier effect. which permits both heating and cooling of the reaction tubes by reversing the electric current. The thin walls of the reaction tubes allow for rapid thermal equilibration.

Successfully replicating DNA of interest can be tricky with PCR. This is because great care must be taken to avoid contamination. It is important to ensure the reagants are adequately mixed and stored appropriately and appropriate temperature conditions are selected for the annealing and elongation phases due to primer and polymerase sensitivity and activity at different temperatures. Typically, PCR consists of usually 20-40 repeated temperature changes, called cycles, where each cycles usually contains three steps. It is necessary to perform many cycles because that way the end results will consist mainly of the desired DNA. The temperature used and the length of time they are applied in each cycle depend on the enzyme used for DNA synthesis, the concentration of divalent ions and dNTPs in the reaction, and the melting temperature of the primers.

After the reagants have been mixed in together in PCR tubes (special, thin-wall, eppendorf tubes to allow for efficient conductivity of heat), the thermal cycler must be programed for various times, temperatures, and cycles. Each major step in amplification (denaturing, annealing, and elongation) requires different conditions appropriate for the primers and polymerase being used. The first step is the initialization step. This step heats the reaction to a temperature of 94-98 degrees Celsius. This temperature is held for one to nine minutes. This heating of the DNA causes the DNA to be denatured. The heat disrupts the hydrogen bonds that hold the nitrogenous bases in the double-stranded DNA together, yielding single-stranded DNA molecules. The second step is the annealing step that requires the temperature to be lowered to 50-65 degrees Celsius to allow for annealing of the primers to the single-stranded DNA template. The annealing temperature is typically 2-3 degrees Celsius below the melting temperature of the primers. In the annealing step, the polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA formation. The last step in PCR is the elongation step. This step also occurs at a certain temperature depending on the polymerase being used. Although some polymerases function better at slightly different temperatures, Taq polymerase is commonly used in PCR, thus a temperature of 72 degrees Celsius is used with this enzyme. During this step, the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the DNA template strand by adding dNTPs that are complementary to the template in 5' to 3' direction, condensing the 5'-phosphate group of the dNTPs with the 3'-hydroxyl group at the end of the extending DNA strand. The duration for elongation depends on the DNA polymerase used and on the length of the DNA fragment to be amplified. At its optimum temperature, the DNA polymerase will polymerize a thousand bases per minute. After the last PCR cycle, a single step of final elongation is required to ensure that any remaining single-stranded DNA is fully extended. This step occurs at 70-74 degrees Celsius for 5-15 minutes. If necessary, lowering the temperature to 4-15 degrees Celsius for an indefinite time can allow for short-term storage of the reaction. Furthermore, some steps take longer than others, and each step must be timed appropriately. Once the appropriate conditions have been established, the number of cycles can be set and the PCR run. Through these steps, DNA is readily and quickly amplified. This is because the products of every PCR cycle is used again as a template in the next cycle. The resulting DNA can then be sequenced for accuracy and then studied through other techniques such as Southern blotting or agarose gel electrophoresis. It allows for size separation of the PCR products. The size of PCR products is determined by comparison with a DNA ladder (a molecular weight marker. This DNA ladder contains DNA fragments of known size. It is run on the gel alongside the PCR products to compare the sizes of the PCR products with the sizes on the DNA ladder.

      <text xml:space="preserve">PCR is a useful technique for scientists because it allows for the amplification and mutation of DNA. Through PCR, small quantities of DNA can be replicated by orders of magnitude, not only essentially preserving the sample if successful, but allowing for study on a much larger scale. Without PCR, the samples we could analyze and mutations we could induce and study would be limited by the amount of DNA we had to work with. Through PCR, that DNA is essentially limitless, allowing biochemists to induce various mutations in different genes for further study. 

Through site-directed mutagenesis or customized primers, individual mutations in DNA can be made. By changing the amino acids transcribed from DNA through individual mutations, the importance of those amino acids with respect to gene function can be analyzed. However, this process can be difficult, particularly when genes act in concert (with varying expression with respect to gene activity). The length of time it takes to run a successful PCR and perform other techniques before study can be done (protein expression, isolation, and purification, for example), makes biochemical research time-consuming and difficult. However, PCR, coupled with other biochemical techniques, allows us to analyze the very core of organisms and the processes by which they function.

PCR is a reliable method to detect all mutations associated with genetic diseases, starting from insertion to deletions and much more. It can also be used to detect the presence of unwanted genetic materials, like infections and bacteria. For example, in diagnosis of diseases like AIDS, PCR can be used to detect the small percentage of cells that infected HIV. PCR also allows early diagnosis of unwanted diseases such as leukemia. PCR offers very simple and fast alternative.

== PCR examples in research ==
[[Image:PCRnishapatrick.jpg‎|thumb|PCR run by Nisha Patel, UCSD Pediatrics, Sander Lab]]
PCR is a highly, commonly used tool in research that allows researchers to amplify DNA segments with simple reactions that can be set up and finished within an hour. PCR in research is most used as a test to see if a gene is expressed in vivo. Such examples include PCR of mouse DNA in order to determine what genes that mouse carries. These mice, with specific target genes, can be studied to see the biological effects of such genes. Common PCR protocols in labs today include knockout genotyping, fluorescence genotyping, and mutant genotyping. Researchers can use PCR as a method of searching for genes by using primers that flank the target sequence of the gene along with all other necessary components for PCR. If the gene is present, the primers will bind and amplify the DNA, giving a band of amplified DNA on the agarose gel that will be run. If the gene is not present, the primers will not anneal and no amplification will occur. Amplification can occur in more that one spot in the DNA, that is why researchers can use DNA ladders to compare the relative length of the amplified strand (usually in bp). If the length of the gene is known, then researchers will know which bands to look for and which to possibly ignore. The term possibly ignore is used because PCRs are usually run with the DNA in question as well as controls, which can include DNA positive for the gene, DNA negative for the gene, and only reactants in the PCR reaction other than DNA. If there are bands positive for the gene in both the DNA negative and the only reactants reactions, as well as all other reactions, it is understood that some of the reactants are contaminated with positive DNA and should thus be thrown out and the PCR run again.

This is an example of a gel run using PCR reaction products. The columns on the far left are 100bp ladders which track the movement of segments of 100, 200, 300, etc. base pairs. Each of the wells represents the DNA taken from a mouse. As seen in the picture, some mice lack one of the DNA sequences that would be amplified by use of the primers. Here it is seen how strong of a tool PCR can be in identifying the targeted sequences of DNA in respect to mice which carry those genes. Since mice of different genetic backgrounds can be distinguished, further conclusions about certain genes can be made.

== PCR Applications ==
PCR can be used to isolate genomic DNA. This means that PCR can isolate DNA fragments from genomic DNA by amplifying a specific region of the parent DNA strand. Applications of PCR include generating hybridization probes for Southern and Northern Hybridization, DNA cloning, DNA sequencing, genetic fingerprinting, etc.

'''Forensics'''
An individual DNA profile is highly distinctive. PCR amplification of multiple genes is being used to establish biological parentage in paternity cases. Analyses of blood stains and semen samples by PCR have implicated guilt or innocence in numerous assault and rape cases. The root of a single shed hair or skin found at a crime scene contains enough DNA for typing by PCR. The power of PCR lies in how little DNA strands are required for the process to occur since amplification occurs exponentially. PCR also does not require knowledge of the targeted DNA sequence, rather it only requires the knowledge of the flanking DNA sequence.

'''Evolutionary'''
Large fragments of DNA can remain intact for thousands of years due to DNA's stability. Thus, PCR is ideal for amplifying ancient DNA molecules for evolutionary studies. PCR can also be used to amplify DNA from microorganisms that have not yet been isolated.

== PCR Amplication ==
PCR can analyze extremely small amounts of DNA sample and can amplify targeted regions of the DNA.

== Quantification PCR ==
Quantification PCR is a method that can estimate the amount of sequence will be shown in a sample; this is normally applied to quantitatively to determine levels of gene expression. Real-time PCR is a tool for DNA quantification that measures the DNA product after each PCR amplification cycle.

== PCR to diagnose diseases ==
PCR diagnosis of malignant diseases (i.e. leukemia) are being used routinely in cancer research. PCR assays can detect specific malignant cells at higher folds than any other methods when performing directly on the genomic DNA. This technique can identify mutations of certain growth control genes such as the ras gene. The capacity to greatly amplify selected regions of DNA can also be highly informative in monitoring cancer chemotherapy. PCR tests can detect when chancerous cells have been eliminated as well as detect a relapse.

PCR can reveal the presence of human immunodeficiency virus in people who have not mounted an immune response to this pathogen (which would otherwise be missed with an antibody assay).

Finding Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli in tissue specimens is slow and laborious, but with PCR as few as 10 tubercle bacilli per million human cells can be readily detected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gene expression in organisms is carefully regulated to allow them to adapt the differing conditions and most importantly to prevent wasteful overproduction of unneeded proteins which would make the organism not productive. Organisms regulate expression of their genes for the reasons of developmental changes, cellular specialization and adaptation to the new environment.The expression of genetic information in a given cell or organism is neither random nor fully pre-programmed. The information in an organisms genome must be regulated in an orderly fashion during development and yet must be available to direct the organisms responses to changes in internal and external conditions.

In prokaryotes gene expression is almost entirely controlled at the level of transcription. The expression of specific genes may be actively inhibited or stimulated through the effects of proteins that bind to DNA or RNA. Unlike the prokaryotic control systems the eukaryotic mechanisms must contend with much larger amounts of DNA that is packaged in inaccessible structures. Non expressed DNA is typically highly condensed in a form known as heterochromatin. An extreme example is the complete inactivation of one of the two chromosomes in female mammals known as Barr bodies. 
Virtually every stage of a proteins existence from transcription to posttranslational modification offers opportunities for regulation. Posttranslational control such as alternative mRNA splicing can yield multiple proteins from a single gene. Additional control of eukaryotic gene expression is effected by variable rates of mRNA degradation and regulation of translation initiation. 

There are over 25000 genes in our human genome. Each gene codes for a unique protein. Regulation of the expression of proteins occurs at the level of transcription from DNA in to RNA. The regulation takes place at a specific position on the DNA template, called promoter, this is the place where RNA polymerase looks for and knows where to start the transcription of the gene. Sometimes a group of related genes cluster together to form an operon and copied into mRNA molecule.

For example the genes involved in the transport and breakdown of food is highly regulated genes. The food we eat needs a digestive enzyme in our mouth to breakdown the sugar to facilitate the absorption by our body. The genes which code for these enzymes are not expressed when arabinose is absent, they only expressed when arabinose is present in their environment. When arabinose is present in the environment, bacteria take it up. and the arabinose interacts directly with araC which bound to the DNA. The interaction causes araC to change its shape which in turn promotes the binding of RNA polymerase and the genes are grascribed. the enzymes are produced.They break down arabinose and eventually the arabinose runs out. In the absence of arabinose the araC returns to its original shape and transcription is shut off. This is a good example of gene regulation.

=== SYNOPSIS ===
 #include &lt;linux/buffer_head.h&gt;
 
 '''struct''' [[../buffer_head/]] * __getblk('''struct''' [[../block_device/]] * bdev, [[../sector_t/]] block, '''unsigned''' size);

* bdev: the block device for which to get the buffer head.
* block: the block number of the block to get the buffer head for.
* size: the size of the block (cluster?) in bytes.

=== SHORT DESCRIPTION ===
This function returns a valid buffer head for the given (device|block|size) tuple.

=== FULL DESCRIPTION ===
This function ''always'' returns a valid buffer head for the given (device|block|size) tuple. If the buffer head for that block already existed, it's just returned. If not, it will be created. Passing an illegal block number causes a valid block head for this invalid block to be created. Subsequent actions on that buffer head will then produce appropriate errors.

The buffer heads reference count will have been incremented after this call. Also, it will be added to the least recently used list of the current cpu and hence having its usage count incremented twice not once. However, the second increment is only done to make sure, that the buffer heads in the lru list don't get grabbed. The other lru  functions make sure, that the one increment will be undone at an appropriate time. The other increment must be undone by the caller by a call to [[../brelse|__brelse]](bh).

=== RETURN ===
The buffer head for the given (device|block|size) tuple.

=== ERRATA ===
If __getblk() will lock up the machine if grow_dev_page's try_to_free_buffers() attempt is failing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lessons in Strangeness==

Aside from consolidating chronic pain out of existence, what would happen if we were to do the same with thoughts, dreams and ideas? Thought (especially familiar dreams) can be considered or viewed as position-less or imaginary. Perhaps intangible as thoughts are things. Which means that all thought has the tendency to be transmuted into it’s physical
equivalent. Yet I am convinced that dreams have a definite connection to alternate dimensions.

Those of you who have had these types of dreams know what I am referring to – because they are familiar. People, places and events that you have seen before. Inexplicably you know that you know that you know it and somehow, in someway, you know that that place actually exists even though you cannot verify it. Sound familiar? But what can I assume
about these dreams? Are they actually linked to alternate time-lines? Yet in the real, in our imagination, marked states can be considered as the super-quantum dynamical of all information.

If matter can neither be created nor destroyed then it is in reference only to non-time travitic applications uninvolved in Aloedeology. Yet again, matter has been created and destroyed, in Pair Production and Mutual Annihilation in particle accelerators. A=A. An identity. A thing is itself. A leaf cannot have the same side on both sides. Existence exists therefore non-existence does not exist. Then of course non-A=non-A. It follows then that in order for A to become non-A. There must be an element of subtraction or negation; A – A = ( ). And A – A = 0. If it is true that ( ) = ( ) but if ( ) +A = A, then there is a transition form non-existence to existence with A being existent in reality. Therefore ( )+A = ( )A.


Where non-existence = non-existence, ( ) +A = ( A ). A transfer process of thought into actual could be existent as (A)-(A)=A. 
Thus “subtraction” of non-existent “(A)” into existence can only bring about non-existent (A) into existence. Or (A) –( ⋅ ) ≠ A. Deleting non-existence itself would not do this but deleting non-existence might occur as ( ) – ( ) = ( ).

Therefore non-existence cannot be deleted because there may not be anything to delete. So to delete something or nothing by subtractive measures would not bring it into the real.

The fundamental method, then, by which A in non-existence to become existent is ( A)+A=A.

Again this sets things at a loss because “A” in non-existence does not become existent by “A” in reality – presupposition. ( A) –A - ( ) = A. Where non-existent A is subtracted from non-existence. This explains the basic transfer of thought into the real but does not explain how it occurs. Perhaps (A) +A – ( )=A. For if (a)_ -A-( )=(A), then (A) is subtracted from nothing as ( ) –( )= ( ). Therefore (A) + A – ( ) = A. representing existence symbolically is measured as a dot.

( • ). (A) + ( ⋅ ) A – ( A ). Is this it? Where non-existent (A) + existent A – non-existent A = A existent.

A subtraction from inexistence while simultaneously becoming an addition to existence. Further we can reduce the length of the equation provided that it’s transmutation is expressed in terms of simultaneity in Aloedeology: (A)+ - • A ( A ) =A There are several inexact(s) to these equations and I do not assume them to be absolute. As with the first case A – A = ( A ). Therefore ( A ) should invert (A) – (A) =A. Again this appears not to be the case since subtraction from or to – it not in existence and the ( - ) part is in existence. Hence one cannot subtract from non-existence when that subtraction is executed in existence.This would also lean toward being the case with addition and other operators. So can these operators be non-existent so as to bring about a non-existent ( A ) into the real and actual?



The reason why A – A = ( A ) was because it first started in existence to make A non-existent as well as subtraction which was existent and this is why it worked. If subtraction and other operators are non-existent is it’s existence in no-existence be existent? The answer might appear contradictory but if it is existent in non-existence it cancels not itself but be thought of as hierarchical dimensions it only cancels it’s surrounding cancelers/inexistors and this cancels
it from non-existence into a form of existence hypothetically.

Thus:

( A ) ( - ) ( A ) = A.

Or

A – A = ( A ) ( - ) ( A ) = A.

The first half of the equation suggests that those who “forget” certain ailments are canceling that ailment out, out of existence. This is a good argument as to why certain cures of the mind work and heal bodily ailments. Remembering or repetitive dwelling on troublesome phenomena associated with repetitive addictions and feeding it (especially in one’s mind) indicates,conjuring from a very real vantage point.

Because after calling it to mind – repeatedly it’s essence is forgotten temporarily and this manifests the phenomena more readily. However this does not always work with all ailments and chronic pain such as a tooth that has gone abscess. For one reason or another when the equations are used for thought transfer into the actual they do and do not work all of the time at least what I have found – perhaps another catalyst is needed.

Internal Structure:

We all know about the status quo for interstellar life and the humanitarian vision. But in all actuality space travel may be quite boring and adventure-less. Exploration on other worlds – similar to Gravitation equal to that of Mars (1/3 of that of earth) could be fatal. A walk in the dunes could lead to death, Gravitational differences will become more than evident in such circumstances. Therefore jogging would be walking. But the excitement is there and everyone has a reason to be the captain of the ship. 

But things are not as they would be on television or rocket ships. Even with simulated Gravity using Aloedelogical techniques objects and things isolated from the composition of the interior of the ship itself (i.e.; cups. Lamps, chairs keys, etc) will possess more than a tendency to become displaced, smashed, flattened or even killed. Because they are not a distinct part of or created “from” within the ship’s interior then damage to these items may occur in FTL mode and will have to be replaced.

A craft’s doctor then would, when introduced to his/her office at first might be perplexed as to why he/she is walking into an empty metallic – looking room with perhaps a console protrusion extending out from a nearby wall. This is because everything that the doctor may or may not need is right at his or her disposal because it has to be created from the &lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;ship’s interior, Aloedelogically.

That is, when properly used, the console would generate tables, chairs and other items separate from the ship from the floor or another base. And would still be melded with the floor while protruding from the floor. Unless mobile the necessity to move things about should be
as limited as much as possible due to FTL modes so that items do not get tossed about and destroyed. Not in use those items meld back into the floor. Everything is available from the ship’s interior.


Individuals may require a room where they too can become a part of the interior while in FTL mode, temporarily, so as to avoid being crushed or killed. The entire ship is like this right down to the captain’s chair. Anything not in sync with this may become damaged. Out of FTL
mode, such as orbit, everything returns to normal and operates as if nothing transpired with normal routine.

The bridge is of course something to behold, it is all worked in a mini stellar cartography room. All navigation to and from destinations is done from this bridge. The personal assigned to the bridge, work in a pit area with the captain’s chair elevated to the center. Somewhat
dark is the upper dome where maps of stars and various solar systems can be seen above, directions are calculated and orders are given- all information is detailed here. 

The captain navigates from his swivel chair using a series of keys to choose the destination and alerts crew members of the oncoming trip. The various maps that can be charted depend on the captain’s directives and he may choose his destination at random for exploration purposes or with the aid of his/her crew may get input as to where next he/she may venture. Unless on a scheduled flight and orders to destinations are given to the captain he or she may choose where it is the crew may go to explore new places.

&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Consequently, the incorporation of tables, chairs, and the such-like being generated from the interior, was reported by the now famous UFO abduction case concerning [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Walton Travis Walton]&lt;/i&gt;.

1) Space is the ability to accommodate energy. Real space where the home of the real vacuum exists, possesses limitations created by energy. Prohibition is to a finite propagation velocity
and finite impedance. Space (time) as it is perceived through our five senses is four dimensional.


Consisting of three dimensions of space and one for time. The laws governing forces and the materials bound in obedience to them are known as physics. Matter and conventional energies exist within the physical in actual space. Energies and all forms of resulting matter are limited to influence or be influenced only within degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom are the result of energy established in a spatio-temporal environment that is expressed as positions.


These positions with respect to G with respect to energy in debt to it- is manifest because the energy is not avoiding any loss in energy by renewal of energy (circular) in a simultaneous manner of which is G and Pe ends in position.


2) In light of avoidance in loss in E by renewal of E, any exotic form of non-energy that may be implemented to leave and arrive to any destination in outer space can be prohibited by degrees of freedom with respect to position- established only through the application of non-renewing energy. Hence with respect to ordinary energy manifestations positions, with respect to space-time are an illusion.



3) Gravitons are false assumptions- they cannot exist outside of simulated Gravity. Gravity is inherent to particles in the form of energy in debt to Gravitational potential energy.


3a) Particles may be composed of one or more gyrating photons that constitute electric and magnetic fields which in turn create Gravitation (energy in debt to G) as a cross product of
the two being potentiality.


Where;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{E\times B}{T}\ne G&lt;/math&gt;

But Rather:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{E\times B}{DT}=P&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;DTP = N - S&lt;/math&gt;

Initially we are not concerned with the composition of particles with respect to Quantum engineering or FTL and it’s by-products – all that is needed to know are the dynamics of the particle’s spin properties in relationship to space-time, FTL, and the such like.


4) The speed of light for a photon propagates through space-time from A to B in 1 second over a distance of 186,282.4 miles. Over twice this distance, 372,564.8, the propagation is approximately 2 seconds. Over a distance of 93,141.2 miles propagation occurs in ⅟2 second.


At 1 mile –1 the propagation is equal to 0. At 1 inch-1 the propagation occurs in less than 0 seconds. All of the above is for ω of c about a distance in 1 direction. And applies to straight-lines too. Inversely where Quantum Tunneling is applicable, ν is unequal to D. While reversed, D is variable to a fixed ν=c.


However when mass-less energy remains constant and distance is vast an increase in ν must be executed for every expanse that is unequal to ν, to compensate for the propagation time it takes to cross from A to B as would be in subspace situations where leaving and arriving transpire in less than 0 seconds at 1 inch-1 and below 1 mile-1. This is the reason why Quantum effects break down on larger scales.


5) The RPS of a particle’s spin is dependent upon the distance through which the angular velocity of light reciprocates about. νc=ω. The angular velocity, ω, conserves energy and is entirely momentum and always constant.


6) Weather or not the spin is generated from electric or magnetic forces are not considered, but only the [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v9/i8/p2203_1 GCV].

6a) The RPS is measured by a point on the radius on the outer circumference, where spin is inductive. The point or dot indicating the RPS is entirely imaginary because the reciprocation in reality possesses no actual position(s).


6b) No matter what the circumferential distance is – below 1 mile-1 or 1 inch-1 the leavings and arrivals of the angular velocity of light about the distance always leaves from the now and arrives back to the now. Arrival never transpires before leaving while leaving never arrives
before arrival. Because the GCV of the particle’s spin always leaves and arrives in the now, one can see why all energy and substance surrounding us remains affixed in the present. Equivalent.


6c) Therefore equivalent, the leaving to THE past transpires because arrival to the present has no actual position to arrive at in the now – because the energy as it is measured by an imaginary reference point to indicate the RPS is avoiding loss in energy by renewal of energy.
With no position to arrive at in the now it cannot come to a complete halt – having nowhere to come but back through past nows.


6d) Likewise, such a finite particle, with no position for the energy to arrive at in a past now to THE past – the energy must re-turn to the now via the future (which by the way is probable) to THE present where everything transpires again and again at all reference points indicated
throughout the circumference.


7) In no case can energy be used to cause FTL, time travel or the such-like, because energy when incorporated into the problem of surmounting these obstacles is bound to df and therefore positions by energy being in debt to Pe. Only when Pe is avoided in a closed time – like line can such even be considered as possible.


8) Oscillatory processes fail also to cause FTL even when started from the Quantum level, because for every increase in the energy consumes more space vs. time so it must compensate for it because it is un-equivalent. Also a finite timitic differential in the oscillation exists at the same space coming from opposing direction ending any possibility for GCV or unition (simultaneity) renewal of E and avoidance of position.


9) The solution to &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; in the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}=i&lt;/math&gt;

Is:

:&lt;math&gt;i=\Rho&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;-P=\frac{\pi^{r2}-P_eE_{c2}\pm T}{E\times B}&lt;/math&gt;


10) Time travel for a spinning particle is applicable from the now where the RPS is subdivided to create position in THE past when the spin is systematically slowed.


11) The systematic slowing in the now as energy travels back to previous nows results in an available position for energy to arrive in THE past.


12) Angular acceleration (α) then may enable a means whereby travel back from the past may be seen or disengagement of slowing.


12a) Means through which done.


13) Quantum Nanotechnology is accomplished via the systematic slow-down to provide for arrival in THE past via Aleodeology.


14) Aleodeology is the means of avoiding position in propagation by continually sending a particle back in time before it left ( t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ) but in a different outcome P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; … So as a result the particle can travel along at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in a line in P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; etc, etc…

A quick-zip effect to the intended destination without trouble.


14b) Pre-selected destinations enable rearrangement of particles constituting atoms of molecules.


(Literally the power of shape shifting) we refer to this as Quantum manufacturing.

15) Other benefits of Aleodelogical processes involving time travitics is the unique ability to take an atom or group of atoms and cause them to exist in different outcomes at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt; or the particles and with them the atoms.


With this knowledge, entire star ships can be designed to support crews for interplanetary exploration. And not that much dissimilar from those star-craft extrapolated from popular sci-fi classics.


16) Simulated Gravity may be accomplished on board a craft by revolving 2 or more atoms about each other in different outcomes of the floor surface – a bit more complex but worth the effort.


17) Elimination for the need to land a craft to explore a planet, moon or asteroid is done Aleodelogically to and from the ship and can come in handy. It will also be used to safeguard occupants and objects inside the craft that are not a part of the ship and be tossed about or crushed by FTL travel modes.


18) Emergence into alternate time-lines (AKA Parallel Universes) is seen as arriving in an outcome that is differentiated from THE past or THE future to A past or A future.


&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The particles can exist Aleodelogically to form the atom without having to actually cause Aleodeology to the atom itself. As it would be to manifest a star craft&lt;/i&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Negative Energy==

According to Quantum theory there exists a distinct, albeit small probability that a particle can tunnel it’s way through a barrier. That probability exponentially declines with the barrier’s thickness.

A particle tunneling has to borrow energy to overcome the barrier it is penetrating. In effect the particle’s energy runs an energy deficit while it is tunneling – it possesses a negative kinetic energy. Classically Ke is related to the square of the speed, thus if energy is negative, the speed will be the square root of a negative number. 

Few if any results could come about to bring about negative matter from a Quantum mechanical investigations of Gravity alone. Gravity is inherent to a particle as energy in debt to G. Accordingly there should be two types of mass - the first type positive mass, which retains all the properties of ordinary mass. 

The second type; negative mass differs only in that it’s mass is an inherently negative quantity. Consideration of the Quantum mechanical effects of the existence of these two types of mass is erroneous because their separate existences are not of an &lt;i&gt;isolatable&lt;/i&gt; nature with respect to a single particle.
 
Hypothetically speaking negative mass cannot be plausible without time travel, especially where isolation is concerned, salvaging that back into the positive would prove difficult.

Why negative mass has never been “observed” (not particles) is due to the same reason why Ke and Pe are interdependent, is because of gravity.

Consider a block of cedar. Attach a durable string securely about the block. A sudden jolt up will result in the downward force of Gravity on the mass of the block, snapping the string and hence according to Newton:


                                      F=ma


Consider a door. A knock on the door heeds the attention of a tenant to open it to a familiar guest.



He or she swings the open the door for reception. The door itself is fairly weighty so opening it may prove a bit of a minor problem in opening it, but if timed properly the visitor can push on the
other side aiding in the pull of the door by the tenant aiding in the weight of the door being opened to be reduced to 0 by equal push and pull forces. Whenever such a push- pull system is in play in the propagation of an object – through outer space is FTL then considerable.

 

Initially this is the production of a free-fall geodesic except in the former case the free-fall of an object from a prearranged height by Gravity has no push-pull only a pull from Gravity. In another spotlight one can assume with absolute correctness that time travel is the key to this push-pull interaction– and that without it FTL is not possible because energy possesses no pull.



Potentiality, then, may be said to obtain this key because negative particles either are time travitic or are the expression of avoidance in energy reciprocally. A probabilistic possibility that can still be
further defined as reciprocal loss in energy by renewal of loss in energy.


These possibilities for reciprocal loss in energy diminish by confinement to a set of limitations for every time one becomes established by the interaction of energy with space-time. Without much
elaboration we may assume that such a particle that is all potential avoiding energy by renewal of, are not bound to such prohibitions and may therefore be at them and even exceed them and therefore:

                                  −Ε = − mo&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;


                      -ωΕ + ω − Ε = m − o&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; or m − 1&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;


Reduction of E to produce reciprocal G or potentiality is presumably devoid of position as is reciprocation of energy. The effect would be fascinating anomalies. To get the odds so to speak we must divide by a negative equivalent to the positive.

i.e;


                        186,282.4 (÷)- 186,282.4 = -1

This tells us that in order to bring about the avoidance of energy to result in potential reciprocation renewing to avoid E we must divide the velocity of energy causing RPS about a finite D in 1 direction by a negative energy either present or derived.

Or


                                 (Ε ÷(−Ε)= -1


The division of the negative is one of time.


Where:


                                (Εt ÷ (-Εt)= -1

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Solutions to The Impossibility of Energy Causing FTL==


We know Ke and Pe are interchangeable and neither is isolatable either from another. All measurement originates from one form of energy or another that has the property of materialism. If it is physical, it possesses energy in one form or another, And energy is equivalent to mass.


Where:


                                   Ε=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;



Light speed without intervention in vacuum is mass-less energy with zero mass. Hence it is limited by it’s four velocity motion to the speed of light and no more. Energy, relativistically induced by an
immense power source is simply the sum of a push in 1 direction absent of a pull. Distance plays it’s part in time as a constant varies in ETA by how much it is varied.


Short=quick. 


Long=eventual. 



E is always established from potentiality but never automatically. 



A degree of freedom is a positional relation in which Pe is necessitated to Δ&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; (change in direction). 



MC: Gravity and Pe seems to be united in some way. 



E in it’s establishment and further development necessitates distance over time. Pe simulates Gravity in propagation where E is used by mass. Disengagement of a force is falsely assumed to be Gravity acting on the mass to bring it to rest by virtue of position. Pe or potentiality would then seem to indicate that it is Gravity where:


                             
                                   G = Pe


However:



                                  Pe ≠ G



Pe can only equate to two things, itself and energy or kinetic.



                                 PE = Pe


Therefore:



                               Pe = Ke or E



Thus:



                                   G=E


The term &quot;kinetic energy&quot; stems from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory theory of gases] wherein it is or starts out at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium thermodynamic equilibrium]. Hence energy of motion, in that being kinetic. Whenever Ε is established by an external force (which also originates from Pe and therefore is Ε) (F = Ε). Pe in it’s establishing’s is never absent and therefore can in no sense omit itself. Thus Ε with the presence of Pe – from which it originates – possesses position (Δ&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;) although Δ&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; may never be implemented in constant ν it is always there due to Pe being present with Ε.


Where:


                                 ∫ ΕF = Ρe/P


Now while all this originally stems from gravity, the oversight comes from the fact that Pe and Ke are not actually interchangeable where one disappears in the presence of the other, but in relationship to either’s establishment of motion over time one is in debt to the other. Since F = Ε also then it becomes easy to say how can energy overcome energy to cause FTL?

It cannot and especially when that motion indebted to it’s counterpart is a force that all consists of a push absent of any pull. Hence relativistics. Thus due to Ke indebted to Pe in a push, relativistically,

Ke is always in debt to Pe and Pe is all potential by virtue of position(s). This is evident from consideration of rapidly rotating rings generated from laser light. The analogy is seen in ω = c
about a fixed D. As you can see a reference point placed on the outer circumference indicates the RPS that the ω of c repeats at in so many seconds –


[[File:Df_face_1_Image37.png|thumb|300px|'''Referance''']]



depending on D in 1d. But no actual position exist in the rapid repetitions of the light ring – hence any actual position that may exist in the light ring’s energy is purely one of conjecture and therefore purely imaginary. Constant change in direction occurs for c to give angular velocity. Tangents transpire for slower objects not duplicating the repeats and eject. If the circumference of the light ring’s distance is shrunk the angular velocity of c traverses D faster and with it the loss in energy reduces depending on the RPS of Ε renewing itself about D. 


As it becomes more finite at specific distances the loss in Ε becomes negligible and then proceeds to become null by renewal but always remains in the present or the now via global causality violation (GCV) because the RPS of the energy’s renewal avoiding loss in Ε possesses no actual position. So initially, because no actual position exists the constant change in direction avoids position by renewal of Ε about the finite D in 1 d. So it is one of time. If the light ring is broken two positions are created which at the same ν would cause a change in d at the ends forcing and oscillation provided two barriers.


When the bend is straightened out we can see that the renewal ends because positions were created to form a line-segment. Now two directions exits.



[[File:Straightened_Bend_Image38.png|thumb|300px|'''Straightned Bend''']]



Because renewal has ended and oscillation is evident renewal back upon itself cannot occur because ends split at either end causing a timitic difference – that no matter how finite still exists.

Removal of one barrier allows the oscillation to escape in one direction and since the propagation is non- re-establishing, it cannot avoid position because the energy is not avoiding loss in energy
by renewal in energy, which is timitic. Deriving from RPS to the line- segment, infinite chains of them are not appropriate. Hence we have no RPS in altering our perspective so we have no RPS – but we have t and Ε. 

And even with an oscillation at a finite distance a small time in the same space coming from opposite directions that is not equivalent and therefore no simultaneity and thus no renewal in energy.


Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{mc^2}{Es}=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{Pe\longrightarrow P}{t_1-t_0}&lt;/math&gt;


We conclude therefore that energy is prohibited by itself by non-repetitious renewal of energy in a straight – line and that because renewal of Ε cannot avoid Pe/G in a straight – line and hence positions in relationship to Pe/G result. Hence FTL cannot transpire and therefore we conclude that whenever energy is established in space-time which does not renew to avoid positions, degrees of freedom result to constrain the energy from going beyond them-timitically. In other words energy causes positions. 


This energy in straight-line traversement cannot cause time travel. In it’s absence however positions do not result and therefore energy in relationship to space-time positions are an illusion.

[[Image:Ecl current curves 1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;The fundamental idea behind ECL.&lt;/center&gt;]]__TOC__


&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Revealing the basic idea ==

ECL gates are maybe the oddest logic circuits that arouse many questions. For example, in contrast to other logic gates, they are based on a differential amplifier... but why? What problem does it solve in these circuits? They say the differential amplifier acts here as a current steering switch. Well, it steers... but we want to know why the emitter current is steered between the two legs; with what purpose the current is steered. To answer these questions, we have first to show what the fundamental problem of ordinary logic circuits is and then to show how this problem is solved in ECL.

The fundamental idea behind ECL is not ''differential amplifier'' or ''current steering'' although, in the middle of transition, the circuit is exactly a differential amplifier (an emitter-coupled amplifier) that steers the current between the legs. ''Differential amplifier'', ''emitter-coupled amplifier'' and ''current steering'' are misleading concepts in explaining ECL circuits. They cannot explain what fundamental problem ECL has solved as they focus our attention to the middle part of the transition where actually there is no any problem! In this area, the transistors of all the ordinary logic circuits (RTL, DCTL, DTL and TTL) work perfect as common-emitter stages in active regime. If we were staying in this area, there was no any need to replace them with this more sophisticated and odd 3-component structure figuratively named ''long-tailed pair'' as it would do the same - it would work as the same common-emitter stage!

=== The problem of saturation ===

A problem appears when the input voltage approaches the high threshold (logical &quot;1&quot;) and the transistors of the ordinary logic circuits (RTL, DCTL, DTL and TTL) saturate; as a result, they work slowly. But, as curious readers would think, the differential (emitter-coupled) amplifier couldn't solve this problem as, in this area, the reference transistor T3 is cut-off and the differential amplifier is not an amplifier. In actul fact, the long-tailed pair is cut in two and this structure is no more a differential amplifier; its two new parts are something else. So, the paradox of this classic viewpoint is that we use a differential amplifier where actually it is not a differential amplifier!

'''Saturation is the fundamental problem that ECL circuits solve''' at high input voltage (logical &quot;1&quot;). This and only this is the amazing feature of ECL; the other advantages (as the presence of two inverse outputs) are inessential. So, it is our primary duty to show in this page the basic idea (the clever trick, the circuit solution, the remedy...) that is used to prevent saturation. But how can we prevent saturation? Let's see and compare various anti-saturation techniques.

=== How to prevent saturation: ===

We can drive the transistor from the side of the base and from the side of the emitter. So, we may prevent saturation indirectly from the side of the base by limiting the base current or directly from the side of the emitter by limiting the very collector current.

==== ...from the side of the base... ====

We have two techniques for limiting the base current that require the presence of a base resistor (i.e., they are inappropriate for direct-coupled circuits).

*The simplest and obvious solution is ''to decrease the base current by increasing the base resistance''. But the large tolerances of β make this approach unrealizable [http://www.physics.dcu.ie/~bl/digi/unitd04.pdf] as the collector current and the point of saturation will depend on the particular transistor.

*Another but reliable and wide used ''β-independent'' technique for preventing saturation is ''to detract the excessive base current by a diode negative feedback'' (connecting a Schottky diode between the collector and the base). Until the transistor is in active mode, the diode is cut-off and does not affect the base current. When it approaches the saturation point, the diode turns on and deprives the excessive base current.

==== ...from the side of the emitter. ====

Finally, we may try to avoid saturation by ''limiting the very collector (emitter) current'' and thus we will finally arrive at ECL. But we cannot set the desired emitter current in a common-emitter stage (DCTL) simply by inserting a constant current source (or, in the simpler case, an ohmic resistor) between the emitter and ground as we will not be able to control at all (or slightly, in the case of the resistor) the collector current from the base. Why? The answer is that the current source (the emitter resistor) will introduce series negative feedback and the common-emitter amplifying stage will transmute into a stage with emitter degeneration. As a result, when we change the input base voltage to change the collector current, the transistor changes in the same manner its emitter voltage and we do... nothing:( Figuratively speaking, when we &quot;move&quot; the base voltage, the transistor &quot;moves&quot; in the same manner its emitter voltage (it operates as an emitter follower). The emitter voltage has become &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;pliable&quot;, &quot;movable&quot;...; but to control the collector current the emitter voltage has to be &quot;hard&quot;, steady, fixed...

This is a fundamental problem of analog circuit design - how to set the desired collector current (the quiescent point) from the emitter without losing control from the base. Or, in other words, how to make the emitter voltage &quot;soft&quot; for the undesired influences and &quot;hard&quot; for the useful input voltage applied to the base. Typical examples: an AC amplifier with emitter degeneration suppresses the slow DC variations and amplifies rapidly changing AC input variations; a differential transistor amplifier suppresses common-mode signals and amplifies differential input signals; finally, an '''''ECL gate suppresses the input voltage variations near to the high threshold (input logical &quot;1&quot;) and amplifies them significantly during the transition'''''. It is clear that there is some common powerful idea in these apparently different circuits... What is it?

=== Arriving at powerful ECL idea ===

[[Image:Ecl current curves 1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Revealing the basic idea behind ECL by showing the circuit structure and collector currents of the emitter-coupled pair for the three states]]

Obviously, to make the emitter voltage &quot;soft&quot;, we have to insert a constant current source (actully, a current-stable element) and v.v., to make the emitter voltage &quot;hard&quot;, we have to insert a constant voltage source (a voltage-stable element). Instead to replace the current source with a voltage source we may just connect the voltage source in parallel to the current source as it will define the voltage across the combination of two elements. In the first two examples above, the voltage sources are permanently connected to the current ones but they appear only at useful input signals. In the AC amplifier, the bypass emitter capacitor follows the slow DC variations and does not affect the current source; but it begins acting as a constant voltage source at rapidly changing AC input variations. In the differential amplifier, the right emitter voltage follows the left one at common-mode and does not affect the current source; but it becomes steady (or opposite changing) at single-ended (or differential) mode. '''''In ECL gate, solely the constant current source is connected in the emitter when the input voltage is near to the high threshold (input logical &quot;1&quot;); both the constant current source and the constant voltage source are connected in the emitter during the transition''''' (the sources are commutated by the transistor's base-emitter &quot;diode switches&quot; S1 and S2 on the picture). Let's consider the three possible configurations that we may observe in ECL operation at the possible input voltages.

#'''V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (logical &quot;0&quot;).''' T1 is cut off; V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 V and does not depend on V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. Both the current source (R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) and the voltage source (T3) are disconnected from the input part (but they are connected to each other).
#'''V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; (transition).''' T1 operates in active regime (common-emitter configuration) with both the parallel connected current source (R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) and voltage source (T3) inserted in its emitter. There is no negative feedback. V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; depends significantly on V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; since the voltage source dominates over the current one and fixes T1's emitter voltage (it is &quot;hard&quot;).
#'''V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; (logical &quot;1&quot;).''' T3 is cut off and there is no voltage source. Only the current source (R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) is connected in T1's emitter (emitter degeneration). There is a series negative feeddback. V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and the collector current does not depend at all (in the case of constant current source) or depends slightly (in the case of emitter resistor) on V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; since T1's emitter voltage is &quot;soft&quot;.

Finally, let's say the basic idea behind ECL with one sentence:

'''''ECL is based on a transistor stage with switchable voltage and current emitter sources: at low input voltage, the sources are disconnected from the emitter; during the transition, both the voltage and current source are connected; at high input voltage, only the current source is connected to the emitter.'''''

== How the powerful ECL idea is implemented ==

[[Image:ECL_structure_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|A typical ECL circuit diagram based on  Motorola's [[:File:ECL.svg|MECL 10k]].]]

The powerful ECL idea above may be realized by an emitter-coupled (&quot;long-tailed&quot;) pair. Look at the picture that represents a generalized circuit diagram of a typical ECL circuit. It differs slightly from the particular [[:File:ECL.svg|MECL 10k]] (the additional reference emitter follower Q4 is omitted and additional resistors are connected in the emitters of the output transistors). The left part consists of two parallel-connected input transistors T1 and T2 (an exemplary two-input gate is considered) implementing NOR logic. The base voltage of the right transistor T3 is held fixed  by a reference voltage source - the voltage divider with a diode thermal compensation (R1, R2, D1 and D2); thus the emitter voltages are kept relatively steady. As a result, the common emitter resistor acts nearly as a current source. The output voltages at the collector load resistors R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; are shifted and buffered to the inverting and non-inverting outputs by the emitter followers T4 and T5. The output emitter resistors R&lt;sub&gt;E4&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;E5&lt;/sub&gt; do not exist in all versions of ECL.

== Scrutinizing the ECL operation ==

Let's assume we investigate an ECL inverter: the input voltage is applied to T1's base and T2's input is unused (T2 does not exist). Assume also the circuit has low voltage threshold V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.7 V and high voltage threshold V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.9 V that are situated symmetrically (±0.4 V) with respect to the reference voltage V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.3 V.

Let's arrange uniformly the circuit components on the circuit diagram above and stretch it so that it to fill out the drawing. Then, to [[Circuit Idea/Philosophy#Visualisation|visualize]] the invisible electrical attributes, let's overlay a picture of voltage and current relief. In this attractive presentation, voltages and voltage drops are represented by red colored bars, whose heights are proportional to the corresponding voltage magnitudes (an association with a water column); currents are represented by green colored loops with corresponding topology and thickness that is proportional to the magnitude of the current (an association with a water flow). Having a look at this picture, you can instantly get a notion of how &quot;high&quot; voltages (drops) are and how they are related; you can see how big currents are and how they flow. 

=== Below the low voltage threshold ===

Actually, this situation will never occur if the circuit is driven by another identical ECL circuit; it will occur only if the circuit is driven by an input voltage source with lower voltage than the low voltage threshold. But let's consider it; it is still interesting.

Imagine the input voltage has got down vastly below the low voltage threshold V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g., we have connected T1 base to V&lt;sub&gt;EE&lt;/sub&gt; = -5.2 V). At this stage, think of the voltage divider R1-R2 and the emitter follower T3 as of a voltage source (voltage stabilizer) that fixes T1 emitter voltage at V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE3&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.3 - 0.7 = -2 V. As a result, T1 base-emitter junction  becomes backward biased (V&lt;sub&gt;BE1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;EE&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = -5.2 + 2 = -3.2 V); T1 is cut off and its collector voltage is almost 0 V. If we continue decreasing the input voltage, at given point a zener breakdown will occur. T1 will begin &quot;pulling-down&quot; T3 emitter voltage (a common-base configuration). As a result, T3 collector current/voltage will begin increasing/decreasing rapidly. 

In this state, the circuit does not consume a current from the previous stage since T1 base-emitter voltage is less than the cut-in voltage or T1 base-emitter junction is backward biased. So, the input resistance is extremely high.

=== Low input voltage (logical &quot;0&quot;) ===

[[Image:ECL_logical0_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Visualizing what voltages are and where currents flow in ECL circuit at low input voltage (logical &quot;0&quot;).]]

'''Left part.''' Now imagine our circuit is driven by another identical ECL circuit whose output stage (the emitter follower T5') has placed low input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.7 V at T1 base. Its base-emitter voltage is V&lt;sub&gt;BE1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.7 + 2 = 0.3 V; T1 is cut off and its collector voltage is almost 0 V. The T4 base current flows through R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; and creates only a small voltage drop about V&lt;sub&gt;Rc1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2 V. So, the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 - V&lt;sub&gt;Rc1&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE4&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.2 - 0.7 = -0.9 V (logical 1&quot;) and does not depend on the gate input voltage. The left part of the long-tailed pair is disconnected from the right part and does not affect it.

In this state, the circuit does not consume a current from the previous stage since T1 base-emitter voltage is less than the cut-in voltage. So, the input resistance is high. 

'''Right part.''' Now, think of the voltage divider R1-R2, the emitter follower T3 and the emitter resistor R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; as a current source passing a current I&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE3&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; through the T3 collector resistor R&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; (this current will determine the maximum T1 collector current in the [[#High input voltage (logical &quot;1&quot;)|next state]] when it will be steered to flow through T1; so, it has to be lower than T1 saturation current to prevent saturation). Or, if you prefer, think of the combination R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, T3 and R&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; as of a common-emitter amplifier (actually, it is not an amplifier but an attenuator with K = Rc3/Re &lt; 1) with emitter degeneration driven by the constant voltage V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. The resistance R&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; (245 Ω) is chosen so that, at the reference input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.3 V, the T3 collector current to create voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;Rc3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 V across it. So, the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 - V&lt;sub&gt;Rc3&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE5&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 - 1 - 0.7 = -1.7 V (logical &quot;0&quot;). The voltage drop across T3 (V&lt;sub&gt;CE3&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = -1 + 2 = 1 V) is high enough to keep T3 in the active region. The output voltage depends on the resistances R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;, R1 and R2 and will vary if they vary. But these variations will not accumulate after next several stages since the input transistor T1 (T2) of the next ECL gate will be cut off and its collector voltage (accordingly, the output voltage  V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) will not depend on the gate input voltage. T3 collector voltage (accordingly, the output voltage  V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;) of the next gate will not depend on the gate input voltage as well; it will depend on its reference voltage.

=== Low-to-high transition ===

Now imagine the input voltage begins rising over the low threshold V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.7 V. T1 begins opening; it increases its emitter current and voltage drop across R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;. Figuratively speaking, T1 begins &quot;pulling up&quot; T3 emitter:) thus closing gradually T3 and taking bit by bit its current. The situation is very interesting and it is worth to be generalized as other legendary circuits (e.g., common-base amplifying stage) are based on the same idea.

[[Image:ECL_transition_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Visualizing what voltages are and where currents flow in ECL circuit during the transition.]]

During the transition, two voltage sources (more precisely, two voltage-stable elements) are connected in parallel (T1 emitter follower from the left side and T3 emitter follower from the right side) and are supplied by a common current source (the emitter resistor R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; supplied by V&lt;sub&gt;EE&lt;/sub&gt;). Figuratively speaking, the two voltage sources are in conflict:) as the right voltage source does its best to keep a steady emitter voltage while the left voltage source tries to increase it. Note these voltage sources are negative feedback systems that react to any intervention applied to their outputs. So, when T1 begins opening to increase its emitter current and emitter voltage, as an answer, T3 begins closing to lower its emitter current and accordingly to decrease the emitter voltage. As a result, ''the collector current redirects (fades) rapidly from the right to the left side at approximately constant emitter voltage''.

During the middle of transition the input resistance is low since the circuit behaves as a common-emitter stage with relatively steady emitter voltage. There is no (it is slight enough) negative feedback in the input stage since there is a small emitter resistance.

Now look at the picture [[#Arriving at powerful ECL idea|above]] to see how the two collector currents were changing during the transition. At the middle area, the two currents change (fade) rapidly. Approaching the high threshold V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.9 V, T3 collector current becomes almost zero while T1 collector current begins changing slowly. How do we explain this behavior? Let's try answering this question.''

During the transition, the right (reference) emitter follower T3 is connected to T1 emitter and fixes its voltage (makes it &quot;stiff&quot;, &quot;hard&quot;, stable...)  Figuratively speaking, the reference emitter follower T3 shorts the emitter resistance during the transition. So, there is no negative feedback in the input stage and it acts almost as a CE amplifier with high gain (transconductance G). At the end of the transition, the reference emitter follower T3 &quot;unhooks&quot; from T1 emitter; the emitter resistor &quot;appears&quot; and introduces a series negative feedback (the so-called ''emitter degeneration''). The input stage already acts as a real CC amplifier (emitter follower) with &quot;soft&quot; emitter voltage that follows the input one. As a result, the T1 collector current becomes I&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;RE&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;RE5'&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE1&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; and its curve begins loosing its nerve:) Accordingly, V&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; continues changing slowly (&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;'s logical &quot;0&quot; depends slightly on the input voltage). Note there is no such a problem with T3 collector current in the beginning of transition as it is set by the steady reference voltage (Y's logical &quot;0&quot; does not depend on the input voltage).

If we are curious and penetrative enough, we may see the same trick ('''''connecting in parallel two voltage-stable elements with different thresholds to redirect the current to the element with the lower threshold''''') in many other circuits. For example, when we ground a TTL (or DTL) input, we connect one base-emitter junction (of the multiple-emitter transistor) in parallel to two series-connected junctions (the base-collector junction of the multiple-emitter transistor and the base-emitter junction of the second transistor); as a result, the input single junction sinks all the base curent. The same trick is applied in the [[:File:7400 Circuit.svg|TTL totem-pole output stage]] where, at output logical &quot;0&quot;, the transistor V2 connects the V4 base-emitter junction in parallel to the series-connected V3 base-emitter junction and deliberately inserted V5 junction; as a result, the single V4 base-emitter junction deprives all the V3 base curent. This trick can be easily demonstrated by connecting in parallel different LEDs as they show where current flows and how big they are without connecting an ammeter. Imagine we have handful of different colored LEDs. Let's connect consecutively a 2 V red LED to the same 2 V red (green, yellow) LED, then to a 3 V blue LED and finally, to a composed 4 V &quot;LED&quot; (two connected in series 2 V red LEDs). We will be deeply impressed when see how the single red LED extinguishes LEDs or combination of LEDs having higher forward voltage.

=== High input voltage (logical &quot;1&quot;) ===

At the end of the transition, when the input voltage reaches the high threshold V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.7 V, all the T3 collector current is taken by T1. This is its maximum collector current that is lower than its saturation current I&lt;sub&gt;SAT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;EE&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) and T1 is prevented against saturation. Note '''''the final collector current does not depend on T1's β (on particualar transistor). It depends only on V&lt;sub&gt;EE&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; and this is the benefit of using the powerful current steering idea here!'''''

[[Image:ECL_logical1_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Visualizing what voltages are and where currents flow in ECL circuit at high input voltage (logical &quot;1&quot;).]]

'''Left part.''' The preceding output stage (the emitter follower T5') has already set high input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.9 V at T1 base. As [[#Low input voltage (logical &quot;0&quot;)|above]], you may think of the emitter follower T1 and the emitter resistor R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; as a voltage-controlled current source (voltage-to-current converter or a transconductance amplifier) passing a current I&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;RE5'&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE1&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; through the collector resistor R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt;. Or you may think again of the combination R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, T1 and R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; as of a common-emitter amplifier (as above, it is sooner an attenuator with K = Rc1/Re &lt; 1) with emitter degeneration driven by the constant voltage V&lt;sub&gt;RE5'&lt;/sub&gt;. The resistance R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; (220 Ω) is chosen so that, at high input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.9 V, the T1 collector current to create voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;Rc1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 V across it. So, the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;  = 0 - V&lt;sub&gt;Rc1&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE4&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 - 1 - 0.7 = -1.7 V (logical &quot;0&quot;). The voltage drop across T1 is V&lt;sub&gt;CE1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = - 1 + 1.6 = 0.6 V and the transistor is still not saturated. The output voltage depends on the resistances R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; and the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;; so, it will vary if they vary. As Rc1/Re = 0.22 the output voltage depends slightly on the input voltage (it won't depend at all if we replace R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; by a constant current source). But again, as above, these variations will not accumulate after next several stages since the input transistor T1 (T2) of the next ECL gate will be cut off and its collector voltage (accordingly, the output voltage  V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) will not depend on the gate input voltage. T3 collector voltage (accordingly, the output voltage  V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;) of the next gate will not depend on the gate input voltage as well; it will depend on its reference voltage.

At this stage, the input resistance becomes very high since the circuit begins acting as emitter follower (common-collector stage).

'''Right part.''' At this point, the input emitter follower T1 has &quot;pulled-up&quot; the T3 emitter to a level of V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.6 V. As a result, the base-emitter voltage of T3 is V&lt;sub&gt;BE3&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.3 + 1.6 = 0.3 V; so, T3 is cut off and its collector voltage is almost 0 V. Only the T5 base current flows through R&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt; and creates small voltage drop about V&lt;sub&gt;Rc3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2 V. So, the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 - V&lt;sub&gt;Rc3&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;BE5&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.2 - 0.7 = -0.9 V (logical 1&quot;) and does not depend on the gate input voltage. The right part of the long-tailed pair is disconnected from the left part and does not affect it.

=== Above the high voltage threshold ===

Actully, this situation will never occur if the circuit is driven by the same ECL circuit; it will occur only if the circuit is driven by an input voltage source with higher voltage than the high voltage threshold. But let's consider it; it is still interesting.

If we continue increasing the input voltage above this level (e.g., if we connect T1 base to ground or to a positive voltage source), T1 will saturate presently. The collector and emitter points join and the input voltage transfers directly through the forward-biased T1 base-emitter and base-collector junctions to this point; accordinghly, V&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; follows V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;'s variations and the current through R&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; begins decreasing. The input part behaves as a voltage divider affected in its output; so, the input resistance becomes relatively low again (R&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = Rc1||Re).

Nevertheless, T1 continues &quot;moving up&quot; T3 emitter. After the point where V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.6 V, T3 base-emitter junction becomes backward biased and, at given point, a zener breakdown occurs.

------------------------------------------------


*In this respect some equations may be “substituted” with various symbols, which possess the same meaning or be more meaningful.


1. Such is that with force. Force is assumed as an external energy created by the manual input of energy. I.e.; The displacement of a coffee cup across the table with one’s finger.



With no energy to produce the force there can be no displacement of the coffee cup, hence F is interchangeable with energy because it originates from Pe. Hence Ε=ma where Ε=F, F≠Ε, lest causality violation.




2. Acceleration, &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, is nothing more than the consequence of increased inputs of force behind a body of mass (pushing) (the input of more energy to produce work or to impart power) in a repetitive manner to result in a “change-in” ( Δ ) velocity to a top velocity,
new velocity, or constantly changing velocity. The repetitiousness involves the repeat in positive changes-in force by positive increases in the manual amount of input of energy.




The output is the incrementation of the energy’s power to cause the force to do more work in pushing the body of mass in 1 direction in the absence of a pull – and not in resistance to Gravitation but in resistance to it’s own potential energy…timitically.




Hence:

                           

                             Δν=a, ΕΡ=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;




The result is, then one of repetitiousness energy enhancements bound to position timitically, forthwith because in 1 direction the energy does not renew itself to avoid loss in itself.



Although suggestive of Quantum time travel in pushing in a straight-line the increase in speed results in the source becoming disabled from it itself moving outside of the now.



Hence a manually established limit for both. Automatically perhaps via communication provided some program of attributes of unknown origin. Oscillatory maintaining futility also due to arrival at the same space possessing finite timitic differences coming from opposing directions. 



We have therefore an equation that suggests that in the establishment(s) of energy, position results to prohibit FTL not alone due to PE, but also in the fact of an absence of pull in externally induced push through the manual inputs of repetitive energy with respect to force.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta v_1-v_0}{Et Dd_1}=f_{(E)}\int_{D^{\infty} }^t m\frac{\lambda=h/v}{\sqrt{\Delta E_k \div (-E_p)} }=p&lt;/math&gt;


While this particular equation may be incomplete what it essentially means is that the energy propagating a mass (m), relativistically over time in Δν, forces a push absent of pull to be indebted to potential energy at a Quantum level, thereby producing positions by the
establishments of energy indebted to Pe. 



If Ε were not in-debt to Pe/G (that is to insinuate a pull with a push or a complete avoidance of Pe via renewal of Ε - timitically, then the assumption of Gravitation being in fact indebtedness to Pe/G would cease and positions related to it would automatically or otherwise disappear. Since positions is a constraint set upon the degrees of freedom upon a mass it follows that without the indebtedness of Ε to Pe/G that in it’s presence energy establishments correspond to the manifestation of positions directly related to &lt;i&gt;df&lt;/i&gt;. 



And that in its absence the manifestation of positions directly related to df cannot constrain a body of mass to slower than light velocities revealing that in light of mass energy in-debt to Pe/G manifesting positions, positional relations prohibiting FTL via relativistic energy establishments are nothing more than an illusion.

==Free Fall==


Free fall is different. An object released from a considerable height is reversed to that OF A FORCE. Where a push is a pull. If both a pull and an equal push, m would equal 0.


==Outer Space==


In the example of free-space a body of mass is weightless. However free to wonder upon the application of an external force projects it into various stages of tumblings. 

Once the action is introduced it may do so add infinitum provided it does not re-enter the atmosphere of a larger mass. Or it may be accelerated as it passes by certain spheres. Pulsed, it can ascertain rapid velocities with minimal energy input. However with nothing to grapple with in free space an ending position does not present itself as an opportunity for it to end Pe in position. Or come to rest. But Pe is still present only that now deceleration is required to bring it to a stop once the mass’s energy has become initialized – neither to deceleration or acceleration. It remains constant in v provided no other external forces are applied to it. Δ&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; is present or it could not tumble in various outcomes.

 
So an oscillation about a circumference would still experience Δd indicating position and hence Pe/G and thereby &lt;i&gt;df&lt;/i&gt;. So the same physics apply only that it is maintained without the intervention of either –Ε or +Ε. warping space would then be easier in pulses – from the now where ΔD = Δ&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; is concerned.

(Ε ÷ (Ε−)) = A constant showing that whenever Ε is established by a manual, external force (a push absent of a pull or a pull (free fall) absent of a push)) Ε is indebt to Pe and in relativistics.

Where: (Εt ÷ (−Εt)) = -1. In effect the indebtedness of Ε by Pe/G in it’s establishment is a negative value undetectable in E as it would seem to cause Pe/G to be assumed as “disappearing”, when in actuality Ke and Pe/G are not isolatable from each other. 


By way of various examples throughout this book and from examples involved in rapid reciprocation at c about specific distances it be comes apparent that energy in debt to G is in fact the source of Gravitation. Although the term itself is a misinterpretation to locate Gravity in relationship to mass in space-time there is none in
space-time itself but only results in establishments of Ε when it is in debt to G. When Ε is not in-debt to G, position is eliminated and therefore the pull upon mass when force becomes or is applied in opposition to a pull or visa-verse. 


In light of Ε in-debt to G whenever Ε becomes established, accumulated, uniform, increased, position(s) and therefore degrees of freedom (the absence of time travel) are interpreted as apparent as being illusionary with respect to Ε in-debt to G in normal relativistic establishments in real space (time).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following sections have been removed from the book for the reasons stated:

==Scripting==

Is there a way to compile a automation script, something like:
&lt;pre&gt;
PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()

dim plog as boolean

if plog = true then
   SHELL &quot;poff&quot;
else
   SHELL &quot;pon dsl-provider&quot;
end if

END&lt;/pre&gt;

This appears to be a question of unknown context. Ask this in alt.comp.lang.gambas for clarification and resolution. - Mark Hobley

==Gambas without KDE==

Is there a way to make a gambas application act as a shell for a user? I need some users to turn on the PC, logon and fall directly into a Gambas program, without any posibility of using any other thing, not even the desktop. When they quit the program they must be logged out.

I will research a solution to this. Obviously, we need to ensure that the user logs in on an X11 capable terminal, and we need some sort of wrapper that will
start the X11 engine, run the gambas application, and then exit. In the meantime ask on alt.comp.lang.gambas - Mark Hobley</text>

[[File:OpenSCAD-logo.png|200px|right]]

== Introduction ==
&lt;section begin=Introduction /&gt;
'''OpenSCAD''' is a software for creating solid 3D CAD objects. &lt;br&gt;
It is [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html free software] and available for [http://www.gnu.org/ GNU/Linux], MS Windows and Apple OS X.

Unlike most free software for creating 3D models (such as the well-known application [http://www.blender.org/ Blender]), OpenSCAD does not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling, but instead focuses on the CAD aspects. So it might be the application you are looking for when you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts, but probably is not what you are looking for when you are more interested in creating computer-animated movies.

OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead it is something like a 3D interpreter that reads in a script file that describes the object and renders the 3D model from the script file. This gives you (the designer) full control over the modelling process and enables you to easily change any step in the modelling process, or even to produce designs that are defined by configurable parameters.

OpenSCAD provides two main modelling techniques: First, constructive solid geometry (CSG) and second, extrusion of 2D outlines. Autocad DXF files are used as the data exchange format for the 2D outlines. In addition to 2D paths for extrusion, it is also possible to read design parameters from DXF files. In addition to reading DXF files, OpenSCAD can also read and create 3D models in the STL and OFF file formats.

OpenSCAD can be downloaded from http://openscad.org/. You may find extra information in the [http://rocklinux.net/mailman/listinfo/openscad mailing list].

People who don't want to (or can't) install new software on their computer may be able to use OpenJSCAD ( http://OpenJSCAD.org/ ),
a port of OpenSCAD that runs in a web browser, if your browser supports [[w:WebGL|WebGL]]

A pt_BR translation of this document is avaliable on GitHub repository (not completed/on development) [http://www.github.com/ubb3rsith/OpenSCAD_doc_ptBR]
&lt;section end=Introduction /&gt;

Teachers: A basic 25 slide presentation is made freely available under GNUFDL to walk your students through the process of using OpenSCAD [http://www.appropedia.org/images/5/5f/Intro_to_OpenSCAD_2014_Long.pdf here]

Fablab Lannion (France) edited a [http://fablab-lannion.org/wp-content/tutos/openscad/ nice (french speaking) interactive tutorial] that you might appreciate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== cube ===

Creates a cube at the origin of the coordinate system. When center is true the cube will be centered on the origin, otherwise it is created in the first octant. The argument names are optional if the arguments are given in the same order as specified in the parameters


'''Parameters'''

; size : Decimal or 3 value array.  If a single number is given, the result will be a cube with sides of that length.  If a 3 value array is given, then the values will correspond to the lengths of the X, Y, and Z sides.  Default value is 1.

; center : Boolean.  This determines the positioning of the object.  If true, object is centered at (0,0,0).  Otherwise, the cube is placed in the positive quadrant with one corner at (0,0,0).  Defaults to false

'''Usage examples:'''
 
 cube(size = 1, center = false);
 cube(size = [1,2,3], center = true);

[[File:Openscad-cube.jpg]]

=== sphere ===

Creates a sphere at the origin of the coordinate system. The argument name is optional.

'''Parameters'''

; r : Radius.  This is the radius of the sphere.  The resolution of the sphere will be based on the size of the sphere and the $fa, $fs and $fn variables. For more information on these special variables look at: [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Other_Language_Features]]
; d : Diameter.  This is the diameter of the sphere.
(NOTE: d is only available in versions later than 2014.03. Debian is currently known to be behind this)
; $fa : Fragment angle in degrees
; $fs : Fragment size in mm
; $fn : Resolution

'''Usage Examples'''
 sphere(r = 1);
 sphere(r = 5);
 sphere(r = 10);
 sphere(d = 2);
 sphere(d = 10);
 sphere(d = 20);

 // this will create a high resolution sphere with a 2mm radius
 sphere(2, $fn=100); 

 // will also create a 2mm high resolution sphere but this one 
 // does not have as many small triangles on the poles of the sphere
 sphere(2, $fa=5, $fs=0.1); 

[[File:Openscad-sphere.jpg]]

=== cylinder ===

Creates a cylinder or cone at the origin of the coordinate system. A single radius (r) makes a cylinder, two different radi (r1, r2) make a cone.

'''Parameters'''

; h : Decimal.  This is the height of the cylinder.  Default value is 1.
; r : Decimal.  The radius of both top and bottom ends of the cylinder.  Use this parameter if you want plain cylinder.  Default value is 1.
; r1 : Decimal.  This is the radius of the cone on bottom end.  Default value is 1.
; r2 : Decimal.  This is the radius of the cone on top end.  Default value is 1.
; d : Decimal.  The diameter of both top and bottom ends of the cylinder.  Use this parameter if you want plain cylinder.  Default value is 1. 
; d1 : Decimal.  This is the diameter of the cone on bottom end.  Default value is 1.
; d2 : Decimal.  This is the diameter of the cone on top end.  Default value is 1.
; center : boolean. If true will center the height of the cone/cylinder around the origin. Default is false, placing the base of the cylinder or r1 radius of cone at the origin.
; $fa : The angle (in degrees) from one fragment to the next. See [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Other_Language_Features]].
; $fs : The circumferential length of each fragment. See [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Other_Language_Features]].
; $fn : The fixed number of fragments to use. See [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Other_Language_Features]].

(NOTE: d,d1,d2 are only available in version later than 2014.03. Debian is currently know to be behind this)

'''Usage Examples'''

 cylinder(h = 10, r=20);
 cylinder(h = 10, r=20, $fs=6);
 cylinder(h = 10, r1 = 10, r2 = 20, center = false);
 cylinder(h = 10, r1 = 20, r2 = 10, center = true);
 cylinder(h = 10, d=40);
 cylinder(h = 10, d=40, $fs=6);
 cylinder(h = 10, d1 = 20, d2 = 40, center = false);
 cylinder(h = 10, d1 = 40, d2 = 20, center = true);

[[File:Openscad-cylinder.jpg]]

=== polyhedron ===

Create a polyhedron with a list of points and a list of faces. The point list is all the vertices of the shape, the faces list is how the points relates to the surfaces of the polyhedron. 

''note: if your version of OpenSCAD is lower than 2014.03 replace &quot;faces&quot; with &quot;triangles&quot; in the below examples''

'''Parameters'''
; points : vector of points or vertices (each a 3 vector).
; triangles : (''deprecated in version 2014.03, use faces'') vector of point triplets (each a 3 number vector). Each number is the 0-indexed point number from the point vector.
; faces : (''introduced in version 2014.03'') vector of point n-tuples with n &gt;= 3. Each number is the 0-indexed point number from the point vector. That is, faces=[[0,1,4]] specifies a triangle made from the first, second, and fifth point listed in points. When referencing more than 3 points in a single tuple, the points must all be on the same plane. 
; convexity: Integer. The convexity parameter specifies the maximum number of front sides (back sides) a ray intersecting the object might penetrate. This parameter is only needed for correctly displaying the object in OpenCSG preview mode and has no effect on the polyhedron rendering.

'''Syntax example'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 polyhedron(points = [ [x, y, z], ... ], faces = [ [p1, p2, p3..], ... ], convexity = N);
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Point ordering for faces'''
When looking at the face from the outside inwards, the points must be clockwise. You can rearrange the order of the points or the order they are referenced in each tuple. The order of faces is immaterial. Note that if your polygons are not all oriented the same way OpenSCAD will either print an error or crash completely, so pay attention to the vertex ordering. Again, remember that the 'pN' components of the faces vector are 0-indexed references to the elements of the points vector.

Example, a square base pyramid:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
polyhedron(
  points=[ [10,10,0],[10,-10,0],[-10,-10,0],[-10,10,0], // the four points at base
           [0,0,10]  ],                                 // the apex point 
  faces=[ [0,1,4],[1,2,4],[2,3,4],[3,0,4],              // each triangle side
              [1,0,3],[2,1,3] ]                         // two triangles for square base
 );
&lt;/source&gt;
[[File:Openscad-polyhedron-squarebasepyramid.png|frame|none|A simple polyhedron, square based pyramid]]

An example of a more complex polyhedron, and showing how to fix polyhedrons with badly oriented polygons.

When you select 'Thrown together' from the view menu and '''compile''' the design
('''not''' compile and render!) you will see a preview with the mis-oriented polygons highlighted. Unfortunately this highlighting is not possible in the OpenCSG preview mode because it would interfere with the way the OpenCSG preview mode is implemented.)

Below you can see the code and the picture of such a problematic polyhedron, the bad polygons (faces or compositions of faces) are in pink.
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
// Bad polyhedron
polyhedron
    (points = [
	       [0, -10, 60], [0, 10, 60], [0, 10, 0], [0, -10, 0], [60, -10, 60], [60, 10, 60], 
	       [10, -10, 50], [10, 10, 50], [10, 10, 30], [10, -10, 30], [30, -10, 50], [30, 10, 50]
	       ], 
     faces = [
		  [0,2,3],   [0,1,2],  [0,4,5],  [0,5,1],   [5,4,2],  [2,4,3],
                  [6,8,9],  [6,7,8],  [6,10,11], [6,11,7], [10,8,11],
		  [10,9,8], [0,3,9],  [9,0,6], [10,6, 0],  [0,4,10],
                  [3,9,10], [3,10,4], [1,7,11],  [1,11,5], [1,7,8],  
                  [1,8,2],  [2,8,11], [2,11,5]
		  ]
     );
&lt;/source&gt;
[[image:openscad-bad-polyhedron.png|frame|none|Polyhedron with badly oriented polygons]]

A correct polyhedron would be the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

Beginner's tip: 

If you don't really understand &quot;orientation&quot;, try to identify the mis-oriented pink faces and then permute the references to the points vectors until you get it right. E.g. in the above example, the third triangle (''[0,4,5]'') was wrong and we fixed it as ''[4,0,5]''. In addition, you may select &quot;Show Edges&quot; from the &quot;View Menu&quot;, print a screen capture and number both the points and the faces.  In our example, the points are annotated in black and the faces in blue. Turn the object around and make a second copy from the back if needed. This way you can keep track.

Clockwise Technique: 

Orientation is determined by clockwise indexing. This means that if you're looking at the triangle (in this case [4,0,5]) from the outside you'll see that the path is clockwise around the center of the face. The winding order [4,0,5] is clockwise and therefore good.  The winding order [0,4,5] is counter-clockwise and therefore bad. Likewise, any other clockwise order of [4,0,5] works: [5,4,0] &amp; [0,5,4] are good too. If you use the clockwise technique, you'll always have your faces outside (outside of OpenSCAD, other programs do use counter-clockwise as the outside though).

Think of it as a Left Hand Rule:

If you hold the face and the fingers of your hand curls is the same order as the points, then your thumb points outwards.

Succinct description of a 'Polyhedron'

 * Points define all of the points/vertices in the shape.
 * Faces is a list of flat polygons that connect up the points/vertices. 

Each point, in the point list, is defined with a 3-tuple x,y,z position specification. Points in the point list are automatically given an identifier starting at zero for use in the faces list (0,1,2,3,... etc).

Each face, in the faces list, is defined by selecting 3 or more of the points (using the point identifier) out of the point list.

e.g. faces=[ [0,1,2] ] defines a triangle from the first point (points are zero referenced) to the second point and then to the third point.

When looking at any face from the outside, the face must list all points in a clockwise order.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Transformation affect the child nodes and as the name implies transforms them in various ways such as moving/rotating or scaling the child. Cascading transformations are used to apply a variety of transforms to a final child. Cascading is achieved by nesting statements i.e.

 rotate([45,45,45])
   translate([10,20,30])
     cube(10);

Transformations can be applied to a group of child nodes by using '{' &amp; '}' to enclose the subtree e.g.

  translate([0,0,-5])    or the more compact      translate([0,0,-5]) {
  {                                                 cube(10);
    cube(10);                                       cylinder(r=5,h=10);
    cylinder(r=5,h=10);                           }
  }


Advanced concept 

As OpenSCAD uses different libraries to implement capabilities this can introduce some inconsistencies to the F5 preview behaviour of transformations. Traditional transforms (translate, rotate, scale, mirror &amp; multimatrix) are performed using OpenGL in preview, while other more advanced transforms, such as resize, perform a CGAL operation, behaving like a CSG operation affecting the underlying object, not just transforming it. In particular this can affect the display of modifier characters, specifically &quot;#&quot; and &quot;%&quot;, where the highlight may not display intuitively, such as highlighting the pre-resized object, but highlighting the post-scaled object.



{{incomplete}}

=== scale ===

Scales its child elements using the specified vector. The argument name is optional.

 Usage Example:
 scale(v = [x, y, z]) { ... }

 cube(10);
 translate([15,0,0]) scale([0.5,1,2]) cube(10);

[[File:OpenSCAD scale() example.JPG|Image showing result of scale() transformation in OpenSCAD]]

=== resize ===

resize() is available since OpenSCAD 2013.06. It modifies the size of the child object to match the given x,y, and z. 

There is a bug with shrinking in the 2013.06 release, that will be fixed in the next release. 
 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;Usage Example:&lt;/big&gt;

 // resize the sphere to extend 30 in x, 60 in y, and 10 in the z directions.
 resize(newsize=[30,60,10]) sphere(r=10);  

[[File:OpenSCAD Resize example elipse.JPG|400px|OpenSCAD Resize example ellipse]]

If x,y, or z is 0 then that dimension is left as-is. 

 // resize the 1x1x1 cube to 2x2x1
 resize([2,2,0]) cube(); 

If the 'auto' parameter is set to true, it will auto-scale any 0-dimensions to match. For example.

 // resize the 1x2x0.5 cube to 7x14x3.5
 resize([7,0,0], auto=true) cube([1,2,0.5]);  

The 'auto' parameter can also be used if you only wish to auto-scale a single dimension, and leave the other as-is.

 // resize to 10x8x1. Note that the z dimension is left alone.
 resize([10,0,0], auto=[true,true,false]) cube([5,4,1]);

=== rotate ===
Rotates its child 'a' degrees about the origin of the coordinate system or around an arbitrary axis.
The argument names are optional if the arguments are given in the same order as specified.


 Usage:
 rotate(a = deg_a, v = [x, y, z]) { ... }  
 // or
 rotate(deg_a, [x, y, z]) { ... }
 rotate(a = [deg_x, deg_y, deg_z]) { ... }
 rotate([deg_x, deg_y, deg_z]) { ... }

The 'a' argument (deg_a) can be an array, as expressed in the later usage above; when deg_a is an array, the 'v' argument is ignored. Where 'a' specifies ''multiple axes'' then the rotation is applied in the following order: x, y, z.


The optional argument 'v' is a vector and allows you to set an arbitrary axis about which the object will be rotated.


For example, to flip an object upside-down, you can rotate your object 180 degrees around the 'y' axis.
 rotate(a=[0,180,0]) { ... }
This is frequently simplified to
 rotate([0,180,0]) { ... }


When specifying a single axis the 'v' argument allows you to specify which axis is the basis for rotation. For example, the equivalent to the above, to rotate just around y
 rotate(a=180, v=[0,1,0]) { ... }


When specifying mutiple axis, 'v'is a [[wikipedia:Euler_vector|vector]] defining an arbitrary axis for rotation; this is different from the ''multiple axis'' above. For example, rotate your object 45 degrees around the axis defined by the vector [1,1,0], 
 rotate(a=45, v=[1,1,0]) { ... }
[[File:OpenSCAD rotate() example.JPG|image of result of rotate() transformation in OpenSCAD]]



Rotate with a ''single scalar argument'' rotates around the Z axis. This is useful in 2D contexts where that is the only axis for rotation. For example:
 rotate(45) square(10);
[[File:Example 2D Rotate.JPG|Result of OpenSCAD rotate(45) as 2D render]]


===== If this is all a bit confusing, this might, or might not, help. =====

[[File:Right-hand grip rule.svg|thumb|Right-hand grip rule]]


For the case of:
 rotate([a, b, c]) { ... };

&quot;a&quot; is a rotation about the X axis, from the +Z axis, toward the -Y axis. NOTE: NEGATIVE Y.
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;b&quot; is a rotation about the Y axis, from the +Z axis, toward the +X axis.
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;c&quot; is a rotation about the Z axis, from the +X axis, toward the +Y axis.

These are all cases of the [[wikipedia:right-hand rule| Right Hand Rule]]. Point your right thumb along the positive axis, your fingers show the direction of rotation.



Thus if &quot;a&quot; is fixed to zero, and &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are manipulated appropriately, this is the ''spherical coordinate system''.
&lt;br&gt;
So, to construct a cylinder from the origin to some other point (x,y,z):

 %cube(10); 
 x= 10; y = 10; z = 10; // point coordinates of corner of cube
 //
 length = sqrt( pow(x, 2) + pow(y, 2) + pow(z, 2) );
 b = acos(z/length);
 c = (x==0) ? 90 : ( (x&gt;0) ? atan(y/x) : atan(y/x)+180 ); 
 //
 rotate([0, b, c]) 
     cylinder(h=length, r=0.5);

[[File:Example xyz rotation in OpenSCAD.JPG|Example of OpenSCAD Rotate() used as a spherical coordinate system.]]

=== translate ===

Translates (moves) its child elements along the specified vector. The argument name is optional.

IExample
 translate(v = [x, y, z]) { ... }

 cube(2,center = true); 
 translate([5,0,0]) 
   sphere(1,center = true);

[[File:OpenSCAD translate() example.JPG|image of result of the translate() transformation in OpenSCAD]]

=== mirror ===

Mirrors the child element on a plane through the origin. The argument to mirror() is the normal vector of a plane intersecting the origin through which to mirror the object.

====Function signature:====
 mirror( [x, y, z] ) { ... }

====Examples====
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Mirror-x.png|&lt;code&gt;mirror([1,0,0]) hand();&lt;/code&gt;
File:Mirror-x-y.png|&lt;code&gt;mirror([1,1,0]) hand();&lt;/code&gt;
File:Mirror-x-y-z.png|&lt;code&gt;mirror([1,1,1]) hand();&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

 rotate([0,0,10]) cube([3,2,1]);
 mirror([1,0,0]) translate([1,0,0]) rotate([0,0,10]) cube([3,2,1]);

[[File:OpenSCAD mirror() example.JPG|image of the result of the mirror() transformation in OpenSCAD]]

=== multmatrix ===

Multiplies the geometry of all child elements with the given 4x4 transformation matrix.

Usage: multmatrix(m = [...]) { ... }

Example (translates by [10, 20, 30]):

 multmatrix(m = [ [1, 0, 0, 10],
                  [0, 1, 0, 20],
                  [0, 0, 1, 30],
                  [0, 0, 0,  1]
                ]) cylinder();

Example (rotates by 45 degrees in XY plane and translates by [10,20,30]):

 angle=45;
 multmatrix(m = [ [cos(angle), -sin(angle), 0, 10],
                 [sin(angle), cos(angle), 0, 20],
                 [0, 0, 1, 30],
                 [0, 0, 0,  1]
               ]) union() {
    cylinder(r=10.0,h=10,center=false);
    cube(size=[10,10,10],center=false);
 }

=== color ===

Displays the child elements using the specified RGB color + alpha value. This is only used for the F5 preview as CGAL and STL (F6) do not currently support color. The alpha value will default to 1.0 (opaque) if not specified.

====Function signature:====
 color( [r, g, b, a] ) { ... }
 color( [r, g, b], a=1.0 ) { ... } // since v. 2011.12 (?)
 color( colorname, a=1.0 ) { ... } // since v. 2011.12 ( fails in 2014.03; use color( &quot;colorname&quot;, #) were # is the alpha )

Note that the &lt;code&gt;r, g, b, a&lt;/code&gt; values are limited to floating point values in the range '''[0,1]'''  rather than the more traditional integers { 0 ... 255 }. However, nothing prevents you to using &lt;code&gt;R, G, B&lt;/code&gt; values from {0 ... 255} with appropriate scaling: &lt;code&gt;color([ R/255, G/255, B/255 ]) { ... } &lt;/code&gt;

Since version ''2011.12'', colors can also be defined by name (case '''in'''sensitive). For example, to create a red sphere, you can write &lt;code&gt;color(&quot;red&quot;) sphere(5);&lt;/code&gt;. Alpha is specified as an extra parameter for named colors: &lt;code&gt;color(&quot;Blue&quot;,0.5) cube(5);&lt;/code&gt;

The available color names are taken from the World Wide Web consortium's [http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/ SVG color list]. A chart of the color names is as follows, &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''(note that both spellings of grey/gray including slategrey/slategray etc are valid)''&lt;/small&gt;:

[[File:Wavy multicolor object.jpg|thumb|A 3-D multicolor sine wave]]
Here's a code fragment that draws a wavy multicolor object

  for(i=[0:36]) {
    for(j=[0:36]) {
      color( [0.5+sin(10*i)/2, 0.5+sin(10*j)/2, 0.5+sin(10*(i+j))/2] )
      translate( [i, j, 0] )
      cube( size = [1, 1, 11+10*cos(10*i)*sin(10*j)] );
    }
  }
↗&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;
Being that -1&lt;=sin(''x'')&lt;=1 then 0&lt;=(1/2 + sin(''x'')/2)&lt;=1 , allowing for the RGB components assigned to color to remain within the [0,1] interval.

[[File:Openscad minkowski example 1a.png|200px|thumb|right|A box and a cylinder]]
[[File:Openscad minkowski example 2a.png|200px|thumb|right|Minkowski sum of the box and cylinder]]

Displays the [http://www.cgal.org/Manual/latest/doc_html/cgal_manual/Minkowski_sum_3/Chapter_main.html minkowski sum] of child nodes.

Usage example:

Say you have a flat box, and you want a rounded edge. There are many ways to do this, but minkowski is very elegant. Take your box, and a cylinder:

 $fn=50;
 cube([10,10,1]);
 cylinder(r=2,h=1);

Then, do a minkowski sum of them:

 $fn=50;
 minkowski()
 {
  cube([10,10,1]);
  cylinder(r=2,h=1);
 }

=== hull ===

=== union ===

Creates a union of all its child nodes. This is the '''sum''' of all children.

 Usage example:
 union() {
 	cylinder (h = 4, r=1, center = true, $fn=100);
 	rotate ([90,0,0]) cylinder (h = 4, r=0.9, center = true, $fn=100);
 }

Remark: union is implicit when not used. But it is mandatory, for example, in difference to group first child nodes into one.

[[Image:Openscad_union.jpg||400px||Union]]

=== difference ===

Subtracts the 2nd (and all further) child nodes from the first one.

 Usage example:
 difference() {
 	cylinder (h = 4, r=1, center = true, $fn=100);
 	rotate ([90,0,0]) cylinder (h = 4, r=0.9, center = true, $fn=100);
 }


[[Image:Openscad_difference.jpg||400px||Difference]]


=== intersection ===

Creates the intersection of all child nodes. This keeps the '''overlapping''' portion

 Usage example:
 intersection() {
 	cylinder (h = 4, r=1, center = true, $fn=100);
 	rotate ([90,0,0]) cylinder (h = 4, r=0.9, center = true, $fn=100);
 }


[[Image:Openscad_intersection.jpg||400px||Intersection]]


=== render ===

Always calculate the CSG model for this tree (even in OpenCSG preview mode).

 Usage example:
 render(convexity = 1) { ... }


{| border=1
|-
|convexity
|Integer. The convexity parameter specifies the maximum number of front sides (back sides) a ray intersecting the object might penetrate. This parameter is only needed for correctly displaying the object in OpenCSG preview mode and has no effect on the polyhedron rendering.
|}


[[Image:Openscad_convexity.jpg||400px||]]

This image shows a 2D shape with a convexity of 4, as the ray indicated in red crosses the 2D shape a maximum of 4 times. The convexity of a 3D shape would be determined in a similar way. Setting it to 10 should work fine for most cases.

Modifier characters are used to change the appearance or behaviours of child nodes. They are particularly useful in debugging where they can be used to highlight specific objects, or include or exclude them from rendering.

Advanced concept

As OpenSCAD uses different libraries to implement capabilities this can introduce some inconsistencies to the F5 preview behaviour of transformations. Traditional transforms (translate, rotate, scale, mirror &amp; multimatrix) are performed using OpenGL in preview, while other more advanced transforms, such as resize, perform a CGAL operation, behaving like a CSG operation affecting the underlying object, not just transforming it. In particular this can affect the display of modifier characters, specifically &quot;#&quot; and &quot;%&quot;, where the highlight may not display intuitively, such as highlighting the pre-resized object, but highlighting the post-scaled object.

Note: The color changes triggered by character modifiers will only be shown in &quot;Compile&quot; mode not &quot;Compile and Render (CGAL)&quot; mode. ([[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Transformations#color|As per the color section]].)

=== Background Modifier ===

Ignore this subtree for the normal rendering process and draw it in transparent gray (all transformations are still applied to the nodes in this tree).

Because the marked subtree is completely ignored, it might have unexpected effects in case it's used for example with the first object in a difference(). In that case this object will be rendered in transparent gray, but it will ''not'' be the base for the difference()!

''Usage''

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
 % { ... }
&lt;/source&gt;

''Example''

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
difference() {
	cylinder (h = 12, r=5, center = true, $fn=100);
	// first object that will subtracted
	rotate ([90,0,0]) cylinder (h = 15, r=1, center = true, $fn=100);
	// second object that will be subtracted
	%rotate ([0,90,0]) cylinder (h = 15, r=3, center = true, $fn=100);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

''Example Output''

{{multiple image
 | align = center
 | width = 220
 | image1 = OpenSCAD Background Modifier (off).png
 | caption1 = Output without the modifer.
 | image2 = OpenSCAD Background Modifier (on).png
 | caption2 = Output with modifier added.
 | image3 = OpenSCAD Background Modifier (render).png
 | caption3 = Rendered Model.
 }}

=== Debug Modifier ===

Use this subtree as usual in the rendering process but also draw it unmodified in transparent pink.

''Usage''

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
 # { ... }
&lt;/source&gt;

''Example''

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
difference() {
	// start objects
	cylinder (h = 12, r=5, center = true, $fn=100);
        // first object that will subtracted
	#rotate ([90,0,0]) cylinder (h = 15, r=1, center = true, $fn=100);
        // second object that will be subtracted
	#rotate ([0,90,0]) cylinder (h = 15, r=3, center = true, $fn=100);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

''Example Output''

{{multiple image
 | align = center
 | width = 220
 | image1 = OpenSCAD Debug Modifier (off).png
 | caption1 = Output without the modifer.
 | image2 = OpenSCAD Debug Modifier (on).png
 | caption2 = Output with modifier added.
 }}

=== Root Modifier ===

Ignore the rest of the design and use this subtree as design root.

''Usage''
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
 ! { ... }
&lt;/source&gt;

''Example''

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
difference() {
	cube(10, center = true);
	translate([0, 0, 5]) {
		!rotate([90, 0, 0]) {
			#cylinder(r = 2, h = 20, center = true, $fn = 40);
		}
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

''Example Output''

{{multiple image
 | align = center
 | width = 220
 | image1 = OpenSCAD Root Modifier (off).png
 | caption1 = Output without the modifer.
 | image2 = OpenSCAD Root Modifier (on).png
 | caption2 = Output with modifier added.
 }}

As shown in the example output with the root modifier active, the rotate() is executed as it's part of the subtree marked with the root modifier, but the translate() has no effect.

=== Disable Modifier ===

Simply ignore this entire subtree.

''Usage''
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
 * { ... }
&lt;/source&gt;

''Example''

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
difference() {
	cube(10, center = true);
	translate([0, 0, 5]) {
		rotate([0, 90, 0]) {
			cylinder(r = 2, h = 20, center = true, $fn = 40);
		}
		*rotate([90, 0, 0]) {
			#cylinder(r = 2, h = 20, center = true, $fn = 40);
		}
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

''Example Output''

{{multiple image
 | align = center
 | width = 220
 | image1 = OpenSCAD Disable Modifier (off).png
 | caption1 = Output without the modifer.
 | image2 = OpenSCAD Disable Modifier (on).png
 | caption2 = Output with modifier added.
 }}

The disable modifier allows to comment out one or multiple subtrees. Compared to using the usual line or multi-line comments, it's aware of the hierarchical structure which makes it easier to disable even larger trees without the need to search for the end of the subtree.

== '''How To Choose The Proper Documentation''' ==


There are many different types of documentation formatting, with some being more detailed then others. Different circumstances require different formats. 

Many businesses and organizations have a specific documentation style that they want to be used for usability reasons. It is important to use the style specific to organizations when doing business with them to make their jobs easier and therefore make you more valuable in their eyes, which can lead to re-hiring. Many businesses have style guides available that include documentation rules and citation examples. 

The American Psychological Association (APA) and the Modern Language Association (MLA) are the two most common documentation style guides that businesses use. Most of the other documentation styles resemble one of these two styles.

== '''Location Of Citations In The Text''' ==


•Sources are cited in the body of a text with the use of parentheses. The type of citation style will differ depending on what is put inside the parentheses. These parentheses are always put on the inside of the sentence's period or comma.

'''''Example:''''' Using APA style formatting- According to J.C. Smith (2010, pg. 777), &quot;It is important to always write clearly and succinctly.&quot;

== Citing One Source for One Sentence, Quotation or Fact ==

•For one sentence, the citation is put in parentheses immediately after the referred sentence, quotation, or fact. 

'''''Example''''': On November 8, 2009, the world's largest cookie was made (Smith, 2009).

== Citing One Source for Multiple Sentences ==

•For one or more sentences, the citation should be placed in the first sentence of the group of sentences that are being cited. This sentence should introduce the material that will be discussed in the upcoming sentences. The readers will then understand that the citation refers to all the material related to this leading sentence. 

'''''Example''''': The topic of cookies and their origins has been studied by John Smith (2009). Cookies are thought to have come from... They were originally used for...

== Citing Multiple Sources for One or Multiple Sentences ==

•For multiple sources, only the information inside the parentheses changes. This is dependent on what type of citation style you are using.

'''''Example''''': Childhood obesity is on the rise in America, creating a need for more nutrition education classes in grade schools (Smith, 2009; L. Johnson, 1998).

== '''Basic Guidelines For Citing Resources''' ==


Sources are cited in the body of the text as well as at the end of the document. The APA and MLA styles differ in how to format these citations.

• In-text citations must clearly show what information the citation is referring to, which is why they must be put in parenthesis and written inside the period.

'''''Example''''': On November 8, 2009, the world's largest cookie was made (Smith, 2009).

•To clearly show that a citation is for multiple sentences, it should be put at the end of the first sentence (inside the period). This clearly introduces the citation at the same time the information is introduced.

'''''Example''''': The topic of cookies and their origins has been studied by John Smith (2009). Cookies are thought to have come from... They were originally used for...

•Citations at the end of a writing should be well organized, and follow all the rules of the citation style. For example, APA style requires citations to be in alphabetical order.

•If information is not available for a complete citation, just skip the part of the citation that you can't find, filling in all areas of information that are available. You should try your hardest to find all information, however, to make your writing most credible.

'''''Example''''': Author's name is missing and there is not an organization name mentioned, write citation as follows: “The Preparation of Bacterial and Oral Smears, and the Use of Simple Stains.” Microbiology Laboratory. New Jersey: Pearson Education Inc, 2003. 21-30.

== '''APA Style In-Text Citations''' ==


When citing an APA source from your bibliography in the text, the author's name and publication year are put in parentheses in the normal sentence punctuation. A comma is placed between the name of the author and the date. For the citing of a specific page in the cited publication, ''p.'' with the page number following is used. If more than one page is being referred to, use ''pp.'' with the referred pages listed afterward. 

'''''Example''''': English Springer Spaniels originated in England in the year 1802 (Harris, 1977, p.28).

• Harris is the author and the information came from a book he wrote that was published in 1977. The information was found on page 28.

'''''Example''''': English Springer Spaniels were used for hunting (Harris et al., 1977).

• Harris and three or more others are the authors of the cited information. &quot;et al&quot; is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase, ''et alii'', which means &quot;and others&quot;. 

'''''Example''''': English Springer Spaniels come in black and white colors (''AKC Dog Book'', 1977).

• The information came from a book call the &quot;AKC Dog Book&quot; that was published in 1977. 

• If more than one source by the same author published in the same year is used, differentiate the citations as seen in the following example:

'''''Example''''': (Smith, 1989a) and (Smith, 1989b)

• Consult publication manual of the ''American Psychological Association'' for more referencing examples.
           
'''''Example''''': According to Keith, Snowboarding had progressed enormously in the past 20 years (2010, pp. 25-28).

• If the Author's name is incorporated into the sentence written itself, only the year and the page numbers are necessary in the parentheses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">VaYerah     &quot;and he revealed himself&quot;   Genesis 18:1- 22:24
Haftarah: 2 Kings 4:1-37; 4:1-23;  Mark 4:21 - 6:56

&quot;And Yahweh appeared unto him by the terebinths (oaks)  of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed down to the earth, and said: 'My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.'&quot;(18:1-3 JPS revised) - 
'And Yahweh revealed Himself', is the theme of this parsha, and He manifested Himself to Avraham after his obedient performance of circumcision to initiate the fulfillment of the covenant which is to be realised through the promised son, Isaac.  According to tradition, this happened three days after he had performed the circumcision, when the pain was at its worst. 

Revelation of Yahweh - The Word of God
According to the Talmud (Babah Metsiah 86b) there were two separate supernatural manifestations. First, the Shechinah of Yahweh, His immediate Presence, was revealed, and later came the visit of the three malachim, messengers.  These are said to be  Michael, who came to foretell the birth of Yitzchak,  Gavriel, who came to destroy Sodom and the towns under its rule, and Rafael, who came to heal Avraham after the circumcision.  Talmud tells us that thereafter Michael accompanied Gavriel when he went down to Sodom to destroy the city.

In chapter 19, verse 1 it says:  &quot;The two angels (&quot;malachim&quot; - messengers) arrived at Sodom in the evening.&quot;(NIV revised)
The word &quot;malach&quot;, in plural &quot;malachim&quot;, simply means &quot;messenger&quot; or &quot;ambassador&quot;. Therefore we do not know from the word itself if it is speaking of people from the earth or angels from heaven. The context determines the meaning.

After the two angelic messengers went on to Sodom, Yahweh returned to Avraham and revealed to him His purposes regarding Sodom.  &quot;And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Avraham stood yet before Yahweh.  And Avraham drew near, and said: 'Wilt Thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?&quot;  (Genesis 18:22-23 JPS revised)

Avraham addressed the physical manifestation of God who stood before him as &quot;Yahweh&quot; - the Word.  (18: 1; 18:33; 19:27)
&quot;When He had finished talking to Avraham Yahweh went away, and Avraham returned home.&quot;(NJB)

Yahweh said to Avraham that he would go down to Sodom to see if it was really according to the outcry that had come before Him (18:21).   The two angels then went down to Sodom with the authority of Yahweh to save Lot and carry out the heavenly judgment.  (19:12-13)

Yahweh goes from speaking with Avraham to speak with Lot whom we may assume is the one who had been raising an outcry against the city seeing 2 Peter 2:7, 8 says that his righteous soul was tormented daily with their lawless behaviour. (19:19-22)   

When Lot petitions Him to only go as far as Zoar before the judgement, Yahweh answers him,   &quot;But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.&quot;(19:22a NIV)   Note that Yahweh Himself is speaking here.
&quot;Then Yahweh rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Amorah, from Yahweh out of the heavens.&quot;(19:24 NIV revised)

The Targum of Johnathan reads &quot;Then Yahweh's Word rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Amorah - from Yahweh out of the heavens.&quot;  This makes it very specific that Yahweh the Word on earth authorised the judgement with His Father in heaven.

In the Targums (which are from the second Temple period) where there are more than one identification of Yahweh in the text, or where Yahweh is presented in human form, the texts have used &quot;Yahweh's Word&quot;.  The Aramaic word for &quot;word&quot; is &quot;Memra&quot; 
Other bible texts show similar revelations of a Yahweh who is in heaven, and of a Yahweh (Katan - little) who reveals himself on earth. 
See Zechariah 2:11; 12:11; 14:5; Isaiah 48:15-16.

Both Avraham and Lot had a face to face encounter with a manifestation of Yahweh in fleshly form.    

According to Yerushalayim's Targum it was to the Memra (the Word) that Avraham prayed &quot;And Avraham worshipped and prayed in Yahweh's Word's name, and said: 'You are Yahweh, who sees me, but You cannot be seen'&quot;
Note that Avraham prays prays in Yahweh's Word's name, but he prays to the Yahweh who cannot be seen.  Here there are two 'Yahwehs' that he is identifying - the One in whose Name he prays to the One to Whom he is praying Whom he cannot see in heaven. 

This whole parsha is revealing that there are two Yahweh's, one who called down fire and brimstone while on the earth, from the other who was in heaven sending it.  Not only would this interpretation be consistent with the context of the Parsha and would also explain why Avraham was able to look upon the face of God and not die. The Yahweh who Avraham saw was the pre incarnate Yeshua, God in the flesh. 

John the apostle identifies Yeshua the Messiah as the Word of Yahweh who took on flesh as a human tabernacle/dwelling place.
&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  He was in the beginning with God. .. .. ..    And the Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.&quot;  (John 1:1-3 and 14 MRC revised)   See also Acts 2:36.

The Promised Son
&quot;And He said: 'I will certainly return to you around this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.' &quot;(18:10  CJB) - 
The word that is translated &quot;this time next year&quot; in v.14 is &quot;moed&quot; &quot;appointed time&quot; referring to the feasts which were outlined in Leviticus 23.  Avraham had unleavened bread at the time (18:6), also Lot made a feast of unleavened bread for the 'angels' (19:3)

Strong 4150 mo?ed  mo?ed  mo?adah, mo-ade', mo-ade', mo-aw-daw', &gt;From H3259; properly an appointment, that is, a fixed time or season; specifically a festival; conventionally a year; by implication, an assembly (as convened for a definite purpose); technically the congregation; by extension, the place of meeting; also a signal (as appointed beforehand): - appointed (sign, time), (place of, solemn) assembly, congregation, (set, solemn) feast, (appointed, due) season, solemn (-ity), synagogue, (set) time (appointed).

When they left Egypt, scripture says it was on the same day as the covenant was given 430 years previously.  Jewish tradition puts Isaac's (Yitzchak) birth on the 15th of Nissan (Day of Unleavened Bread) 30 years after the covenant which would place this heraldic announcement of Isaac's (Yitzchak) birth, during the feast of unleavened bread, Yitzchak being born one year later.
 
&quot;And the child grew, and was weaned. And Avraham made a great feast on the day that Yitzchak was weaned.&quot;(21:8 JPS revised) 

&quot;And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Mitzrit, whom she had borne unto Avraham, making sport.&quot;(21:9  JPS revised) -  The root of the word that is translated &quot;made sport&quot; is &quot;tzachak&quot; which means laugh.  It is the same root that is found in the name Yitzchak. The word is also used in with a sexual implication, as for instance in Genesis 26:8, where Yitzchak was 'sporting' (&quot;tzachak&quot;) with Rivkah his wife.&quot;

It can therefore be possible that what Yishma'el did to Yitzchak was a mixture of violence, sex and idolatry, which are the three gravest sins. When Sarah saw this she was very offended. This type of influence was not good for her son. 
&quot;Wherefore she said unto Avraham: 'Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Yitzchak.'&quot;(21:10  JPS revised)  

Yishmael had a jealous heart toward his little half brother, who had been born 14 years after himself, persecuting him, as it is written in Galatians 4:29:  &quot;But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, as it is also at present.&quot;(MRC)  
Later on Yahweh confirms her words and commands Avraham to do according to all that Sarah had said to him.   Yahweh was saying that Avraham should listen to Sarah's &quot;voice&quot; (the Hebrew word is &quot;kol&quot; which means voice).  And in this case it was not just her human voice, but the prophetic voice through her to which he was to listen.

Avraham was a good father but Hagar was a bad mother and the fruit of her upbringing of Yishmael had its outworking in his behaviour.   &quot;And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow-shot; for she said: 'Let me not look upon the death of the child.' And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.'&quot;(21:16  JPS) - What kind of mother abandons her child when he is about to die?  Hagar did. She thought only of herself, not of the welfare of her son at the most critical moment of his life.  Besides that, she had completely forgotten the words that the angel had given her concerning her son's future.  &quot;And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.&quot;(21:19 JPS revised) 

The well was there all along.  When we are in a crisis situation or have problems, we do not need to go up to heaven or down to the depths in order to find the solution. What we do need, is to have a good relationship with Yahweh so that He can open our eyes in order that we may see the solution that is not far from us. 

Lessons of Faith
&quot;God tested Abraham.&quot; (22:1)  In Hebrew the common term for test is &quot;bechina,&quot; but here the word used is &quot;neis&quot;.  In Hebrew this word means not only a test, but also a banner; as the Psalmist says, &quot;You gave those who fear you a banner to raise themselves&quot; (Psalms 60:6).  A banner is something which is raised high as a symbol of victory, a rallying point for others to congregate.  Similarly, when Yahweh tests an individual, the purpose is to lift him into a higher sphere. When the individual is victorious and passes the test, he is spiritually elevated and exalted.   Through the trial, his hidden potential powers of faith were extracted and brought to fruition.

When someone has passed a test, he always receives a great reward. The greatest reward any man can get is to have a complete and fully mature character, as it is written in James 1:2-4:  &quot;Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you fall into various temptations, knowing that the proof of your faith produces patient endurance. And let patient endurance have its perfect work, that you may have reached the goal and be complete, lacking in nothing.&quot;  (MRC)

If a man does not pass the test that the Eternal brings him, he has two choices. One is to go through the test again and again until he passes it.  The other is to be disqualified. What happened with the majority of the children of Israel who came out of Mitzrayim was that they failed the test 10 times, see Numbers 14:22, and therefore they could not come up to the higher level that the Eternal had prepared for them in the promised land.

His first son Ishmael, the premature product of his fleshly relations with the Egyptian handmaiden Hagar, had already been sent away from the family compound which had also tested his faith in Yahweh's provision for his son Ishmael, apart from it being the separation of his firstborn son from the family.  
Twice Yahweh takes Abraham through the same type of test of faith regarding losing Sarah as his wife because of her beauty.  &quot;And Abimelech sent and took Sarah&quot;  (Gen 20: 2)  This was what Abraham had anticipated and Yahweh moved in the situation and preserved her and returned her to him.  Peter commends her behaviour to all women as an example of her submission to Abraham.  1 Peter 3: 5-6

His final and greatest test came in offering up his son Yitzchak.   Just as he had believed for Sarah to be returned to him so he also believed that God was able to raise him again from the dead to fulfil His promise  (Hebrews 11:19)
By the time of the binding or the Akedah, as it is known in Hebrew, Abraham had already been through the great trials of his life.  This is the tenth test that was placed before our father Abraham and is the last and defining test for his faith to be complete.   

In his obedient response to the call to offer Yitzchak (Isaac), Abraham's faith was resting in his knowledge of the Almighty.   His response was, &quot;God will provide&quot;.   In the Hebrew this carries the idea that God will &quot;make it clear&quot;. or &quot;it will be seen&quot; what the offering will be.  His obedience was in implicit trust in the providence of the Almighty and in His power if necessary to even raise him from the dead.

The overcomers of the past are a cloud of witnesses to us who come afterward of their weaknesses and triumphs of faith in overcoming the fleshly nature and aspiring to that city which has spiritual foundations,  for which they were 
willing to be strangers and pilgrims here in this life, in order to inherit that which is to come which is eternal.

When in the midst of a test, do not complain, but place your trust in the Eternal and his promises, so that you can come up to a higher level in the Kingdom and your character will become more like His Son's, which is the goal of your life, according to Romans 8:29, &quot;For whom He foreknew, He also foreordained to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren;&quot; (MRC)

The Great Act of Faith
Abraham's placement of Yitzchak on the altar is often seen as a great act of faith in the Almighty.  We often misinterpret the nature of that act of faith.  If we view the act of being willing to tie Yitzchak up and place him on the altar as a great act of faith, we do so from a western frame of mind, a frame of mind that is unfamiliar with the workings of blood covenants. The great act of faith on Abraham's part was his absolute conviction that the Almighty could and would live up to the commitment He was making.

When the fullness of time was satisfied, the Almighty One secured the agreement of a young Jewish girl named Miriam.  Miriam was engaged to be married to a Jewish man named Yousef.  El Shaddai poured the creative part of Himself, His Word, into her uterus to become flesh.  Yahweh Yireh, God our provider, required of Yousef and Miriam that they name this child Yeshua, which means &quot;Deliverer.&quot;

Yeshua, being the son of Miriam, was fully human.  He, being the creative voice of the Almighty God, was also fully and completely born of God and His son.

The Akedah is a foreshadowing of the ultimate sacrifice the heavenly Father would give on our behalf of actually offering His only Son upon mount Moriah (where Abraham offered Yitzchak) in order to make salvation available to all who believe.  As Abraham said, Elohim yireh-lo haseh (“God Himself will provide a lamb”).

Both Yitzchak and Yeshua were born miraculously; both were “only begotten sons”; both were to be sacrificed by their fathers at Mount Moriah; both were to be resurrected on the third day (Genesis 22:5, Hebrews 11:17-19); both willingly took up the means of his execution; and both demonstrate that one life can be sacrificed for another – the ram for Yitzchak, and Yeshua for all of mankind. Indeed, Yitzchak is a clear picture of the Greater Seed of Abraham to come, the One who would remove the curse and save us from death.

On account of Abraham’s obedience and trust in Yahweh, the Angel of Yahweh then says, “By myself I have sworn, declares Yahweh, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, and in your Seed (singular) shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.&quot;

Yitzchak disappears from the scene of the Torah here, not to be seen again until his bride, Rivkah, is ready, see 24:62.  In the same way, Yeshua, after his death and resurrection, was taken up from the scene of this world and He will not be revealed again until the bride is without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, ready for the wedding of the Lamb.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Proteoglycans''' are proteins that are covalently bonded at multiple sites along the protein chain to a class of polysaccharides, known as glycosaminoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans constitute approximately 95% of the mass of proteoglycans by weight, which results in proteoglycans bearing a resemblance more to polysaccharides than to proteins. The physiological properties of proteoglycans are a function of the particular glycosaminoglycans present. Examples of common glycosaminoglycans are chondroitin 6-sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparin, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronate. As a result of the ionic character of glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans carry at least one negatively charged carboxylate or sulfate functional group under physiological conditions&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;. Examples of proteoglycans include Versican, Brevican, Neurocan, and Aggrecan.

[[File:Glycosaminoglycans2.jpg|right|thumb|Proteoglycan]] 

== Synthesis ==
As the name implies, proteoglycans are essentially proteins that have been glycosylated. These proteins are synthesized in the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum by ribosomes, and are then transported by vesicles to the Golgi Apparatus, where the proteins are modified into various forms. Proteoglycans are among these modified forms. Upon completion of synthesis, the proteoglycans are transported to the Extracellular Matrix by vesicles. &lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
Proteoglycans are a significant component in the Extracellular Matrix. The major functions/purpose of proteoglycans depends on the glycosaminoglycan component of the molecule. This component allows connective tissues of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) to be able to withstand compressional forces through hydration and swelling pressure to the tissue. Aggrecan best portrays this particular function. 

In addition to Aggrecan are other proteoglycans such as Lumican, Decorin, Perlecan, Fibromodulin and Biglycan, each serving different functions according to their components. &lt;ref&gt;3&lt;/ref&gt;


== Examples ==
=== Aggrecan ===

In biological systems, proteoglycans constitute the structural building blocks of connective tissue; additionally, proteoglycans serve as joint lubricants. The most well studied proteoglycan, called ''aggrecan'', is found alongside collagen as the main components of cartilage. The negative charges on the repeating glycosaminoglycan units of aggrecan attract water absorption. As a result, aggrecan acts as a cushion for impact retention by absorbing and desorbing water&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;. This role is particularly important in between joints that sustain high amounts of impact in mammalian bodies, such as the knees. Aggrecan has also been found to take an important role in the central nervous system. It is one of many proteoglycans that inhibit neuronal growth, movement, and interaction. These proteoglycans are important for keeping the pathways established in young, developing animal brains during adulthood; however they are also the reason adult brains are less likely to establish new connections than the developing brain. Recent work has hinted that aggrecan is an important contributor to aging neuronal loss and dementia&lt;ref&gt;4&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Lumican ===

Lumican belongs to a family of proteoglycans called Small Leucine-Rich Proteoglycans. It is most well known for its importance in healing and scar tissue formation in mammals. Recent studies in mice show that it specifically helps mediate the migration of chemokines (cytokines responsible for preventing infection and promoting wound healing) to injured sites in the skin. Mice that lack the gene encoding named LUM for encoding the protein Lumican have tissue defects and poor immune responses to infections&lt;ref&gt;5&lt;/ref&gt;. Lumican's role in healing injured sites is not completely understood, however the protein's moiety allows collagen fibrils and charged hydrophilic gylcosaminogyclans to bind into interfibrillar spacings. Lumican as a keratan sulfate proteoglycan forms interstitial collagenous matrices within an injured site, which not only aids in wound closing, but protection of the inflammatory site against infections. In addition, Lumican regulates collagent organization, spatial growth, corneal transparency, cell migration, and tissue repair.

'''CARBOHYDRATES BINDING MOLECULES AND MALARIA'''

In a paper titled ''Carbohydrate Binding Molecules in Malaria Pathology'' Alan Brown and Matthew K Higgins studied the relationship between [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein glycoproteins] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_parasite malaria parasite].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Many pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, use carbohydrate-binding molecules to interact with their hosts.Carbohydrates play an important role in the modification and function of proteins.The new insights on pathogenic carbohydrate-binding molecules provide potential therapeutic targets.Glycoproteins play a key role in pathogen binding to their host cells. Malaria-causing parasites, interact with human [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocytes hepatocytes] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocytes erythrocytes]. This glycoprotein mediated binding is essential for host [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease cell invasion, movement, avoidance of detection by the immune system, and destruction.] 

The malaria parasite recognizes multiple [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialic_acid sialylated proteins] on the erythrocyte surface to bind to the host cell. Two protein families in malaria parasites recognize the sialic acid on the erythrocytes: [http://www.anopheles.org/showabstract.php?pmid=10613703 EBL (erythrocyte-binding like)] and [http://www.anopheles.org/showabstract.php?pmid=19428659 RBL (reticulocyte-binding like).] Both protein families consists of proteins that interact with different membrane protein and lead to different pathways; their function can be either independent or dependent of sialic acid, which enables the pathogen to overcome the diversities among human population.Both these proteins contain a region called [http://www.anopheles.org/showcitationlist.php?keyword=recombinant%20rii RII]. This region is responsible for the ability of the malaria protein to bind to the host cells. EBL and RBL have multiple methods of binding and attack on erythrocytes. This means that it can bind in multiple different ways and avoid destruction by the human immune system.
 
'''EBL Family'''

EBL family is composed of RII region (made of two Duffy-binding like (DBL) domains known as F1 and F2), a C-terminal cysteinerich region and a transmembrane domain.RII region is conservative; it reveals 98% sequence identity across strains from various geographical locations.One of the family members, EBA-175 is better understood by the researchers.

'''EBA-175'''

EBA-175 binds to sialylated membrane glycoprotein of erythrocyte, Glycophorin A. Its importance in invasion pathway has been shown through in vitro experiment where antibodies against EBA-175 inhibit binding to Glycophorin A and block invasion.The RII region  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GYPB EBA-175] recognizes and binds to [http://www.springerlink.com/content/kfc5ahykppvxjrgd/ Glycoprotein A], a glycoprotein on the surface of the host cell. Glycoprotein A has specific [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate carbohydrate] sequences on its surface that are essential for binding to occur. When the malaria parasite binds to Glycoprotein A, it recognizes sialiac acid on the cell’s surface. This is a good method of attack for the parasite as it is unlikely that sialic acid compositions changes. However, slight differences in sialic acid can prohibit attack by the parasite.

Nevertheless, sialic acid alone is insufficient for pathogenic invasion. For instance, Glycophorin B, which shares 11 conserved sialylated O-linked glycans with Glycophorin A, does not bind EBA-175. In fact, certain orientation of the protein chain is required for optimal binding, where EBA-175 is more likely to directly interact with the protein. 

In its crystal form, the two DBL domains of RII region are joined through a three helical linker where two anti-parallel monomers form a dimer. Such structure consists two positively charged channels. Each channels lined with residues from the F1 domain of one monomer and the F2 domain of the other. In solution, though, EBA-175 appears to be concentration dependent in which content ratio of monomer and dimer varies with solute concentration. Thus, it can be proposed that EBA-175 is stable as a monomer and tends to dimerize at high concentrations. 

By co-crystallize EBA-175 with Neu5Ac(a2,3)Gal, researchers are able to detect sugar molecule, locating near the channels of dimer, are coordinated by residues of both monomers. This observation aid in the efforts to locate sialic acid binding site and results in the model where EBA-175 assembles around the Glycophorin A ectodomain (glycoproteins on the surface of the membrane and extends into extracellular space) by interactions with both sialic acid and the protein chain. 

There are also alternative invasion pathways that involve other members from EBL family. In particular, EBA-140 is devoid of charged patches and residues identified as interacting with sialic acid in EBA-175, while it still binds to Glycophorin C in a sialic acid dependent way. Therefore, each member of EBL family seems to have its own sialic acid binding site distinct from others.

'''Cytoadhesion and Evasion of Host Detection'''

Infected erythrocytes become sticky and adhere to uninfected erythrocytes to form clumps known as [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC257977/ rosettes]. This prevents detection and spleen mediated destruction of infected cells allowing the infection to continue to survive in the body. In Malaria targeted pregnant women, the erythrocytes will accumulate and lead to placental inflammation, possibly causing loss of the child. Antibodies that bind to PfEMP1proteins and prevent adhesion in some forms of Malaria suggests PfEMP1proteins as potential therapeutic targets.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD36 PfEMP1]. These PfEMP1 proteins are made of [http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/short/95/11/3594 DBL (duffy binding-like) domains].

'''PfEMP1proteins'''
The PfEMP1 proteins contain large-sized ectodomains made from multiple DBL and CIDR domains. Different PfEMP1 proteins will interact with different receptors. Among PfEMP1 proteins, VAR2CSA is the best understood by the researchers.PfEMP1s switch rapidly to avoid detection in the body. These interact with various proteins ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD36 CD36] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1 ICAM-1]) as well as carbohydrates. One of these PfEMPS1 is [http://malariajournal.com/content/7/1/51 VAR2CSA]. 

'''VAR2CSA'''

The infected erythrocytes by VAR2SCA become specifically avid for 4-sulphated chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) molecules. CSA molecules, especially those that are closely related glycosaminoglycan carbohydrates, show little ability to prevent interactions with VAR2CSA. In addition, the protein chain of CSA molecule does not contribute to the specificity of recognition of the molecule.Structurally, Four out of the six DBL domains from VAR2CSA bind to CSA in isolation. The DBL3X structure has an a-helical structure similar to the EBA-175 DBL domains, only with longer loops. 

When sulphate ions or disaccharides are present, a loop on the concave surface of the domain will form a positively charged patch and sulphate-binding pocket crucial for CSA binding.
Different form EBA-175, VAR2CSA has longer, often disordered, loops and is more versatile. The versatility of VAR2CSA hints that VAR2CSA has a longer length of exposure to immune system in comparison to EBA-175 during invasion process. The structure of the DBL6e domain is similar toDBL3X, but it does not have the sulphate-binding pocket or positively charged patch. It binds to CSA molecule through positive charges on a distinct surface of the domain, a mechanism that shows more versatility than DBL3X. Therefore, it is more likely to be a more exposed part of the intact ectodomain during cell invasion.

The two domains have distinct surface features to interact with CAS molecules. Moreover, they do not have the CSA-binding specificity; rather their affinity for carbohydrates increases with the charge of the carbohydrate. In addition, the ectodomain shows strong ligand specificity where the ectodomain acts as a compacted monomer distinct fromEBA-175.

'''Conclusion'''

Carbohydrate binding molecules are crucial in the life cycle of Malaria pathogen. Both EBA-175 and VAR2CSA use the same DBL domain in binding carbohydrates where the specificity of binding requires multiple domains. EBA-175 needs both protein and carbohydrate components of a dimeric receptor for specificity whereas VAR2CSA requires only carbohydrate for specificity; EBA-175 uses “carbohydrate binding surfaces lining the grooves at dimerization interfaces” whereas VAR2CSA uses “multiple domains from a single monomer to generate a specific binding pocket”. Studies of the carbohydrate-binding proteins and deeper understanding of their structures can provide useful information on pathogenic pathway as well as potential therapeutic targets in the future.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">All cells need to acquire the molecules and ions that they need from their surrounding extracellular fluid.  There exists an exchange of molecules and ions in and out of the cell wall, as well as in and out of membrane-bounded intracellular compartments such as the nucleus, ER, and mitrochondria.  Examples of substances that exchange through the membrane include glucose, Na&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, ATP, mRNA, etc.  The lipid bilayer of cell membranes is impermeable to large and polar molecules but permeable to water molecules and other small uncharged molecules like O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. To solve this problem, the cell membrane contains proteins that are selective for unique, water soluble molecules. Continuous protein pathways are composed of '''carrier proteins''',  '''channels''' and '''pumps'''. The transport may be '''active transport''' by carrier proteins with an energy source, or it may be '''facilitated diffusion''' or '''passive transport''' via channels. A cell's activity depends on what biochemical reactions it may complete, and these reactions are dependent on the compounds extracted from the extracellular fluid. The array of transporters expressed in any given cell defines the cell's function and effectiveness.

==Quantifying Free Energy Stored In Concentration Gradients==
The process or movement of any molecule or ion moving down or up a concentration gradient requires a change in free energy. Understanding free energy is the heart of understanding how molecules are transported and/or behave in a concentration gradient. From the second law of thermodynamics molecules spontaneously move from a higher concentration to lower concentration. The availability of free energy is one of the factors that determine if a molecule will move across a membrane, the other being the permeability of the molecule in the lipid bilayer.
The free energy change in the transportation of an uncharged species from one side of a membrane containing a concentration of x1, to another side of a membrane containing a concentration of x2 is given as followed:

ΔG (x) = RT ln (x2/x1) = 2.303 RT log10 (x2/x1)

R: The gas constant, 8.314 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

T: Temperature 

x: Concentration

ΔG: Free Energy

At 25° (298K), ΔG is +11.4 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (+2.7 kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), indicating that this transport process requires an input of energy.

For charged species, an electrical potential is generated by an unequal distribution of ion charges across the membrane because “like” charges will be repelled. Taking the sum of the electrical terms and the concentration, electrical potential, generates the general expression.

ΔG (x)  = RT ln (x1/x2) + Ζ F ΔV = 2.303RT log10 (x2/x1) + Ζ F ΔV

Ζ: Electrical charge of the transported species.

F: Faraday’s constant 96.5 kJ V&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

ΔV: Potential in volts across the membrane.

When ΔG is positive the transport is active, an input of energy is needed to move a molecule up a concentration gradient, contrary to ΔG being negative the transport is passive, which means that such molecules will pass through a membrane down their own gradient, simple diffusion.

=Passive Transport=
[[Image:Diffusionofonesolute.jpg|thumb|Passive diffusion of one solute across a membrane]]
Passive transport is the moving of biochemicals across membranes of cells without the use of chemical energy.  The four main types in include diffusion, facilitated diffusion, filtration and osmosis.  

'''Diffusion''' is the process by which molecules migrate over the cell membrane from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration.  When the amounts of molecules become stabilized, this state is called equilibrium.  This occurs through random molecular motion.  

A '''diffusion coefficient''' is a factor of proportionality that represents the amount of substance diffusion across a unit area through a unit concentration gradient in unit time.  It is represented with a D and is based on Fick's law of diffusion.  

There are 2 kinds of diffusion:

1) Tracer diffusion is the spontaneous mixing of molecules that occurs in absence of a concentration gradient.  This diffusion takes place under equilibrium 

2) Chemical diffusion occurs in the presence of a concentration gradient.  It will result in a net transport of mass.  The overall system will increase in entropy and it gradually moves closer to equilibrium until it is reached.  

Other types of diffusion include:

*'''Osmosis''' is the diffusion of water through a semi-permeable membrane.  Water will move from an area with a higher concentration of water to the other side of the membrane with a lower concentration of water.  Osmosis is very important in biological systems because many membranes are semipermeable.  They are impermeable to organic solutes (i.e. large molecules) but are permeable to water and small uncharged solutes.  Permeability does not only depend on size, but also depends on solubility properties, charge and chemistry.Further information: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Osmosis]

*'''Atomic diffusion''' is a diffusion process that incorporates the random thermally-activated movement of atoms in a sold, which eventually results in the net transport of atoms.  Examples include how a Helium atom inside a balloon can diffuse through the wall of the balloon.  The balloon will eventually deflate.

*'''Brownian motion''' is the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid (could be liquid or gas).  There is also a mathematical model that is used to describe such random movements.

*'''Collective diffusion''' is the diffusion of a large number of particles.  This usually takes place within a solvent.  This is different form the brownian motion because it is the diffusion of a single particle and the interactions between the particles may need to be considered.

*'''Eddy diffusion''' is also called &quot;turbulent diffusion.&quot;  It is any diffusion process by which substances are mixed in the atmosphere or in any fluid system due to eddy motion.

*'''Effusion''' is the process in which individual molecules will flow through a hole without collisions between molecules.  It occurs if the diameter of the hole is considerably smaller than the mean free path of the molecules.

==Types of Passive Membrane Transport==
=== Ion Channels ===
Ion channels are proteins that forms water-filled pores through membranes, which allow specific ions to passively transport down the electrochemical gradient. For instance, the ion channels commonly found throughout the human body include Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels. These passive transport ion channels make use of the electrochemical potential to drive physiological processes, such as nerve impulse. The electrochemical potential is maintained by various active transport mechanisms, such as the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase.

The selectivity of the ion channels arise from the amino acids formation from which the protein is formed. Two main criteria determine what ions pass through these channels unimpeded: diameter of the pore and the electrical properties of the amino acids. The ion channels essentially forms a hole through the lipid bilayer of the membrane. The diameter of the hole helps determine which substances are allowed to pass through the channel. Only ions of an appropriate size will be able to pass through the hole of a specific ion channel. The observation that some larger ion channels only permit a specific ion to pass while smaller ions do not is based on the energetics of dehydrating the ion as it passes. The arrangement of amino acid carbonyl groups inside channels dictate the passage: the arrangement of the carbonyl groups is so that the dehydration energy costs are lowest for certain hydrated ions. Thus a larger pore has a favorable arrangement for larger hydrated ions, whereas a smaller hydrated ion passing through would require more energy to dehydrate. In potassium channels, this dehydration region that mediates the passage of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions is known as the ''selectivity filter''.

In addition to the diameter of the pore, the electrical properties of the amino acid help determine which ions are allowed to pass through the ion channel. If the amino acids facing the inside of the pore are negatively charged, then only cations can pass through the channel. Anions will be repelled away from the negatively charged amino acids in the channel due to charge repulsion. Conversely, anions will be able to pass through channels lined with positively charged amino acids.

There are some inherited ion-channel diseases.  Some include:
-Chloride-channel diseases include cystic fibroses and inherited tendency to kidney stones.  
-Potassium-channel diseases include some inherited life-threatening defects in the heartbeat, a rare inherited tendency to epileptic seizures in the newborn and several types of inherited deafness.  
-Sodium-channel diseases include inherited tendency to certain types of muscle spasms and Liddle's syndrome.

=== Porins ===
[[Image:Sucrose porin 1a0s.png|thumb|Side view, illustrating the antiparallel beta barrel structure.]]
Porins are a type of membrane proteins what form a beta-barrel pore across the lipid bilayer. Unlike other protein transport channels, the pores from porins are large enough to allow passive diffusion. As a result of the large diameter, porins generally mediate the diffusion of small metabolites, such as amino acids, sugars, and ions. 

The general structural properties of various porins are the same, regardless of their type. Porins are proteins composed primarily of beta-sheets, connected in the anti-parallel direction. Sixteen to eighteen strands of beta-sheets fold into a cylindrical tube, which is labeled as the beta-barrel. The amino acid sequence is roughly an alternating pattern of non-polar and polar residues, which are positioned in an appropriate way as to generate the tertiary barrel structure. This beta-barrel is located in the lipid bilayer, forming the large hole into the cell. As a result of these interactions, the amino acids facing the outside of the beta-barrel are generally nonpolar, to interact with nonpolar region of the lipid bilayer. However, the inside of the beta-barrel typically contains polar amino acids, to interact with the aqueous environment connecting the two sides of the membrane.

Porins are also found in the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria. Gram negative bacteria contain an outer membrane that helps keep out unwanted chemicals, as well as increase virulence. The porins facilitate the diffusion of small molecules and nutrients through the outer membrane and into the periplasm.

=== Ionophores ===
Ionophores are molecules that help transport ions from a hydrophilic environment into a hydrophobic environment. In other words, ionophores are ion carriers that help transport hydrophilic ions across lipid bilayer membranes. There are two broad mechanisms by which ionophores transport ions across cell membranes: carrier and channel forming. 

In the carrier mechanism, the ionophore forms a complex with the ion. The ionophore wraps around the ion with its polar interior. The exterior of the ionophore-ion complex is primarily hydrophobic, thus allowing the complex to cross the hydrophobic cell membrane. The carrier ionophore basically shields the ion’s charge from the environment by solvation. 

For the channel forming mechanism, the ionophore induces a hydrophilic channel through the lipid bilayer membrane. The formation of this polar pore allows ions to cross through the cell membrane.
Ionophores can be used as antibiotics due to its ability to disrupt the transmembrane electrochemical gradient. This electrochemical gradient is essential in driving metabolic processes. Without the gradient, there would be no net movement of ions into and out of the cell, essentially disrupting normal cellular processes. Ionophores disrupt the electrochemical gradient by allowing ions to freely diffuse across the cell membrane, either by forming complexes or channels. This free diffusion disrupts the normal ion balance between cytoplasm and the extracellular environment, thus eliminating the electrochemical gradient.

==Facilitated diffusion==
'''Facilitated diffusion''' occurs in almost all cells. Facillated diffusion of ions takes place through proteins or assemblies of proteins that are embedded in the plasma membrane.  These proteins are water-filled channels through which ions can pass down their concentration gradient.  These channels can be either opened or closed, and others can be considered &quot;gated&quot;.  

One critical example is the metabolism of glucose. Glucose molecules cannot pass easily through cell membranes; passive diffusion alone is slow, which can be problematic for cell metabolism. One way nature has solved this problem is by facilitated diffusion (another rapid mode of glucose transport is active diffusion). Like passive diffusion, the movement of glucose is always from a region of high to low glucose concentration and independent of ion coupling. Glucose transport proteins catalyze the reaction of glucose movement across the membrane. Facilitated diffusion of glucose molecules is fast and bidirectional. The actions of glucose transport proteins are analogous to enzyme mediated catalysis. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry#Catalysis]

Facilitated diffusion is a form of passive transport that uses no energy for the transport of molecules and substances through the membranes of cells. It is largely aided by proteins that are an integral part of the membrane. Facilitated diffusion is the spontaneous passage of substances or molecules across a membrane passing through specific transmembrane transport proteins. The hydrophilic substances can avoid contact with the lipid by layer core of the membrane by passing through transport proteins. Some of these proteins function by having a hydrophilic channel that lets through polar molecules. Aquaporins are an example of channel proteins that facilitates the transport of water molecules through the membranes. Other proteins termed carrier proteins grab the molecules and change shapes so as to avoid contact of the molecules with the hydrophobic core and goes through the membrane. Most of the proteins are very specific that is they only transport certain types of substances. 

=== Gated Ion Channels ===
&lt;big&gt;'''Ligand-gated'''&lt;/big&gt;

These ion channels open or close in response to when it binds to a signal molecule or &quot;ligand.&quot;  The ligand is not the substance that is transported when the channel opens.  Some ions are gated by extracellular ligands and others are by intracellular ligands.  

Another type of protein channels are ion channels that lets through ions. Many of them are stimulated by electrical or chemical signals and are called gated channels. The stimulants either open the channel or clothe them. Stimulation of a nerve cell by certain neurotransmitter molecules, for example, opens gated channels that allow sodium ions into the cell.
External ligands bind to a site on the extracellular side of the channel.  Examples include:

- Acetylcholine (Ach) which is the binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at certain synapses.  It opens channels that admit sodium ions and initiate a nerve impulse or muscle contraction.  

- Gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)- binding of GABA at certain synapses allows for the central nervous system to admit chlorine ions into the cell, which inhibits the creation of a nerve impulse.  

- Calcium channels that permit calcium ions to flow into the membrane. These Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions then serve as second messenger internal ligands to initiate various processes, such as activating calmodulin.

External ligands may be regulated by enzymes. In neurosynapses, acetylcholinesterase degrades ACh into recyclable components; GABA is degraded in a similar fashion. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is removed by active transport via an Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; pump. These various ligand removal processes help regulate the overall concentrations and restore membrane asymmetry.

Internal ligands bind to a site on the intracellular side of the channel exposed to the cytosol.  Examples include:

- cyclic AMP (cAMP) ad cyclic GMP (cGMP) which are both called &quot;second messengers&quot;.  They are channels that are involved in the initiation of impulses in neurons responding to odors and light

The channel that allows chlorine and bicarbonate ions in and out of the cell is regulated by ATP.  This channel is defective in patients with cystic fibrosis

&lt;big&gt;'''Mechanically-gated ion channels'''&lt;/big&gt;

- Sound waves bending the cilia-like projections on the hair cells of the inner ear.  They open up, which leads to the creation of nerve impulses that the brain interprets as sound.  

- Mechanical deformation of the cells of stretch receptors open up ion channels leading the to creation of nerve impulses.  

&lt;big&gt;'''Voltage-gated channels'''&lt;/big&gt;

These neurons and muscle cells are &quot;excitable cells&quot;.  Some channels open or close as a response to changes in the charge (measured in volts) across the plasma membrane.  An example is an impulse that passes down a neuron and the reduction in the voltage opens sodium channels in the adjacent portion of the membrane.

=== Carrier Proteins ===
Carrier proteins are membrane-bound transport proteins that bind with specific substrates and changes conformation to carry the substrate across the membrane. Facilitated diffusion occurs by use of carrier proteins. There are several types of carrier proteins: uniport carriers, symport carriers, and antiport carriers. 

'''Uniport carriers''' are carrier proteins that move only one kind of substance across the cell membrane. They work by binding to one molecule at a time and transporting that molecule down its electrochemical gradient. Uniport carriers can be regulated by various mechanisms: voltage, physical, and ligand binding. By the voltage regulation, the uniport carrier opens or closes at a critical difference between transmembrane voltage. For the physical regulation, physical pressure will cause the carrier to open or close. Lastly, for ligand binding regulation, ligands bind to the uniport carrier on either the intracellular or extracellular side to induce opening or closing of the carrier.

Other carrier proteins can carry more than one molecule across the cell membrane at a time. '''Symport carriers''' are carrier proteins that transport two or more different molecules simultaneously across the cell membrane in the ''same'' direction. In contrast, '''antiport carriers''' are carrier proteins that transport two or more different molecules simultaneously across the cell membrane, of which at least one of the molecules are transported in the ''opposite'' direction compared to the others. Generally, these carriers transport at least one molecule down its electrochemical gradient and the other molecules would go against its gradient. The molecules going down the electrochemical gradient will provide the driving potential to push the other molecules against its electrochemical gradient. These types of proteins are classified as secondary transporters, or cotransporters.
[[Image:TransportTypes.png|thumb|]]

Facilitated diffusion by carrier protein transport is ultimately based on the embedded membrane proteins, in contrast with passive diffusion which occurs everywhere in the membrane. In particular, uniport transport and passive diffusion, both of which describe ion movement down concentration gradients across membranes, differ by their maximum rates: uniport transport is limited to and located at the carrier proteins in the membrane.

= Active Transport =

'''Active transport''' in a cell occurs when energy is used to transport molecules across the cell membrane. While passive transport takes advantage of favorable concentration gradients to facilitate ion diffusion through membranes (i.e. moving a protein from high to low concentration), active transport requires energy input because the molecule in question is being moved against the concentration gradient (i.e. moving a protein from low to high concentration). Because this type of movement is &quot;uphill&quot;, meaning that it is thermodynamically unfavorable, energy is needed to compensate for the thermodynamic loss. This ensures that the transport in question is completed successfully and that the cell can obtain whatever nutrients it requires, even if this means moving proteins and ions into areas where their concentration is already relatively high. The ATP used in active transportation may be used either directly or indirectly.  For direct active transport, some transporters will bind ATP directly and use the energy of its hydrolysis to drive active transport and establishes a concentration gradient.  Indirect Active transport will use the energy already stored in the gradient of a directly-pumped ion.  

=== Membrane Pumps ===

The cell makes use of '''membrane pumps''' to help in accomplishing active transport. Pumps can convert free energy into different forms, depending on which form is required by the cell at a given time. This property makes membrane pumps a convenient choice for mediating active transport since they can provide the energy needed to initiate the transport. The two main types of pumps employed by the cell are P-type ATPases and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCs). Both of these pumps are powered by ATP, one of the more common forms of cellular energy. One method by which these pumps can perform active transport is by binding to ATP. This binding, followed by hydrolysis, induces a conformational change in the pump that allows bound ions to be transported across the cell membrane. These pumps can also use active transport to establish favorable concentration gradients for separate transport processes. For example, one pump can create a given concentration gradient by performing active transport on a certain ion, and then another pump can exploit this new concentration gradient by facilitating ion diffusion down the concentration gradient. Thus the cell can couple active transport with passive transport (much like it couples endergonic reactions with exergonic reactions) in order to efficiently use the results of one process to drive another process to completion. 

=== Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pump ===
[[File:Sodium-potassium pump.svg|thumb|]]
The '''Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pump''', also known as the '''Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase''', is an enzyme used by the cell to control the ion gradients in its intracellular media. As the name of the enzyme suggests, the ions it deals with are those of potassium and sodium, which are two of the more common ions present in living systems. In this case, the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pump hydrolyzes ATP in order to supply the energy needed to actively transport Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; out of the cell while bringing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the cell. It is for this reason that most animal cells tend to have a significantly higher concentration of potassium ions than sodium ions; the cell requires this concentration in order to be able to facilitate various cellular processes. The Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pump helps it maintain this concentration by generating the necessary ion gradient.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGJIvEb6x6w&amp;feature=related 

Two other such enzyme &quot;pumps&quot; that are homologs of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pump are the '''Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase''' and the '''H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase'''. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase is responsible for transporting calcium ions (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the cytoplasm of normal tissue cells into the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells. Calcium ions are needed by the muscle cells in order to function at peak efficiency; thus this pump ensures that they receive enough calcium ions to fulfill this requirement. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase pumps large quantities of protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) into the stomach's gastric juices in order to keep the pH less than 1.0. Such a low pH is required because the stomach is responsible for digesting all the foods and fluids that enter it; thus its gastric juices need to be acidic enough to dissolve and break down anything that needs digesting. 

The three aforementioned pumps are all part of a family known as the '''P-type ATPases''', so called because they all form a phosphorylated intermediate during their reactions with ATP. Hundreds upon hundreds of known homologs of these pumps exist within the P-type ATPases, and each plays a definite role in maintaining the functions of the cell.

===Multidrug Resistant (MDR) Pumps===
[[Structural Biochemistry/Outside the Cell|MDR Pumps]] are activated by ATP and are found in microorganisms such as bacteria and cancer cells. The multidrug-resistance (MDR) pumps consist of large proteins that weave through the cell-surface membranes. They work to effectively monitor and prevent unwanted chemicals from entering the cell. Therefore, the microbes have ability to self-defend with MDR pumps. MDR pumps also prevent antibiotics from entering bacteria and chemotherapeutic agents from entering cancer cells. In addition, they are used to spit out the ones that might endanger the bacteria. Administering antibiotics with MDR inhibitors may be a way to circumvent the MDR pumps in bacteria. This explains the uncanny ability of bacteria to defend themselves against antibiotics. MDR pumps can be found in humans, where they have variety of roles that help drugs get to places they need to go. They are also important in membranes in the brain, digestive tract, liver, and kidneys because they move hormones into and out of cells through the membrane (Medicines by Design 15).

For instance, AcrB is a effective MDR in Gram-negative bacteria.  It functions through its three asymmetric protomers, each of which exists as a particular conformation that corresponds to its function in the pump.  The three stages are Access, Binding, and Extrusion.  In the Access stage, substrates enter the protomer's vestibule, with the binding pocket still left in tact.  In the Binding stage, the substrate remains in the vestibule, but the binding pocket expands to better hold the substrate.  Lastly, in the Extrusion stage, the substrate exits via the removal of the central helix.  AcrB serves to export a multitude of drugs out of the membrane, some of which include antiseptics, toxic compounds, and antibiotics.

==Vesicles==
'''Vesicles''' are simply a bubble of fluid within a cell. Specifically, vesicles are a membrane bound sac that aid in transportation and storage of cellular waste or cellular products, metabolism, and buoyancy control. The membrane surrounding the vesicles shares many characteristics with the plasma membrane of the cell. As a result, the vesicle can fuse with the membrane in order to dispose of its contents. 

'''Transport Vesicles'''

These are just a specific type of vesicle with a function of transport. They move molecules, products etc. between the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Two types of proteins are synthesized on the ribosomes present on the Rough ER. From here the transport vesicles take the new proteins to the Golgi apparatus. At the Golgi apparatus the proteins age and mature in order to be transported to their final destination. The proteins always travel around the inside of the cell with transport vesicles. 

'''Lipid Vesicles'''

Also  known as liposomes, these vesicles are aqueous compartments that are surrounded by a lipid bilayer. These vesicles are used to monitor membrane permeability and to deliver chemicals to the cell. Lipid vesicles aid in determining the level of impermeability of a membrane to ions and polar molecules. Ions and polar molecules are trapped in the aqueous compartment of the liposome. The rate of the flow from the inner compartment of the vesicle to the outside solution during membrane transport determines the membrane's impermeability to the ions or polar molecules contained in the inner aqueous compartment. Liposomes are formed by sonicating phospholipids in the presence of an ion, polar molecules or a water soluble substance. 

'''Coated Vesicles''':

These are vesicles that form when emerging buds are detached from the cell membrane. Depending on the formation of the vesicle, the formation of the outer coat may form the vesicle, where in other cases, other enzymes are necessary to form the vesicle. It is an intracellular structure. The outer surface of the vesicle is covered in a lattice or cage like coating of the protein Clathrin. 
 

'''Clathrin''' is a protein that forms a lattice shaped covering on the cytosolic side of the cellular membrane. These cytosolic sides are referred to as coated pits, the first stage of forming coated vesicles. It is made through a process of making subunits called triskelioins. The Triskelioins are a three pronged molecule with three N-terminus regions. They are known as heavy chains, about 192kDa in weight and are bound to light chains, about 30kDa in weight. The invagination of the pit is during the first states of endocytosis and results in a clathrin coated vesicle. Clathrin can self assemble spontaneously and it plays a major role in deforming the budding vesicle. While clathrin is a major player in the deformation, there are other accessory proteins that aid in the assembly and dissembly of the coats.  

'''COP I''' is another protein that coats vesicles during protein transportation. However, this vesicle coat transports from the Golgi apparatus to the Rough Endoplasm Reticulum. Since this is in the reverse of direction of normal transportation, it is known as a retrograde transport. The protein coat is made of large protein sub-complexes that possess 7 unique subunits. 

The protein is known as an ADP Ribosylation Factor dependent adaptor protein. This basically means that they are regulators of vesicle biogenesis. They also aid in the selection of the proteins that are used for the carriers. 

'''COP II''' is very similar to COP I in the fact that it transports proteins, however COP II transports from the Rough ER to the Golgi apparatus and is known anterograde transport. COP II has a coat that is made of 4 unique protein subunits. COP II has three different binding sites that it can complex with other proteins.

Both COP I and COP II are very active in membrane trafficking. They perform the necessary tasks of selecting the correct cargo for the proteins and they change the shape of the phospholipid bilayer into the correct buds and vesicles. 

The anterograde and retrograde transport off set each other to help keep the flow of the membranes and secretions in balance. There is constant recycling going on to maintain the equal amounts of resident proteins in the different pathways.

==Exciting the Membrane==
Semipermeable membranes are often sensitive to charge and voltage across the lipid bilayer. 
Remember, membranes are charged entities so exacting a charge across a membrane
is likely to cause a reaction such as an action potential. An action potential
is generally created at the axon hillock once the membrane is depolarized due to
an increase or decrease of voltage. When the membrane potential goes up, integral proteins in the
membrane called voltage gated ion channels start to open to allow ions into the cell.
While some ion channels allow ions into the cell, other channels let ions out of the cell.
This is most exemplified by the sodium potassium pump. So since sodium ions are flowing into the cell
and potassium is flowing out of the cell, depolarization occurs where the usual membrane potential, called
the resting potential is disturbed. Note that action potentials are all or nothing,
meaning the occurrence of action potentials does not depend on the magnitude of stimulus.
A single action potential can trigger several along the membrane thus propagating
the signal. 

[[Image:actionpotential.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A]]
[[Image:actprop.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A]]

Only certain types of cells have the activity of action potentials. The most important one is the 
neuron. A neuron is a cell in the nervous system that creates messages and sends
signals through electronic excitability through action potentials. The axon hillock
is the part of the neuron that connects a cell to the axon. This area
has many voltage activated ion channels and is considered to be the key ingredient
to creating the depolarization that exacts an action potential.
[[Image:neuron.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A]]

Neurotransmitters are chemicals that amplify or control the signal between a neuron and another
cell. When neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, they bind to receptors and
cause an action potential which can then trigger other neurons to do the same creating
a surge of energy across a group of neurons that carry out a specific process. This
overall process is called neurotransmission. Action potentials can be transferred from 
one cell to an adjacent cell because of direct connection of these cells through
gap junctions. Channels and other membrane proteins make sure that action potentials only
travel one direction. Some cells need no stimulus to fire action potentials while others
need an external stimulus. For example, the pacemaker cells in the heart maintain a rhythm
that can be changed and altered with external stimuli such as a shock to the body. While sensory neurons like
the ones in your eyes that sense light are excited by external source which then provokes
action potentials. This is the same for cells in the ear that are sensitive to sound.

Several chemicals block neurotransmitter binding by competitively binding to the receptors. Substances such as curare or atropine, dubbed antagonists, compete with neurotransmitters, specifically acetylcholine (ACh), binding to and preventing the ligand-gated channels from opening and allowing ions to flow, thus preventing the generation of action potentials. In a natural environment, this competitive inhibition leads to paralysis and death. In a controlled environment, these antagonists can be used to prevent muscle spasms or convulsions during surgery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background:==

Online stock trading sites have experienced a steady increase in use and popularity due to simplicity. People are able to trade their stocks and make their own transactions on the computer, rather than having to call their broker and pay high commissions, which tend to be lower through online investment sites due to the intense competition. Information for such online brokerages is easily accessible for everyone. It is important for investors to take time in deciding which site (of the many) works best for their style of trading because profiting from online trades can be a slow process. 

The internet offers a wide variety of online stock trading sites. With such a large range of options, users are able to find what works best for their style of trading and personal interests. Some of the most used and well known stock trading sites online include: Charles Schwab, E*trade, Fidelity, Firstrade, Muriel Siebert, OptionsXpress, Scottrade, TD Ameritrade, TradeKing, Vanguard, WallStreet*E, Zecco, Venom, Wells Fargo, FxPro, ShareBuilder as well as other helpful and resourceful sites. This causes a high taste for variety among users. Your typical user someone with a moderate amount of money under $100,000 may be looking for a site with specific tools that can give them analysis of stocks and articles related to companies they want to invest in. This typical user will be completely different from another user who may be a day trader. Day Traders have over $25,000 and trade stocks multiple times a day. This differs from the average investor because the other investor will not be making decisions day to day but rather for the long term. The second user will be looking for a trading site that will give him/her the most options and most features in order to ensure a competitive advantage in order to beat the market. This is only one example of how there can be tastes for variety in the market for online stock trading websites. Another type of user would not be very likely to be in the market for online stock trading. This user would be the professional who has limited knowledge and limited time as to how online stock trading works. This user would benefit from the traditional setting of having a broker who will invest his/her money. This type of user would be uninterested in entering into the market of online stock trading sites. 

Wall Street and the trading of company stock has come a long way since the beginning of Wall Street in 1792. In May of that year the Buttonwood Agreement marked the very beginning of Wall Street. Dealers and auctioneers had a meeting under the buttonwood tree where they established a formal exchange for the buying and selling of shares. The market would be more structured and a standard commission for trading would be charged. Those that did not sign the agreement would have to pay a higher commission if they wished to trade.&lt;ref name=Background&gt;{{cite book|Last=Geisst|First=Charles|authorlink=Charles Geisst|title=Wall Street: A History|1997|}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The world of online-brokerage houses has evolved substantially since Datek launched its services in 1996.  Historically, the individual was forced to trade securities through brokers who would control the execution of the transaction while also charging high transaction and management fees. The information and technology that was later developed allowed for an online trading system where investors can not only view their stocks but trade on their own. The model for online-brokerage created a vehicle for the individual to manage their securities portfolios.  This direct interaction between the individual and the markets dramatically increased the number of individuals participating in the market, expanded the retail brokerage market, and also introduced new pressures on the margins of brokerage houses.  Specifically, if an individual is looking to trade securities, why pay $40 per trade through a traditional brokerage when an online brokerage can provide a similar service for $9.99? That said, lower costs demand that online brokers have a sufficient customer base and daily volumes in order to support the business cost structure which includes everything from staff to advertising. 

The benefits offered from online trading are far reaching and this is another example of how the internet and technology have paved the way for increased information. Upon joining an online stock trading website you get benefits instantly. These include graphs, charts, projections and reviews all at the users’ fingertips. Many sites also have how-to tips as well as research tips and analysis of specific trades. Many websites will go over stock trading strategies in a presentation type setting. https://www.tradeking.com/ is an example of this; they have many tools for their users that they claim will give a competitive edge while trading. Many stock trading sites, and www.Zecco.com  in particular, have stock reviews as well as mutual fund profiles to guide in the correct investment decisions. One important thing to note is that the amount that the site charges are a reflection of the user benefits. If you are going for the cheapest website in terms of online trading you will, more likely than not, get very little if any tools to help in your investing goals. Go back 50 years and the same amount of research and analysis took time to accumulate. Online stock trading websites allow people to have access to information that is put together by professional analysts and companies. This type of information would have been extremely difficult to obtain half a century ago. 

==Differentiation:== 

With the success of the early online brokers such as Datek and E-Trade, there was an influx of competitors and the need for differentiation became apparent between all participants, online and traditional brokerage houses.  Because of all the options to the consumer, all players must differentiate in order to reduce customer churn.  Examples of differentiation range from trade-able securities, to fees, to quantities of information and analysis.  Most sites now allow customers to trade common stock, options, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), index funds, etc.  Fee and commission structures typically will vary based on the type of execution desired whether its limit, option, or margin trading.  Online-brokerages also have increased the breadth of research tools available to its consumers.  For example, an account with Ameritrade offers a stock screener, analyst recommendations, option chain analysis, charting tools, and industry multiple comparisons.  Online-brokers even have educational material which allows the customer to learn more about trading, strategy, and market analysis.

When it comes to differentiating yourself from your competitors in the online stock trading world, a few options are possible. Referring to the Online Stock Trading Review from toptenreviews.com, the site displays reviews from consumers and online traders about what is most valuable to them and how each online brokerage tends to differentiate itself from competing firms.  One way to make a site more appealing than a competitor’s is to avoid account maintenance fees. The fees and commissions portion of differentiation tends to be a large deal breaker to potential users. This policy will make low income consumers back away but then again consumers want the best deal possible. The fees/commissions which are mostly reviewed are market trades, limit trades, option trades, minimum account balances, and margin rates. Having a tiered commission structure is also another key feature in some sites. Another important feature that differs among competitors is the amount or type of investments offered.  Reviews show that most users prefer to have options of such investments: Stocks, Options, Mutual Funds, Exchange-Traded Funds, International Stock Exchange, Forex, Retirement Accounts, and Educational Savings Plans. Not only are users looking for low prices, but also a menu of options for investing.  Simplicity is yet another way for sites to differentiate themselves, and providing trading or investment tools is helpful for those who are looking for an easy route to online trading. Popular tools for these sites tend to be: calculators, alerts, virtual trading, Level I and Level II quotes, automated trading, charts and graphs, criteria based search tool/screeners, options chain/string, analyst research reports, and watch lists. A recent addition to optional tools demanded by some potential customers happens to be mobile tools. Not all of the top online trading sites offer this feature, but with the advancement of options with mobile phones continuing, more users are looking for this easily accessible alternative.

If the market for online stock trading sites is rather full of commodity businesses, then the bottom-line to the consumer is typically price and execution.  In managing securities, one hopes to be able to execute trades quickly and efficiently at the lowest possible cost. The hope of the brokerage house is that by providing the greatest breadth of services, customers will be less likely to switch to a competitor. This strategy may also fall into differentiation, but it would be a very mild form of it if this was the extent of the differentiated product. 

Barry L. Ritholtz explained in his article titled “On Line Trading: A Business Plan for the future” that when you look past the price war in online trading, what is necessary to differentiate oneself from competitors is really a better business model. He mentions that a firm which can distinguish itself with a better business model can be more successful than other online brokers. He presents a series of ideas which will help achieve this type of business model, and these ideas include: Advertising, Blog, Commentary, Database, Education, and Fund. For more information on Ritholtz’s article and details of the business model, visit: http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/06/on_line_trading.html.

When using a strategy to differentiate in a sense of focus and changing what to offer consumers, the idea is to essentially target and/or create a smaller market. This can lead to a repositioning of competition from direct to indirect when it comes to information goods such as online stock trading sites. In a blog about business strategies from tutor2u.net, the explanation of this type of differentiation is written as “In the differentiation focus strategy, a business aims to differentiate within just one or a small number of target market segments. The special customer needs of the segment mean that there are opportunities to provide products that are clearly different from competitors who may be targeting a broader group of customers.&quot; Although this may not be the most precise definition of the strategy, it seems to sum up the plan of a business intending to place themselves into a smaller market. The idea is to make their specific online trading site more appealing to a certain group of consumers than any other site which they are indirectly in competition. By offering different, not necessarily better, tools and options, the business can target a smaller yet dependable group of consumers. Differentiation can allow a business in the information goods market to offer some consumers new options and meet needs that the other competing firms cannot. 

Although previous paragraphs have mentioned the different options online stock trading sites can offer in order to create a type of differentiation (tools, fees, simplicity and such), it might be appropriate to look at differentiation from an easier perspective. An almost too simple yet very straight forward example of this form of differentiation can be seen with ice cream shops (although it does not relate to online stock trading sites whatsoever). In this market, almost all ice cream shops carry the same flavors in order to target a broad group of consumers. However, not all consumers may want the ordinary and everyday flavors. If one business in the market were to change their offering by making different (not always better) flavors, then they could possibly place themselves in a smaller market for those customers who prefer new and different flavors. By differentiating themselves with their menu, they will most likely not appeal to the broad market they were once in, but they could secure a group of consumers who are looking for a product just like theirs. Although they are still competing as an ice cream shop, it can be seen as indirect because the offered product is unlike the product of the competition. 

When it comes down to it, it is difficult to draw fine lines between online stock trading sites for differentiation, and it could be true that consumers outside of the “smaller market” also find these features appealing. Quite a few businesses in this market offer similar features, making it hard to differentiate because of the market they are in (various information goods can be simply too difficult to differentiate with aside from basic features). But, if it were possible to change what the site is offering aside from the fundamental features seen in the Online Stock Trading Review, then perhaps an information goods business would be successful in a smaller market with indirect competition. 

==Emergence of Day Trading and Firms entering the Market==

After the emergence of the first Online Stock Trading Site, Datek, there has been lots of competition among firms to enter the market and secure market share. After Datek’s debut online trading and reduced fees became extremely attractive and according to researchers the number of online firms increased from 12 to 140 in a 7 year span. This is also when the career and popularity of day trading came about. With online trading sites day traders can now do trades from home and take advantage of a whole new way to earn a living. 
Day Traders have also contributed to a lot of volatility in the market in the 1990s. There was a large amount of volume added to the market in the 1990s also due to day trading. From 1994/5 - 2001 the volume in the stock market tripled according to stock-trading-warrior.com
Day Traders created a whole new market for firms to make money and firms benefited greatly from the increased volume. Also charging per trade is perfect for companies because many day trading strategies involve entering into positions to capture the movement of the stocks on a particular day, hence the term day trader. The fee per trade allowed for companies to capture fairly significant margins on each trade made from their site. The firm pays a very small percentage of the fee to execute the actual trade, this is why some sites can only charge $3 a trade. 
Firms moved quickly to create websites where investors could go to manage their own investments and take advantage of the new connection to the market previously reserved for professional investors and fund managers. This is a large change since the beginnings of Wall Street where only members could trade stocks and there were a very small number of them. 

==Why is online trading so popular?==

A core reason for this growing popularity of online trading is the demand from stock traders to reduce operating costs, seeing that many people want to avoid the charges of a stock broker’s commission fees. Due to technology, this form of trading is now possible and widely used for its cheaper deals. 

Traditional brokerage requires you to call your broker every time you want to buy or sell any particular stocks.  Furthermore, it may involve some type of conversation in which the broker questions whether the investment is suitable given the investors situation.  As such, there is a delayed execution which can represent a potential loss of gains or potential increase of losses. Not to mention greater fees. 

Thus, the popularity of online brokerage has also primarily derived from the ability to execute trades as desired without going through a third party.  Furthermore, the cost to execute these trades is at a significant discount, and the information made available through online brokerages in terms of tools and analysis have vastly improved over the years.  That being said, individuals can utilize both the traditional and online brokers to optimize their capabilities.  Specifically, it is assumed that there remains some information that is held by a traditional broker which is unavailable to the online brokerage house.  This information could be derived from analyst research or industry contacts that give a broker an edge over information available to the masses. 

Therefore, to take advantage of both options, there are some people that will retain their traditional brokerage accounts to gain access to proprietary information while also keeping a personal online brokerage account to maintain trading control.  An additional reason to maintain a traditional brokerage is for access to new offerings (IPOs) and for thinly traded securities.  Traditional brokerage houses can gain access to public offering allotments, and for low-volume stocks a broker can help pair up the buyer and seller.  

When it comes down to it, online trading is known for its low costs and its speedy execution. With a growing culture of people working from home, online stock trading seems to be the optimal choice for potential users.  Simplicity, the option of multi-tasking, and the “anytime, anywhere” effect of these sites make the idea even more appealing.

===The Document Window===
Slides Tab: 
[[File:PP1_-_slides_tab.jpg]]
Outlines Tab: 
[[File:PP1-Outline_Tab.jpg]]
[[File:PP1-Window_Panes.jpg]]

===Create a title Slide===
*Start in a new document
*The first slide that appears is a title slide.  It has a place for a title and a subtitle.  Usually the title is the subject of your presentation, and the subtitle would be the presenters name.
====Text on Slide 1====
*Type in the title for this presentation: '''CLASSROOM SUCCESS'''
*Click into the Subtitle place holder and type in: ''Presented by''
*Press enter and type in: '''your name'''

===Selecting a Document Theme===
Themes add color and style to every slide in your presentation in a consistent and unified fashion.  
*Go to the Design Tab
*Find the Theme group
*Click the MORE button to show the Theme Gallery
*Hover over a theme to see a preview
*Click on a theme that matches the content of your presentation

NOTE: you can change the theme at any time. It is also a good idea to get your content in first and then apply the theme after so you are not distracted by the colors.  The content is the most important thing.

===Adding New Slides===
Once you have the first slide created you are ready to add more slides. 
*Go to the HOME tab
*Click on the NEW SLIDE button
**The top part will create a new Text and Content slide
**The bottom will allow you to choose the style of slide to create. 
*Click on the top or choose Text and Content for a standard slide.

===Create a Bulleted List===
&lt;P&gt;By default the Text Slide has a bulleted list in the bottom portion.  
&lt;P&gt;If you needed to create a section with a bulleted list you would:
*Go to the Insert tab
*Go to the TEXT group
*click on TEXT Box
*Click on your slide
*Go to the HOME tab
*Go to the PARAGRAPH group
*click on the BULLETS button
&lt;P&gt;Type in your text for the first line item in your list
*Press enter to go to the next line
*Press TAB to Increase the level of the indent
**TAB increases the indention level or demotes it or makes it a lower-level paragraph
**SHIFT+TAB decreases the indention level or promotes it or makes it a higher-level paragraph

====Text on Slide 2====
'''Get Organized'''
*Time management
*Scheduling
*2 to 1
====Notes on Slide 2====
&lt;p&gt;Time management skills help balance academic, work and social events

&lt;p&gt;Make mental Summaries of material
&lt;p&gt;Be Prepared for class
&lt;p&gt;Review – notes from your book, and from the previous class
&lt;p&gt;Preview material covered that day

====Text on Slide 4====
'''Exam Strategies'''
*Review for a week
**No cramming
***Short-term memory
*Read Whole Test
**Start what you know
***Think positively
***Stay focused
====Notes on Slide 4====
&lt;p&gt;Review for a week – that is 20 minutes a day for 7 days
&lt;p&gt;No cramming this is not effective – you will not remember, it causes stress and sleep deprivation
&lt;p&gt;Short-term memory
&lt;p&gt;Read Whole Test from cover to cover
&lt;p&gt;Start what you know the best and move to what you know lesser
&lt;p&gt;Think positively if you know your going to fail – you will
&lt;p&gt;Stay focused, don’t daydream, answer the question asked. 
&lt;p&gt;Scope creep – talking about more than what the question asks you to

===Add Graphics to the Slides===
Graphics are a nice way to show the listeners what you are going to talk about.  They should be used to enhance the meaning and bring attention to the main focus.  They should not be used just because you can.  
====To add a clip art====
*Go to the INSERT tab
*Click on the CLIP ART button to open the task pane
*Type in a keyword in the Search For box and press enter. 
*Click on the clip art you want to place into the slide. 
*Use the re-size handles and move the clip art so it looks &quot;nice&quot; on the page
**The page is balanced
**It is not on top of any of the text
**It is big enough to see, but not so big it overpowers the text
====To add a picture====
*Go to the INSERT Tab
*Click on the PICTURE button
*Browse to find the picture where you saved it
*Double click on the picture
*Use the re-size handles and move the clip art so it looks &quot;nice&quot; on the page
**The page is balanced
**It is not on top of any of the text
**It is big enough to see, but not so big it overpowers the text
===Spell Checking===
Once you have created all the slides for your presentation you need to go back and look at each one.  This will let you see inconsistencies.  You should also read each slide out loud, you will find more grammatical errors that way.    Finally you should run a spell checker on it.  
*Go to the REVIEW tab
*Click on the ABC Spelling button and it will spell check the entire document.

===Display Presentation in Grayscale===
If you are going to print the presentation out on a black &amp; white printer, you should view the presentation in grayscale first to see how it will print.  There are times you will place graphics behind your text and it will look fine in color, but in grayscale you will not be able to read it.  
*Go to the VIEW tab
*Go to the COLOR/GRAYSCALE tab
*Click on the Grayscale button

You might want to check out the Pure Black and White view as well.

===Printing A Presentation===
Like with any document it is a good idea to print preview your document prior to printing. 

====Print Preview====
*Click on the Office Button
*Hover over Print
*Click on Print Preview
*Go to the Page Setup group
*Set the Print What to the style you want to print. 

====SLIDES====
Prints one slide per page and the one slide take up the entire page.  This is a good view for final editing if you have placed items on the slide with detail. 

====HANDOUTS====
*1 per page -  Shows one slide per page with a blank section at the bottom
*2 per page - Shows two slides per page and takes up most of the page
*3 per page - Shows three slides vertically on the left with a set of lines on the right for a person to take notes in.
*4 per page - Shows four slides per page and takes up most of the page
*6 per page - Shows six slides per page and takes up most of the page
*9 per page - Shows nine small slides per page and take sup most of the page

====NOTES PAGES====
Prints one slide per page at the top, and then prints all the notes you have entered for the slide at the bottom of the page.  This is a great view to print for when you are giving your presentation. 

====OUTLINE====
Prints the same outline that shows up on the Outline Tab.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== usage ===

Defining your own module (roughly comparable to a macro or a function in other languages) is a powerful way to reuse procedures.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 module hole(distance, rot, size) {
     rotate(a = rot, v = [1, 0, 0]) {
         translate([0, distance, 0]) {
             cylinder(r = size, h = 100, center = true);
         }
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, passing in the parameters distance, rot, and size allow you to reuse this functionality multiple times, saving many lines of code and rendering your program much easier to read.

You can instantiate the  module by passing values (or formulas) for the parameters just like a C function call:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 hole(0, 90, 10);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== children ===

The child nodes of the module instantiation can be accessed using the children() statement within the module. The number of module children can be accessed using the $children variable.

''Parameters''

; empty : select all the children
; index : integer. select one child, at index value. Index start at 0 and should be less than $children-1.
; vector: vector of integer. select children with index in vector. Index should be between 0 and $children-1.
; range:  [&lt;start&gt;:&lt;end&gt;] or [&lt;start&gt;:&lt;increment&gt;:&lt;end&gt;]. select children between &lt;start&gt; to &lt;end&gt;, incremented by &lt;increment&gt; (default 1).

'''Deprecated child() module'''

Up to release 2013.06 the now deprecated &lt;code&gt;child()&lt;/code&gt; module was used instead. This can be translated to the new children() according to the table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! up to 2013.06 !! 2014.03 and later
|-
| child() || children(0)
|-
| child(x) || children(x)
|-
| for (a = [0:$children-1]) child(a) || children([0:$children-1])
|}

'''Examples'''

Transfer all children to another module:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 // rotate to other center point:
 module rz(angle, center=undef) {
   translate(center)
      rotate(angle)
         translate(-center)
            children();
 }

 rz(15, [10,0]) sphere(30);
&lt;/source&gt;

Use the first child, multiple time:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 module lineup(num, space) {
   for (i = [0 : num-1])
     translate([ space*i, 0, 0 ]) children(0);
 }
 
 lineup(5, 65) sphere(30);
&lt;/source&gt;

If you need to make your module iterate over all children you will need to make use of the $children variable, e.g.:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 module elongate() {
   for (i = [0 : $children-1])
     scale([10 , 1, 1 ]) children(i);
 }
 
 elongate() { sphere(30); cube([10,10,10]); cylinder(r=10,h=50); }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== arguments ===

One can specify default values for the arguments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 module house(roof=&quot;flat&quot;,paint=[1,0,0]){
   color(paint)
   if(roof==&quot;flat&quot;){
     translate([0,-1,0])
     cube();
   } else if(roof==&quot;pitched&quot;){
     rotate([90,0,0])
     linear_extrude(height=1)
     polygon(points=[[0,0],[0,1],[0.5,1.5],[1,1],[1,0]],paths=[ [0,1,2,3,4] ]);
   } else if(roof==&quot;domical&quot;){
     translate([0,-1,0])
     union(){
       translate([0.5,0.5,1]) sphere(r=0.5,$fn=20);
       cube();	
     }
   }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

And then use one of the following ways to supply the arguments

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 union(){
   house();
   translate([2,0,0]) house(&quot;pitched&quot;);
   translate([4,0,0]) house(&quot;domical&quot;,[0,1,0]);
   translate([6,0,0]) house(roof=&quot;pitched&quot;,paint=[0,0,1]);
   translate([8,0,0]) house(paint=[0,0,0],roof=&quot;pitched&quot;);
   translate([10,0,0]) house(roof=&quot;domical&quot;);
   translate([12,0,0]) house(paint=[0,0.5,0.5]);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;font size=3&gt;
*The first meter was used in the country in 1931. 
*Nearly all Colombian meter stamps contain a license number (with prefix LIC or L.C.) rather than a meter number. Later meters, especially the Pitney Bowes, displayed both. A few stamps are found with identical license and meter numbers.
*Some stamps are designed specifically for airmail with &quot;AEREO&quot; inside the frank (Types A4, A5, A9, etc) and others for surface mail use with &quot;COMUNICACIONES&quot; inside the frank (Types A1-A3). The airmail stamps are printed in red while the surface stamps are printed in blue. Occasionally the two types of stamps are found on the same mail piece.
*The stamps are grouped by appearance and usage:
:: '''A'''   - Frank with simulated perforation outer border
:: '''B'''   - Frank with only partial or no exterior border
:: '''C'''   - Frank with straight-line border
:: '''PO'''  - Special stamp for Post Office use&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Comoros=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;Previously administered as part of the French territory of Madagascar, in 1947 Comoros became a separate French territory that included the island of Mayotte. In 1975 the Comoros Islands, less Mayotte, gained independence and became the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros. Although the United Nations in 1979 declared Mayotte to be under Comoros sovereignty, in all practical terms the island remains a French territory and is cataloged separately under MAYOTTE. The earliest meter seen with “COMOROS” in the frank is from 1972.

* The stamps are divided into two groups based on the political status:
:: '''A''' - French territory
:: '''B''' - Islamic Federal Republic&lt;/font&gt;

Listed here are companies known to have manufactured at least one postage meter used at some point to frank actual mail. Manufacturers of machines that were tested on dummy mail only and never saw commercial use are not listed.

The list is not meant to include companies that are only distributors or representatives of meter manufacturers and not manufacturers themselves, but some may have slipped in.

The country name in parenthesis is where the company is/was located. If two country names are shown, the second is where the machine was used if not in the country of origin. Example: Ohmer Fare, a company located in the United States, had only one machine placed into service, and it was in South Africa.

To view this page in romanized Manchu, visit [[Manchu/Lesson_1_-_Pronunciation|this page]].

==The different sounds of the Manchu language==

The Manchu script consists of 24 Manchu letters to write 25 native Manchu sounds, and 10 letters to write sounds found in Chinese (these 10 letters are  k', g', h', ts', dz', zh', sy' cy', jy' xy' and are dealt with in lesson 12). The 24 native Manchu letters include:

{|
|-
|6 vowels:
| a,e,i,o,u,v
|-
|18 consonants:
|n,k,g,h,b,p,s,x,t,d,l,m,c,j,y,r,f,w
|-
|......................................
|......................................
|-
|}

===Vowels===

Manchu has the 6 short vowels mentioned above, two long vowels, 7 diphthongs and 1 triphthong:
{|
|-
|Short vowels: 
|a,e,i,o,u,v
|-
|Long vowels: 
|ii,oo
|-
|Diphthongs: 
|ai,ei,oi,ui,io,ao,eo,
|-
|Triphthong:
|ioi
|-
|......................................
|......................................
|-
|}

===Consonants===

As for consonants, in addition to the 18 consonants mentioned above Manchu has one combined consonant ‘rs’ and two doubled consonants ‘tt’ and ‘xx’.

Notes:

*	Of the 18 consonants, the two that are not pronounced like in English are ‘x’ which sounds like ‘sh’ and ‘c’ which sounds like ‘ch’.
*	The phoneme ‘ng’ is also found in the Manchu language but is not a separate letter.
*	The Manchu script contains front and back versions of ‘k’, ‘g’, ‘h’, ‘d’, and ‘t’.
*       In Manchu transliterations and online the vowel 'v' is also often written as 'ū'
*       In Manchu transliterations and online the consonant 'x' is also often written as 'sh' or 'š'
* No Manchu words start with ‘r’ or two or more consonants. 
* As for endings, Manchu words end in either a vowel or ‘n’. Some loanwords do however end in ‘ng’ e.g. (wang – king). In this respect, it is close to being an open syllable language. 
* There are sometimes clusters of consonants between vowels such as in ‘abka’ (heaven) and ‘ilha’ (flower) but these are the final and initial consonants of two separate syllables. In most words however, vowels are separated by single consonants.


==Syllable structure in Manchu==

The Manchu language has the following syllable structures:

{|
|-
|'''Manchu&lt;br&gt; Syllable&lt;br&gt; Structure'''&lt;br&gt;    
|'''Example'''
|-
|V
|‘a-’ in a-ma (father)
|-
|VV
|‘ai’ what
|-
|VC 
|‘am-‘ in am-ban (official)
|-
|VCC
|‘axx-‘ in axxasun (verb)
|-
|CV
|‘du-’ in du-ka (gate)
|-
|CVV
|‘moo’ (wood)
|-
|CVVC
|‘duin’ (four)
|-
|CVC
|‘den’ (high)
|-
|CVCC
|‘faxx-‘ in faxx-an (effort)
|-
|CVVV
|‘elioi’ (吕 - a Chinese surname)
|-
|}

Out of the above syllable structures, CVVV is extremely rare as it can only occur with the triphthong ‘ioi’; and both VCC and CVCC are also quite rare as they can only occur with one of the two doubled consonants ‘tt’ or ‘xx’ or with the combined consonants ‘rs’.

==Vowel harmony==

The Manchu language is subject to the rules of vowel harmony. This means that only certain vowels can appear together in the same word and that the vowel in the first syllable of a word must be of the same type as the vowel in the second syllable. Note: vowel harmony in Manchu isn’t as strict as in Turkic or Mongolic languages. Manchu vowels fall into the following three categories:

* Front vowels (阴性)		e
* Back vowels (阳性)		a,o,v
* Neutral vowels (中性)		u,i

In theory, front and back vowels can not exist in the same word, although there are some examples of this (ajige - small). However, neutral vowels can exist with both front and back vowels. There are two forms of vowel harmony:


===Vowel harmony within a stem===
This form of vowel harmony involves the vowels within a particular stem (a word with no suffixes) harmonising. In general one word will only have the following combinations of vowels (the first vowel is the vowel in the first syllable):
&lt;!--
{|
|-
|...................................................    
|...................................................    
|-
|‘a’ and one of 
|‘a’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘v’ 
|-
|‘e’ and one of
|‘e’, ‘i’, ‘u’
|-
|‘i’ and one of
|‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘v’
|-
|‘o’ and one of
|‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘v’
|-
|‘u’ and one of
|‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘u’, ‘v’
|-
|‘v’ and one of 
|‘a’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘v’  
|-
|}

|- 
|| X || X || X || X || X ||   || style=&quot;background:#ffde00;&quot; | &lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;v&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
|| X || X || X || X || X || X || style=&quot;background:#ffde00;&quot; | &lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
|| X ||   || X || X || X || X || style=&quot;background:#ffde00;&quot; | &lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
||   ||   ||   || X || X || X || style=&quot;background:#ffde00;&quot; | &lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}


Note: the vowel ‘o’ vary rarely exists in a word with other vowels, and if it does it is nearly always with ‘a’,’v’,’i’ or occasionally ‘e’, but basically never with ‘u’.
The vowels ‘u’ and ‘i’ can go with all other vowels

===Stem-suffix vowel harmony===

Stem-suffix vowel harmony involves the vowels of a stem harmonising with the vowels of whatever suffix is attached to that stem. The rules are a bit different for stems with single, double or multiple syllables:


'''Single Syllable Stems'''
{|
|-
|...................................................

* Note: there are exceptions to the above rules for double syllable stems, but in most cases the above rules hold.


'''Multiple Syllable Stems'''

* In general, stems terminating in 'a', 'e' or 'o' take the corresponding vowel in the suffix. 
* Stems with multiple syllables terminating in 'i' or 'u' and proceeded by 'e' generally take 'e' in the suffix.
* Stems with multiple syllables terminating in 'i' or 'u' and proceeded by 'a', 'u' or 'v' generally take 'a' in the suffix.
* Stems with multiple syllables with 'u' and 'v' generally take 'a' in the suffix.


Notes: 
* Some suffixes such as ‘de’ ‘-bu’ etc are fixed and do not change.
* Some words use the vowels ‘a’ and ‘e’ to distinguish between masculine and feminine concepts, e.g. haha (man), hehe (woman).
* There are two forms of the letters ‘k’, ‘g’, and ‘h’, a back form for the vowels ‘a’,’o’,’v’, and a front form for the vowels ‘e’,’u’,’i’. 
* There are also two forms of the letters ‘d’, and ‘t’, a back form for the letters ‘a’, ‘o’, ‘i’, and a front form for the letters ‘e’ and ‘u’.

===Nouns=== 

Manchu nouns have number and case but do not really have gender. Nouns can consist solely of a stem such as &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〈ᠪᡳᡨᡥᡝ〉&lt;/font&gt; (book), are formed by adding suffixes to other words, or be formed by adding two nouns together such as &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〈ᠠᡥᡡᠨ ᡩᡝᠣ〉&lt;/font&gt; (brothers).

The most common suffixes that can be added to words to form nouns include:


Note, there are 3 hyphens between the stem and suffix in these examples, as well as a single hyphen before all suffixes.

|}


Note: of the above suffixes, the suffixes &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;᠊ᡴᡠ᠈ ᠊ᡴᡡ&lt;/font&gt; are used for instruments, the suffix &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;᠊ᠴᡠᠨ&lt;/font&gt; is used for abstract concepts, and the suffixes &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;᠊ᠰᡳ᠈ ᠊ᠴᡳ᠈&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;᠊ᠵᡳ&lt;/font&gt; are used to denote people by what they do (Gorelova, M. P.198). When adding suffixes to nouns, the final &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〈᠊ᠨ〉&lt;/font&gt; is often dropped.


====Gender of Manchu Nouns====

Nouns usually do not have gender, although some obviously masculine nouns have masculine vowels, while feminine nouns have feminine vowels, e.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡥᠠᡥᠠ&lt;/font&gt; (man), &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡥᡝᡥᡝ&lt;/font&gt; (woman), &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠠᠮᠠ&lt;/font&gt; (father) and &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡝᠮᡝ&lt;/font&gt; (mother).


====Number:====

There are several ways to express the plural in Manchu:

&lt;u&gt;Through the use of the suffix &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;᠊ᠰᠠ 〔᠊ᠰᡝ᠈ ᠊ᠰᠣ᠈ ᠊ᠰᡳ〕&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ᠊᠊᠊ᠰᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - Manchu'''s'''
&lt;u&gt;Through use of one of the suffixes &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;᠊ᡨᠠ᠈ ᠊ᡨᡝ᠈ ᠊ᡵᡳ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
* This is mostly used for family relationships (note final 〈᠊ᠨ〉 is often omitted).
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᠠ᠊᠊᠊ᡨᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - father'''s'''
* The suffix '-ri' is only used with a few words. E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᠠᡶᠠ᠊᠊᠊ᡵᡳ&lt;/font&gt; - grandfather'''s'''/ancestor'''s'''
&lt;u&gt;Through the use of adjectives&lt;/u&gt;
* like &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡤᡝᡵᡝᠨ&lt;/font&gt; (many/all), &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡝᡳᡨᡝᠨ&lt;/font&gt; (all), &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡨᡠᠮᡝᠨ&lt;/font&gt; (a myriad) or verbally with &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡤᡝᠮᡠ&lt;/font&gt; (all)
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡨᡠᠮᡝᠨ ᠵᠠᡴᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - The myriad things


====Case====

Manchu has 5 different cases. Cases can be attached to the proceeding noun or written seperately:

&lt;u&gt;Nominative (no suffix).&lt;/u&gt; 
* This is the natural case and has no suffix. 
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠪᡳᡨᡥᡝ&lt;/font&gt; - book

&lt;u&gt;Genitive &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〔᠊ᡳ᠈ ᠊ᠨᡳ&lt;/font&gt; after &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;᠊ᠩ〕&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/u&gt; 
* This case is used to show the possessive. The suffix &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;᠊ᡳ 〔᠊ᠨᡳ〕&lt;/font&gt; can also be used for instrumental case which shows the means or cause of which something happens. 
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡝᡵᡝ ᠣᠴᡳ ᠮᡳᠨᡳ ᡝᠮᡝ &lt;u&gt;ᡳ&lt;/u&gt; ᠪᡳᡨᡥᡝ&lt;/font&gt; - This is my mother''''s''' book (''Possessive'')
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᠠᡶᠠ ᡤᡠᡵᡠᠨ &lt;u&gt;ᡳ&lt;/u&gt; ᡳᠯᡥᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - The fatherland''''s''' flowers (''Possessive'')
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᡤᡳᠰᡠᠨ &lt;u&gt;ᡳ&lt;/u&gt; ᠠᡵᠠᠮᠪᡳ&lt;/font&gt; - To write '''by means of''' Manchu (''Instrumental'')

&lt;u&gt;Dative/Locative &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〔᠊ᡩᡝ〕&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;
*This case is used to show location or direction (at/to).
* E.g. Direction:  &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡥᠠᡵᠪᡳᠨ &lt;u&gt;ᡩᡝ&lt;/u&gt; ᡤᡝᠨᡝᡥᡝ&lt;/font&gt; - He went '''to''' Harbin (''Dative'')
* E.g. Location:  &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡥᠠᡵᠪᡳᠨ &lt;u&gt;ᡩᡝ&lt;/u&gt; ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠᠰᠠ ᠯᠠᠪᡩᡠ&lt;/font&gt;Harbin '''de''' manjusa labdu - There are many Manchus '''in''' Harbin (''Locative'')
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡤᡝᠮᡠᠨ ᡥᡝᠴᡝᠨ&lt;/font&gt;(Beijing) &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ᡩᡝ&lt;/u&gt; ᠨᡳᠶᡝᠩᠨᡳᠶᡝᡵᡳ ᡳᠰᡳᠨᠠᡥᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - '''In''' Beijing spring has arrived

&lt;u&gt;Accusative &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〔᠊ᠪᡝ〕&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/u&gt; 
* This case is used to make a noun the direct object of an action.
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡳ ᡝᡵᡝ ᠪᡳᡨᡥᡝ &lt;u&gt;ᠪᡝ&lt;/u&gt; ᠮᡳᠨᡳ ᡝᠮᡝ ᡩᡝ ᠪᡠᡥᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - He gave '''this book''' to my mother 
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡨᡝ ᠮᡳᠨᡳ ᡝᠮᡝ ᡳᠨᡝᠩᡤᡳᡩᠠᡵᡳ ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᡤᡳᠰᡠᠨ &lt;u&gt;ᠪᡝ&lt;/u&gt; ᡨᠠᠴᡳᠮᠪᡳ&lt;/font&gt; - Now my mother studies '''Manchu''' everyday.
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠪᡝ ᠮᠠᡶᠠ ᡤᡠᡵᡠᠨ &lt;u&gt;ᠪᡝ&lt;/u&gt; ᡥᠠᡳᡵᠠᠮᠪᡳ&lt;/font&gt; - We love the '''fatherland''' 

&lt;u&gt;Ablative &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;〔᠊ᠴᡳ〕.&lt;/u&gt; 
* This case is used to show point of departure or for comparison.
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠣᠩᡤᠣ ᡤᡠᡵᡠᠨ &lt;u&gt;ᠴᡳ&lt;/u&gt; ᠵᡳᡥᡝ ᠨᡳᠶᠠᠯᠮᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - The people who came '''from''' Mongolia (''Point of departure'')
* E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠨᡳᡴᠠᠨ ᡤᡳᠰᡠᠨ &lt;u&gt;ᠴᡳ&lt;/u&gt; ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᡤᡳᠰᡠᠨ ᠵᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - Manchu is easier '''than''' Chinese (''Comparison'')

==jeruk aku==

Although in spoken Indonesian it is acceptable to say &quot;gelas dia&quot; instead of &quot;gelasnya&quot; and &quot;bolpen kamu&quot; instead of &quot;bolpenmu&quot;, it is incorrect to say &quot;jeruk aku&quot; to mean &quot;my orange&quot;.

really?

masak sih?

gua kok engga yah... hahahha

==Pages needed==
* A page to explain the differences between commercial brewing, microbrewing and home brewing
*A page that will outline the intention of the wikibook - to prevent editing wars between homebrewers and commercial brewers and between imperial and metric system users
* A section on malting
* More information about how yeast work
* A section on how enzymes work in malting and the mash
* A vastly expanded ingredients section, with more info on water chemistry (such as pH and the influences of each brewing salt)
* Much more chemistry. Everywhere.

==Pages needing attention / rework==
* [[Brewing/Glossary]] - there are still many terms that need to be added

==1. Describe the national, state or provincial, AY, Pathfinder, and Christian flags.==

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;

|[[File:Flag of South Africa.svg|thumb|300px|'''National Flag:''' Flag of South Africa]]
|[[Image:Pathfinderflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Pathfinder Flag:''' The Pathfinder flag is made from one of several materials, cotton bunting, rayon, or nylon. The flag is divided through the center both vertically and horizontally making four equal parts. The background colors are royal blue and white alternately sewed together with the upper left hand comer being royal blue. The Pathfinder emblem is centered in the heart of the background. The colors are descriptive of the purposes and ideals of Pathfindering. White means purity, blue means loyalty, red reminds us of the shed blood of Christ (sacrifice), and gold means excellence. The symbols also have meanings. The shield is the protection of God, the sword is his word, the Bible, and the triangle represents completeness. Completeness of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and completeness of the three parts of education (Mental, Physical, and Spiritual).]]

|[[Image:Ayflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''AY Flag:''' The background is red and white, red symbolizing the blood of Christ and white representing purity. In the center, there is a logo that has AY which means Adventist Youth and it has three angels meaning the 3 angels message.]]
|[[Image:Christian flag.svg|thumb|300px|'''Christian Flag:''' The &quot;Christian Flag&quot; is a white flag with a blue canton and a red cross in it. It was designed by Charles Overton in 1897 to represent Protestants of all denominations. The cross symbolizes the crucifixion of Christ.]]

===Current state/provincial flags===
&lt;!-- Find images of all the provincial flags of your country and put them here.  --&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;




&lt;/gallery&gt;
==2. Know how to display the national flag with two other flags under the following situations: a. Camp out/camporee b. Fair c. Pathfinder Day program d. Parade==
1.	When the National Flag is displayed vertically against a wall, the red band should be to the left of the spectator with the hoist or the cord seam uppermost;  when it is displayed horizontally, the hoist should be to the left of the spectator and the band uppermost.&lt;br /&gt;


2.	When the National Flag is displayed next to or behind the speaker in a hall or other meeting place, for example with him on a stage, it must be placed on the speaker’s right hand.  When it is placed elsewhere in the hall or meeting place it should be to the right of the audience as they face the speaker.&lt;br /&gt;


3.	When the National Flag is displayed together with :&lt;br /&gt;

(a)	Any other flags, it must be hoisted first and lowered last;&lt;br /&gt;

(b)	the national flags of other countries, all the flags should be of approximately equal size and must be flown at an equal height, and the National Flag of the Republic of South Africa must be on the right side of the building or platform (that is to say, on the left side from the observer’s point of view);&lt;br /&gt;

(c)	any other flags, not being other national flags, on separate flag staffs, the National Flag must be in the middle or on the left side from the observer’s point of view or at the highest point of the group;&lt;br /&gt;

(d)	any other flags on the same flagstaff, it must be at the top;&lt;br /&gt;

(e)	any other flag on crossed staffs, the National Flag must be to the spectators’ left and its staff must be in front of the staff of the other flag;&lt;br /&gt;

If there is a row of flags, the National Flag must be in the middle or on the left side from the observer’s point of view or at the highest point of the group



The national flag should never be dipped as a sign of respect to a dignitary. The Pathfinder flag, AY flag and Christian flag are dipped when the &quot;eyes right&quot; command is given, but the National Flag should be held vertically.

==4. Explain the meaning of and reason for the National Anthem, and recite the words from memory. ==
Since 1997, the South African national anthem has been a hybrid song combining new English lyrics with extracts of the hymn Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika (God Bless Africa) and Die Stem van Suid-Afrika (The Call of South Africa).
Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika was composed by a Methodist school teacher named Enoch Sontonga in 1897. It was first sung as a church hymn, but later became an act of political defiance against the apartheid government. Die Stem van Suid-Afrika is a poem written by C.J. Langenhoven in 1918 and was set to music by the Reverend Marthinus Lourens de Villiers in 1921. It was the national anthem until 1995.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The lyrics employ the five most widely spoken of South Africa's eleven official languages – Xhosa (first stanza, first two lines), Zulu (first stanza, last two lines), Sesotho (second stanza), Afrikaans (third stanza), and English (final stanza).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==5. Give the rights and responsibilities of a citizen of your country. ==
===Rights===
===Responsibilities===
==6. Have an interview with a local, regional, or national official of your country, and learn about his duties. ==
It is generally easier to get a local official to agree to an interview, though it is often more exciting to interview a more prominent person.  The interview can be accomplished during a club meeting, and multiple Pathfinders can ask questions.  Invite your guest well ahead of time, and make sure everyone in the club is on time.  A visit by an official would be a very good reason to have everyone in the club wear their class A uniforms.  If desired, you can make up several questions ahead of time, writing them on index cards, and distributing them to the members of your club.  But do not be so rigid as to not allow them to ask spontaneous questions.  Having questions prepared ahead of time on index cards are a good way to get things rolling.  Here are some suggested questions:
* Could you describe a typical day at work?
* What is the most difficult part of your job?
* What is the most satisfying aspect of your job?
* To whom do you report?
* How did you get your position?  Were you elected, appointed, or hired?
* How should a young person prepare for a life of public service?

==7. Write a one-page essay or give a two-minute oral report about a famous person in your country. Mention what he has done to gain his recognition. ==
This would be an excellent opportunity to present a worship during the opening exercises of a regular club meeting.  Encourage your Pathfinder to choose a person they are personally interested in.  If they cannot think of anyone themselves, have a list of suggested persons at hand and encourage them to choose from the list.  Famous people might be historical figures, politicians, actors, sports stars, or anyone else.  It would be preferable to choose a person who has been a positive influence on the country.

Although the requirement asks that you &quot;mention what ''he'' has done to gain ''his'' recognition,&quot; this should not be interpreted as excluding women.  Men are not the ''only'' famous people in a country.

==8. Do one of the following ==
===a. Make a list of ten famous quotations from leaders of your country.===
===b. Make a list of ten famous historic places in your country. ===
===c. Make a list of ten famous historic events in your country.===
==9. Describe what you can do as a citizen to help your church and country. ==
The best way to help either your church or your country is by ''getting involved''.  Edmund Burke, an English philosopher summed this up when he said ''&quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;''

In your church, this means that you will show up for services on a regular basis.  It also means you will support it with your tithes and offering, show up for business meetings, and not wait to be asked before you volunteer your services.  If you see something that needs done, ''do it.''  If you do not have the skill to do it, or you think that you need permission first, talk to your pastor, an elder, deacon, or deaconess.  Find your ministry!

For your country, it is much the same.  Show up for public meetings, stay informed about the issues of the day, vote if you are eligible, and pay your taxes fairly and promptly.

==10. Go through the steps of an individual acquiring citizenship in the country and learn how this is done. ==
==11. Know how to explain the process of government in your country. ==
==12. Explain the meaning of this statement Jesus made in Matthew 22:21: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. ==
This verse teaches that governmental authority is to be respected, as long as it does not conflict with the moral obligations of being a Christian.  Government serves a holy purpose; preserving social order, promoting the well-being of its citizens, and protecting their safety.  If you believe that this does not apply today because you see the government as corrupt, you are urged to research the Roman government of the first century A.D. when these words were spoken by Jesus.  Was Herod corrupt?  Was Pilate just?

==13. Explain why laws are established in your country. ==

Hi Keelynnw.  Please don't add answers to the main page of [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Outreach/Christian Citizenship]].  It looks like you are trying to create a version of this honor for South Africa which is great!.  However, you removed the United Kingdom's version when you did that, so I restored it, added a link to the new [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Outreach/Christian Citizenship (South Africa)|South Africa]] version, and then added in the template.  You should do your work on that page rather than on the main page.

Thanks for your contributions! If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to leave a note on my talk page.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:35, 11 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

===Pronouns===


====Personal pronouns====

As with nouns, personal pronouns in Manchu also have different cases. The normal form of Manchu personal pronouns is expressed by using the nominative case. See following table for list of all personal pronouns in the 5 different cases:

* The personal pronoun in the nominative case is the ordinary form of the pronoun, e.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠪᡳ&lt;/font&gt; = I, &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠰᡳ&lt;/font&gt; = you, &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡳ&lt;/font&gt; = he/she/it, &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠪᡝ&lt;/font&gt; = we (excl.), &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᡠᠰᡝ&lt;/font&gt; = we (incl.), &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠰᡠᠸᡝ&lt;/font&gt; = you (plural), &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠴᡝ&lt;/font&gt; = they/them
* For the singular first personal pronoun &quot;I&quot; the different forms are: nominative &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠪᡳ&lt;/font&gt; &quot;I&quot;; genitive &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᡳᠨᡳ&lt;/font&gt; &quot;my&quot;; dative/locative &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᡳᠨᡩᡝ&lt;/font&gt; &quot;to/at me&quot;; accusative &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᡳᠮᠪᡝ&lt;/font&gt; &quot;me&quot;; ablative &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᡳᠨᠴᡳ&lt;/font&gt; &quot;from me&quot;. All the other personal pronouns follow the same pattern. 
* As with Chinese, Manchu has two versions of the 1st plural personal pronoun: an exclusive version &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〈ᠪᡝ〉&lt;/font&gt;, and an inclusive version &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〈ᠮᡠᠰᡝ〉&lt;/font&gt;.
* To express the idea of oneself, you would use the genitive form of the personal pronoun and follow it with the word &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〈ᠪᡝᠶᡝ〉&lt;/font&gt; (body). E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᡳᠨᡳ ᠪᡝᠶᡝ&lt;/font&gt; (myself), &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠰᡳᠨᡳ ᠪᡝᠶᡝ&lt;/font&gt; (yourself).
* The possessive pronoun is formed by adding the suffix &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〈᠊ᠩᡤᡝ〉&lt;/font&gt; after the genitive form of the personal pronoun. E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᡳᠨᡳ᠊᠊᠊ᠩᡤᡝ&lt;/font&gt; (mine). &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡝᡵᡝ ᠪᡳᡨᡥᡝ ᠮᡳᠨᡳᠩᡤᡝ&lt;/font&gt; (this book is mine). 
* The suffix &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〈᠊ᠩᡤᡝ〉&lt;/font&gt; is a possessive suffix which does not change with the rules of vowel harmony. When written it is proceeded by the genitive case and therefore becomes one of &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〈᠊ᡳᠩᡤᡝ〉&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〈᠊ᠨᡳᠩᡤᡝ〉&lt;/font&gt;. In the case of use with personal pronouns, it is already proceeded by the genitive form of the pronoun so remains &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;〈᠊ᠩᡤᡝ〉&lt;/font&gt;. It can be translated as belong to, and is often written separately from the noun. E.g. &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡝᠵᡝᠨ ᠨᡳᠩᡤᡝ&lt;/font&gt; - belonging to the master. 

Now for some examples of the different cases:

'''Nominative'''
* &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ᠪᡳ&lt;/u&gt; ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᡤᡳᠰᡠᠨ ᠪᡝ ᡨᠠᠴᡳᠮᠪᡳ&lt;/font&gt; - '''I''' study the Manchu language 
* &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ᡳ&lt;/u&gt; ᠣᠴᡳ ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᠨᡳᠶᠠᠯᠮᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - '''He''' is Manchu

'''Genitive'''
* &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ᠮᡳᠨᡳ&lt;/u&gt; ᡤᡠᠴᡠ ᠣᠴᡳ ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᠨᡳᠶᠠᠯᠮᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - '''My''' friend is Manchu
* &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ᠮᡝᠨᡳ&lt;/u&gt; ᡝᠮᡝ ᠣᠴᡳ ᠮᠠᡶᠠ ᡤᡠᡵᡠᠨ&lt;/font&gt; - '''Our''' mother is the fatherland

'''Dative/Locative'''
* &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ᠰᡳᠨᡩᡝ&lt;/u&gt; ᠠᡳ ᠪᠠᡳᡨᠠ ᠪᡳ᠉&lt;/font&gt; - What issue do '''you (at)''' have?
* &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡨᡝᡵᡝ ᡝᠮᡠ ᡩᡝᠪᡨᡝᠯᡳᠨ ᠪᡳᡨᡥᡝ ᠪᡝ &lt;u&gt;ᠮᡳᠨᡩᡝ&lt;/u&gt; ᠪᡠᡴᡳ&lt;/font&gt; (to give imp) - Can you please give  this book '''to me'''

'''Accusative'''
* &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠮᠠᡶᠠ ᡤᡠᡵᡠᠨ &lt;u&gt;ᠮᡝᠮᠪᡝ&lt;/u&gt; ᡠᠵᡳᠮᡝ ᡥᡡᠸᠠᡧᠠᠪᡠᡥᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - The fatherland raised '''us (object)'''
* &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠪᡳ &lt;u&gt;ᠴᡝᠮᠪᡝ&lt;/u&gt; ᡝᠮᡠ ᠪᡳᠶᠠ ᠣᠩᡤᠣᠯᠣ ᡨᠠᡴᠠᡥᠠ&lt;/font&gt; - I met '''him (object)''' one month ago 

'''Ablative'''
* &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᡳ &lt;u&gt;ᠮᡳᠨᠴᡳ&lt;/u&gt; ᠵᡠᠸᡝ ᠰᡝ ᠠᠵᡳᡤᡝ&lt;/font&gt; - He is two years younger '''than me'''
* &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;ᠰᡳ &lt;u&gt;ᠮᡳᠨᠴᡳ&lt;/u&gt; ᡨᡠᠯᡤᡳᠶᡝᠨ ᠸᡝ ᡨᠠᡴᠠᠸᠪᡳ᠉&lt;/font&gt; - Apart '''from me''' who do you know?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Parts of a Narrative ==

&lt;h3&gt;Setting the Scene:&lt;/h3&gt;

Setting the scene is a great place to talk about sensory detail.  Try introducing the topic with a short literary story or by asking students to describe the classroom using all their senses.  Using detail can be fun, and it can be a good way to foreshadow the upcoming story.

&lt;h3&gt;Introducing the Complication:&lt;/h3&gt;
One interesting way to map the story arc is using storyboards.  Have the students read part of a graphic novel, such as &lt;i&gt;Persepolis&lt;/i&gt;, and then have students turn their stories into a graphic novel style storyboard.  After setting the scene, something out of the ordinary, that presents a problem for the characters, is usually the next step in the arc.

&lt;h3&gt;Evaluating the Options:&lt;/h3&gt;
In many narratives, there is a moment when the characters stop and evaluate what has just happened.  This give the writer an opportunity to establish the character's feelings, foreshadow upcoming action, and show different characteristics of each character.  To practice, have students get into groups and tell a story about something that happened to them.  Often, the moment just after the complication has been introduced is full of interesting introspection.

&lt;h3&gt;Resolving the Problem:&lt;/h3&gt;
This step, though obvious, can present a problem for students.  Many students do not feel comfortable without a &quot;wrap up&quot; moment at the end of a story.  Remind them that in the real world, not all stories are ended neatly.  Perhaps the resolution is the lack of a resolution, or maybe the resolution is negative.

&lt;h3&gt;The Coda:&lt;/h3&gt;
This is where an argument, moral, or lesson can come in.  If you are pairing an argument with the narrative, this is generally where the argument comes into play.


== Sample Lesson Plan ==

Narrative Argument and Podcast Assignment

&lt;br&gt;Due: Monday, 10/5
&lt;br&gt;Length: 700 words
&lt;br&gt;Submission: Paper Copy, burned CD

Because of the many ways people make arguments, it is important to learn how to use available technology.  Podcasts have become a popular way to reach a variety and large number of people.

In this assignment, you should use a narrative argument to make a point about something people are afraid of.  The narrative will probably be a memoir based on something that happened in your life.  You can use the scary story you wrote as the basis, or you can tell a completely different.  A narrative argument tends to follow this pattern:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Set a scene
&lt;br&gt;Introduce a complication
&lt;br&gt;Evaluation
&lt;br&gt;Resolution
&lt;br&gt;Coda (a lesson, though this does not have to be the typical, heavy-handed lesson)

&lt;br&gt;Once you have completed your final draft, you will turn your essay into a podcast.  In pairs, go to the Digital Learning Collaboratory (HICKS library).  Together, follow the How To: Podcasting handout to create podcasts of your and your partner’s paper.  Then burn the podcasts to a burnable CD.  You will submit the CD along with the narrative essay.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Subject:Electrical engineering|Electrical engineering]] is an extremely broad discipline, and there are many interleaving fields which can be studied to different relative depths. 

Below are the fields represented by the books in this subject.

*'''[[Materials in Electronics]]'''
::This book begins with the basics - the electron. From there it builds up to quantum physics and explains why electronic components, and especially semiconductors, work on the most fundamental level.

*'''[[Semiconductors]]'''
::''Semiconductors'' is the layer above ''[[Materials in Electronics]]'': leading from a slab of silicon through to the vast range of devices available today, from the BJT to the MOSFET.

*'''[[Electronics]]'''
::The classical physics behind electronics: resistance, capacitance, inductance, moving onwards and upwards. This book deals with the plain physics behind such devices, not what you can do with them.

*'''[[Circuit Theory]]'''
::The fundamentals of electrical physics, from Ohm's Law and ideal components to more advanced techniuques such as nodal analysis and network parameters. This book briefly derives the techniques that underpin the understanding of all electronics.

*'''[[Circuit Idea]]'''
::A revolutionary new approach to electrical engineering - ''Circuit Idea'' guides you through electrical engineering by intuition and deep understanding, rather than by formulae and rote.

*'''[[Analogue Electronics]]'''
::This book deals with the electronics associated with continuously variable signals. Mostly concerned with the operation of transistors, op-amps, and other active components, this book picks up where ''[[Semiconductors]]'' left off, weaving the myriad of devices into a useful circuit.

*'''[[Digital Circuits]]'''
::This book introduces the concept of digital electronics as opposed to ''[[Analogue Electronics]]''. From basic logic gates to fast multipliers, ''Digital Circuits'' has the theory behind them, but doesn't overly concern itself over the physical devices doing the work.

*'''[[Digital Integrated Circuits]]'''
::This book concerns itself with the cross-over involved with implementing digital circuits in an analogue universe. Manufacturing and layout are both considered.

*'''[[Analog and Digital Conversion]]'''
::Techniques, circuits and theory for converting real-world analogue signals to machine-readable digital form and back again.

*'''[[Signals and Systems]]'''
::Starting form the mathematical end of the spectrum, rather than the physical, this book looks at what makes a signal and what we can do with it in the real world.

*'''[[Signal Processing]]'''
::Following on from ''[[Signals and Systems]]'', this book shows how to manipulate signals to do our bidding! Filtering, compression, Fourier transforms and the kind are the name of the game.

*'''[[Digital Signal Processing]]'''
::Using computers and embedded systems, we see how to implement the techniques discussed in ''[[Signal Processing]]'' in a timely and elegant fashion.

*'''[[Communication Systems]]'''
::Getting data from A to B efficiently and in one piece. Basic radio theory such as modulation right up to frequency-hopping spread-spectrum signals and error-correcting codes.

*'''[[Practical Electronics]]'''
::For the hobbyist who doesn't want to get bogged down in the hows and wherefores of the electronics. This book explains how basic and not-so-basic components can be used to produce useful and interesting circuits, from burglar alarms and electronic locks to egg timers and battery chargers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Digital integrated circuits represent the practical side of digital electronics - digital functions are constructed using analogue technologies such as doped silicon. This complicates the previously neat digital technologies that are divorced from the real world. This book deals with the design of digital integrated circuits, their manufacture and techniques to optimise performance. The book is being organized such that it will be useful for people who know 'what is MOS' and nothing more. Fabrication section is not important for people who wants to learn design.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{SPARC Assembly Page}}

If you're familiar with any higher level programming language (C, C++, Java, etc.), then you are likely aware of the tremendous capabilities that control structures afford computer programmers. Control structures allow us to have our programs make decisions about which code block to execute, and possibly even how many times to execute that block of code. Though somewhat more cryptic, control structures in SPARC afford us the same capabilities. We will discuss a few of of more common ones below.   

== If Then ==

As you might have guessed from the section on branching, an if-then structure is comprised simply of a branch statement that skips the code in the &quot;if&quot; block and branches to a label the marks the beginning of the code to be executed after the if block . For example, if in psuedocode our goal is to have a program that looks like

{|width=50% align=center

|&lt;pre&gt;

if register %l0 is less than zero{
::then 'and' it with register %g0 and store the result in %l0
::then and add one to %l0
}

'or' the code with the base two version of 42 and store the result back in %l0

&lt;/pre&gt;
|}


then the SPARC version of this would be 

{|width=20% align=center

|&lt;pre&gt;
cmp %l0, 0
bge next
nop

and %l0, %g0, %l0
add %l0, 1, %l0

next: or %l0, 42, %l0

&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

Note that we have negated the logic of the if statement from &quot;if %l0 is less than zero, then do this&quot; to &quot;if %l0 is not greater than zero, then do not do this&quot;. This is necessary because our ability to create control structures to comes from our ability to skip portions of code. So what we are telling the computer is that if this condition is not true, then skip all of this code here and move on the next set of labeled instructions.

== If Else ==

This is similar to the if-then structure but requires more branching. The basic point of if-else is to do the following:

{|width=50% align=center

|&lt;pre&gt;
If some condition is true{
   then preform this set of instructions
}

If the condition is false (the else part){
 then execute this set of instructions
}  
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

So, if we want to do this in SPARC, we branch to the &quot;else&quot; part just like we would to the &quot;next&quot; label in the if-then code. However, we also need to ensure that if the 'if' block is executed, then the 'else' block is skipped when after th 'if' block finishes executing. So for sake of example, lets say that in the previous example we wanted to set %l0 to zero if the condition was not satisfied. The code is as follows:

{|width=20% align=center

|&lt;pre&gt;
cmp %l0, 0
bge else
nop

and %l0, %g0, %l0
add %l0, 1, %l0

ba next
nop

else: mov 0, %l0
next: or %l0, 42, %l0

&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

Notice now that when the 'if' condition is false we now move to the 'else' statement instead of 'next'. Also notice that we now have a 'branch always' instruction at the end of the if block that allows us to skip the 'else' block when the 'if' block has been executed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Binary Number System ==

The binary (base two) system is the number system that computers use to represent the data stored in them. In contrast with the base ten system that we are used to, which uses numbers 0-9 to represent all possible real numbers, the binary system uses only numbers 0-1. For example, the number 2112 is represented as a binary number is 100001000000, the number 3 is 11, and as you might suspect, the number 0 is still just 0. 

It may seem that choosing to represent numbers in this way only introduces unnecessary hassle and complexity that impedes usability, but actually the opposite is true. The reason computer engineers chose to use this relatively unfamiliar number system is that it is much simpler to implement and represent using computer circuitry, and thus makes the creation of more elaborate computer components much simpler than it would be if a higher base system was used.

== Binary Arithmetic ==

Even though it may seem the contrary, binary numbers can be used just as base ten numbers can. You can add them, subtract them, multiply them, divide them, square them, and so on. For now, more information can be found [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system#Binary_arithmetic:Contents here].

== Two's Complement ==

== Signed and Unsigned Numbers ==

== Condition Codes ==

Condition Code Registers are special flags (bits) contained the condition code register (CCR) that are used to record information about condition code (&lt;opcode&gt;cc) instructions so that branching decisions may be made by a program. As discussed above, the context of whether a number is signed or unsigned will imply very different results when it is used in calculation. As such, SPARC uses different sets of CCR's to manage signed and unsigned data.   


===Signed Condition Codes ===

For signed numbers, SPARC uses three of the three condition codes- the Z, N, and V bits - to regulate conditional branching:


::*'''Z''': This flag keeps track of whether the result of a calculation of a condition code instruction was zero or not. If the result is zero it is set to 1, if not it is set to 0. For example,

{|width=30% align=center

|&lt;pre&gt;
mov 4, %l1         !move 4 into %l1
subcc %l1, 4, %g0  !subtract 4 from %l1
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

:::: would set the Z register to 1, but 

{|width=30% align=center

|&lt;pre&gt; 
mov 4, %l1         !move 4 into %l1
subcc %l1, 3, %g0  !subtract 3 from %l1
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

:::: would set it to zero.


::*'''N''': This flag keeps track of whether the result of a calculation of a signed condition code instruction was negative or not. if the result is negative it is set to 1, if not it is set to 0. For example,

{|width=30% align=center
|&lt;pre&gt;
mov 4, %l1         !move 4 into %l1
subcc %l1, 5, %g0  !subtract 5 from %l1
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

:::: would set the N register to 1, but 

{|width=30% align=center
|&lt;pre&gt; 
mov 4, %l1         !move 4 into %l1
subcc %l1, 3, %g0  !subtract 3 from %l1
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
:::: would set it to zero.


::*'''V''': This flag keeps track of whether the result of a signed calculation is too large to be held by a 32 bit (or possibly 64 bit) register. If the result is too large it is set to 1, if not it is set to 0.

=== Unsigned Condition Codes ===

== Branch Instructions ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Assigning variables and plotting are both simple maple functions that are very important and can be used towards a variety of goals, whether you are assigning a physical constant to make an equation easier to use or making the task of graphing a data set of 1000 terms much more manageable. Here, we are illustrating these simple commands with equations relating to [[Special Relativity]]. 

==Graph e=mc^2==
E=mc^2 is a very famous equation which describes the relationship between energy and mass. The full equation involves a gamma function which basically modifies the answer based on the speed. This graph shows that as the velocity approaches the speed of light, the energy approaches infinity. &lt;br&gt;



1. Assign c to the value 1. (Though the speed of light, 'c', is actually close to 3*10^8 m/s in special relativity we use the convention of having it equal 1 so when we use very large velocities we can assign them as fractions of the speed of light. ie. v=0.5 is half the speed of light) &lt;br&gt;

2. Assign the function:
&lt;math&gt;\gamma(v) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

3. Assign the function: 
&lt;math&gt; E(v,m)=\gamma(v)\,m\,{c}^{2} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;

4. Plot E(v,30) over the range m= 0 to 0.9. To label the y axis, enter the label you want as the third term in the maple plot command, after the range is specified. See below. Also see how the title is added.

Solution (Maple Commands)

 c:=1;
 Gamma:= (v)-&gt; 1/sqrt(1-(v**2/c**2));
 E:= (v,m)-&gt; Gamma(v) * m * c**2;
 plot(E(v,30), v=0..0.9, energy, title=&quot;Energy Mass Relationship&quot;);

==Graph Length Contraction Equation==

Explained by the theory of special relativity, length of an object as viewed from another frame of reference contracts as it moves in a direction along its length. In fact, as the object's relative velocity approaches the speed of light, the length of the object approaches zero. In theory, the object will never actually reach the speed of light. The equation for this is L_prime= L/Gamma. L_prime is the contracted length, and L is the 'proper length' or the length measured in the frame of the object. Gamma is the problem above. Plot the graph of L_prime for a limousine that is 10 meters long from v=0 to c.

Solution

 c:=1;
 Gamma:= (v)-&gt; 1/sqrt(1-(v**2/c**2));
 L_prime:= (L,v)-&gt; L/Gamma(v);
 plot(L_prime(10,v),v=0..c, length, title=&quot;Length Contraction&quot;);

[[Image:Length_Contraction.jpg|center]]

==Computing Length Contraction for Everyday Objects==

Gamma's purpose in these equations is in essence a modifier to take into account the change in different values with respect to how fast an object is moving. Changes in length do not affect our everyday lives because everything around us moves too slowly to affect the length or time we perceive. To show this, try plugging in different speeds to the L_prime equation for an object 1 meter long and see how big of a change there will be for the speed of a person walking- about 1.5 m/s, a car - about 30 m/s, the X-43 rocket/scramjet plane- 3,111m/s, and at 10,000 times the actual speed of Apollo 10 as it reentered the atmosphere (11,100 m/s * 10,000). Use the actual value of the speed of light for c, 299,792,458 m/s. (By using the evalf function, it forces maple to output a decimal instead of a cumbersome fraction). Notice the small change by the ridiculously high spaceship speed.

Solution:

 L_prime:= (L,v)-&gt; L/Gamma(v);
 c:=299792458;
 evalf(L_prime(1,1.5));
                                                            1.000000000
 evalf(L_prime(1,30));
                                                            0.999999999
 evalf(L_prime(1,3111));
                                                            0.999999999
 evalf(L_prime(1,(11,100*10000)));
                                                            0.9290317539

It can be seen that the length contraction at speeds that we can achieve is negligible. Speed of: &lt;br&gt;
walking- 1 meter &lt;br&gt;
car- 1 meter &lt;br&gt;
jet- 1 meter  &lt;br&gt;
10,000 times the Apollo 10- 0.93 meters

==Relativity in Kinetic Energy (plotting multiple functions per graph)==

For every day situations, we can measure the kinetic energy of an object based on its mass and speed with the equation, &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m\,v^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. However, special relativity tells us that energy increases to infinity as velocity approaches the speed of light. The more accurate equation that describes kinetic energy at very high relative speeds is &lt;math&gt;E = \lambda\,m\,c^2-m\,c^2&lt;/math&gt;. Assign both of these functions, and then graph them together on the same graph to show the error in the Newtonian kinetic energy equation(E=mv^2/2) at very high speeds. Make a graph of both equations at 10% the speed of light, 50% the speed of light and 100% the speed of light. Notice that until very high speeds, the difference in the energy computed in both equations is negligible.

Solution:

 kinetic:=(m,v)-&gt; (1/2)*m*v**2; &lt;br&gt;
 kinetic2:= (m,v)-&gt; Gamma(v) * m * c**2- m*c**2; &lt;br&gt;
 c:= 299792458; &lt;br&gt;
 plot([kinetic2(13, v), kinetic (13,v)], v=0..(.1*c),kinetic_energy, title=&quot;Difference Between Newtonian and Relativistic Kinetic Energies at 10% c&quot;);

[[Image:Difference_Between_Newtonian_and_Relativistic_Energies_at_10%_c.jpg|center]]

 plot([kinetic2(13, v), kinetic (13,v)], v=0..(.5*c),kinetic_energy, title=&quot;Difference Between Newtonian and Relativistic Kinetic Energies at 50% c&quot;);

 plot([kinetic2(13, v), kinetic (13,v)], v=0..c,kinetic_energy, title=&quot;Difference Between Newtonian and Relativistic Kinetic Energies at 100% c&quot;);

:It won’t be “inconsistent” anymore when I’m done with it. Also, please explain why it would make the text hard to search: there’s virtually no search function anywhere that lets you search for quote characters.

::It will be inconsistent as it will be unexpected and not common across that particular book, the other books (or even generally used elsewhere).
::Search functions aren't restricted to Wikimedia software, one can perform even local searches (on the browser or on the resulting PDF of a book) and that new quote character breaks it, in sum it will definitively not be an useful improvement...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:51, 14 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Van dwelling rocks, especially if you are into camping out. However, if you are going to be traveling long distances you really need to take the time to make sure all the maintenance is all taken care of. Just make sure you change the oil and keep it full if you have a leak. Take extra oil with you and other fluids as well such as transmission fluid, power steering fluid, water, antifreeze,brake fluid... you never know when you might get a leak, and if you are out in the mountains, having some of these fluids might mean the difference between stranded and moving. 

Also, if your van is making noises that are brand new or don't sound right.... get it checked out in a commercial area....there are usually big name companies that will give you a free estimate, get three estimates, and the mechanic you are most comfortable with , get the repair done, you don't want to have something break while you are traveling.

Pay attention to you van, keep it clean and uncluttered this will help you focus and be aware of you van surroundings , you will see leaks, and smell odors that could be a precursor to bigger problems. 

If you van leaks from the seals over the doors or on the roof, get a huge tarp at Walmart and some twine. Throw the tarp over your van and over the areas that leak and tie it down to the door handles or trees. This is easy if you are camping where you don't have to be so incognito.

Get yourself a good set of tools appropriate for you van IE: get a set of name brand tools as cheap ones just strip out or break or just perform badly. Make sure you get metric tools if you have a foreign model. Even if you don't know how to use the tools, at least they will be there to assist any passerby good Samaritans that want to help. *If a stranger does try to help try to figure out if this person actually knows the basics... ask a few questions to see if they tell you the right answer re: other types of repairs. If they don't know those simple answers, don't let them tinker on your vehicle. Better to get a tow and get it to a shop.  And make sure you have a cell phone for emergencies.

May God bless you in your van adventure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Congo, Democratic Republic=
&lt;font size=3&gt;(includes Belgium Congo, Katanga, Zaire, Democratic Republic of Congo)
----
* Meter stamps of the Democratic Republic of Congo can easily be confused with those of the Peoples Republic of Congo which is an entirely separate nation. The Democratic Republic of Congo is a former Belgian colony, and the Peoples Republic of Congo is a former French colony. Franks that contain “Republique du Congo” or “Republique Populaire du Congo” (in full or abbreviated) are from the Peoples Republic of Congo. See CONGO, PEOPLES REPUBLIC for these issues.
*The first meter was installed in 1929. The stamps are grouped according to the country name in the frank:
:: '''A''' - Issues as a Belgian colony, inscribed CONGO/ BELGISCH BELGE or variation, 1929-1960
:: '''B''' - Issues of breakaway state of Katanga, inscribed ETAT DU KATANGA, 1960-1963
:: '''C''' - Issues of the first republic, 1960-1971, inscribed CONGO alone or CONGO/ REPUBLIQUE DEMOCRATIQUE
:: '''D''' - Issues after name change to ZAIRE, 1971-1997
:: '''E''' - Issues of the second republic, 1997 to present, inscribed RDC or provisional issues without country name&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter we will primarily be focused on linear second order ordinary differential equations.  That is, we will be interested in equations of the form 
&lt;math&gt;(\text{LIVP})\qquad\begin{cases}y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)\\y(x_0)=y_0\\y'(x_0)=y'_0\end{cases}.&lt;/math&gt;

While it doesn't often enter into the business of finding solutions to differential equations it is important to keep in mind when there is even hope that a solution exists.  The following theorem tells us at least one case where we can hope to find solutions.

:'''Theorem''' Suppose &lt;math&gt;p(x),\, q(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; are continuous functions defined on an open interval &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;x_0\in I&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a ''unique'' function y(x) defined on &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the ordinary differential equation &lt;math&gt;y''(x) + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)&lt;/math&gt; and satisfies the initial conditions &lt;math&gt;y(x_0)=y_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y'(x_0)=y_0'&lt;/math&gt;.  

Putting the proof of this fact aside for now, even knowing this statement still provides us with a lot of information.  In particular it gives some idea of how many solutions there are.  One way of looking at what this theorem is saying is that a solution is completely determined by two numbers, namely &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y'_0&lt;/math&gt;

We first reduce this problem to the homogeneous case, that is &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0 &lt;/math&gt;.  Later we will introduce methods that will allow us to leverage our understanding of the homogeneous problem to better understand the non-homogeneous case. 
Thus we are interested in the problem of fiding solutions to 
:&lt;math&gt;(\text{LH})\qquad y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=0&lt;/math&gt;
The first thing to notice is that if &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; are solutions to (LH), then for any two real numbers &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;c_1y_1+c_2y_2&lt;/math&gt; is also a solution.  This may be directly verified by substituting into the left hand side of (LH).

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;(c_1y_1+c_2y_2)''+p(x)(c_1y_1+c_1y_2)'+q(x)(c_1y_1+c_2y_2)\\
=&amp; c_1y_1''+c_2y_2'' + c_1p(x)y_1'+c_2p(x)y_2'+ c_1q(x)y_1+c_2q(x)y_2\\
=&amp; c_1(y_1''+p(x)y_1'+q(x)y_1)+c_2(y_2''+p(x)y_2'+q(x)y_2)=c_1\cdot 0+c_2\cdot 0=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If you're familiar with linear algebra, then you'll recall that a transformation is called linear if &lt;math&gt;T(v+w)=T(v)+T(w)&lt;/math&gt;.  So what we are really seeing is that the left hand side of the ODE is a linear transformation on functions, and it is for this reason the equation is called ''linear''.

Now this gives us a very interesting fact for the homogeneous case.  Recall we mentioned above that our existence theorem tells us all solutions are parametrized by two initial conditions.  Putting this together with the fact that linear combinations of solutions to the homogeneous problem are again solutions, it becomes interesting to investigate what initial value problems we can solve simply by taking linear combinations of solutions that we already know.

This is, given fixed numbers &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y'_0&lt;/math&gt; we consider the problem 
:&lt;math&gt;(\text{LHIVP})\qquad \begin{cases}y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=0\\y(x_0)=y_0,\quad y'(x_0)=y'_0.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose we know two solutions to the homogeneous problem, &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; but suppose that &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; don't satisfy the initial conditions.  Since we are interested in solving the initial value problem &lt;math&gt;y(x_0)=y_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y'(x_0)=y'_0&lt;/math&gt; and we know that linear combinations of solutions are again solutions we can ask the question: &quot;Is it possible that &lt;math&gt;y=c_1y_1+c_2y_2&lt;/math&gt;?&quot;

If that were the case we could evaluate &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to check the initial conditions.  So we would need to have that:
:&lt;math&gt;y(x_0)=c_1y_1(x_0)+c_2y_2(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;y'(x_0)=c_1y_1'(x_0)+c_2y_2'(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;

But it is important not to lose sight of the fact that we are assuming that &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; are just fixed functions that we know.  So &lt;math&gt;y_1(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_1'(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_2(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;y_2'(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;
are simply four numbers that we know.

This means we are really trying to solve the following &lt;u&gt;linear system&lt;/u&gt; with two equations and two unknowns:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align}
c_1y_1(t_0) &amp;+ c_2y_2(t_0) &amp;=y_0\\
c_1y_1'(t_0) &amp;+ c_2y_2'(t_0) &amp;=y_0'
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

From linear algebra we know that such a system can be solved for ''any'' set of initial conditions &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y'_0&lt;/math&gt; provided we know the determinant of the coefficient matrix is not zero.  In this two by two case that is simply &lt;math&gt;y_1(x_0)y_2'(x_0)-y_2(x_0)y_1'(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.  This determinant, in the subject of ODE's, is named after the mathematician who first used it systematically.  It is known as the ''Wronskian'', which we will now give a more formal definition.

:'''Definition:''' Given functions &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;u&gt;Wronskian of &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt; is the function &lt;math&gt;W(y_1, y_2)(x):=y_1(x)y_2'(x)-y_2(x)y_1'(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Our discussion above can be summarized by the following theorem.

:{{TextBox|1=
;'''Theorem:''':
Suppose &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; are two solutions to the linear homogeneous problem (LH). Then ''every solution'' to the initial value problem
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = 0,\\y(x_0)=y_0,\\y'(x_0)=y'_0.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
may be written as a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; provided that the Wronskian &lt;math&gt;W(y_1, y_2)(x_0)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
}}
===Constant Coefficients===
The first tractable problem is to consider the case when &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q(x)&lt;/math&gt; are constants.  For convenience we also allow &lt;math&gt;y''&lt;/math&gt; to have a non-zero constant.  Thus we are interested in the equations.

:&lt;math&gt;ay'' + by' + cy = g(x),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

where a, b and c are real numbers with &lt;math&gt;a \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The homogeneous equation associated with this is

:&lt;math&gt;ay'' + by' + cy = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Our experience first order differential equations tells us that any solution to &lt;math&gt;ay'-by=0&lt;/math&gt; has form &lt;math&gt;e^{rx}&lt;/math&gt; (in this case &lt;math&gt;r=b/a&lt;/math&gt;).  It turns out to be worth effort to see if such a function will ever be the solution to the equation we are considering.  So we simply substitute &lt;math&gt;y = e^{rx}&lt;/math&gt; in to our equation to get:

:&lt;math&gt;a r^2 e^{rx} + bre^{rx} + ce^{rx} = (ar^2+br+c)e^{rx}=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;e^{rx}&lt;/math&gt; is never zero, the only way for the product to be zero is if &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; happend to satisfy:

:&lt;math&gt;ar^2+br+c=0&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is known as the '''characteristic equation''' associated with the homogeneous differential equation and the polynomial &lt;math&gt;ar^2+br+c&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''characteristic polynomial'''. Since &lt;math&gt;a, b, c&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers there are three cases to consider.

====Real distinct roots====
The first case is that &lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the quadratic formula furnishes us with two real numbers &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;ar_1^2+br_1+c=0=ar_2^2+br_2+c&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case our calculation above shows us that &lt;math&gt;e^{r_1x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{r_2x}&lt;/math&gt; are two different solutions to our equation.  As you will show in the exercises the Wronskian of &lt;math&gt;e^{r_1x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{r_2x}&lt;/math&gt; is not zero in this case. Thus we have found two solutions to the equation, and by our theorem we can represent every solution as a linear combination of these two solutions.

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1:

Find the general solution to &lt;math&gt;y''-3y'+2y=0&lt;/math&gt;.  In this the characteristic equation is &lt;math&gt;r^2-3r+2=0&lt;/math&gt;.  The polynomial &lt;math&gt;r^2-3r+2=(r-2)(r-1)&lt;/math&gt; has two real roots, &lt;math&gt;r_1=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2=2&lt;/math&gt;.  So we have two solutions &lt;math&gt;y_1=e^x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2=e^{2x}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since these are two different solutions to a second order equation they form a fundamental solution set.  So if &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a general solution then
:&lt;math&gt;y=c_1e^x+c_2e^{2x}&lt;/math&gt;.

}}


{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2:

Find the solution to the initial value problem:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}y''-2y'+3y=0\\y(0)=1\\y'(0)=0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.

For this ODE, &lt;math&gt;r^2-2r+3=0&lt;/math&gt;.  This characteristic polynomial factors &lt;math&gt;r^2-r+3=(r+1)(r-3)&lt;/math&gt; so there two roots: &lt;math&gt;r_1=-1, r_2=3&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus our two solutions to the ODE are &lt;math&gt;y_1=e^{-x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2=e^{3x}&lt;/math&gt;.  This leads us to the general solution of:
:&lt;math&gt;y=c_1e^{-x}+c_2e^{3x}&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to solve the initial value problem we now substitute in the values given.  That is
:&lt;math&gt;y(0)=c_1e^{-0}+c_2e^{3\cdot 0}=c_1+c_2&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;c_1+c_2=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Further
:&lt;math&gt;y'(0)=-c_1e^{-0}+3c_2e^{3\cdot 0}=-c_1+3c_2&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;-c_1+3c_2=0&lt;/math&gt;.

This means we need to solve the 2&amp;times;2 system:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;c_1 +&amp; \!\!\!\!&amp;c_2&amp;\!\!\!\!= 1\\
-&amp;c_1 +&amp;\!\!\!\!3&amp;c_2&amp;\!\!\!\!= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Adding the first equation to the second we see that &lt;math&gt;4c_2=1&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;c_2=\tfrac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, by substituting &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; into the first equation we get &lt;math&gt;c_1+\tfrac{1}{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;c_1=\tfrac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

This means the solution to our initial value problem is &lt;math&gt;y=\tfrac{3}{4}e^{-x}+\tfrac{1}{4}e^{3x}&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

====Complex roots====
The second case to consider is when &lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case the theory is almost identical.  Since the coefficients of the characteristic equation we know we may right &lt;math&gt;r_1=z+iw&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2=z-iw&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;e^{r_1 x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{r_2 x}&lt;/math&gt; are two solutions, and in fact form a fundamental solution set.  

This being said, it is perhaps a bit disturbing to some of us to describe a real valued solution to an ode with real coefficients (and real initial data) using complex numbers.  For this reason it is atheistically pleasing to find two real valued solutions.  In order to do this it helps to know a little bit about what it even meas to raise a number to the a complex power.

In our setting the answer is provided by Euler's formula, which states that for a real number &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta + i\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  Let's take a quick look at why this is the formula makes any sense at all.  The idea is it examine the series power series for &lt;math&gt;e^x=1+x+x^2/2+x^3/3!+\ldots=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then plugging in &lt;math&gt;i\theta&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and collecting real and imaginary parts we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;1+i\theta-\frac{\theta^2}{2}-i\frac{\theta^3}{3!}+\frac{\theta^4}{4!}+i\frac{\theta^5}{5!}-\cdots\\
&amp;=(1-\frac{\theta^2}{2}+\frac{\theta^4}{4!}-\cdots)+i(\theta-\frac{\theta^3}{3!}+\frac{\theta^5}{5!}-\cdots)\\
&amp;=\cos\theta+i\sin\theta.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This calculation is justified because these power series are absolutely convergent, and so we may rearrange the terms as we see fit.  For more general complex numbers we may define &lt;math&gt;e^{z+iw}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;e^ze^{iw}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus using these definitions we may rewrite our two solutions as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}y_1=e^{zx}(\cos(wx) +i\sin(wx))\\y_2=e^{zx}(\cos(wx)-i\sin(wx))\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since any linear combination of these two solutions is again a solution we note that two particularly nice linear combinations are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\tilde y_1=\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}=e^{zx}\cos(wx)\\
&amp;\tilde y_2=\frac{y_1-y_2}{2i}=e^{zx}\sin(wx)\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For those uncomfortable with complex variables the above discussion may seem a bit unclear.  But it may simply be considered as motivation.  That is if we remember &lt;math&gt;z=\frac{-b}{2a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w=\frac{\sqrt{4ac-b^2}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt; one may directly verify that &lt;math&gt;\tilde y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y_2}&lt;/math&gt; solve (LH).  It is also left to the reader to verify that &lt;math&gt;W(\tilde y_1,\tilde y_2)(x_0)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.  This in this case as well we also find a fundamental solution set.

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 3:
Solve the initial value problem
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}y''+2y'+5y=0\\y(0)=0\qquad y'(0)=1.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case our characteristic polynomial is &lt;math&gt;r^2+2r+5&lt;/math&gt;.  Using the quadratic formula we see the roots are &lt;math&gt;r_1=\frac{-2+\sqrt{4-4\cdot 1\cdot 5}}{2\cdot 1}=-1+2i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2=-1-2i.&lt;/math&gt;.  This means two solutions to this differential equation are given by:
:&lt;math&gt;y_1=e^{-x}\cos(2x)&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;y_2=e^{-x}\sin(2x).&lt;/math&gt;  
So we know that the general solution has the form &lt;math&gt;y=c_1e^{-x}\cos(2x)+c_2e^{-x}\sin(2x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Now we need to use the initial conditions to solve for &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;.  We start by calculating the derivative of y:
:&lt;math&gt;y'=-c_1\big(e^{-x}\cos(2x)+2e^{-x}\sin(2x)\big)+c_2\big(-e^{-x}\sin(2x)+2e^{-x}\cos(2x)\big) &lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, using the initial conditions we see that:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;0=y(0)=c_1\cdot 1+c_2\cdot 0=c_1\\&amp;1=y'(0)=-c_1\cdot(0+2)+c_2\cdot(-2+0)=-2c_1-2c_2\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

From this we see immediately that &lt;math&gt;c_1=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2=-\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;y=-\tfrac{1}{2}e^{-x}\sin(2x)&lt;/math&gt; is the solution to our initial value problem.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 4:
Find the general solution to:
:&lt;math&gt;4y''+y=0.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case our characteristic equation is &lt;math&gt;4r^2+1=0&lt;/math&gt;, whose roots are &lt;math&gt;r_1=\tfrac{i}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2=-\tfrac{i}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Notice that these two solutions have the form &lt;math&gt;0+\tfrac{1}{2}i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0-\tfrac{1}{2}i&lt;/math&gt;, or in other words using the notation above &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w=\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  When there is no real part to the complex number, that just means the &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case we get &lt;math&gt;y_1=e^{0\cdot x}\cos(\tfrac{x}{2})=\cos(\tfrac{x}{2})&lt;/math&gt; and similarly &lt;math&gt;y_2=\sin(\tfrac{x}{2})&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore the general solution to this ODE is:
:&lt;math&gt;y=c_1\cos(\tfrac{x}{2})+c_2\sin(\tfrac{x}{2})&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

====Repeated Real Roots====
In the case when &lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac=0&lt;/math&gt; finding two solutions is slightly more difficult. In this case our characteristic polynomial factors into &lt;math&gt;a(r+\frac{b}{2a})^2&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case we have only one root, namely &lt;math&gt;r_1=\frac{-b}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;.  We still obtain the solution &lt;math&gt;y_1=e^{r_1x}&lt;/math&gt;, the question becomes how do we find a second solution?

Luckily there is one very nice property of the characteristic polynomial.  In general, if a polynomial the a repeated root then the derivative of our polynomial also has this root. (Since the polynomial depends on r, we mean here a derivative with respect to r.)  In our case this is easily seen, let &lt;math&gt;P(r)= a(r+\frac{b}{2a})^2&lt;/math&gt; then we have
:&lt;math&gt;P'(r)=2a(r+\frac{b}{2a})&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and so
:&lt;math&gt;P'(r_1)=2a(r_1+\frac{b}{2a})=2a(\frac{-b}{2a}+\frac{b}{2a})=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Since our characteristic polynomial came from considering &lt;math&gt;a(e^{rx})''+b(e^{rx})'+c(e^{rx})&lt;/math&gt;
We might hope that taking a derivative in &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; might help us find another solution to try.  
 
So we start by considering: 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\big(a(e^{rx})''+b(e^{rx})'+c(e^{rx})\big)=\frac{d}{dr}\big((ar^2+br+c)e^{rx}\big)=(2ar+b)e^{rx} + (ar^2+br+c)xe^{rx}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now if &lt;math&gt;r=r_1=\frac{-b}{2a}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(2ar_1+b)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(ar_1^2+br_1+c)=0&lt;/math&gt;.   Hence &lt;math&gt;(2ar_1+b)e^{r_1x} + (ar_1^2+br_1+c)xe^{rx}&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, remembering that derivatives commute, we might have calculated this a bit differently to get:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\big(a(e^{rx})''+b(e^{rx})'+c(e^{rx})\big)=a(\frac{d}{dr}e^{rx})''+b(\frac{d}{dr}e^{rx})'+c(\frac{d}{dr}e^{rx})=a(xe^{rx})''+b(xe^{rx})'+c(xe^{rx})&lt;/math&gt;

That is we are really just looking at &lt;math&gt;xe^{rx}&lt;/math&gt; plugged into our differential equation, but we know from our first calculation this should be zero.  So it seems that &lt;math&gt;xe^{rx}&lt;/math&gt; should be a solution.

Changing the order of the derivatives in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the derivatives in &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is allowed because &lt;math&gt;e^{rt}&lt;/math&gt; has continuous derivatives of all orders in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.  So we can let &lt;math&gt;y_2=xe^{r_1x}&lt;/math&gt;. It can be checked that &lt;math&gt;W(y_1, y_2)(x_0)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and so we again have that  &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; form a fundamental solution set.

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 5:
Suppose we want to find the general solution to 
:&lt;math&gt;y''+4y'+4y=0&lt;/math&gt;.
In this case our characteristic equation is &lt;math&gt;r^2+4r+4=0&lt;/math&gt; which has only one root &lt;math&gt;r_1=-2&lt;/math&gt;.  And so according to our theory above a fundamental set of solutions are given by &lt;math&gt;y_1=e^{-2x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2=xe^{-2x}&lt;/math&gt;, and so the general solution is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;y=c_1e^{-2x}+c_2xe^{-2x}.&lt;/math&gt;
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 6:
If we want to solve the initial value problem
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}9y''-6y+y\\y(0)=3\quad y'(0)=1.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Then our characteristic equation is &lt;math&gt;9r^2-6r+1=0&lt;/math&gt;.  The quadratic formula gives &lt;math&gt;r_{1,2}=\tfrac{6\pm\sqrt{36-4(9)(1)}}{2\cdot 9}=\tfrac{1}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;  The fundamental solution set is given by &lt;math&gt;y_1=e^{x/3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_1=xe^{x/3}&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore our general solution is &lt;math&gt;y_1=c_1e^{x/3}+c_2xe^{x/3}&lt;/math&gt;.  We can now calculate &lt;math&gt;y_1'=c_1(\tfrac{1}{3}e^{x/3})+c_2(e^{x/3}+\tfrac{1}{3}xe^{x/3}).&lt;/math&gt;
}}

===More about the Wronskian===
In the above conversation we it was always necessary to check the Wronskian at the initial point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; in order to see if the set of functions formed a fundamental solution set.  This leaves us with the uncomfortable possibility that perhaps our fundamental solution set at one point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; would not be a fundamental solution set if we choose to have our initial conditions at &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;.  Thankfully this turns out not to be the case.

{{TextBox|1=
;Abel's Theorem:
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; are solutions to (LH).  Then we have that 
:&lt;math&gt;W(y_1, y_2)(x)=Ce^{-\int_{x_0}^x p(t)\,dt}&lt;/math&gt;,
where C is a constant depending on &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt;
}}

To begin proving this we start by taking the derivative of &lt;math&gt;W(y_1, y_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;W'(y_1, y_2)=(y_1y_2')'-(y_2y_1')'=y_1'y_2'+y_1y_2''-y_2'y_1'-y_2y_1''=y_1y_2''-y_2y_1''&lt;/math&gt;.

Next we use the equation (LH) to work out what &lt;math&gt;y_1''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2''&lt;/math&gt; are.

:&lt;math&gt;y_1''=-p(x)y_1'-q(x)y_1&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;y_2''=-p(x)y_2'-q(x)y_2&lt;/math&gt;

Thus
:&lt;math&gt;W'(y_1, y_2)=y_1(-p(x)y_2'-q(x)y_2)-y_2(-p(x)y_1'-q(x)y_1)=-p(x)y_1y_2'+p(x)y_2y_1'&lt;/math&gt;

By inspection we see that &lt;math&gt;W'(y_1,y_2)=-p(x)W(y_1,y_2)&lt;/math&gt;.  We know the solution to this ODE is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;W(y_1, y_2)=Ce^{-\int_{x_0}^x p(t)\,dt}&lt;/math&gt;.  
Finally if we plug in &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; we get that &lt;math&gt;C=W(y_1, y_2)(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus we can write our final formula as 
:&lt;math&gt;W(y_1,y_2)(t)=W(y_1, y_2)(x_0)e^{\int_{x_0}^x p(t)\,dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

The important thing for us to notice is that &lt;math&gt;e^{\int_{x_0}^x p(t)\,dt}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;u&gt;is never zero&lt;/u&gt;.  So for any real number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we see that &lt;math&gt;W(y_1, y_2)(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;u&gt;if and only if&lt;/u&gt; &lt;math&gt;W(y_1, y_2)(x_0)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  This tells us exactly that either &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; are a fundamental solution set or they are not, where we take our initial data does not change that fact.

===2: Series Solutions ===

As mentioned when we began second order ODE's, equations of the form &lt;math&gt;y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)&lt;/math&gt; are guaranteed to have a unique solution when &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt;and  are continuous on an open interval that includes the initial condition. However, problems of this form are not guaranteed to have a closed-form solution, a solution that can be expressed in terms of &quot;well-known&quot; functions like &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;. We can get arround this by using Taylor's theorem from Calculus. Because we don't know the solution itself, we try a solution of the form &lt;math&gt; y=\sum_{n=0}^{\infin} a_n(x-x_0)^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, a power series, instead of using the definition of the Taylor series.

====Series Solutions of Homogeneous ODE's====

Much like the method used for constant coefficients, we take our assumed solution form, differentiate it, and plug it into the equation. We then collect each series into a single series after matching both the powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the indices. Because the collected series is equal to zero in the homogeneous case, each coefficient of x must also be equal to zero. We then use this fact to find a recurrence relationship between the successive values of &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;.

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1:

Find a series solution to the following initial value problem about &lt;math&gt;x_0=0&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;y'' + x^2 y' + y = 0, \, y(0)=y_0, \, y'(0)=y'_0&lt;/math&gt;

We begin by differentiation and plugging in our assumed form.

:&lt;math&gt;y=\sum_{n=0}^{\infin} a_n x^{n} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y'=\sum_{n=1}^{\infin} a_n n x^{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y''=\sum_{n=2}^{\infin} a_n n(n-1) x^{n-2} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{\infin} a_n n(n-1) x^{n-2}+x^2\sum_{n=1}^{\infin} a_n n x^{n-1}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infin} a_n x^{n}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Note that because the first term of each series is a constant, and the derivative of a constant is zero, each derivative has its starting index increased by one. We then move the &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; into the series.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{\infin} a_n n(n-1) x^{n-2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infin} a_n n x^{n+1}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infin} a_n x^{n}=0&lt;/math&gt;

In order to combine the series in a useful manner, we match the powers of x and the indices. To match the powers we change the indices. To do so, we add (or subtract) an integer to the index and substitute &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; minus (or plus) that number for n in the series itself.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infin} a_{n+2} (n+2)(n+1) x^{n}+\sum_{n=2}^{\infin} a_{n-1} (n-1) x^{n}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infin} a_n x^{n}=0&lt;/math&gt;

The last step before combining the series is pulling terms out of the series to match the indices.

:&lt;math&gt;a_{2}(2)(1)+a_{3}(3)(2) x+\sum_{n=2}^{\infin} a_{n+2} (n+2)(n+1) x^{n} + \sum_{n=2}^{\infin} a_{n-1} (n-1) x^{n}+a_0+a_1 x + \sum_{n=2}^{\infin} a_n x^{n}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the series and like powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; yields

:&lt;math&gt;(2 a_2+a_0)+(6a_3+a_1)+\sum_{n=2}^{\infin} [a_{n+2} (n+2)(n+1)+a_{n-1} (n-1)+a_n] x^{n}=0&lt;/math&gt;

In order for that equation to hold for every value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the coefficients of each power of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; must be zero. This yields

:&lt;math&gt;2 a_2 + a_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;6 a_3 + a_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1) + a_{n-1}(n-1) + a_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Solving each for the last &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; yields

:&lt;math&gt;a_2 = (-1/2) \, a_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_3 = (-1/6) \, a_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2}  = \frac{- a_{n-1}(n-1) - a_n}{(n+2)(n+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

The last equation above is called a recurrence relation. Given the previous three values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, the next value of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; can be determined. Note that given &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, we can determine the values of all &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;. This is consistent with our expectation that the solution to a second order linear ODE should have two arbitrary constants.

Taking derivatives and plugging in zero, we find that &lt;math&gt;a_0=y_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1=y'_0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the solution to our initial value problem is

:&lt;math&gt;y=\sum_{n=0}^{\infin} a_n x^{n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_0=y_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_1=y'_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_2 = (-1/2) \, a_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_3 = (-1/6) \, a_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2}  = \frac{- a_{n-1}(n-1) - a_n}{(n+2)(n+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Due to modern techniques of DNA analysis, many genomes have been sequenced and analyzed. A famous example is the human genome through the Human Genome Project.

==Human Genome Project==
The human genome project was an international scientific research effort to fully map out the human genome. This project was started by James D. Watson at the US Institute of Health, but research centers worked on the project all over the world; such as France, Germany, Japan, China, the United Kingdom, and India. So far about 92.3% of the genome has been sequenced, but its difficult to determine due to non-coding sequences of DNA or &quot;junk&quot; DNA. 

The genome project uncovered some key findings such as the genome of the human race is 99.9% alike.

==Homology==
Sequencing genomes allow scientists to identify homologous proteins and establish evolutionary relationships. Furthermore if a newly discovered protein is homologous to a known protein, through homology scientists can make an educated guess on how the new protein functions.

==The Impact of Sequencing on Medicine==

The ability to quickly sequence the human genome in the future may have significant impacts on medicine. Knowledge about genes and an individual's DNA have already given scientists a way to predict the likelihood of certain diseases among individuals. This also allows one to analyze the chromosomal structure, the effects of evolution upon the genome, and protein structures and functions. In the future, gene therapy, genomic medicine, and preventative treatments may reduce the likelihood of disease and allow manufacturers to tailor drugs to specific individuals.

=Sequenced Eukaryotic Genomes=

Eukaryotes are organisms containing cells that enclose complex organelles within a well-defined cell membrane. The defining characteristic that sets Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes apart is Eukaryotes' nucleus, or nuclear envelope, in which an organism's genetic information is contained.

The first eukaryotic genome to be sequenced is that of [http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae '''''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'''''] ('''''S. cerevisiae''''') in 1996, and it is commonly known as brewer's yeast. '''''S. cerevisiae''''' is the most useful type of yeast due to its utility in baking and brewing, so it is the most studied eukaryotic model organisms in molecular and cell biology, similar to '''''E. coli''''''s role in the study of prokayortic organisms. Many proteins that are important to humans are studied by examining their homologs in yeasts. For example, signaling proteins and protein-processing enzymes are all discovered through the help of yeast genome.  

Other fully sequenced organisms include: roundworm, fruitfly, pufferfish (first vertebrate to be sequenced after humans), and ''Arabidopsis thaliana''.

The tables from below are taken from Wikipedia's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sequenced_eukaryotic_genomes list of sequenced eukaryotic genomes].

==Protists==
===Chromista===
The [[Chromista]] are a group of [[protist]]s that contains the algal phyla [[Heterokontophyta]], [[Haptophyta]] and [[Cryptophyta]]. Members of this group are mostly studied for evolutionary interest.

== Sequenced Bacterial Genomes ==

There are some techniques which are improving to be fast and high volume DNA sequencing like fluorescent dideoxynucleotide chain terminators, &quot;shot gun&quot; method etc. The bacterial genome of Haemophilus influenza wa determined in 1995 with a &quot;short gun&quot; method. The genomic DNA is cut randomly into fragments and then the computer programs brings out the whole sequence by matching the overlapping regions between these fragments. The H. influenzae genome consists of 1,830,137 base pairs and encodes approximately 1740 proteins. With these similar approaches, more than 100 bacterial and archaeal species including key model of organisms such as E.coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus, as well as pathogenic organisms such as Yersina pestis (causing bubonic plague) and Bacillus anthracis (anthrax).&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

{{incomplete}}

With the import() and extrusion statements it is possible to convert 2D objects read from DXF files to 3D objects.

=== Linear Extrude ===

Example of linear extrusion of a 2D object imported from a DXF file.

 linear_extrude(height = fanwidth, center = true, convexity = 10)
    import (file = &quot;example009.dxf&quot;, layer = &quot;fan_top&quot;);

=== Rotate Extrude ===

Example of rotational extrusion of a 2D object imported from a DXF file.

 rotate_extrude(convexity = 10, twist = -fanrot)
    import (file = &quot;example009.dxf&quot;, layer = &quot;fan_side&quot;, origin = fan_side_center);

=== Getting Inkscape to work ===

Inkscape is an open source drawing program. Tutorials for transferring 2d DXF drawings from Inkscape to OpenSCAD are available here:

* http://repraprip.blogspot.com/2011/05/inkscape-to-openscad-dxf-tutorial.html (Very simple, needs path segments to be straight lines)
* http://tonybuser.com/?tag=inkscape (More complicated, involves conversion to Postscript)
* http://bobcookdev.com/inkscape/inkscape-dxf.html (Better DXF Export, native support for bezier curves)

=== Description of extrude parameters ===

==== Extrude parameters for all extrusion modes ====

{| border=1
|-
|scale
|FIXME
|-
|convexity
|Integer. 
The convexity parameter specifies the maximum number of front sides (back sides) a ray intersecting the object might penetrate. This parameter is only needed for correctly displaying the object in OpenCSG preview mode and has no effect on the polyhedron rendering. See diagram below.
|-
|file
|The name of the DXF file to extrude [DEPRECATED]
|-
|layer
|The name of the DXF layer to extrude [DEPRECATED]
|-
|origin
|[x,y] coordinates to use as the drawing's center, in the units specified in the DXF file [DEPRECATED]
|}

==== Extrude parameters for linear extrusion only ====

{| border=1
|-
|height
|The extrusion height
|-
|center
|If true, extrusion is half up and half down. If false, the section is extruded up.
|-
|twist
|The extrusion twist in degrees
|-
|slices
|FIXME
|}



==== Convexity ====

[[Image:Openscad_convexity.jpg||400px||]]

This image shows a 2D shape with a convexity of 4, as the ray indicated in red crosses the 2D shape a maximum of 4 times. The convexity of a 3D shape would be determined in a similar way. Setting it to 10 should work fine for most cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== File Size ==
Before starting a screencast, you want to make sure you will have adequate space to store the final video.  It's generally a good idea to have at least double the space you think the resulting video will be.

=== Controlling Video File Size ===
Not all these options may be available to you when recording and may instead be hard-coded into the software as presets.

* Resolution
** This is the size of your video's width and height in pixels. Generally, more pixels = more memory, so having a larger resolution will result in a larger file size.

* Capture rate
** How often a frame (still picture) is recorded.  This is usually denoted in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milliseconds milliseconds] (ms). A lower capture rate will result in more frames being captured during a given interval of time.

* Framerate
** This represents the amount of frames played in a given time period.  Usually it is denoted with frames-per-second (fps).

* Bitrate
** The maximum amount of data allowed to be recorded at a given time.  Usually measured in Kb/S.

* Compression \ Codecs
** The encoding scheme used to store the video.

* Keyframes
** This stands for whole or complete frames.

=== Easy on the eyes ===
Fullscreen VS region recording.  Maintaining a descent file size without sacrificing readability in compression.

=== Controlling Audio Size ===
* Channels (mono vs stereo)
** If you're just recording your voice from a microphone, mono (single channel) is recommended.

* Frequency
** Measured in Hertz

* Bitrate
** The maximum amount of data allowed to be recorded at a given time.  Usually measured in Kb/S.

* Compression
** The encoding scheme used to store the audio data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Testing your set-up ==
Occasionally a software based screen recorder may not be able to capture something displayed on the screen. In particular, 3D graphics and desktop animation effects are often difficult or impossible to record with acceptable quality. Sometimes changing display settings may fix this, but not always. For this reason a quick test-capture of all the programs you intend to record is strongly recommended to ensure you can actually record the screencast.

== Preparation ==
The first step towards creating a screencast should be making sure you have a good understanding of the subject matter to be covered.  Once you have that the next step thinking up the workflow, what level of knowledge your viewer should have as a prerequisite and what you viewers should gain after watching the video.

Write down or type up a basic outline of the topics you want to cover and the order you want to cover them in before you start recording.  If you want to record multiple programs, it is advisable to launch them before you start recording if you have the resources available to do so.

Web. 14 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2009/02/facebook-hits-175m-active-users.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. Twitter, from February 2008 to February 2009 grew by 1,382%. This growth is astronomical and it is a sign that the way we are communicating is changing. Facebook originated as a means of communication for college students and has since gone to larger demographics. At the current time, the fastest growing demographic on Facebook is people age 35 or older. This is a sign that this means of communication is not going away any time soon. Another startling fact given by Facebook is that on average 50% of active users log on everyday&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Statistics | Facebook.&quot; Welcome to Facebook! | Facebook. Web. 14 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. This means of communication has gotten to the point where mobile smart phones, such as the new Motorola Droid, give users the choice when communicating with a contact to choose text message, phone call, or Facebook message and most of these new smartphones have Facebook preinstalled. This shows that people prefer to use one source of communication that allows them to email, instant message, update a status, post pictures and interact with friends, colleagues and family. All that being said, why aren't educational institutions embracing the change in communication?

Most distance learning environments use some sort of course management system, email and possibly video conferencing to educate their students. The difference between a typical course management piece of software and Facebook is that Facebook is more interactive and widely used. Imagine the scenario where a student is online simply checking up on some friends and gets an instant message from a classmate from a few states away asking a question about the assignment they had for the week on the online course they're taking together. Instantly the student is engaged and discussing the material in the same environment where on average, the student is actively using most everyday. The opportunity for a more successful class experience is increased by using the tools that students are using currently. Asking a student to change their habits and check another system of messaging, discussion and email is adding a barrier to the learning process. If the class is integrated into the tools that are already used by the student, then the likelihood of regular engagement into the material and interaction with classmates in a distance learning environment is greatly increased.

==Twitter==
Twitter can be an excellent tool for use in an educational environment if used properly. The beauty of Twitter is that messages can be seen and searched by anyone. For example, if I were teaching a class in a distance learning environment, I would have my students Tweet on a particular channel for that class. This is done by simply creating a tag preceded by the &quot;#&quot; symbol in all of their messages. I would start discussions, send links and photos and encourage my students to do the same. There are two main benefits for using Twitter for communication in a distance learning class. The first is that these messages can be sent and received on various mediums. Twitter messges, links and photos can be send from laptops on the web, twitter clients such as TweetDeck&lt;ref&gt;TweetDeck. Web. 14 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;, and most mobile phones. This constant availability allows for students to more easily interact with their classmates and the material being studied. The second benefit to using Twitter for communication is that since Twitter messages are public, other twitter users can easily share in the content and join the conversation. This allows the conversations and links shared in class to be viewed and possibly added to by other students, professors or experts in the field you are studying. 

Beyond allowing the students to share information easily, Twitter messages allow students to interact causally and create a new feel for the class. David Parry, a professor at the University Texas at Dallas, required his 20 students to create Twitter accounts for class&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Wired Campus - A Professor's Tips for Using Twitter in the Classroom - The Chronicle of Higher Education.&quot; Home - The Chronicle of Higher Education. Web. 14 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://chronicle.com/blogPost/A-Professor-s-Tips-for-Using/3643&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. He said, “It was the single thing that changed the classroom dynamics more than anything I’ve ever done teaching,&quot; in regards to the way the students interact with each other and with himself as the professor. This interactions can go beyond the topic of the classwork and create a better environment for students to get to know each other, interact and learn. In this case of David Parry's class, this was helpful even though his class met in person. Imagine the impact it would have on a distance learning class where students may never meet in person. The idea of building a convenient, interactive and engaging learning environment that can be accessed through various devices is attractive to an educator today and Twitter should be a consideration when looking at social media tools. 


==Facebook==
As mentioned earlier, Facebook is one of the fastest growing web sites in existence today and contains a large demographic of people in today's society. This allows for it to be a perfect central location to host interactions by a class. The service is free. It allows for communication via email type message, instant message, wall posts (or public messages), photos, links and videos. There is also the possibility of creating applications for use in a class environment that run on the Facebook service that could alert students to upcoming assignments via the Facebook notification system. Facebook also allows for groups to be easily made which can be used by a class for interaction&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Using Facebook in Education.&quot; Find Science &amp; Technology Articles, Buyer's Guides, Computer Hardware &amp; Software Reviews And The Latest Tech News At Bright Hub. Web. 14 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://www.brighthub.com/education/k-12/articles/21296.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. Most importantly, Facebook can be accessed and used on most mobile devices and any computer with an Internet connection. As mentioned in the introduction, the beauty of using a service like Facebook is that most of the students in the class will probably already have an account and be using the service regularly. This allows for a more interaction based on the fact that students are already using the service almost daily. 

Most schools have embraced Facebook in the past year by creating &quot;Fan Pages&quot; for their schools on the service&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Worcester Academy | Facebook.&quot; Welcome to Facebook! | Facebook. Web. 14 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://www.facebook.com/WorcesterAcademy&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. These pages are mostly used as a means of communication which is readily changing the way school websites are used. They provide an instant form of communication from the school by administrators or in some cases students who update the page with links, statuses and photos. This is the first step in getting the community to find each other on the service and start interacting. The next step is to create a page for a particular class for students to share work, ideas and links&lt;ref&gt;&quot;WA Mash | Facebook.&quot; Welcome to Facebook! | Facebook. Web. 14 Nov. 2009. &lt;https://archive.is/20121225181146/www.facebook.com/WAMash&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Ning==
Ning is an alternative to Facebook because with a Ning network, an instructor can create a closed social network for their class. With Facebook, there may be privacy concerns with combining a students personal life and their educational or professional life online. Photos, messages and comments can be viewed by classmates and instructors and based on the age and level of maturity of the students, the choice may be made to create a private network for class. Ning is an excellent choice for this type of environment. It provides the same tools and design as Facebook, but gives the creator control to the level of security and users which are on it. The downside is that the mobile tools and level of use decrease when using a Ning network. The instructor is also creating another place for students to check messages and assignments instead of placing the assignments and information in a centrally located service such as Facebook.

==Conclusion==
In the end, there are a number of social media tools that can be used in a distance learning environment. The difficult part is choosing which tools is right for the particular course the instructor is teaching. Each service does things in a slightly different way but as long as it accomplishes the task of providing an ease of communication and the ability to share knowledge in a public environment, the goal of engaging students will be more easily achieved than by using the types of tools that distance learning classes are currently using.

We need analysis of characters, analysis of story, details and analysis of magic, interpretations of major events... but we are restricting ourselves to the seven books, plus three additional booklets, written by the original author, as it is meant to be a textbook to assist in the teaching of that author's work. Other fiction by other authors set in that same universe is outside the scope of our book, as there is far too much of it and it is far too diverse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Combination Assignment Operators ==

Gambas supports combination assignment operators (also called compound assignment operators ) in a similar manner to the C programming language. The combination assignment operators provide a more concise way of creating expressions by enabling calculations involving a variable to be performed without the variable being included in the right hand operand.

value += 3    ' value = value + 3
value /= 3    ' value = value / 3
value *= 3    ' value = value * 3

=== Arithmetic ===

+= 	addition
-= 	subtraction
*= 	multiplication
/= 	division

=== Concatenation ===

| &amp;= | Concatenation
| &amp;\= |	Concatenation (adding a path separator between the two strings if necessary)

      <text xml:space="preserve">When a DNA solution is heated enough, The double-stranded DNA unwinds, and the Hydrogen bonds that hold the two strands together weaken and finally break. The process of breaking a double-stranded DNA into single strands is known as [[Wikipedia: DNA denaturation | DNA denaturation]], or DNA melting. The temperature at which the DNA strands are half denatured, meaning half double-stranded, half single-stranded, is called the '''melting temperature(Tm)'''. The amount of strand separation, or melting, is measured by the absorbance of the DNA solution at 260nm. Nucleic acids absorb light at this wavelength because of the electronic structure in their bases, but when two strands of DNA come together, the close proximity of the bases in the two strands quenches some of this absorbance. When the two strands separate, this quenching disappears and the absorbance rises 30%-40%.This is called [[Wikipedia: Hyperchromic Effect | Hyperchromicity]]. The Hyperchromic effect is the effect of stacked bases in a double helix absorbing less ultra-violet light. 

==Applications of DNA denaturation==

Sequence differences between two different DNA sequences can also be detected by using DNA denaturation. DNA is heated and denatured into single-stranded state, and the mixture is cooled to permit strands to rehybridize. Hybrid molecules are formed between similar sequences and any differences between those sequences will give a disruption of the base-pairing

==What determines the Melting Temperature (Tm)?==

While the ratio of G to C and A to T in an organism's DNA is fixed, the GC content (percentage of G +C) can vary considerably from one DNA to another. The percentage of GC content of DNA has a significant effect on its Tm. Because G-C pairs form three hydrogen bonds, while A-T pairs form only two, the higher the percentage of GC content, the higher its Tm. Thus, A double-stranded DNA riches in G and C needs more energy to be broken than one that is riches in A and T, meaning higher melting temperature(Tm). Above the Tm, DNA denaturaizes, below it, DNA anneals. Annealing is the reverse of denaturation.

==Other methods to denature DNA==
Heating is not the only way to denature DNA. Organic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide and formamide, or high pH, could break the hydrogen bonding between DNA strands too. Low salt concentration could also denature DNA double-strands by removing ions that stabilize the negative charges on the two strands from each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Carboxylic-acid.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of Carboxylic Acids]]


==IUPAC nomenclature==

Out of all the functional groups, carboxylic acids are the highest priority. Like other functional groups, there is IUPAC nomenclature and other simple acids have common names. 

1. The suffix used for naming carboxylic acids is ''–oic.'' &lt;br&gt;
2. The carbon containing the carbonyl bond is designated as carbon #1. &lt;br&gt;
3. The longest chain of carbon containing the carbonyl carbon is numbered and named according to the alkane/alkene/alkyne rules. &lt;br&gt;
4. The substituents on the longest chain are labeled accordingly. &lt;br&gt;

==Structural and Physical Properties==
[[File:Resonance stabilization of carboxylic acids.png|thumb|Resonance stabilization of carboxylic acids]]
[[File:Carboxylic acid dimers.png|thumb|Carboxylic acid dimers]]
Like other carbonyl groups, the carbonyl carbon bears a strong positive charge. However, because this carbon is bound to two oxygens, whereas the carbonyl carbons in ketones and aldehydes are only bound to one, the carbonyl carbon in a carboxylic acid bears an even bigger positive charge. Because of the big charge distribution, carboxylic acids hydrogen bond to other polar molecules like ketones, alcohols, aldehydes and with other carboxylic acids. 

The carbonyl group is sp2-hybridized and trigonal planar with all bond angles around it being about 120°. The C-O bond lengths are longer for the carbonyl than a typical aldehyde or ketone and the C-O single bond is a little shorter. This is explained by resonance.There is a lot of double bond character between the hydrogen-bearing oxygen and carbonyl carbon. And there is a lot of single bond character between the carbonyl carbon and carbonyl oxygen. 

Because it is such a polar functional group, carboxylic acids have relatively high melting points and boiling points compared to the cooresponding aldehydes and ketones. Also, carboxylic acids form hydrogen-bonded dimers in the solid state and in dilute non-aqueous solutions. 

==Acidity==
The hydrogen in the carboxylic acid is very acidic. &lt;br&gt;
1.	The resonance structures of the carboxylate ions increase the acidity of the terminal hydrogen because the negative charge resulting from the deprotonated hydrogen is spread over the whole molecule.  &lt;br&gt;
2.	Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the acidity of the carboxylic acids. Electron-withdrawing groups have an inductive effect. They draw electron density away from the –OH bond, thereby making the bond even more polar and easier to deprotonate the hydrogen. 
==Reactions==
===Making Carboxylic Acids===
1.	Oxidation: Primary alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes and then furthered oxidized to carboxylic acids. Some common oxidizers are MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
2.	Organometallic reagents react with carbon dioxide to form carboxylic acids.&lt;br&gt;
3.	Nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. &lt;br&gt;
4.    Amides, esters, and anhydrides can also be converted to carboxylic acids.

===Reactions===
1.	Addition-Elimination is the pathway for carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids can be converted to acycl halides, anhydrides, esters, amides using addition-elimination pathways. &lt;br&gt;
2.	Carboxylic acids can be reduced using lithium aluminum hydride to the primary alcohol.&lt;br&gt;

===Alpha-Bromonation via the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky Reaction===
[[File:PBr3 HVZ rxn.gif]]

This reaction is useful to produce alpha-bromocarboxylic acids. They are precursors to alpha-amino acids.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Information==
A knockout mouse is a mouse used by researchers for laboratory experiments aimed at understanding the consequences of inactivation or &quot;knocking out&quot; of a specific gene.  In general, the over- and/or under-expression of genes in an organism for experimentation is known as transgenic technology &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What is transgenic technology | publisher=Knockout Mouse and Transgenic Research | url=http://www.knockoutscience.com/ | accessdate=2009-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  This process is completed by disrupting or replacing the existing gene with an artificial piece of DNA that is a mutated version of the targeted gene &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Twyman, Richard | title=Knockout Mice | publisher=The Human Genome | url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD021038.html | accessdate=2009-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Due to the disruption, there will be a loss of gene activity, and it will cause changes in the mouse's phenotype.  When the mouse's phenotype is affected, the changes in appearance, behavior, and other physical characteristics should be evident in the offspring.

==Purpose and Applications==
As many genes are similar in mice and humans, the extraction or &quot;knocking out&quot; of a particular gene in a mouse can provide evidence to further understand the extent of the function of genes in humans &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NIH Knockout Mouse Project | publisher=National Institute of Health | url=http://www.nih.gov/science/models/mouse/knockout/health.html | accessdate=2009-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  This usually is manifested by a change in the animal's physical characteristics, behavioral characteristics, or biochemical pathways that regulate the mouse's functions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Knockout Mice | publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute | url=http://www.genome.gov/12514551 | accessdate=2009-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  This laboratory technique has been used in various types of research:

* Cancer Research
* Cystic Fibrosis
* Lung, Heart, Blood, and Parkinson Diseases
* Aging
* Anxiety
* Arthritis
* Diabetes
* Obesity
* Neural Pathway Functions
* Substance Abuse

A specific gene studied from the knockout mouse can also be useful in studying how different recreational drugs affect the animal, which can be used to test therapies for drug abuse in humans &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | year = 2006 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 6th Ed. | publisher = W. H. Freeman | id = ISBN 0716787245}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  For example, a [[Structural Biochemistry/p53|p53]] knockout mouse focuses on a mechanism - p53 - that codes for a protein that inhibits the growth of tumors and stops cell division.  By taking out this gene, the mouse is at risk of developing various types of cancer (blood, lung, brain, bone, etc.).  This is a useful study because humans with the abnormality in this gene have &lt;b&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Fraumeni_syndrome| Li-Fraumeni Syndrome]&lt;/b&gt;, a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disorder that puts people at a much higher risk of developing cancer.

==Limitations and Weaknesses==
Although knockout mouse technology is an excellent research tool, there are frequent complications that occur when a particular gene is knocked out.  For example, the mouse might depend on the gene of interest for other important bodily functions; if it was disrupted, the mouse might die or stop functioning correctly in unexpected ways.  In addition, the gene that is knocked out in the mouse may not even produce an observable change in any of the mouse's characteristics.  This makes it extremely difficult to correlate the study with that of humans.  Gene knockouts in mice embryos may sometimes inhibit the mice from growing into adult mice.   This makes the studies limited to the pre-natal stage of the mouse, further distancing the relationship between the gene-knockout in the mouse, and that of humans.

==Methods of Preparing Knockout Mice==
[[File:Knockout mouse breeding scheme.svg|thumb|Knockout Mouse Breeding Scheme]]

Knockout mice are created from embryonic stem cell (ES cells) by harvesting them approximately 4 days after fertilization.  The reason for using the ES cells so early on is because the swapping of gene sequences can be properly passed on to the rest of the cells during division and develop along with the all the other adult cells.  This process is completed in one of two methods:

====Gene Targeting====
In gene targeting, a particular gene is manipulated within the nucleus of the ES cells of the mouse through homologous recombination &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Twyman, Richard | title=Knockout Mice | publisher=The Human Genome | url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD021038.html | accessdate=2009-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  To start the homologous recombination, the DNA sequence of the gene that needs to be replaced would need to be known.  Next is to make a new DNA sequence that is needed to be inserted into a chromosome.  That chromosome is going to take the place of a wild-type allele.  The artificial inactive DNA sequence is introduced (this piece is nearly identical in sequence to the knocked out gene).  This artificial sequence flanks the DNA sequence in both directions on the chromosome.  The cell recognizes the identical stretches of DNA, and &quot;trades&quot; the existing gene with the artificial DNA.  Since the artificial DNA is inactive, the function of the existing gene has now been &quot;knocked out&quot; by gene targeting.  The new cells will keep growing and dividing with the new gene inside of it.

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt; An embryo from a mice in the blastocyst stage of a species with gray fur is isolated.  Then the embryonic stem cells are removed from the blastocyst and put on a tissue culture to be grown.  Transfer the homologous recombinant gene and grow them in gancyclvir and neomycin.  The cells with the new genes for white fur are then transferred back to the blastocyst.  Many of the transformed blastocysts will be implanted into pseudo-pregnant mouse with white fur.  The mouse will give birth to some white mice and some with patches of gray, showing the activity of the old gene.  The mice with the patches - which means they have both the gray fur and white fur genes - will mate with a white mouse.  If the gametes of the gray white mouse were from the recombinant stem cells then it will give birth to all gray mice.  All of the cells in the mice are heterozygous for the fur gene.  The gray mice will then mate together with the heterozygous mice.  Identify which mice has the homozygous recombinant and mate them until both of the alleles are knocked out.  The end result is the knock out mouse which is when both of the alleles have been knocked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Campbell, A. Malcom | title=Homologous Recombination and Knockout Mouse | publisher= Davidson College | url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/genomics/method/homolrecomb.html | accessdate=2009-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gene Trapping====
Gene trapping is done by using a sequence of artificial DNA which holds a &quot;reporter gene&quot; that is made to insert into any gene at random.  The artificial DNA prevents RNA splicing in the cell, thus preventing the existing gene from synthesizing its assigned protein and eliminating its function.  Now the activity of the artificial &quot;reporter gene&quot; can be observed and studied, to determine the existing gene's normal function in the mouse.

====Which method is better?====
For both of these methods, a DNA vector is used to carry the artificial DNA into the embryonic stem cells of the mice.  Once the DNA is injected, the cells are cultured in-vitro, and then injected into mouse embryos.  These embryos are given planted into female mice, which then give birth to mice with the knocked out genes.

Both ways have their own advantages.  For example, in gene targeting, the target gene is known in the DNA sequence.  This method allows researchers to knock out the sequence(s) that they find are interesting.  On the other hand, although the specific gene which is knocked out is unknown in gene trapping, it would create different kinds of mice because there is no efficiency or precision in how the &quot;reporter gene&quot; binds; finding the function of specific gene can become cumbersome because of the randomness.  The researchers need to spend a lot of time testing the ES cell to identify which gene has been knocked out.  Moreover, a certain gene that is not easily chosen may be knocked out in random manner.

== Overview ==

Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas that regulates glucose levels in the blood. Without insulin, cells cannot use the energy from glucose to carry out functions within the body. Insulin was first discovered in 1921 by Frederick Grant Banting and Charles Best from extracted substances from the pancreas of dogs in their laboratory.  The material was then used to keep diabetic dogs alive, and then used in 1922 on a 14 year old diabetic boy.  The FDA approved insulin in 1939.  In 1966 insulin was synthesized by Michael Katsoyannis in his laboratory, which marked the first complete hormone to be successfully synthesized.   Synthetic insulin is used as a drug to treat diabetes, and the current forms on the market include insulin from bovine and porcine pancreases, but the most widely used is a form made from recombinant human insulin.

[[file:Insulin_primary_structure.jpg‎|500px|thumbnail| Primary Structure of Human Insulin]]

== Function==

Insulin is made in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas pancreas] by beta cells.  After the body takes in food, these beta cells release insulin, which enables cells in the liver, muscles and fat tissues to take up glucose and either store it as glycogen or allow blood to transfer it to organs in the body for use as an energy source.  This process stops the use of fat as a source of energy.   When glucose levels are elevated in the blood, insulin is produced at higher rates by the pancreas in order to maintain normal sugar concentrations in the blood.   Without insulin, the body cannot process glucose effectively and glucose begins to build up in the blood stream instead of being transported to different cells . In contrast with elevated levels of glucose in the blood, when there is a deficit of glucose available to the body, alpha cells in the pancreas release [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon glucagon], a hormone that causes the liver to convert stored glycogen into usable glucose which is then released into the bloodstream. 

Some of the effects of the insulin on the metabolism include:
1. Controlling cell intake of substances like glucose in many organs like muscles and adipose tissues.
2. Controlling amino acid uptake, thus increasing DNA replication and protein synthesis
3. Altering the activity of enzymatic cells 

Other Cellular effects of insulin include:
1. Increasing synthesis of glycogen. Glycogen is a type of storage for glucose and is stored in the liver. Levels of blood glucose determine whether glucose is stored as glycogen or is excreted. Low levels of glucose cause the liver to excrete glucose, while higher levels of glucose allows glucose to be stored as glycogen.
2. Increasing the synthesis and esterification of fatty acids. This is caused by the insulin causing fat cells to convert blood lipids to triglycerides. Esterification is caused when the insulin causes the adipose tissue to convert fats from fatty acid esters.
3. Increasing the esterification of fatty 
4. Decreasing protein breakdown (proteolysis)
5. Reducing lipolysis
6. Increasing uptake of substances like amino acid and potassium
7. Relaxing wall of arteries of muscles, which vasodilation
8. Increasing secretion of HCl into the stomach

== Structure ==

Insulin is a hormone consisting of 2 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypeptide polypeptide] chains.  Each chain is composed of a specific sequence of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid amino acid] residues connected by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_bond peptide bonds].   In humans, chain A has 21 amino acids, and chain B has 30.  Post translational modifications result in the connection of these two chains by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide_bridge disulfide bridges].  Cysteine residues on A7 and B7, as well as A20 to B19 are covalently connected by disulfide bridges. Chain A also has an internal disulfide bridge connecting A6 to A11. The 3D structure of insulin is composed of 3 helices and the three disulfide bridges.  Hydrophobic amino acid residues are clustered  on the inside of the  molecule while the polar amino acids residues are located on the outer surface.  This arrangement of amino acid residues lends stability to the overall molecule.  A single molecule of insulin can form a dimer with another insulin molecule, but the most active form is a single unit.  The chemical formula for the insulin monomer is:  C256H381N65O79S6.

== Synthesis==
[[image:Insulin_synthesis.jpg‎‎|700px|thumbnail| Insulin Synthesis Using Recombinant DNA Technology. ]]
  
Insulin production takes place in the pancreas, however diabetics lack the capability to produce insulin, so insulin derived by synthetic means  is required  to maintain normal blood glucose levels.   Bovine and porcine insulin is similar to human insulin, however  insulin synthesized from these sources can have adverse affects when used to treat diabetic patients due to possible long term effects from the continual injection of a foreign substance into the body.   As a result of these possible adverse effects, in 1977, researches at the Genentech corporation developed means to reproduce insulin derived from humans through recombinant DNA technology.  The steps involved in cloning human insulin begin with extracting proinsulin mRNA from the pancreas of a human with a functioning pancreas.  Next, the enzyme [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase reverse transcriptase] is used to synthesize a strand of DNA that is complementary to the proinsulin [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrna mRNA].  This DNA complement is called cDNA.  The cDNA and RNA strands form a double helix hybrid.  Next, the RNA is hydrolyzed off by raising the pH, and the DNA strand complementary to the original cDNA strand is formed with the help of an enzyme called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_transferase terminal transferase].  Restriction enzymes can be used to cut the gene and isolate just the sequence that encodes for the insulin protein.  Next, circular units of DNA, called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid plasmids], are extracted from E. coli bacteria cells and cut with the same restriction enzyme that was used to cut  the human chromosome.  Using the same restriction enzymes creates complementary ends on the plasmid and the insulin gene.   Next, the insulin gene is inserted into the plasmid at the proper location and the enzyme DNA ligase is used to form the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodiester_bond phosphodiester bonds] between the insulin gene and the plasmid.  This step essentially “glues” the insulin gene into the E. coli plasmid vector.  A certain type of plasmid called an “expression vector” is used in this process, which contains a bacterial promoter that facilitates the  formation mRNA.  Once the insulin genes are ligated into the vector, the vector is inserted into a bacterial cell.  The bacterial cell acts as a host for the translation process of mRNA to protein.  These host cells are harvested and allowed to reproduce, which creates a colony of insulin producing bacterial cells.  The insulin can then be purified and packaged.

== Alternative Synthesis==
Another possible method to synthesize insulin was recently proposed by a pharmaceutical company SynBioSys in 2006 which used safflower to produce insulin rather than bacteria. Their goal ultimately was to reduce economic costs by exceeding its target and achieving accumulation levels of 1.2 percent of total seed protein. The company claims that this breakthrough in plant-produced insulin have the potential to &quot;fundamentally transform the economics and scale of insulin production.&quot; The company announces safflower produced insulin can be up to 60% less expensive than insulin manufactured through bacterial cells.

The clinical testing trials were promising: 
SBS-1000 was bioequivalent to most common brand name insulin medications.
SBS-1000 in humans showed no difference in metabolizing bacteria based insulin rather than through safflower.
SBS-1000 was well tolerated at pharmacologically active dosages.

== Release ==
Insulin is released in the body by the Beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. This is done in two phases, which includes a response in a change in blood glucose level and another type of release which is slower and is independent of sugar. 

Insulin released by a change in blood glucose level starts when glucose enters glycolysis and the respiratory cycle. During this cycle, ATP is produced by oxidation, and thus the level of ATP produced is representative of the blood glucose level. When the amount of ATP produced gets to a certain point, potassium channels that are activated by ATP close, depolarizing the cell membrane, leading to a change in other voltage activated channels, such as the calcium channels. Due to the depolarization, voltage gated calcium channels open, allowing an influx of calcium ions into the cell. The increased level of calcium in the cell activates phospholipase C. Phospholipase C cleaves the membrane phospholipid phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate, which in turn becomes inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol. 
The newly formed inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (also known as IP3) binds to receptors on IP3 gated channels embedded on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. The IP3 gated channels allow an influx of calcium ions in the cell, repolarizing the cell. Insulin, which was synthesized prior to this reaction, is stored in secretory vesicles, and is waiting to be released. The increased levels of calcium due to the binding of IP3 causes the release of the insulin from these vesicles.
The beta cells of the islets of Langerhan regulates the glucose level by this reaction. When the blood glucose level is physiologically normal, the beta cells cease to secrete any more insulin. This is done by the sympathetic nervous system, by the release of the hormon norepinephrine.

When blood glucose level drops, hyperglycemic hormones (glucagon) are released by the alpha cells of the Islets of Langerhans. This causes glucose to be released into the blood from storage within the body, and most mainly comes from the liver. The glucose is stored as glycogen within the liver.

== Degradation ==

Insulin has two routes of degradation after it has attached to the receptor site on the cell membrane. (1) It may be released into the extracellular environment or (2) it may be degraded by the cell. If insulin is to be degraded by the cell, the insulin-receptor complex is brought into the intracellular area via endocytosis. Subsequently, insulin-degrading enzymes break down the molecule. Insulin is degraded primarily in the liver and the kidneys. The liver is responsible for degrading insulin that is in the bloodstream for the first time; the kidneys are responsible for degrading insulin that is in normal circulation. Natural, endogenously produced insulin is estimated to be degraded within one hour after its initial release into circulation by the pancreatic beta cells. The half life of insulin is approximated to be 4-6 minutes. 


== Diabetes ==
Diabetes is a condition which the body either cannot produce insulin or does not respond properly to insulin. There are two types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is when insulin is not produced by the body. This is due to an autoimmune condition, in which body attacks the Beta cells of the Islets of Langerhans. This can be treated by insulin injections. Type 2 diabetes is when there is a resistance to insulin, reduction in production of insulin, or both. 

Insulin is used to maintain a balance of glucose levels in a body’s bloodstream. After a meal, digestion of the carbohydrates occurs and enters the blood as glucose to provide the body with energy. To maintain a body’s blood sugar level, excess sugar is stored in the liver and is released once the blood sugar level starts to become low. This is where diabetes occurs; when the glucose is unable to enter the cells from the pancreas when the sugar levels are too low. If this disease is left untreated, complications, such as blindness and damage to the kidneys can occur.

==Non Diabetic Uses of Insulin==
1) Intravenous feeding solutions: One of the active ingredients in IV solutions used for feeding the body in hospital patients is insulin. The presence of insulin in the boyd helps improve the adsorption of nutrients and when combined with growth hormones, can help reverse negative protien balance. 

2) Intravenous GIK solution: Glucose, insulin and potassium solutions have been used to reduce the mortality rate of acute mycoradial infractions, or otherwise known as heart attacks, along with postoperative cardiac failure. By addition of GIK infusions, it is a quick way to infuse potassium into all the cells of the heart even when circulation has ceased completely to readily restore action potential in cardial muscle to induce contraction. 

3) Dialysis shock recovery: A bit insulin can be added to an electrolyte solution that can help patients absorb electrolytes quickly to recover from a dialysis shock. 

4) Sports Drinks and Oral Rehydration Solutions: The sugars found in these drinks, such as gatorade, allow for increased secretion of insulin in the body which speeds up absorption of water and electrolytes into all the cells of the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">CHAYEI SARAH - 'the life of Sarah'  Genesis 23-25

Ask Not What External Events Can Do To You;
Ask What You Can Do To Maintain Equilibrium In The Face of External Events

Sarah &quot;Sarah’s life&quot;. This parasha is an epitaph on behalf of Sarah as she is the only woman in the Bible that received such notoriety. This choice of this title for the week's portion indicates that Sarah is of paramount importance as the Bible normally only speaks this way of the patriarchs.   
&quot;And Sarah was a hundred and twenty seven years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.&quot; (Genesis 23:1)

Avraham had encamped at various times at the trees of Mamre, just east of Hebron, and this is the place where Sarah, the mother of the Jewish people, died at the age of 127.

Reigning in Life
The Midrash comments that the name change from Sarai to Sarah signified our Matriarch being given dominion over the entire world (from the word Sarah -- female officer or ruler). 

One might think that though she had a long life,  a life full of good deeds,  but it was anything but a good life. Anyone can see from reading the basic text, all the troubles Sarah had.  First she had to travel far away, then there was a famine. She was kidnapped twice, and was taken as a captive, first by the King of Egypt and then by Avimelech. She also experienced many years of childlessness. Finally Sarah gave birth to a boy. Not long after that however, Yishmael, the son of the concubine Hagar, began to have a bad influence on her son. Both Yishmael and Hagar had to be sent away. Now I would call that a hard and troublesome life, full of sadness and hardships.

If one looks at Sarah's life, one certainly does not get the impression that she ruled over the entire world and that she &quot;called the shots&quot;. In effect, she was dominated by events that surrounded her. And yet, we are taught that she was given the name Sarah (rather than Sarai) because she ruled over the entire world.

The reason why it says she had a good life, is because of the way she, Sarah, looked at life. The negative things that occur in ones life can be a devastation or an opportunity to grow.  As one tries to believe that life has a higher purpose than the here and now, we can strive to cultivate a life like that of Sarah.   Rav Nissan Alpert suggests that in spite of all that happened, Sarah did rule over the entire world.  A person who can maintain her equilibrium, her serenity and faith, in spite of the events that surround and affect her, is indeed a person who &quot;rules over the entire world&quot;.

We cannot change the course of events.  There are things that will happen between nations; there are natural phenomenon; there are things that will happen in a family.  This is what life is all about.  As anyone who has lived for any significant amount of time knows, life is a series of going from one crisis to another.

We can look upon Sarah as an example of how to stand in faith.  When everything looks wrong or we do not understand what Yahweh is doing in our life, remain steadfast and be faithful.

The only way one rules over all that takes place in one's life and manages to be in control,  is by maintaining one's serenity and equilibrium throughout it all.  That is what the life of Sarah was.  For a woman to remain barren for 90 years and experience so many the trials and tribulations was not a simple matter.  And yet we see the same woman of valor, the same personality of kindness, the same Matriarch Sarah throughout. This is indeed a person who ruled over the entire world.

If a person has learned the secret of not letting external events shape his or her life and rather maintains an internal serenity in spite of those events, that person has in fact achieved a great degree of control.

The Faith of Sarah
King Solomon composed &quot;Aishes Chayil&quot; (Woman of Valor - from Proverbs 31), which is sung in Jewish homes each Friday night, with Sarah in mind.   What is the real meaning of &quot;a woman of valor?&quot;  As one Torah teacher states:    This is what makes a true Aishes Chayil, of whom King Solomon wrote. She possesses the ability, above all else, to transform her non-spiritual reality into one of tremendous spirituality, even when all the surrounding elements are working against her. This is especially true of the wife's effect on her husband. Through her actions (grounded in Torah) a woman can increase her husband's spiritual insight/ability.

Avraham on at least two occasions told kings that Sarah was his sister, a half truth. In spite of being barren, apparently degraded by her husband denials, living all over the known world from Ur to Pharoah’s Egypt, and even seeing her own handmaid produce offspring from Avraham, Sarah remained faithful to him, even calling him lord (1 Peter 3:5,6). What an example for us all.

Of course, we always think about the faith of Avraham, who has been labeled the father of our faith (Romans 4:12), and a friend of God (James 2:23). Little mention is made of the faith exhibited by Sarah, and yet, she also is listed among the faithful in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews in the &quot;hall of fame&quot; for faith.

&quot;By faith also Sarah herself received the power to conceive, even beyond the right time of life, since she considered Him faithful Who had promised; therefore, also, there came from one man, and him regarded as almost dead, descendants as the stars of Heaven in multitude, and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore&quot; (Hebrews 11:11-12)

Here Sarah is noted as one who faithfully considered the Holy One as willing and able to complete the promises He made to them regarding the birth of a physical heir So when you couple this statement with the references to the other faith explanations about Avraham throughout the Scriptures, you can conclude that the faith component in their lives was mutually shared.  They epitomized and exemplified the awesome power of husband and wife working faithfully as one flesh to accomplish what the Father had called them to do.

The Fruit of Righteousness
After this, Avraham's servant, Eliezer of Damascus (the one Avraham had originally thought would be his heir), made a covenant with Avraham to find his son Yitzchak (Isaac) a wife from among his relatives living in Mesopotamia - and not from among the Canaanites.  Eliezer took the oath and set out on the 500 mile journey to Haran looking for the right wife for Yitzchak (also called the city of Nahor and the place where his father Terah died), taking ten camels laden with gifts in search of Isaac's (Yitzchak’s) bride.

At a city well near Nahor, Eliezer made the camels kneel down and asked Yahweh for a sign: when the maidens would come to the well, he would ask some for water to drink, but the woman who offered to also draw water for his camels as well (roughly 140 gallons) would be the one chosen by Yahweh for Avraham’s son.  On the way, Eliezer received tremendous help from Heaven.   It took him much less time than it should have normally taken.  Eliezer received Divine enabling.   The sign that he devised helped him unambiguously identify the right match for Isaac (Yitzchak). (The maiden who says, &quot;I will also give your camels to drink...&quot;)  Everything fitted into place like a glove. When Eliezer related the entire story to Rivka's (Rebbecca) father and brother (Bethuel and Lavan), they responded,  &quot;This matter has come out from God. We cannot speak about it -- for bad or for good&quot; [Bereshis 24:50].  In other words, they recognized that this was the hand of God orchestrating the events.

Upon hearing this, Eliezer gave Rikvah (Rebbecca)more gifts and also gave gifts to the rest of the family. They then ate a meal together and spent the night.   The following morning, Eliezer wanted to leave for Canaan with Rikvah, but her parents wanted her to stay another ten days (tradition has it that she was fourteen at the time). When they finally asked her if she was willing to depart immediately, she said she was, and left for Canaan without further delay with her maidservants.  

Eliezer took Rivka, brought her back to Yitzchak (Isaac), and related all that had happened and all of these signs.  If anyone ever needed confirmation that he had the right marriage partner, Yitzchak surely had such confirmation in Eliezer's description.  

Faith or Signs
It was no mean small task to draw water for 10 camels (about 140 gallons) and to do so with a willing and gracious spirit.   When Eliezar chose this as a test he was looking for the same qualities of kindness, humility and servanthood which he knew to be in his master Avraham's life. He was looking for the same characteristics for a suitable partner for Yitzchak.

The verse then says that Yitzchak brought Rivka to the tent of Sarah his mother, and he married her [24:67]. 

The Targum interprets this verse to mean that &quot;Yitzchak took Rivka and he saw that her deeds and actions were like those of his own mother, Sarah.  Therefore, he married her.&quot;   What more did Yitzchak need?   Eliezer told him about all the miracles and all the incontrovertible signs from Heaven.   What more could he ask for?

The Brisker Rav answered that simple people always see these &quot;signs from Heaven&quot;, but not a Yitzchak.  Yitzchak knew that all that matters is whether she was a righteous woman - whether she had the attributes and deeds of his mother Sarah.  Sarah poured her life out into Yitzchak in such a way that she was the ideal woman in his sight.   The testimony of her influence is seen in his willingness to lay down his life at Yahweh's command when required to do so, as at Mt. Moriah.

The &quot;righteous individuals&quot;, Lavan and Bethuel, are blown away by the &quot;signs&quot;.   They see the Hand of God in everything.   However, the holy person - the really righteous person, does not look for signs or try to play &quot;Providence Guessing&quot; games.   Such a person looks at the bottom line.  What it comes down to, as the Targum explains, is &quot;and Yitzchak saw that her actions were those of Sarah&quot;.   For Yitzchak, the only thing that is important is the fact that her actions are those of Sarah and he is comforted from the loss of his mother and her righteous influence in his life.

Do not look for signs; do not look for Providence; do not look for miracles.   Look for the standard by which we know how to judge actions,  kindness, righteousness, and honesty.  

Avraham takes Keturah as his wife to fill his life after Sarah's departure and had 6 more sons.   Keturah and her children do not become a partaker of the covenantal promises with Avraham.  He gave gifts to these children as a legacy, but left everything else he owned to Yitzchak, the appointed heir and Yitzchak becomes  the only son to inherit the promises. 
 
The parashah ends with Avraham's death (at age 175), and how his two sons (Yitzchak and Ishmael) buried him in the Cave of Machpelah next to his wife Sarah. As a postscript, we are also told of the descendants of Ishmael and of his death (at age 137):

      <text xml:space="preserve">TOLDOT    The Generations
Genesis  25:19- 28: 9

The Faith of Abraham
In Toldot, there is a reaffirmation on the part of Yahweh to Isaac, of the promises that He made Isaac's father Avraham. Yahweh promises to give Isaac the Land of Canaan as His Promised Land, and to increase his descendants like the stars of the sky.  All the nations of the Earth will be blessed by Avraham's and Isaac's seed. But notice that there is a reason stated as to why this will be the case:  &quot;Because Avraham obeyed My voice, and observed My safeguards, My commandments, My decrees, and My Torahs.&quot;

Many of us have been rightfully taught that Avraham is the quintessential example of faith.  He left Ur of the Chaldees because the Creator God called him out and told him that He would bless him and multiply his descendants, making them be a blessing to all of mankind.  We know that the primary part of this blessing is that later Yeshua the Messiah would come through the line of Avraham.  But was Avraham simply blessed because he had &quot;faith&quot;?   Faith is not just a belief in something. &quot;Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&quot; (Hebrews 11:1).  Faith must also be evidenced by our actions, i.e., we must be living the appropriate lifestyle that we may be able to reach toward those things that are &quot;of faith&quot; and unseen.
Avraham was able to be blessed by God because He obeyed Him.   Bereisheet/Genesis 26:5 

The Hebrew verb for obey is shama  meaning &quot;hear, listen to, obey.&quot;  Avraham not only had to hear the voice of Yahweh, but he also had to obey it.   It is commonly taught that the Torah was not given or was not even in effect until Moses at Mount Sinai.  This is not true.  The Torah pre-dates Mount Sinai, although it was not formally given to the people until Mount Sinai.
It is very interesting what you find when you compare Christian and Jewish commentaries on Genesis 26:5, both in fact confirm Messianic beliefs.

The Bible Knowledge Commentary, Old Testament edited by John F. Walvoord and Roy B. Zuck states &quot;These are standard terms in the legal literature of the Old Testament.  Israel would immediately see Torah (Law) terminology in the record of Avraham, and would be prompted to keep the Law.  Avraham learned that true faith obeys God's words.&quot;

Pentateuch &amp; Haftorahs edited by J.H. Hertz says this means &quot;laws. Customs and traditional ordinances orally transmitted from generation to generation &quot;   (This line of succession goes back to Adam through Noah)

The ArtScroll Chumash takes it further in stating &quot;My Torahs [or: teachings], in the plural, are the Written Torah and the Oral Torah.  The latter includes rules and interpretations transmitted to Moses at Sinai.   &quot;The consensus of Rabbinic opinion is that Avraham arrived at a knowledge of the entire Torah through Divine Inspiration and observed it voluntarily&quot;

Avraham  obeyed the Torah before it was formally codified with the people of Israel at Sinai. 
Truly, if we are to follow in the example of Avraham, considered to be &quot;the father of faith,&quot; then we are to obey Yahweh without question.  We are to be obedient to Him and be living appropriately, so that we might be able to reach toward the things that are unseen, just as Avraham was led into a land by Yahweh that he had not seen.

Inheriting The Promises
Avraham settles in Hebron  (13:18) while still in his seventy-fifth year (Seder Olam, ch.1).  He remains there until the cities of the plain are destroyed, when he is nearly 100, relocating in the south, in the land of the Philistines (Bereishit 20:1).  Thus, he lived in Hebron for 25 years.  When, just before the Akeidah (the offering of Yitzchak), the Torah says that Avraham resided in the land of the Philistines for many years (21:34),  this means that he was there for a longer period than he had been in Hebron, namely, 26 years (Bereishit Rabbah 54:9).   At the end of this time, Avraham is 126, Sarah is 116 and Yitzchak (Yitzchak) is 26.

Sarah did not die at the time of the Akeidah, because she was only 116 then.  However, Rivkah was born then.

All midrashim (Commentaries) agree that the birth of Rivkah (Rebbecca) coincided with the Akeidah (Seder Olam, l.c.).  Therefore she was approximately twenty-six years younger than Yitzchak. Bereishit Rabbah 56:11  says that Yitzchak was 26 at the Akeidah, at the end of Avraham’s residence in the land of the Philistines.

Rivkah, shortly before her marriage to Yitzchak (Bereishit 24:16), is called NA’ARAH, which refers to a girl of at least 12 years of age!   Tosafot on Yevamot 61b (“v’chen”).    Rivkah was 14 when she married Yitzchak.

With the marriage of Yitzchak and Rivkah, another link is forged in the chain that creates the people of Israel. Like Avraham and Sarah before them, they have difficulty conceiving:  &quot;And Yitzchak was forty years old when he took Rivkah, daughter of Betuel the Aramean of Paddan-Aram, sister of Lavan the Aramean, to himself as a wife. And Yitzchak entreated Yahweh on behalf of his wife, because she was barren, and Yahweh was moved, so his wife Rivkah conceived&quot; Gen. 25:20-21

Radak says that Yitzchak prayed intensely so that he would not have to take a second wife as his father did. 

Vayetar “and he entreated” Yahweh, and Yahweh was entreated of him. The root, atar, means to burn incense and Rashi says that it denotes &quot;urging and profusion&quot;.   Yitzkhak went into a lengthy prayer and regular communication with Yahweh regarding it.   “How have you heard my voice”, asked Yitzkhak, “seeing I have no children.”    

By withholding children from them, He caused him to develop a deep personal relationship with Him.


Interceding For the Promises
It was the law and custom of the day that a man who had not had a child with his wife for 10 years — as in the case of Avraham — may take a second wife.  Yet, twenty years passed before Yitzchak implored Yahweh to grant him and Rivkah children!   Yitzchak’s love for Rivkah was so deep that he did not take advantage of her barreness and secure another wife, but instead he exercised faith in the promises of Yahweh to give him an inheritance through Rikvah, his chosen wife whom he loved and prayed for her barrenness. Each new generation of the patriarchs required faith to embrace the promise and in itself was a gift from Yahweh that would not naturally have occurred.  

Many Hebrew women have been barren, Sarah, Rivkah, Rachel and Channah, the mother of the prophet Shemu'el. Avraham and Sarah had to wait for over 70 years for an answer to prayer. Yitzchak and Rivka waited 20 years before they had children.  Rachel had to wait 14 years before she had children, and Chanah was barren for 19 years according to the Midrash.  In verse 26 it says that Yitzchak was 60 years old when his wife bore Esav and Ya'acov. That means that Yitzchak had prayed for 20 long years.  Twenty years of waiting to see the fulfillment of the promise that Avraham's descendants would multiply!  

The walk with the Eternal is not easy. The road is full of problems that give us reasons to give up. The walk of faith means trusting the Eternal so that you can overcome all your problems and see radical changes in life's crisis.
Romans 8:35-37 says  &quot;Who shall separate us from the love of Messiah? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Just as it is written, 'For your sake we are put to death all day long; we were regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.' But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him Who loved us.&quot; 

Also the promises of the Eternal are not fulfilled without human cooperation.  In spite of the fact that Yitzchak was the heir of the promises that were given to his father about his descendants becoming like the stars and the sand, he did not wait passively for these promises to be fulfilled.  He entered into prayer until they were fulfilled.  The Eternal has created prayer in order to cooperate with man to fulfill His plans on earth.  The prophecies in Scripture are not just there to embellish history with lovely predictions that cause us to marvel at the greatness of the Eternal, but that we should cooperate with Him so that His plans, which he has purposed ahead of time, can be fulfilled.


The Two Nations
Both sons were named from characteristics of their birth.    Ya'akov is named so because he grabbed his brother's heel as he came out of the womb (25:26).   By giving Ya'acov a name from the Hebrew root which means 'heel',  his parents were placing him in line with the prophetic fulfillment of Genesis 3, where the seed of the woman (coming through the line of Ya'acov) would crush the serpent's head.   

Esav is born first, then Ya'acov.  The boys grow to manhood.  Ya'acov is the quiet, peaceful, home-loving man; Esav the skillful hunter and man of violence.  The Hebrew word &quot;tam&quot; which is translated as &quot;quiet&quot; means, in this case, that he was not good at deception as was Esav, but upright, simple.

The rabbis interpret the word &quot;tents&quot; as a reference to the tents of Shem and Ever, who, according to tradition, were leaders of a place of study, where they gave spiritual teaching.  According to another interpretation, we can understand this word in reference to Genesis 4:20, where it has to do with raising livestock.  The Book of Jasher says[10] that Ya'acov lived in tents and raised livestock, while he was learning the instructions of the Eternal and the teachings of his parents. We know that God loved Ya'acov and that He hated Esav.  Ya'acov would go on to become the man of God while Esav  rejected Yahweh for the gods of Canaan.  

One day, when Esav  returns famished from the fields, he finds his brother Ya'acov preparing a meal of lentil pottage. Ya'acov says he will give him the food if Esav will sell him his birthright, to which Esav readily consents. The episode signifies the transfer of leadership of the clan from Esav to Ya'acov.  Esav turned his back on his birthright.  He sold it off to his brother for a bowl of lentils.

In Hebrew 12:16 it says that Esav was profane. The word that is found in the Greek translation and is translated as &quot;profane&quot; or &quot;godless&quot; is &quot;bebelos&quot;[13].   The same Greek word is found in the Septuagint in 1 Samuel 21:5 as a translation of the Hebrew word &quot;chol&quot;[14], which means &quot;secular&quot;, &quot;common&quot;, &quot;general&quot;.  It comes from a root which means &quot;to make hollow&quot;, &quot;to bore (make a hole)&quot;, &quot;to empty&quot;, &quot;to injure&quot;, &quot;to take apart&quot; and so on. That teaches us that Esav was a person who was empty on the inside, and had an exterior façade of respect.  He did not distinguish between the set apart and the common; he did not value his spiritual calling as a priest and lived only to fulfill his natural desires without care for future consequences.  He appreciated material things and pleasure more than eternal realities.  He despised the plan of salvation for mankind, which had been revealed to Avraham and Yitzchak.

People disregard the important things of life so they can comfort their flesh just a little, as in the story of Ya'acov and Esav (Esau).  Later they come to regret their actions and wish they had not been so foolish.   All of us fit this category, but some are more careless with their “birthright” than others.  Compromise never pays off.  When will we learn?  Esav was counting on his inheritance.   The birthright (the spiritual endowment) would never be seen, in this life anyway, but the inheritance was something tangible and therefore desired by Esav. 

The Two Natures
&quot;I have loved you,&quot; says Yahweh.  But you say, &quot;How have You loved us?&quot; &quot;Was not Esav Ya'acov's brother?&quot; declares Yahweh.  &quot;Yet I have loved Ya'acov.   &quot;'A son honors his father, and a servant his master.  Then if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My respect?' says Yahweh of hosts to you, O priests who despise My name.  But you say, 'How have we despised Your name?' 

&quot;True Torah was in his mouth and unrighteousness was not found on his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many back from iniquity.  7 &quot;For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and men should seek Torah from his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of hosts.   Malachi 1:2, 6; 2:6-7

Malachi is addressing the pride of the Edomites in his day and cites the choice of Yitzchak over Yishmael.

&quot;I have hated Esav&quot;   The word for hate in Hebrew (sanei) is not emotional dislike. Yeshua used the word as a matter of choosing God's purposes over your parents (Luke 14:26). God chose Ya'acov over Esav before he was born.  It is possible that Esav was rejected due to His foreknowledge of his later lack of faith in the promises and his rebellious nature.

&quot;For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel&quot;   This has always been the case.  Not all of Avraham’s children were part of Israel, nor all of Yitzchak’s either.  Yahweh limited those He chose in the line of Avraham and Yitzchak, so only part of natural Israel will be included.  For “through Yitzchak your descendants will be named” (Rom. 9:6-13 vs.7).

It is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but children of the promise.  Only faith in Messiah’s sacrifice (the promise) can make one part of true Israel as even the patriarchs had to believe in God’s blessing to be part of Israel. The real issue has always been faith in the promise.  Under the Torah, a Hebrew person who did not follow the covenant would be “cut off” from his people (Exod 12:19, Levit 7:27, 17:9, Num 9:13, etc.).  It took faith in the promise to participate in sacrifices, Passover, and the institutions of Torah.

Esav's character and attitude were detestable to the Eternal.  It is obvious that his father Yitzchak was not aware of the evil that was hiding behind the respectful façade. Yitzkhak’s sight was failing and he thought he was about to die.  He asked his favorite son, Esav to get him some fresh venison and make it his special way.  While he was out hunting, Rikvah (his mother) prepared a goat the same way Esav did his venison, dressed Ya'acov in some of Esav’s hunting clothes and placed goat hair on his arms and neck (Esav was a hairy man) and brought him to Yitzkhak.

Most emphasis is laid on the deceitfulness of Ya'acov (Jacob) and his mother in securing the birthright blessings.  However, it can be overlooked that Ya'acov had secured the birthright from Esau by a contract previously, and so it was rightfully his.   However because Esau wanted the material side of the blessings, he did not honour the transaction that they had made over the bowl of &quot;pottage&quot; and allow Ya'acov to receive the birthright blessing.   He set about to defraud Ya'acov by either not informing his father that Ya'acov was the rightful recipient and/or by not making known to Ya'acov his father's intention of imparting the blessing that day.   So we see a web of deceit surrounding Ya'acov and the receiving of the birthright and Esau rising up to take the birthright that he had given to Ya'acov for the price of a meal.
Yitzchak (Isaac) arranged with Esau to enact the blessing as was his duty seeing he was the firstborn.   However when Ya'acov had intercepted Esau receiving it, Yitzchak could still have reversed it, yet he chose not to do so. Did Yitzchak recognise the will of Yahweh in what he had done?   
Did he recognise that Ya'acov was more deserving of the inheritance than Esau, even though he personally preferred Esau and had the events been a deciding factor in recognising Divine intervention and endorsement of the more worthy son?

Esav had married a Cana’anite woman against his father’s will.  Yitzkhak suspected something was wrong when the voice did not fit the smell and touch of Ya'acov.  Why didn’t Yitzkhak recognize the younger son’s voice?  A person who has lost his sight tends to increase his remaining senses. Unless Yitzkhak was getting to be hard of hearing as well Ya'acov could never have succeeded.    Yitzkhak could have been aware of the transfer of the inheritance to the younger son and complied with the deception.  If Yitzkhak could say that Ya'acov had tricked him,  then the older son would have to accept it and family peace could reign in Yitzkhak’s final days.

Esav was so angry, that he again married a Cana’anite woman.  This rebellious nature of Esav is why Yahweh chose Ya'acov to fulfill the promise to Avraham.
According to Talmud and the Book of Jasher,[27] Yosef was born at the end of the 14 years that Ya'acov served for his two wives.  Here we can calculate the age of Ya'acov when he came to Lavan.  When Ya'acov stood before Pharaoh in Mitzrayim, he was 130 years old, according to Genesis 47:9.  Therefore Ya'acov was 91 years old when Yosef was born.  Then Ya'acov must have been 77 years old when he left the land of Kana'an to travel to Lavan. Talmud[28] claims that Ya'acov stayed in the house of Ever for 14 years to study, before continuing on to Lavan.

Ya'acov went to his father’s homeland to find a wife.  He knew this was his father’s desire and the will of Yahweh.  While there, he demonstrated integrity and honor by working seven years for the woman of his dreams.   Even after Levan cheated him by switching women on the night of the betrothal, Ya'acov was honorable.  Then he worked another seven years for the bride of his choice and another seven years to build a flock for himself.  Several times Lavan tried to cheat Ya'acov but Yahweh was with him and caused him to prosper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This may be a lack of Haskell knowledge speaking, but I don't think it is. 

The answers for the &quot;second round&quot; seem off.

The very last reference to the function uppercase (before the exercise) has the signature 

'''uppercase, lowercase :: String -&gt; String'''

The function is the exercise is

'''f x y = uppercase (x ++ y)'''

The answer to the exercise is

'''f :: Bool -&gt; Bool -&gt; Bool'''

Ultimately, the f function will use the '''toUpper''' function. This function doesn't work with Bool values. How is the answer correct? Can an breakdown be provided by anyone for new readers?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Scenery objects treat transparency differently to rolling stock.  Only other scenery objects can be seen through transparent scenery objects.

For Blender settings see Torsten's comments in this thread in the Trainz forum labeled &quot;Transparent and semi- transparent meshes with Blender 2.65&quot;:

http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?98810-Transparent-and-semi-transparent-meshes-with-Blender-2-65&amp;p=1113319#post1113319

Creating a transparent file in GIMP then painting it with opacity of around 30% seems to work.

I propose to delete the book.
* Length: 770 words
* I see no valuable content.
* Initial contribution: September 2007 and October 2007 
* The title of the book &quot;A Scientific Perspective of Philosophy&quot; looks suspect; Google finds under this title as a search term only this wikibook.
* The book states that it is inspired by the Russian wikibook [[:ru:Философия науки]], whose title reads in English &quot;Philosophy of Science&quot;.
** Wikibooks already has [[Introduction_to_Philosophy/Philosophy_of_Science]]
--[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:29, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comments'''  As the original contributor made clear at the [[Introduction_to_Philosophy/Philosophy_of_Science]] he feels there are two different meanings of the phrase &quot;Philosophy of Science&quot; and goes on to point out that the book in question and the module are discussing different issues.  Reading both they seem to be quite different their approach.  While the last edit by the main contributor was in October 2007, there were two non-trivial edits was on September 13, 2009.  One by an IP user, and an other by logged in user (of course nothing says these were not the same person. It was the logged in user's only edit)  While the title is a bit unorthodox, judging by the edits at [[Introduction_to_Philosophy/Philosophy_of_Science]] it seems the main contributor was aware that this would usually be titled &quot;Philosophy of Science&quot; and was trying to choose something to distinguish it. Googling &quot;Noob to Pro&quot; also mostly pulls up links related to the Blender book, so I don't think in this case the Google search indicates that anything is suspect.  These are the points I think are imporant in considering this book.
* The book is a stub.  Even more then that the book never made it to the point of discussing its main topic.  Instead it stands as more or less an introduction.
* It also appears to be abandoned for approximately two years.
* There were two recent edits, but whether or not the were constructive is open to opinion.  I tend to view them as deteriorating the introduction to the book.
* The book as been tagged with {{tlx|cleanup}} for two years and {{tlx|stub}} for one month.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Esters are another carboxylic derivative. Out of all the carboxylic acid derivatives, esters are considered to be the most important. They are especially present in nature, as they are responsible for the smell of flowers and fruit. The general structure of an ester is shown in the picture to the right. 

==IUPAC Nomenclature==
Esters are named as alkyl alkanoates. The part of the ester, known as the ester grouping: the carbon doubly bonded to the oxygen and single bonded to the OR group, is called the alkoxy carbonyl. 

Generally speaking, a cyclic ester is called a lactone.  The IUPAC naming is detailed below as follows:

IUPAC Nomeclature:

1.	The carbonyl carbon is designated as carbon number 1. This will be true unless there are more important functional groups present on the molecule but for these purposes, assume the ester is the predominant functional group. Other rules and modifications become necessary as the molecule becomes more and more complex and as more functional groups exist. &lt;br&gt;
2.	It is easiest to name the compound by treating it as two parts: &lt;br&gt;
(a)	The first part is the alkyl group attached the terminal &lt;br&gt;
(b)	Second portion is the alkyl group bonded to carbon #1. &lt;br&gt;
3.	Once the two groups have been identified, the alkyl groups should be named according to the usual IUPAC nomenclature for alkyl groups. Remember to include the carbonyl carbon when this chain is being named. &lt;br&gt;
4.	Once the two chains have been named, they need to be modified to represent the fact that an ester is present in the compound. The chain branching off the terminal oxygen is not modified. For example if a methyl group were attached, it would remain methyl. On the other hand, drop the “-ane”, “-ene”, or “yne,” suffix and add the suffic “oate” to signify that an ester is present. &lt;br&gt;

==Physical and Structural Properties==

The carboxylate group is a polar group in it of itself but nonpolar carbon and hydrogen chains surround it. Because of their presence, ester molecules are only slightly polar because of the dipole-dipole bonding between them. Because of this, the esters with few carbons are liquid at room temperature while the esters with more carbon chains are solids. 

[[Image:ester_resonance.jpg|left|Ester Resonance]]

Resonance is prominent in esters. Recall that resonance is the movement of electrons within a molecule. Though it has many meaning, resonance implies the flow of electron density from one atom to another. It means that the electron density does not belong to just one of the atoms, but is shared within numerous atoms in the molecule. This property is the reason why the carbonyl carbon is not as electrophilic. One of the lone pairs of electrons from the terminal oxygen can form a double bond with the carbonyl carbon that breaks its double bond with the other oxygen thereby giving it a negative charge. Because electron density is being essentially given to the carbon, it becomes less electrophilic meaning that it in essence is less susceptible to nucleophilic attack. 

==Reactions==

Esters undergo numerous reactions though the majority of them follow the same mechanism. If one reaction is understood and the mechanism clear, the rest of the reactions and their mechanism inevitably become much easier to follow and understand. 

1. Esters hydrolyze to carboxylic acids: Like the other carboxylic derivatives, esters also are susceptible to addition-elimination pathways. However, because of the resonance present in esters, they are less susceptible, though they still do occur. Because they are not as electrophilic, they need to be acid or base catalyzed in order for the reaction to take place before water creates the  carboxylic acid. 

[[Image:ester_hydrolysis.png|center|frame|Ester Hydrolysis under Basic Conditions]]

2. Transesterification with alcohols: Transesterification means that the alkyl group attached to the terminal oxygen is switched with the alkyl group attached to the alcohol. To do this, it is necessary for the reaction to be acid or base catalyzed like it was in the previous reaction. Like the esterification process, this reaction is reversible. 

The mechanism of this reaction is identical to the hydrolysis to the carboxylic acids. The carbonyl oxygen is protonated with the acid, after which the carbonyl carbon is attacked via nucleophilic attack. On the other hand, under base catalyzed reaction, the alcohol is deprotonated, and the alkoxide group that results from the deprotonation adds to the ester carbonyl group. 

3. Amines and esters form amides: Amines are much more nucleophilic than the alcohols, thus they form amides. Because it is more nucleophilic than alcohols, acid and base are not needed to activate this reaction, though heat is sometimes needed. In this mechanism, the lone pair on the ammonia attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester; the double bond breaks, and the lone pair moves to the top of the oxygen, creating a negative charge on the oxygen. When the lone pair comes back down to reform the carbon-oxygen double bond, the OR’ group leaves to form the amide. 

4. Gnignard reagents transform esters into alcohols: Esters converted into alcohols by using two equivalent ratios of Gnignard reagents. All esters save that for formate esters  -- which form secondary alcohols – form tertiary alcohols. The mechanism to form an alcohol is in two steps:

(1) The first step is for the first Gnignard to attack the carbonyl carbon. The double bond between the carbon and the oxygen break, giving the oxygen a negative charge. When the lone pair comes down to reform the double bond, the OR’ group leaves to form the alkoxide ion.  
(2) The second step is virtually identical to the first step. The difference is that the lone pair on the oxygen does not come back down to form the double bond because there is no good leaving group. In this case, in order to furnish the alcohol, which is now a tertiary alcohol, is made by an acid workup. This gives the tertiary or in that one specific case, the secondary alcohol. 

5. Esters can be reduced to give alcohols or aldehydes: Esters can be reduced to give alcohols and aldehydes. The reducing agent that is used is often LiAlH4. However, in this case, only 0.5 equivalent is required instead of 1 equivalent. If an aldehyde is desired, a milder reducing agent is required such as bis(2-methylpropyl)aluminum hydride. 

==Relation to Biochemistry==
Esters bonds are found in naturally occurring fats and lipids as the fatty acid ester bonds to glycerol.  As mentioned earlier esters are found in naturally occurring aromas and flavors.  Phosphodiester bonds form the backbone of DNA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== O-GlcNAc ==

[[File:O-GlcNAc2.pdf|right|thumb|O-GlcNAc.]]

β-linked N-acetylglucosamine is also known as O-GlcNAc.   It is an intercellular cabohydrate that dynamiclly modifies proteins in the nucleous and cytoplasm on the Serine and Threonine residues (Hart).  The regulation of O-GlcNAc is dependent on only two enzymes OGT and O-GlcNacase (Hart). 
The difference between O-GlcNAc and many forms of protein glycosylation are:
a.O-GlcNAcylation occurs only in the cytoplasm and nuclease
b.It is not an elongated structure
c.It is attached and removed several times in the life of a (Hart.
It was discovered in 1983 (Hart). It is present all muticellular organisms,but not in yeast, for example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hart).

== O-GlcNAcylation ==

[[File:O-GlcNAc1.pdf|right|thumb|O-GlcNAc.]]

O-GlcNAcylation shares more similarities to phosphoylation than other forms of protein phosphorylation. The interplay between O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate is fact, that protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c).  The enzyme that removes O-phosphate also regulates OGT.  This suggests that the enzyme can remove the phosphate group and attach the O-GlcNAc.

== O-GlcNAc Transferase ==
The catalyst that attaches O-GlcNAc from the UDP-GlcNAc substrate to either a Serine or Theronine residue forming a β-glycosidic linkage is the O-GlcNAc  tranferase(OGT) (Hart).
Mammals seem to have only one gene that catalysis the OGT.  There is a dependent relationship between OGT and viability of the embryonic stem cells. In the absence O-GlcNacylation in the mammalian cells is lethal (Hart).
The complex regularion of OGT has not been clearly defined.  But, it has been discovred that OGT is O-GlcNAcylated and phosphorylated (Hart).

== O-GlcNAcase ==

Nucleocytoplasmic β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase) is the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc from a protein (Hart).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The fusion of two cells results in the coming together of the membranes of the two cells at one location which allows for the exchange of material. It is one of the most common ways for materials to enter or exit a cell and the process eventually leads to one continuous membrane surrounding the contents of the two cells. The membrane of the cells are made up of a double layer of phospholipids which interact and creates a connection between two cells. The fusion of the two cell membranes can be seen through the technique of x-ray diffraction. The technique of x-Ray diffraction confirms the theory that the cells form an hourglass shaped structure called a &quot;stalk&quot; during fusion. This stalk eventually grows to connect the two membranes and the two membranes eventually merge into one large one. The fusion of two membranes is catalyzed by [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]]. These [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] act by recognizing other cells that have the potential to be fused and can also initiate the process by pulling the membranes close together to eliminate [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipid]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Water|water]] interactions.

For membrane fusion to occur, the process must be thermodynamically favorable, that is, the free energy of the complex before remodeling must be lower than that of the complex afterwards. It is said that the process must be energetically &quot;downhill&quot;  in order for the process to be feasible. The intermediate structures must also be low enough to overcome thermal fluctuations in a reasonable amount of time. The driving force of the reaction is the relaxation of elastic energy.

The amount of energy required for membrane fusion to occur is roughly 40kBT which is about the same amount of energy to hydrolyze a few ATP molecules.

==Exocytotic Membrane Fusion==
This is the process in which a cell's internal organelles fuse with the cytoplasmic side of the cellular membrane. It is an important process for the release of hormones and neurotransmitters as well as other biological compounds. This fusion process typically occurs in three steps. Step 1 consists of the internal cellular component that is to be released migrating towards the exterior of the cellular membrane. Step 2 is the merging of the membranes, and step 3 consists of the merging of the interior components such as molecules within a vesicle. The overall process is effected by different factors. An important factor that determines the ability of exocytotic membrane fusion is [[Structural Biochemistry/pH|pH]]. Another factor is the hydrolysis of ATP as the fusion itself requires energy. Other factors include: transmembrane electrical potential, Osmotic forces, Proteinases, and Calmodulin.

==Membrane Fusion Mechanics==
Membrane fusion begins with the local merger of two separate cellular monolayer membranes, while the remote monolayer membranes remain separate. This initial connection between the two cellular membranes is call a fusion stalk and represents the first stage in the process of membrane fusion between two separate cellular membranes, called hemifusion. Stalk evolution eventually lead to the fusion of the remote monolayer of the two cellular membranes. The outcome of this merger is a fusion pore that connects the volumes of the previously separated cellular membranes. The fusion pore has the ability to expand or contract depending on the biological conditions.
Stalk formation in the membrane fusion requires the temporary disruption of the two cellular membranes, which is unfavorable and opposed by the hydrophobic forces working to maintain a continuous lipid assembly on the cellular membrane. One theory that solves this contradiction is the involvement of one lipid molecule in the cellular membrane building a bridge between the two separate cellular membranes. In the pre-stalk fusion intermediate, one lipid molecule splays its two hydrocarbon chains into the opposing membrane and begins building a developing lipid bridge between the two separate cellular membranes. This chain-splay mechanism to counteract the hydrophobic conditions of the cellular membrane has been demonstrated countless times with simulations under conditions of partially dehydration of the membrane contact. This shows that the process of membrane fusion is ran by the strong lipid bridge force pushing between the two separate cellular membranes together.
As a result of fusion, the overall curvature of the merged membrane can partially relax the bending and is reduced opposed to the former two cellular membranes. Physical forces driving unbent membranes favor membrane fusion due to the self-connectivity of two cellular membranes opposed to one small and strongly bent cellular membrane. The lipids of the merged cellular membrane can redistribute over the increased membrane area instead of being limited in one compacted cellular membrane.

==Membrane Elastic Energy==
In membrane remodeling there are three different energies that play a major role: membrane bending, membrane stretching, and tilting of the lipid hydrocarbon chain. 
Membrane bending energy is dependent on the curvature of the membrane surface. The free energy at any point on the membrane surface can be different due to the variations of lipids and protein compositions. Membrane fusion decreases the free energy of membrane bending.
The second type of elastic energy is membrane stretching. This type of energy originates from the lateral tension from the membrane stretch that can drive the expansion of the fusion pore.
The last type can be considered as the tilting of the hydrocarbon chain of the lipid molecules between the two cellular membranes during fusion.

==SNARE complex==
[[File:Vesicle fusion.png|600px]]

This is a complex made of proteins that is involved in membrane fusion. The proteins involved are called SNARE proteins which act to regulate vesicle fusion. SNARE stands for soluble N- ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor.The SNARE complex consists of proteins that forms a four-helix bundle. They are often located on the plasma membrane and help to draw certain membranes together to initiate the fusion process. These proteins are found in all eukaryotic cells and help determine the compartment in which the vesicle will fuse. There are two kinds of SNARE proteins. The first one is the v-SNARE where the &quot;v&quot; stands for vesicle. The second one is the t-SNARE where the &quot;t&quot; stands for target. The v-SNARE which is part of the transport vesicle is an integral protein and will bind to a t-SNARE on the target membrane which will result in fusion of the target membrane to the transport vesicle.
The SNARE complex plays a vital role in neurotransmission. For neurotransmission to occur, there needs to be fusion of the presynaptic plasma membrane with vesicles containing the neurotransmitter molecules. SNARE proteins must meet certain conditions in order to be active in cell fusion. The first condition is that the SNARE proteins must be located on two different membranes. Second, these membranes must be able to reach each other. Third, heavy and light chains must get together on the membrane and form t-SNAREs. Fourth, the SNAREs must be able to link the two membranes. Fifth, the anchors and linkers must be functional. Lastly, the membranes surfaces msut be compatible for fusion.

SNARE proteins can be assigned to three protein families. The families are the syntaxins, the VAMPs, and the SNAP-25 family. One of the distinguishing features that all SNARE proteins have is their coiled-coil domains. The SNARE complex itself is formed from a coil of syntaxin, a coil of VAMP, and two coils of SNAP-25. The overall mechanism of the membrane fusion is that a vesicle will land on on a membrane with the help of Rab proteins and bring the SNARE proteins closer to each other. The SNARE core complex then brings the two membranes together and creates tension within the two membranes. When the membranes get closer and closer, hemifusion can occur then a fusion pore opening and expansion allowing for membrane fusion. The SNARE proteins basically provide the driving force as well as stabilizes the transition states of the process.

[[File:SNAREcomplex.jpg]]

One of the many important uses of membrane fusion and the SNARE complex is within the bodies nervous system. It is important for chemical synaptic transmission where neurotransmitters bound by pre-synaptic vesicles are eventually released be a calcium dependent mechanism into the synaptic cleft after membrane fusion occurs. Before fusion is able to occur, the vesicle is transported to the specific target membrane. A &quot;fusion trigger&quot; such as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; directs fusion for completion after the vesicle has gone through priming. In order for this fusion to occur, the SNARE complex is important in overcoming repulsive ionic forces as well as getting rid of hydration between the membranes lipid bilayers. In recent years the SNARE proteins have been reclassified as R-SNAREs and Q-SNARES instead of the v and t SNAREs. R-SNAREs are argining containing while Q-SNAREs are glutamine containing.

==Hydrophobic insertion (wedging) mechanism==

One mechanism of membrane fusion is the Hydrophobic insertion (wedging) mechanism. Proteins are intermediates to the process of membrane fusion and certain proteins can induce membrane fusion which in turn causes elastic stress. Examples of proteins that can drive this process are lipid-modifying enzymes, flippases and rigid protein scaffolding. The core essence of this mechanism lies in the insertion of hydrophobic or amphiphatic regions into the shallow membrane causes the expansion of the polar head region which induces protein curvature. Proteins that are capable of this include epsins, small G-proteins, and N-bar domains and proteins capable of inserting small hydrophobic loops. Further research deals with finding which structurally related proteins can drive membrane remodeling.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Comparative Genomics'''==

Nowadays, there is a vast numbers of genomes were sequenced. It is stunning how similar the genome of other species to human. For example, Drosophila (fruit fly) has more than half of the genes have human counterparts, even though the species does not look “human” at all. The result is even more stunning when scientists compared human’s genes with mammals. 

Information about different genomes requires sciences to have a new field: comparative genomics. Comparative genomics studies the relationship between genomes of different species and tries to discover more genomes. Moreover, this field also attempts to answer many evolutionary questions. Recently, the draft sequence of chimp, out closest living relative, has been completed. By comparing the genome of chimp and human, scientists may have the answer of how we evolve from chimp in a biological aspect.

'''Example:''' Fruit fly - genome

[[Image:Genoma_Drosophila_melanogaster.png]]

==Processes of Comparing Genomes==

Comparative genomics works by aligning sequences [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Bioinformatics/Sequences_Alignments] of different organisms to identify patterns that operate over both large and small distances. Aligning mouse chromosomes with human chromosomes, for example, shows that 99% of our protein-coding genes align with homologous sequences in mice. Underlying such analyses is the principle that DNA sequences that are highly conserved are likely to be functionally important. A common assumption is that adding more comparative genomes to the alignment helps distinguish functionally significant from irrelevant conserved sequences.

If a desired genome is unsequenced, it would take a long time to completely sequence species’ genome from beginning, and then compare it to others. However, science can make use of its relative species to finish this task quicker and easier. In order to compare unsequenced genomes, genome science uses shared synteny, a conserved arrangements of DNA on chromosomes of related species. Take a look at wheat for an examples, wheat has even more genomes than human; therefore, sequencing it would be too abundance.

==Benefits of Comparitive Bioinformatics==
1. Helps our understanding of the genetic basis of diseases in both animals and humans. &lt;br&gt;
2. Increases our basic knowledge of the evolutionary pathways of related species. &lt;br&gt;
3. Help find new medical treatments and other means of benefiting human health. &lt;br&gt;
4. To determine the function of human genes → for example, researchers can look for genes in humans in other animals whose functions are known. If scientists have identified a particular gene in another animal and know what it does, a gene in a human with a similar sequence probably has a similar function as that in the animal. This is called &quot;annotating&quot; - defined as creating a set of comments, notations, and references describing the experimental and inferred information about a gene or protein. 

==Examples==

1. Chloroplast genome and mitochondrial genome -- Chloroplast and mitochondria also contains a significant amount of genetic information for a cell. Therefore, it should also be considered in the studies of genomics. Chloroplast is the organelle in plant that functions in photosynthesis. However, it also possesses its own genome, and thus can be independent of the cell in replication. Compared with the DNA in the nucleus, DNA in chloroplast does not evolve or evolves extremely slowly. Moreover, this DNA also cannot be modified or mutated over generation since recombination does not happen. As a result, scientists can easily provide the detail about evolution. It was found that genetic exchange had occurred between the chloroplast and nucleus. Some of the proteins are also encoded from the chloroplast genome. Similar to chloroplast genome, mitochondrial genome does not change significantly overtime. Mitochondrion in a cell is made by both its nucleus and mitochondria DNA. This shows the interaction between the two genomes, the nucleus’ and the mitochondria’s. &lt;br&gt;
2. Fruit flies  -- Although fruit flies have a genome that is 25 times smaller than the human genome, many of the flies' genes are similar to those in humans and control the same biological functions. Research on fruit flies  has led to discoveries on the influence of genes on diseases, animal development, population genetics, cell biology, neurobiology, behavior, physiology and evolution. &lt;br&gt;
They are also used for Parkinson's research. Researchers have found that two-thirds of human genes known to be involved in cancer have counterparts in the fruit fly. When scientists put a human gene associated with arkinson's disease into fruit flies, they displayed symptoms that humans have. This might mean that they could serve as a new model for finding a cure for Parkinson's. 

DNA as an ID tool if do not know what type of organism it is. Take what species DNA that one would like to sequence and then first look on Genbank- which is the public bank of DNA to see if it has sequences before and since that is public knowledge. It is also somewhat of a Taxonomy browser. If for example seahorses are to be sequenced to see if a certain species at an aquarium is a certain one, the sequences that are available are the Cytochrom B sequence. Just need to sequence the DNA at the cytochrome area of the genome. In order to do this, must amplify that region- the purpose is in order to make millions of copies of that region. Take the primers that will complement that region and the people who have already sequenced that region will already have specified primers that can be used to determine the sequence with. All sorts of primers may be used even ones that have recently died just ones without any smell. Take the DNA that was sequenced and then compare with the DNA from the bank. Input what was sequenced and ask the search engine for the best match. The results will show species that have the highest similarity to the one that was sequence and give the best match.

'''Comparison of human genome with other species':'''

&lt;u&gt;1. Human vs. Pufferfish:&lt;/u&gt;
	Pufferfish was the first vertebrate that has its sequence compared with human. The latest shared ancestor of humans and pufferfish was 450 million years ago. However, their genomes still have many some similarities. Only about ¼ of human genes have no counterparts in pufferfish. However, 97% human DNA is repetitive while the number is only about 17% in pufferfish. 

&lt;u&gt;2. Human vs. Mouse:&lt;/u&gt; 
	This is the first genome comparison made between two mammals. The similarity is much more significant. Both humans and mouse have about 25000 genes; and surprisingly, they share 99% genome. Human and mouse have the same ancestor about 75 millions years ago, much shorter compared with human-pufferfish ancestor. However, it was found that mouse DNA mutated two times faster than human’s DNA. That created 300 genes unique (only 1%) to both organism; and human genome has 400 million more nucleotides than mouse’s. 

&lt;u&gt;3. Human vs. Chimpanzee:&lt;/u&gt;
	Chimpanzee is one of the closest relative to human. We shared a common ancestor only about 35 millions years ago. In 2005, the genome of chimpanzee was completely sequenced and compared with humans’ genome. Only 1.06% difference in substitution and 1.5% difference in insertion and deletion were detected. Those insertion and deletion may provide us distinct characteristics from chimps, including lack of body hair and larger cranium.  

&lt;u&gt;4. Human vs. Plants:&lt;/u&gt;
	Estimated 1/3 of the genes in plants are not found in mammals. Those genes encoded plants’ distinguished characteristics such as photosynthesis and photosynthetic anatomy. The other 2/3 is very similar to human and animal genome. The similar genes encoded for basic metabolism, genome replication and repair, RNA transcription and protein synthesis.

      <comment>/* Types of Transposons */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Transposons, also known as jumping genes, are segments of DNA in a single cell that can move in the genome. The process of transposon movement is called transposition. The effects of transposition are mutations and the lengthening or shortening of the genome. Transposons were once called junk DNA because they were seemingly useless. However, research has shown that these mobile segments of DNA are significant in the development of organisms.

==Types of Transposons==

Transposable elements longer and more complex than insertion sequence, called transposons,also move about in the bacterial genome. In addition to the DNA required for transposition, transposons include extra genes that go along for the ride, such as genes for antibiotic resistance. In some bacterial transposons, the extra genes are sandwiched between two insertion sequence. It is as though two insertion sequence happened to land relatively close together in the genome and now travel together, along with all the DNA between them, as a single transposable element. other bacterial transposons do not contain insertion sequences; these have different inverted repeats at their ends.

Transposons are not unique to bacteria and are important components of eukaryotic genomes as well.


===Class I===
Retrotransposons (Class I transposons) move to different areas of the genome through:

1. Transcribing to RNA

2. Reverse transcribing to DNA (via reverse transcriptase)

3. Inserting into a different area of the genome

Retrotransposons are prevalent in plants: the genome of maize and the genome wheat are composed of roughly 50-80% and 70% retrotransposon respectively. Roughly 40% of the human genome is composed of retrotransposons. The mechanism by which retrotransposons work is similar to that of retroviruses, suggesting that there is a relationship between the two.


The three subtypes of Class I transposons are:

1. Viral: encodes the reverse transcriptase enzyme which is used to reverse transcribe to DNA (step 2 of transposition) Behaves most like retroviruses in that it is characteristic of having long terminal repeats (LTRs).

2. Nonviral: does not encode the reverse transcriptase. Use RNA polymerase III

3. long interspersed elements (LINEs): encodes the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Uses RNA polymerase II


LTRs: Observed in retroviruses, long terminal repeats are segments of DNA that repeat from one hundred to a thousand times.

LINEs: Segment of DNA which codes for reverse transcriptase and also may code for an endonuclease.

===Class II===
DNA transposons (Class II transposons) can move to different areas of the genome through two mechanisms:

'''Mechanism 1''': Transposase enzymes can bind to either a specific site of DNA or anywhere. Transposase cuts the DNA at the site it binds to and produces &quot;sticky ends&quot; and also cuts the transposon and ligates it to the specific site. Then DNA polymerase and DNA ligase run through the site to effectively enclose the transposon to the designated area.

DNA transposons that move through the genome via Mechanism 1 can be duplicated during the cell cycle.

'''Mechanism 2''': The second mechanism by which Class I transposons move through the genome is called replicative transposition. In replicative transposition, the DNA transposon replicates itself into a new area of the genome.


DNA transposons are prone to eventually losing the ability to produce the necessary enzymes transposase or reverse transcriptase. However, other types of transposons will produce these enzymes, prolonging the ability of DNA transposons to move through the genome.

Transposons Are Mutagens

When transposons insert into the genome, they may potentially insert into a region encoding for a gene. This causes mutation because the gene will be inhibited. Insertion into introns, exons, and DNA sequences adjacent to the gene encoding region may also cause dysfunction of the gene. In addition to mutation due to insertion, mutation may occur if a sequence is copied several times such that it interferes in cell mitosis and meiosis. The irreparable gap produced when the transposon is removed may cause mutation as well.

Diseases resulting from mutations of this sort include Hemophilia, porphyria, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Transposition may also result in cancer.

'''''Fabes con almejas''''', sometimes called ''habas con almejas'', ([[w:Spanish language|Spanish]] for beans with clams) is a [[w:clam|clam]] and [[w:bean|bean]] [[w:stew|stew]] that originated in the principality of [[w:Asturias|Asturias]] in [[w:Spain|Spain]] in the 1800s as [[w:peasant|peasant]] fare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theheartofnewengland.com/food/shellfish/spanish-beans-clams.html ''Fabes con almejas'' recipe from the Heart of New England]&lt;/ref&gt; It's a lighter variation of Asturian [[w:Fabada Asturiana|''fabada'']] whose primary ingredients are [[w:sausage|sausage]], beans and [[w:pork|pork]].

The traditional recipe for ''fabes con almejas'' calls for small clams, fava beans, onions, garlic, salt, saffron, bay leaves, olive oil, parsley, bread crumbs and sometimes sweet paprika.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spain.info/NO/TourSpain/Gastronomia/Productos%20y%20Recetas/Recetas/C/0/Fabes%20con%20almejas ''Fabes con Almejas'' recipe from Spain Info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/lokebuskes/cocina.htm ''Habas con almejas'' recipe from ''Lo Ke Busques'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A small serving works well as an appetizer and a large serving is a satisfying main course.

==Cooking with clams==
This recipe calls for live clams. Here are some safety guidelines for buying, eating and cooking them:

*Never buy a clam that's open or cracked.
*Never eat a clam that won't open after cooking.
*Cook clams within 24 hours of purchasing.
*Always brush clams clean before cooking.

For more on this subject have a look at [http://www.foodreference.com/html/clamshappy.html ''Happy as a clam'']
by Chef Mark R. Vogel

==Ingredients==
*1 pound (450 g) dried [[w:Vicia faba|fava beans]] (or any large, white bean), soaked overnight or boiled as below
*24 live [[w:clams|littleneck or mahogany clams]]
*3 cloves [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
*2 [[w:bay leaf|bay leaves]]
*3 tablespoons [[w:olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]
*one half [[cookbook:onion|onion]] (about four ounces)
*generous pinch of [[w:saffron|saffron]] or yellow food coloring for rice
*1 tablespoon [[w:paprika|sweet paprika]] (not smoked)
*¼ cup chopped [[w:parsley|parsley]]
*A large loaf of crusty bread
*sea salt or [[w:kosher salt|kosher salt]], as needed

==Preparation==
#Rinse and soak the beans overnight.
#Scrub the clams clean and rinse.
#Drain the beans and place them in a skillet with the onion, garlic, two pinches of parsley, two bay leaves and the olive oil. 
#Add just enough water to cover the ingredients and cook over a high flame.
#Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Skim off any foam. Cook them, loosely covered, until done. This should take about 90 minutes. Check the skillet occasionally to add water. Never allow the water to drop below the height of the ingredients.
#When the beans are almost done, place the clams in a separate skillet and add about an inch of water. Cover the skillet and cook over a medium flame, shaking the pan occasionally to help the clams open. Check the clams every minute. Remove them as they open and place them in a separate bowl. This should take no more than 10 minutes. Once you've removed all the clams you'll have clam broth in the skillet. '''SAVE THE BROTH'''. You'll need it for the next step.
#Check the broth for bits of dirt and clam shell. If there's a lot, you'll have to strain it through a cloth to remove the grit.
#Add the broth to the simmering beans along with the saffron (or food coloring), the remaining parsley, paprika and salt to taste.
#Cover and cook for five to ten minutes.
#Ladle the beans and broth into separate bowls and add six clams to each bowl.
#Serve with a crusty bread on the side.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Transgenic animal''' are animals that have had foreign genes from another animal introduced into their genome. A foreign gene (such as a hormone or blood protein) is cloned and injected into the nuclei of another animal’s in vitro fertilized egg. Cells are then able to integrate with the transgene, and the foreign gene is expressed, upon which the developing embryo is surgically implanted in a surrogate mother. The result of this process, if the embryo develops, is a transgenic animal housing a particular gene from another species.


Applications of transgenic technology are for example, improving upon livestock, such as higher quality wool in sheep, or increasing the amount of muscle mass of an animal so that it can produce more meat for consumption. Conversely, transgenic animals can also be utilized for medical purposes such as producing human proteins by inserting a desired transgene into the genome of an animal in a manner that causes the target protein to be expressed in the milk of the trangenic animal.

Another example is one that involved mice. Normal mice have the capability to not be infected by the polio virus. They do not have the cell surface molecule that is required as a receptor for polio, unlike humans, who do have this receptor. However, the polio receptor gene can be injected into a mouse, thus developing a transgenic mouse. This allows the mouse to now be successfully infected by the polio virus, and display the similar symptoms that are displayed in humans who are affected by the polio virus.

The most common studies that are currently going on with transgenic animals involve animals, such as the rhesus macaques. These animals contain the human gene of the Huntington’s disease. This allows scientists to research options that can provide a cure to Huntington’s or at least a better treatment option. Other animals, such as mice or those that contain human stem cells, are used to create medicine and treatment options for diabetes, strokes, and blindness.

The human genome project has also been of great help in the role of transgenic animals. With the newfound discovery of the DNA sequence of the human genome, scientists can now study the genes that are involved as drug targets, which can help provide them with the ability to mark the appropriate gene that can aid in providing the cure to any certain disease that they are studying.

The expression of a transgene can also be engineered to take place in plants, such as obtaining the bio-luminescent gene that gives fireflies their glow in the dark ability, and introducing it to a plant. 

==Transgenic Animals Countless Benefits to Humanity==
Three of the most widely-used reasons for producing transgenic animals for the benefit of human welfare are agriculture, medical and industrial. 

===Agricultural Applications===

Farmers have always wanted to have the best breed for any type of animal and to have the best traits that it can possible have. The normal way of breeding animals can potentially take up a lot of time and is not entirely efficient. With new advances in technology, selected characteristics can be developed in species with a lot less time and more accuracy.

Not only are animals produced more efficiently, the quality of the animals are enhanced as well. Some examples include having cows create milk with lessened milk content and sheep that produced a lot more wool.

Also, with these new qualities in animals they must be protected. Scientists are researching on creating animals that are resistant to particular diseases and to enhance the two reasons stated above. 

===Medical Applications===
Animals that have their genes modified to show disease symptoms, may be studied and cure could possibly be contrived in the near future.At Harvard, scientists created a transgenic mouse also known as OncoMouse® or also known as the Harvard mouse which allows it to carry genes that can enhance the development of a variety of cancers that are found in humans. 

Xenotransplantation will play a major role in the medical industry in the future. It is the transplantation of living cells, tissues or organs from one species to another. Due to worldwide shortages of organs, advances in gene manipulation of animals can alter their organs to become susceptible to humans. For example, Transgenic pigs may play a major role in the transplant of organs to humans. Because Pig and human organs are closely related, there is a possibility to use pig organs for transplants. However currently, a pig protein inhibits the human body’s immune system acceptance of the organs. If animals such as Pigs can have its protein successfully supplanted by a human protein can be used to meet a major need- transplant organs such as the hearts, liver, or kidneys. It can also be applied to bringing about refined drugs in the pharmacy industry and nutritional supplements. An example is insulin and anti-clotting factors of blood can soon be extracted from milk of transgenic animals such as goats, sheep, cows. This milk being the source of importance is undergoing major research to create a type that will be able to treat diseases such as phenylketonuria or cystic fibrosis.
[[Image:tansgene.jpg|500px|thumbnail| Human Gene Therapy, [http://stemcells.nih.gov/StaticResources/info/scireport/images/4_3.jpg]]]
Human gene therapy is another medical application that is gaining wide acclaim. In essence, it is the transfer of genetic information into patient tissues and organs. As a result, diseased defective copies of genes can be eliminated or their normal functions rescued. Moreover, the procedure can provide new functions to cells. For Example, to combat cancer and other diseases, the insertion of a gene that causes the production of immune system mediator proteins can be introduced. By this therapy, countless genetic disease could have potential cures further down the road.
There are two paths to Gene therapy. The first path is direct transfer of genes into the patient. The second path is the use of living cells as vehicles to transport the genes of interest. These two paths both have certain advantages and disadvantages.
Direct gene transfer is the most simplistic way of administering the gene of choice. There are two methods to direct gene transfer. The first method is the process in which genes are delivered via liposomes or other biological microparticles into patient’s tissue or bloodstream. The second method of the introduction of genes is using genetically-engineered viruses, such as retroviruses or adenoviruses. However, due to biological safety concerns, viruses must first be altered so they are not infections before introduction. However, due to the simplicity of the direct gene transfer method, there are major weaknesses. For example, it does not allow for the control of where the therapeutic gene will insert. The transferred gene will either randomly insert itself into the patient’s chromosomes or remain unintegrated in the targeted tissue. Moreover, the target tissue may not be easily accessible for direct gene application of the therapeutic gene.
The second method of gene therapy is the use of living cells to deliver the therapeutic gene. This method is very complex compared to the direct gene transfer method. There are three major steps to this method. The first step is cells from the patient are isolated and propagated in vitro. The second step is the introduction of the therapeutic gene into these cells using methods similar to the direct gene transfer. The last step is the genetically modified cells are returned to the patient. The advantage of using gene transfer vehicles is, in the laboratory cells can be manipulated more accurately and precisely than in the body. In addition, some of these cells are able to continually propagate under laboratory conditions before reintroduction into the patient. Moreover, some of these cells types have the ability to localize to particular regions of the human body, for example, hematopoietic (blood-forming) stem cells can return to the bone marrow upon reintroduction in to the body. This action can be very useful for applying the therapeutic gene which has regional specificity. However, a major disadvantage is the biological complexity of the living cell’s environment. The isolation of a specific type of cell requires not only extensive information of its biological markers, but also knowledge of the requirements for that cell type to stay alive in vitro and continue to divide. Unfortunately, there are many cells types with unknown information to their specific biological markers. Moreover, many normal human cells cannot be sustained in the lab for long periods of time without amassing deleterious mutations.

===Industrial Applications===
Animals that have transgenes have been produced to for testing on chemical safety as these animals are sensitive to toxic things. Also, these transgenic animals may produce something that can be utilized in biochemical reactions. Microorganisms have been structured to be able to produce enzymes that can make major reactions speed up.

==Production of Transgenic Animals==
The production of transgenic animals is taking the genome, the genetic makeup of the organism and introducing foreign genes into that organism.  These insertions of genes are known as transgenes. Most importantly, these foreign genes must be transmitted through the germ line of the organisms. As a result, every cell, including the germ cells, whose function is to transmit genes to the organism’s offspring, contains the same change in genetic material.The predominant method of creating these transgenic animals is the use of DNA Microinjection. However, producing these type of transgenic animals is hardly deemed a success as DNA insertion is arbitrary and success rate very low. The offspring is what's studied for this new transgenic gene. But the ability to produce these type of offspring that is successfully carrying the gene is extremely difficult.

Scientists may produce transgenic animals is three main ways: DNA microinjection, retrovirus-mediated gene transfer and embryonic stem cell mediated gene transfer.

[[Image:DNA Microinjection.jpg|300px|thumbnail| Transfer of desired gene into mouse via microinjection, [http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/38_3/38_3Richardsonfig1.jpg]]]

===DNA microinjection===
====Technique summary====
The first animals to be experimented with DNA microinjection was the mouse. DNA Microinjection is the transfer of a desired gene into the pronucleus of the reproductive cell. This cell is first cultured in vitro. Then reaching to a specific stage or threshold of the embryonic phase, it is then transmitted into the recipient female.

====Technical Explanation====
[[Image:Retroviruss.jpg|250px|thumbnail| Retrovirus mediated Gene transfer, [http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/38_1/38_1Gordonfig2.jpg]]]

The pipets for this technique must be created especially from glass that are extremely thing and a pipet puller as well as a micro-forge. It must be absolutely flat at the tip or there will be impedance when injecting into the embryo. The specification of the DNA injection pipet should have an internal diameter of about 1&amp;nbsp;µm or even less. When  performing this technique gloves that are covered with talc should be avoided as the power has the potential to clog the pipets and could lead to the failure of the embryos. The embryo that is working with should be put in very low magnification. Using the pipet, with ease suction the embryo into the end and let it stay there. The tip of the pipet is brought to exactly where the pronucleus is and then it is punctured through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm area. It is often hard to see if the pipet tip has gone through into the pronuclear membrane. The only safe bet in judging if it was transferred successfully is to glance at the  pronucleus to see if it swells up and its size in volume amounts to around 1pl. After injection it is then moved to the far end of the dish so that the next one may be done as well. When a bundle of embryos are complete, it is left for incubation and then evaluation for a duration of time. The embryos that are viable will then be transmitted to a female's oviduct and then utilized. 

===Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer===
Retroviruses are used as vectors to transfer genetic material in the form of RNA rather than DNA. It is the transfer of genetic material into the host cell, resulting in a chimera, a organism that has various genes aside from its own. These chimeras are inbred for as many as twenty generation until homozygous offspring are formed, carrying two copies of the same transgene in all of its cells. 
This has been proven successful in 1974, when a virus was used as a vector into embryos of mice. They showed the desired transgene.
[[Image:Embryonic stem cell mediated gene transfer.jpg|250px|thumbnail| Embryonic stem cell mediated gene transfer, [http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/38_1/38_1Gordonfig3.jpg]]]

===Embryonic stem cell mediated gene transfer===
The technique involves isolation of the totipotent stem cells from embryos(stemcells that can develop into any type of specialized cell). The desired gene is inserted/transfer into the stem cell. These stem cells containing the desired DNA of interest are now incorporated into the host's embryo. Thus resulting in a chimeric animal. A major benefit of this technique is that it may test the transgenes on the molecular level, which essentially saves ample time and using this technique one would not have to wait for living offspring.

==Stem Cells (in Further Detail)==

&lt;u&gt;'''What exactly are stem cells?'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

Stems cells are now a hot topic for research because of their seemingly endless potential. They are cells that may develop into numerous different categories of cells in the body during the beginning stages of life and also during the growth stage. Stems cells can also be utilized as an internal repair system, basically dividing incessantly to restock the cells under damage and repair until it reaches back to equilibrium and for the duration of the organism's life span. As stem cells divide, each has the opportunity to choose between sticking as a stem cell or become more specific- one with a specialized function, examples including liver cell, a white blood cell, brain cell, etc. 

''How are stem cells set apart from other types of cell? &lt;br&gt;''
There are two primary properties that are used to do this. The first aspect is that stem cells are initially unspecialized cells and may regenerate through cell division, and even at times after prolong periods of time without activity. Another aspect is that under right, specific physiological conditions can be promoted to turn into either tissue or certain cells of organs and with distinctive abilities. Examples of when stem cells are maximized for their repair function are in organs, bone marrow, gut marrow, where they constantly divide to restore injured cells or ones that have been heavily used. 

In the past, researchers mainly worked with two categories of stem cells which were from both humans and animals. The two that were worked on were embryonic stem cells and somatic stem cells, which can also be called adult stem cells. The first embryo cells came from mouse as described above, which occurred around 1981. The human embryonic stem cells were made for reproduction and was made possible through the intense research done with the mouse embryos. Recently, there has been a third category of stem cells known as induced pluripotent stem cells(iPSCs). These cells are unique because they are cells of adults that can be reconditioned by gene modifications to be a stem cell. 

''Why are stem cells valuable for living organisms? &lt;br&gt;''
Typically in blastocysts, which are embryos of only 3–5 days aged, the cells on the inside will turn into the cells for all of the body of that living organism, even specialized cells and organs including the skin, heart, lung, reproductive cells-sperm and egg, and different tissues. Within the tissues of adults including bone marrow and muscle, these stem cells have the ability to replace the cells that are damaged, affected by disease, or simply just used. 

Research in the stem cell arena, has continued to add new insights to the development of organisms from cells and the repairing mechanism of affected cells. Stem cells may also be utilized to help select for new drugs to be brought to market and better understand not only cell developments but also the irregularities that induce defects in the infants of organisms. 

&lt;u&gt;'''Special characteristics of stem cells'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
Stem Cells are very unique and set apart from other cells of the body. All types of stem cells will have 3 defining characteristics- able to divide and replenish themselves for long duration of time, not specialized, able to be turned into numerous different types of cell types. For each of these properties, further depth analysis will be explained below. 

The first property discussed was stem cells ability to divide and replenish themselves for a long duration of time. Typically cells of muscle or nerve do not duplicate by themselves, but stem cells have the ability to do this and also done ample times. Stem cells replicated countless times in the laboratory times for months at a time may result in millions of cells. If the cells can go on for a long time and not be specialized just like the parents, these cells are able to perform self-renewal for the longterm. Two sources of profound interest  under study about this self-renewal for the longterm is how embryonic stem cells can replicate for an entire year in the laboratory and not differentiate but usually non-embryonic stem cells are not capable of this and which aspects of organisms are the ones that are source of regulation of stem cell replication and this self-renewal. 

Finding out how the regulation of stem cells is performed for stem cells normal development may assist in finding out the reasoning for cancer through irregular cell division. This could also lead to more efficient growth embryonic and non-embryonic stem cells performed in the laboratory setting. Having stem cells that continue to stay as unspecialized result from special conditions. These special conditions are set up from signals in the cells that induce the stem cells to replicated and stay as unspecialized. 

Stem cells are ones that are not specialized. Since they are not specialized, they are incapable of doing any specialized tasks that could occur in specific tissues or organs. As a result, stem cells cannot work collaboratively with other cells to perform organized tasks such as being a carrier of oxygen molecules throughout the body such as red blood cells. But what is unique about stem cells is their potential to be made into specialized cells such as nerve cells, brain cells, or muscle cells. 

Stem cells have the capability to be made into specialized cells. The progression of stem cells that are not specialized being turned into ones that are specialized is known as differentiation. The differentiation process have  multiple steps and the progression through these steps increases specialization. Many factors help to control this progression. Signals that both inside and outside of the cell help promote the stem cells through each stage. Outside signals include being in close,touching proximity of nearby cells, chemicals that are given off by other cells, and the presence of specific molecules in the immediate environment. Inside signals are managed by genes present on the DNA that tell it exactly what to do. Understanding the regulation of these stem cells can help to grow cells or even tissues to help in selecting for drugs and cell therapy, which is what makes stem cells so special and a primary source of research. 

'''&lt;u&gt; Different types of stem cells'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt; Embryonic stem cells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These type of cells come from embryos. A major portion of these types of cells come from eggs that are fertilized in vitro or in the laboratory  setting and then given to labs so that research may be done on them. The embryos from the human stem cells are usually about 4–5 days aged and are in the blastocysts form, which essentially is a hollow ball of cells. The blastocysts have a total of three structures including the trophoblast, embryoblast or pluriblast, and blastocoel. The trophoblast is a layer that surrounds the blastocoel. The hollow cavity of the blastocyst is the blastocoel and the embryoblast is  mass of cells that will turn into defined structures of the fetus.  

''How are embryonic stem cells identified? ''

While creating embryonic stem cells, there are various checkpoints to test if the cells have the right properties that allow it to be called embryonic stem cells. This is also known as characterization. There is not a universal test agreed to always be used to mark embryonic stem cells but there are various tests that can be used. The first one that can be used is to grow these stem cells for a number of months. This proves that the cell can do long-term growth and self-renewal. The cells are put under a microscope and observed to see that it is in good condition and still have not differentiated. A second test that is to determine transcription factors that are characteristic of cells that are not differentiated. Specific transcription factors to look for are Nanog and Oct4. Essentially what transcription factors do is aid in turning genes either off or on when needed, which is very integral in cell differentiaion and development of embryos. Nanog and Oct4 help to keep the stem cells to be undifferentiated. A third test is to use specific techniques to look for cell surface markers that undifferentiated stem cells will give off. A fourth test is to look at the chromosomes using a microscope and to diagnose if there is damage or if the quantity of chromosomes is different. A 5th test is to see if the cells can be grown again after putting it in the freezer and then allowing it to thaw. The last test which is the 6th one is to test if these human embryonic stem cells are pluripotent. This may be done by permitting the cells to instinctively differentiate in the laboratory, conducting the cells so that it will form a cell that consists of three germ layers, or injecting the cells into a mouse that has an impaired immune system to test for the development of teratoma, a tumor that is benign. The growth of the injected stem cells and its differentiation may be observed since the immune system of the mouse does not reject it. Encompassed in the tumor cells is a combination of differentiated or somewhat differentiated kind of cells, showing that embryonic stem cells have the ability to differentiate into other different types of cells. 

''How does differentiation of embryonic stem cells occur? &lt;br&gt;''
When embryonic stem cells are kept under the right conditions, they can be kept in the unspecialized state. When cells are permitted to aggregate and form what is called embryoid bodies, spontaneously differentiation occurs. These cells are able to form numerous different types of cells. This does show that this sample of embryonic stem cells is good condition, however this method is not efficient in creating certain cell types.

In order to generate cultures of specific types of differentiated cells such as blood cells or brain cells, is done by controlling the differentiation of these embryonic stem cells. Components to modify are the different chemicals the culture medium is made of, the surface of the culture dish, or even the cell themselves by giving them specific genes. After a long time of trial and error there have been some standard protocols established for this directed differentiation to certain cell types to occur. If this directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells is done successfully,  they can be used to treat certain diseases which include Parkinson's disease, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, heart disease, vision loss and traumatic spinal cord injury. 

&lt;u&gt; Adult stem cells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Adult stem cells are thought to be undifferentiated type of cells, located with differentiated cells either in a tissues or organs that can revitalize itself and may differentiate to give either some or all of the primary specialized types of cells of an organ or tissue. The main job of adult stem cells in organism are to sustain and restore the tissues where they are located. Unparalleled to embryonic stem cells that are named according to location in which they are found, the stock of some adult stem cells in some tissues that are already mature are still being researched. 

As more research is being conducted on adult stem cells, their presence is being found in many additional areas of tissue than ever before. This has opened up the possibility of these adult stem cells to be used as transplants. A widespread use of adult stem cells as transplants are for hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow, which is blood-forming. It is now evident that stem cells do exist in the heart and the brain. The control of differentiation of these stems cells if done correctly it may be feasible to use them for transplantation therapy treatments. 

Adult stem cells were first discovered in bone marrow, which contained two versions: hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow stromal stem cells, which were discovered second. The stromal cells were small in number but had the ability to make everything including fat, bone, cartilage, and fibrous connective tissue. 

''Location of adult stem cells and their role?&lt;br&gt;''
Adult stem cells are actually located in numerous different organs and tissues which include bone marrow, brain, blood vessels, skin, teeth, heart liver, epithelium part of ovarian, and testis. Within each tissue, stem cells live in a particular area. In a lot of tissues, some stem cells comprise the outside layer of small blood vessel known as pericytes. Stem cells usually do not divid for long durations of time until prompted to for normal maintenance of tissues, after injury, or by disease. 

Normally the number of stem cells in each tissue is small and once taken away from the body, their ability to divide becomes limited and duplicating large amounts of stem cells difficult. As a result, researchers are looking for improved ways to grow large quantities of adult stem cells in the laboratory so that specific ones may be created to target and treat diseases and injuries. Uses include to recreate bone from cells located in the bone marrow stroma, making cells that produce insulin to help treat diabetes of type1, and to rejuvenate heart muscles that were greatly impaired after a heart attack event. 

Identification of adult stem cells

There are many methods to identifying stem cells. Researchers typically use several methods to identify the adult stem cells. One way it occurs is to tag the cells that are in living tissue with molecular markers and then look to see the produced specialized cell types. Another useful method would be to take the cells from a living organism, tag them in the laboratory and reinsert them into another organism to observe whether or not the cells recreate cells at their original tissue location. 

One of the primary things that must be exhibited is that one adult stem cell will be able to produce an entire colony of genetically identical cells that can also create the correct differentiated cell types of that particular tissue. To produce these results experimentally and confirm that the cells are indeed adult stem cells is done through showing that it can create genetically identical cells or that the cells can remake the tissues after inserted into another animal or both of these. 

'' &lt;u&gt;Adult cell differentiation''&lt;/u&gt; 

[[Image:Stemcelldifferentiaion.jpg|550px|thumbnail|Differentiation of Both Hematopoietic and stromal stem cells, photo by Terese Winslow, [http://stemcells.nih.gov/StaticResources/images/figure2_lg.jpgg]]]

&lt;br&gt; '' Normal differentiation'' &lt;br&gt;
Adult stem cells are free to divide when called and can produce mature cells that have the same shapes, structure, role of that tissue in which it resides. Examples of this will follow. Hematopoietic stem cells will produce any type of blood cells including the b lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, basophils, monocytes, red blood cells, etc. Mesenchymal stem cells actually produce a whole variety of cell types including bone cells, fat cells, cartilage cells, etc. Neural stem cells of the brain may produce neuron, astroyctyes, and oligodendrocytes. In the lining of digestive tract reside epithelial stem cells and they produce cells including goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, absorptive cells, etc. The stem cells of the skin reside in the basal layer of the epidermis and produces keratinocytes, that provide the security layer. 

''Transdifferentiation'' &lt;br&gt;
Particular adult stem cells can differentiate into other types of cells of other organs or tissues than it's predicted type, such as heart muscle cells differentiating into brain cells. This type of differentiation is better known as transdifferentiation. This occurrence in human beings is still not fully proven. Some possible explanations for this type of differentiation being observed could be the junction of this donor cell with the recipient. Another explanation could be that these injected stem cells give off factors that promote that other organism's own stem cells to initiate the repair mechanisms. When transdifferentiation has been observed, it is only seen in small instances. 

Scientists have proved that some adult cells can be remade into different cell types in the laboratory using precise gene alterations. This can prove to be a way to remake cells into the other ones that have been injured or eliminated because of diseases. In diabetes, the cells that produce insulin or beta pancreatic cells can be recreated by reprogramming other cells in the pancreas. These recreated cells were very close i appearance and shape to the actual beta pancreatic cells. These reprogrammed cells when put into mice did improve the regulation of the sugar levels in the blood even though the mice had nonworking pancreatic beta cells. 

Adult somatic cells can be reprogrammed to mimic embryonic stem cells through the presence of genes of embryos, and these types of cells are known as induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs. Through iPSCs cells can be introduced that receptive by the donor and will not be rejected, which is important when recreating new tissue. However, iPSCs are still under study until they can produced to entirely only stick to its designated cell type.                                                 

'''&lt;u&gt;Similarity among stem cells'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
Both human embryonic and adult stem cells have similarities and its differences in relation to using for regenerative therapy or repairing already damaged tissue and cells. A primary difference between adult stem cells and embryonic is the amount of different abilities that each is capable and the specific kind of differentiated cell types they will turn into. Embryonic stem cells can actually turn into all the different type of cells in the body because of their pluripotent nature. Adult stem cells are very specific and so limited to only differentiating into the type of cells of their original tissue. 

A noteworthy difference is that embryonic stem cells can be grown with great ease in the laboratory. Looking within mature tissues, the adult stem cells are limited in number so finding these cells may be difficult. Unlike embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells still do not have a way to be grown in the laboratory. This difference has a great impact as replacing cell mechanisms oftentimes requires an abundance of cells in order to work properly. 

Moreover, the tissues created from either embryonic or adult stem cells may be different in probability of rejection rate post-injection or transplantation. Embryonic stem cells have not been researched too heavily yet as testing using cells from hESCs were only just now approved by the FDA(Food and Drug Administration). The adult stem cells and tissues that form as a result are presumed to be less probable to rejection post-transplantation. The success can be attributed to using patient's self cells to be duplicated in the laboratory and then induced to differentiate into a specific cell kind and then re-injected into that same very patient. Utilizing the adult stem cells and the tissue products from the patient's very own cells highly decreases the probably of rejection by the immune system. This proves to be a major benefit since only using immunosuppressive drugs can help fix this problem but then the drugs have side effects that come along as well. 

'''&lt;u&gt;Uses for stem cells'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

[[Image:Stemcellheartrepair.jpg|550px|thumbnail| Using adult stem cells to repair heart muscle cells, photo by Terese Winslow, [http://stemcells.nih.gov/staticresources/images/figure4_lg.jpg]]]

There are many uses for stem cells, especially in research and in clinic. Studying human embryonic stems cells will help give information about development of humans. The principal target is to pinpoint how undifferentiated stem cells become differentiated cells and then later to form organs and tissues. Gene regulation is imperative in this aspect. A lot of the most irregular activity in humans result from aberrant erroneous cell division and differentiation. New research has found that iPS cells show that specific factors are associated with genetic signaling and molecular signaling and introducing these into the cells in a proper manner to command these processes will need a special technique. 

Stem cells of humans may be used to select for new drugs. These drugs can be tested to see that it is not damaging using these differentiated cells. A vivid example would be to use cancerous cells to select for drugs that could be anti-tumor. Environment of the drugs should be very similar in order to check if the drugs actually work and this can be done through having a precise command over where the differentiation of stem cells turn into. 

Another widespread use of stem cells is to utilize them to create cells and tissues to repair damaged or disease tissue in cell therapy. These regeneration of cells and tissues can aid in treating disease such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, heart disease, osteoarthritis, and spinal cord injury. 

'''&lt;u&gt;Checklist for successful transplant of stem cells'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
1) Duplicate in mass amounts and be able to produce enough quantities of tissue
2) Differentiate into wanted type of cells
3) Live to survive in recipient post-transplantation
4) Become integrated into the tissue in the proximity post-transplantation
5) For entire duration of organism's life- be able to correctly function
6) No detrimental effects on recipient 

'''&lt;u&gt;Ethical conflicts with stem cells?'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
The main concern with stem cells has to do with the human embryonic stem cells, which has created a lot of public interest and conflict. Stem cells that are pluripotent, or may become numerous different types of cells in the human body are created from human embryos that are some days aged. The major debate is of when does life technically commence and if embryos or even fetuses would be considered as such and also who has the power to decide on such an issue. 

'''&lt;u&gt;United States' position on stem cells'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
The Bush administration in 2001 offered federal funds for research on human embryonic stem cells if certain three criteria were met. However, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order 13505 known as &lt;u&gt; Removing Barriers to Responsible Scientific Research Involving Human Stem Cells&lt;/u&gt; on the 9th of March 2009. This allowed National Institutes of Health or NIH to take a different strategy on doing human stem cell research. Also this Executive Order essentially nullified both the Executive Order 13435 and the presidential statement that occurred on August 9, 2001.

** 2 tsp. of [[Cookbook:Curry Powder|curry powder]] stirred into the juice of 1/2 a [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]

== Procedure ==

* If using dry black-eyed peas, wash, then cook for 20 minutes, until [[Cookbook:Al dente|al dente]]. When done, drain.

* Meanwhile, prepare onions, carrots, celery, and sauté in oil or fat for 5 minutes.
* Add spices (garlic, ginger, salt, pepper) and sauté for 2 more minutes.
* Add rice to vegetable mix, stir in.
* Add stock and tomatoes, bring to a boil.
* Add the cooked black-eyed peas.
* Add meat, cook a further 5 minutes, turn heat to low, let simmer for 30-40 minutes.

* The meal is ready when the rice is soft.
* Then, add chili peppers and curry-lemon paste, cook for 10 more minutes. Serve.

== Optional / Replacements ==

* This dish works well as a vegetarian dish. Just omit the chicken, and increase the amount of black-eye peas by 50%.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Arachidonate, a 20:4 fatty acid derived from linoleate, is the dominant precursor of several eicosanoid hormones. There are four families of eicosanoids—the prostaglandins, prostacyclins, the thromboxanes and the leukotrienes.  These molecules react with cell receptors to produce signal transduction responses. Also, anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin are known to reduce effects of these molecules.

Eicosanoids are molecules which affect the synthesis of other molecules in cellular reactions. They take part in complex checks and balances systems in many parts of the human body such as during the inflammatory response or relaying messages in the central nervous system. They are derived from oxidation of essential fatty acids, generally Omega-3 or Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The name is derived from &quot;eicosa&quot; which means twenty in Greek. This is because eicosanoids are made of 20 carbon fatty acids called eicosatetraenoïc acid.

they are local hormones because they exist only for a short amount of time. they change the cell activities which they are sunthesized and of adjoining cells by binding to 7TM receptors. however, their effects are not uniformed and varies from cell to cell.

==Biosynthesis==
Biosynthesis of eicosanoids involves two steps: arachidonic acid release and its transformation into active products. Eicosanoids are not stored anywhere but rather created whenever required by the body. When a stimuli is triggered, such as cytokines, or growth factors, a phospholipase is released at the cell membrane and travels to the nuclear membrane. Here, the phoshpolipase catalyzes the break down of either a phospholipid or a diacyglycerol. This step releases a 20-carbon fatty acid. This fatty acid is a precursor to the different eicosanoids.

Two key enzymes starts the eicosanoid routes: cyclo-oxygenases lead to the formation of prostaglandins, while lipoxygenase produces hydroperoxides of arachidonic acid or catalyze the first step of leukotriene synthesis.

==Arachidonic acid metabolism: cyclooxygenase pathway==
catalyzes fatty acids to prostanoids by a 2 step process. two Oxygen molecules are added as two peroxide linkages, this leads to the formation of short lived, active intermediate PGG when a 5 member ring is forged in the middle of the fatty acid chain. secondly, one of the peroxide loses H and sheds a single oxygen, forming PGH.

==Arachidonic acid metabolism: lipoxygenase pathway==
==Catabolism (inactivation) of eicosanoids==

All arachidonic acid derivatives are quickly, in less than a few minutes, inactivated in the body by several complex reactions

==Functions in the Human Body==

Different Eicosanoids have different medical applications. Within the body, they are mostly paracrine and autocrine agents acting on cells close by and then are quickly used up. Each eicosanoid has its own specific receptor so they have highly unique functions. Some Eicosanoids have been isolated and have been identified. Some prostanoids have been identified to help sleep, smoothen muscle contraction like bronchoconstriction, uterine constraction, and platelet aggregation. Some leukotrienes have similar uses. Some stimulate platelet aggregation as well, vasoconstriction, leukocyte chemotaxis, and muscle contraction.

prostagladins stimulate inflammation, regulate blood flow to particular organs. control ion transport across membranes, modulate synaptic transmission, and induce sleep.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
As briefly stated in a previous section on the fluid mosaic model of biological membranes, proteins and phospholipids diffuse both laterally and, to a lesser extent transversely, through the entire span of a membrane. This sort of behavior can be characterized by fluorescence microscopy. This particular technique is called FRAP or fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching. In a typical procedure, a specific portion of a cellular membrane is first tagged with a fluorescent chromophore. Next, an intense light is pulsed over a small part of the fluorescent-marked region and viewed under a microscope. As a result of the exposure to the powerful laser-light, the fluorescent molecules are bleached (destroyed). The bleached region is then monitored over time for the recovery of fluorescence (as neighboring unbleached molecules moving towards the bleached areas).This can determine the availability state of a protein - whether it is free to diffuse or is already bounded. The rate at which the recovery takes place, D, the diffusion coefficient, will reflect the overall mobility of membrane components. The equation for such observations is as follows where S is the average distance of movement per unit time (t) as they relate to the diffusion coefficient:

S = (4Dt)1/2

[[File:Photobleaching.png|thumb|600px|center|'''Photobleaching Process''']]

A typical speed for a membrane phospholipid is 2um per second. This may not sound very fast, however, if you take into account the relative length of a cell or organelles which are typically 2um or less, a phospholipid can easily traverse an entire surface in 1 second or less. This experiment also allows for comparison with other familiar materials where relative diffusion rates and viscosities are known. As it turns out, a membrane has a diffusion rate and viscosity similar to that observed in olive oil.
The speeds for membrane proteins vary a great deal from nearly immobile to nearly as fast as a phospholipids. This should not be surprising being that proteins have, in general, a more irregular shape and a more uneven distribution of polar and nonpolar groups. Indeed, some of the more immobile proteins are anchored to various structures within the cell.

==GFP==
[[File:Aequorea victoria.jpg|thumb|Aequorea victoria]]
GFP is a protein that exhibits a green florescent light when exposed to blue light, hence its name. Green florescent protein was the first protein extracted from A. Victoria. Other marine animals, mostly corals, also exhibit florescence. The color of the florescence’s varies based on the structure of the derivative.

==GFP Uses==
[[File:PDB 1rmp EBI.jpg|thumb|PDB 1rmp EBI]]
GFP's can be used to study certain cell processes that could be difficult if not impossible to study. Including DNA replication and transcription, protein synthesis and transport, organelle and cytoskeleton assembly/disassembly, energy metabolism, and signal transduction pathways. Fluorescence is useful for measure cellular processes over time scales of minutes seconds or hours.. The most important aspect of GFP is it is genetically encoded by a single portable DNA sequence. This can be covalently bonded to a protein that can then be expressed in vivo.

==FRET==
[[File: FRET paths.svg|thumb|FRET Pathway]]
Florescence Resonance Energy Transfer has two major contributors. A donor chromophore and an acceptor chromophore. This allows for protein-protein interactions to be resolved spatially and temporally.The mechanism of fluorescence resonance energy transfer involves the use of a donor fluorophore. The fluorophore must be in an excited state. In the excited state the fluorophore may transfer its energy to a nearby acceptor chromophore. The main idea behind fret is that the energy transfer is based on the concept of treating an excited fluorophore as an continuously oscillating dipole. This can be compared to pair of tuning forks vibrating at the same frequency. Resonance energy transfer can yield a significant amount of structural information concerning the donor-acceptor pair.

The &quot;phenomenon&quot; of fluorescence resonance energy transfer is not regulated by photon emissions. FRET does not need the acceptor chromophore to be fluorescent either. The efficiency of the energy transfer varies in a direct proportion to the distance separating the acceptor and donor. FRET measurements can also be used as a ruler in molecular scale to determine distances between molecules. They must be labeled with an appropriate donor and acceptor fluorophore and must be within 10 nanometers of each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Determining Membrane structure ==
Using a technique called freeze fracture electron microscopy scientist were able to discredit the membrane sandwich model by the discovery of transmembrane proteins. In this technique a membrane is frozen in liquid nitrogen and then shattered so the membrane splits between the leaflets of its bilayer exposing the interior of the lipid bilayer and its embedded proteins. Electron micrographs are then used revealing that the interior of the membrane is studded with globular membrane proteins and the outer surface has a relatively smooth appearance.

==Bacteria Cell Walls==
Bacteria cell walls are composed of Peptidoglycan, which create rigidity of the cell wall, determine cell shape, and help prevent osmotic lysis.  The bacteria cell wall, like most lipid bilayers, is porous and semipermeable.  Gram positive bacteria have a very thick peptidoglycan layer and therefore, when dyed during gram staining, retain the crystal violet dye.  Gram negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan layer which results in an inability to retain the crystal violet dye during gram staining.

Peptidoglycan, also known as murein, is composed of alternating units of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). NAM is essentially a molecule of NAG onto which a lactyl group has been added to C3 via phosphoenol pyruvate; it is a signature molecule of bacteria. A pentapeptide chain is attached to the lactyl group during the NAM-NAG unit formation inside the bacteria. Generally, this pentapeptide chain consists of, in order: L-ala-D-Glu-mDAP/L-Lys-D-ala-D-ala. Once the NAG-NAM complex complex crosses the bacteria cell membrane into the periplasmic space, the terminal D-ala is cleaved off and the penultimate D-ala is cross linked to a DAP (forming a direct crosslink), or to a L-Lys (via a peptide interbridge) of another NAG-NAM complex. This crosslinkage is catalyzed by transpeptidases. 

There are two cellular compartments that are involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan.  The formation, association, and assembly of soluble precursors onto a lipid carrier occurs in the cystoplasm.  This generates Lipid II.  This is a complex molecule that is thought to be translocated to the outer side of the cytoplamsimic membrane by integral membrane proteins of the shape, elongation, division, and sporulation family.  The Lipid II's glycan chains are polymerized and the its stem peptides are cross linked.  This is catalyzed by peptidoglycan synthases which are penicillin-binding proteins, making this a target of B-lactam antibiotics.  The biosynthesis of peptidoglycan involves over 10000 common reactions catalyzed in the cytoplasmic compartment.

The antibiotic penicillin works by competitively inhibiting the transpeptidase via the beta-lactam ring in the drug. Vancomycin also prevents the peptidoglycan layer from forming, but it works by binding to the terminal D-ala-D-ala complex, preventing transpeptidases from working. It typically is used as a last resort. Other drugs that work to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis include phosphomycin, which inhibits NAM formation by competing with phosphoenol pyruvate, D-cycloserine, which inhibits enzymes that form the D-ala-D-ala unit inside the bacteria; and bacitracin, a drug that prevents bactoprenol from being recycled (bactoprenol is a carrier lipid, a homolog of dolichol, that moves the NAM-NAG complex across the cell membrane).

Additionally, bacteria have their own control mechanisms which inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis so that the organism can grow. These controls are classified as murein hydrolases, or autolysins, because they cleave various structures important for the murein layer. Hexosamidases cleave the beta-1,4 link between NAM and NAG, amidases cleave the peptide bond between the lactyl group and the pentapeptide chain on NAM, endopeptidases cleave various parts of the pentapeptide chain, and carboxylpeptidases cleave the D-ala carboxyl group, preventing crosslinking.

==Penicillin-Based Proteins.==
Once Lipid II is on the periplasmic side of the membrane, it undergoes the polymerization of the glycan chains and the cross-linking of the stem peptides.  While the Penicillin-binding proteins with high molecular mass carry out both of these reactions, penicillin-binding proteins with low molecular mass can exert carboxypeptidase or endopeptidase activities.  These activities cleave peptide bonds within the stem peptide in order to regulate the level of peptidoglycan cross-linking.  This insertion of the newly synthesized chains of peptidogylcan into the pre-existing layer is accompanied by the turnover of the old material produced by hydrolases (transglycosylases and endopeptidases).  This sequence has proposed the idea that penicillin-based proteins are themselves associated with cell wall degrading enzymes within a comples that is located at the interface between the membrane and the periplasm

== Common Features that Biological Membranes Share==

1. Composition of Membranes

The [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Fluid Mosaic Model|fluid mosaic model]] says that the three main components that make up membrane bilayers are lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. In general, most membranes are composed of approximately 75% [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]], 20% [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]], and 5% [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]].

2. Sheet-Like

Membranes are only two molecules thick and are sheetlike structures. They form closed boundaries and create different compartments. The thickness of most membranes are only between 6&amp;nbsp;nm and 10&amp;nbsp;nm

3. Built of [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|Lipids]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|Proteins]]

The mass ratio of lipids to proteins can range anywhere from 1:4 to 4:1. Although most membranes are made mostly of lipids and proteins some can have carbohydrates that are linked to lipids and proteins.

4. Composed of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties (Amphipatic)

Membrane lipids are small molecules and they have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. The membrane lipids form closed bimolecular sheets. These lipid bilayers that are formed provide barrier to the flow of polar molecules. The hydrophilic head of the lipid molecule is on the outside surface of the cell membrane in addition to the inside surface of the membrane while the hydrophobic fatty acid long chains are on the inside of the lipid bilayer.

5. Proteins mediate functions

Different proteins mediate different function for the membrane. The membrane proteins are embedded in the bilayer and serve as pumps, channels, receptors, energy transducers, and enzymes.

6. Noncovalent

The proteins and lipids in the membrane are held together through noncovalent forces that work cooperatively.

7. Fluid

Membranes are fluid and lipid and protein molecules can freely diffuse into the plane of the membrane but do not rotate across the membrane. The membranes are two dimensional planes of oriented proteins and lipids.

Membranes are not static sheets of molecules locked in place but rather, they are held together by hydrophobic interactions which are much weaker than covalent bonds. As a result, most of the lipids and some of the proteins can diffuse laterally across the membrane. Adjacent phospholipids switch positions about 10^7 times per second where as molecules flip-flopping transversely across the member is rarely observed. The reason flip-flopping is rarely observed is because switching from one phospholipid bilayer to another requires the hydrophillic part of the molecule crossing the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Proteins on the other hand do drift laterally but at a much slower pace as their size, compared to lipids, is relatively large. Two factors increase the fluidity of membranes. The first factor is the presence of unsaturated hydrocarbon tails of phospholipids which have kinks that keep the molecules from packing closely together. The second factor is the presence of cholesterol which enhances fluidity at low temperatures by hindering solidification by disrupting the regular packing of phospholipids. What also enhancs the fluidity of lipids is the lateral (fast) and flip flop (slow) exchange of place of lipid molecules between each other.

8. Asymmetric

The membrane does not match up and is asymmetric.

Asymmetry of membranes result for different functions needed by the cell as well as the molecular make up of each membrane. A membrane is a collage of different proteins embedded in the fluid matrix of the lipid bilayer. Phopholipids make up the majority of the membrane but proteins determine most of the membranes asymmetric properties as a result specification of membrane functionality. Different types of cells contain different sets of membrane proteins and the various membranes within each cell have a unique set of proteins necessary to carry out specific functions. An example of this is the sodium and potassium ion pump which uses ATP as a source of energy to pump ions in and out, but in order to do so, ATP must be inside of the cell to drive it.

There are two major populations of membrane proteins, integral proteins, which penetrate the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer, and peripheral proteins, which are no embedded in the lipid bilayer at all. Certain membranes contain distinct orientations of their integral and peripheral proteins, adding to the asymmetric character of the membranes. They have unique orientations because they are inserted into the mebrane in an asymmetric manner after synthesis. Many of the integral proteins are trans membrane proteins, which completely span the membrane. The hydrophobic regions of an integral protein consist of one or more stretches of nonpolar amino acids usually coiled in alpha helices. The hydrophillic parts are exposed to the aqueous solutions on either side of the membrane. Peripheral proteins are loosely bound appendages on the surface of the membrane and are usually exposed to parts of integral proteins. Depending on the functions needed by the cell, whether it be transport, enzymatic activity, signal transduction, cell-cell recognition, intercellular, attach to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, each membrane will look different. This asymmetry is preserved because membrane proteins do not rotate from one side to the other but &quot;are always synthesized by the growth of preexisting membranes&quot; (Berg, 345).

An example of membranes differing in their protein content is Myelin. Myelin is a membrane that serves as an electrical insulator around certain nerve fibers and has a low content of protein, 18%. Compared to the protein content of plasma membranes, 50%, the protein content is relatively low in Myelin. There are three major kinds of membrane lipids phospholipids, glycolipids, and cholesterol. The content of each in a membrane depends on the functions needed by the membrane and the characteristics of the cell. 

9. Electrically Polarized

The inside of the membrane is negative at around -60mV

==Cell Growth and Forces that Shape It==
Cell wall elongation and division of multi-protein complexes usually involves large macromolecues that are found on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane.  Penicillin-binding proteins, (PBPs) are intimatily associated to the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton proteins.  The bacterial cytoskeleton is a very important aspect of bacteria, and is the target of penicillin finghting antibiotics.
Peptidoglycan is the macromolecule that determines the shape and maintenance of a bacteria cell by influencing the growth of the bacteria cell wall.  There are two biochemical reactions that occur in the terminal stage of the peptidoglycan synthesis that is responsible for the lateral wall elongation and for septation.  The two peptidoglycan-synthesizing systems are in competition with each other so that there is not any peptidoglycan synthesis for lateral wall elongation occurring during septation and not septation during cell wall elongation.  The final shape of the bacteria is determined by these two cell wall synthesis interactions.  A normal balance between the two reactions with result in bacteria being shaped like rods.  An unusual prevalence of the site for elongation will lead to long rods or filaments.  Any prevalence of septum formation will lead bacteria to the formation of coccobacili or cocci.  However, bacteria has a negative control that blocks septum formation when lateral wall elongation is not completed.  This will help keep cocci from formation.  Mecillinam is a Beta-lactam antibiotic that will specifically bind to penicillin, binding protein 2 (PBP 2).  This will inhibit lateral wall elongation and transform rod shaped bacteria into cocci shaped bacteria.  This can be extremely useful as the cocci shaped bacteria is unable to proceed to further division.  However, it has been found that re-adding mecillinam to cocci that have not yet reshaped into rod shaped bacteria inhibits the peptidoglycan synthesis but does not interfere with the division occurring in the cells to which the antibiotic has been re-added even though these cells divide as cocci.  This indicates that in order to release septum formation form the control that the lateral cell wall exerts on it, the cell wall does not need full elongation of the lateral wall.  It has been found that cells with the removal of mecillinam, roughly one hour after removal, the cell division occurs.  This suggests that the time needed for the septum to start and fully complete is approximately an hour.  Because a normal rod will divide in half the time it takes for septum to complete, it is possible to deduce that the two septa are initiated at the same time in exponential cells growing under these conditions and are then stopped by the lateral wall elongation beginning.  However, septum formation can be blocked by intracellular event such as DNA replication that postpone septum termination until such time as they are complete.

----
Sequencing an [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Oligosaccharides '''Oligosaccharide''']involves identifying it's structure. The most common method in doing so uses enzymes that cleave oligosaccharides at certain linkage points. The first step is to remove it from the protein it is attached to. From this point, the oligosaccharide can be isolated and the mass can be found using mass spectrometric techniques such as [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Proteomics/Protein_Identification_-_Mass_Spectrometry/Types_Mass_Spectrometry#MALDI-TOF '''MALDI-TOF'''] (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight). Unfortunately, since many possible oligosaccharide structures exist within a given mass. A better analysis can be obtained by further decomposing the oligosaccharide into smaller pieces using specific enzymes. The decomposition and analysis of the pieces of the oligosaccharide can be repeated as many times as possible or needed to find the structure of the oligosaccharide.

[[../Sharratt, Peter. &quot;Ramus 2000.&quot; ''Rhetorica'' 18.4 (2000): 399-455]].

-Sharratt’s essay “Ramus 2000” is a unique one; its goal is to provide rhetorical scholars with a highly systematic, categorically-organized overview of the most recent scholarship presented on Ramus (ranging from 1987 – 2000). Sharratt is of the mind that a recent spike in the interest level toward Ramus and the ever-elusive definitions of Ramism (the influence of Ramus) justifies just such a type of investigation. Sharratt’s article – which perhaps could be better defined as a survey or meta-analysis of the varying studies pertaining to Ramus – ultimately finds that the “study of Ramus is in a very healthy state, particularly through international collaboration, though there are still considerable problems for scholars securing access to the different versions of his works” (399). 
-Sharratt divides the work published on Ramus as falling under one of the following headings: Biographical and General Studies, Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric, Scientific, and Ramism, this latter subdivided by geographical areas.

''Biographical and General Studies''
Just as there is no modern biography of Ramus, so there is no single modern general monograph on Ramus and Ramism although several recent publications contain good lucid presentations on the thought of Ramus (of which he annotates thoroughly in this article), usually with reference to some particular author or some particular topic. 

''Grammar''
According to Genevieve Clérico, historians of grammar largely consider Ramus’s contribution “comme un cas limite, sinon comme une rencontre manquée,” which is to say that is it marginal and does not quite live up to its promise of being a formalized structural grammar (404). 
While Ramus’s construction of grammar in many ways never got to be completed, Chevalier points out that the greatest defect of Ramus’s grammar lies in its “uniplanarite,” which means that he often fails to rise above the words themselves to a theory of sentence-formation and resorts instead to lists as a descriptive strategy. 

''Logic''
Research indicates that although Ramus is relatively influential, some legal diagrams do predate his and, perhaps more significantly, spatial diagrams appear clearly in the Middle Ages. Scholarship on this topic all but concludes that Ramus had or still has little influence on these higher disciplines.

''Rhetoric''
In a book published in 1999, ''Histoire de la rhétorique dans l’Europe moderne'', there is much interest shown towards Ramus. This is a widely varied collection of essays that provides a lucid account of late medieval rhetoric and the transition to the Renaissance. Sharratt points out one article in particular, which is explicitly linked to Ramus, Michel Magnien’s “D’une mort l’autre: le Rhetorique reconsidérée.” This article is particularly significant because Magnien does not agree with those who suggest that the Ramist “restriction” of rhetoric brought about the death of rhetoric since it was soon revived, starting with the work of Lipsius in the North and others in Italy (415-6). 
Ramist rhetoric, much less important than his dialectic, is not radically innovative. Laurens and Magnard, in their analysis of selected polemical texts, argue that Ramus emerges as a simplifier, a reducer, responsible for the excessive logicising of the analysis of discourse and of the divorce between logic and rhetoric.

''Scientific''
The most pertinent article about this aspect of Ramist thought is Jardine and Segonds’ “A Challenge to the Reader: Petrus Ramus on Astrologia without hypotheses,” which brings everything about Ramus on this subject up to date. It begins with Ramus’s letter to Rheticus in 1563 which condemns all astronomical hypotheses as impious, illogical, and unnecessarily complicated. The authors show that this approach is clearly linked to Ramus’s program for the renewal of the arts. 

''Conclusion''
&quot;There is a broad measure of agreement now that Ramus owed more to his predecessors (especially Melanchthon and Agricola) than he would have us understand and than had been previously recognized, and it is even plainer than it was before that he is no revolutionary, no great philosopher but a teacher, educationalist, and communicator, in spite of one or two dissenting voices. There is no real consensus about whether he was a humanist or not, and different attempts have been made to define his position with relation to Aristotle and others... There is also strong disagreement about his influence on Descartes&quot; (454-5).

      <text xml:space="preserve">RNA splicing takes place after RNA is transcribed from DNA, but before RNA is translated into mRNA.  Splicing takes out the interfering sequences (introns) from the expressed gene sequence (exons). 
Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) contain less than 300 nucleotides and are located within the nucleus.  They are mainly used for splicing mRNA precursors and are labeled as U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, and U6.  

Small Nuclear RiboNucleoprotein Particles (snRNPs) are the secondary molecules made of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and specific proteins.  snRNP molecules make up the larger splicosome molecules.  U1 snRNP recognizes the binding site on the 5’ end and the six-nucleotide sequence of the U1 snRNA binds to the splice site on the pre-mRNA.  From this, the spliceosome will assemble along the pre-mRNA molecule.  The U2 snRNP will bind to the branch site on the intron with its complementary sequence between the U2 snRNA sequence and the pre-mRNA.  The U4, U5, and U6 snRNPS then bind with the U1 and U2 complexes and form the necessary spliceosome.
The splicing process itself begins with the U5 interaction with the exon sequence on the 5’ splice site.  The U6 goes through intramoleculear reorganization after breaking from U4, which allows U2 to base pair and interact with the 5’ end of the intron, taking U1 out of the spliceosome.  The U2-U6 complex forms a helix that forms the center of the spliceosome itself.  U4 prevents U6 from splicing until the splice sites are correctly aligned.  Once alignment has occurred, the transesterification reaction cuts the 5’ exon at the phosphodiester bond and produces a lariat intermediate.  Splicing continues with rearrangements with the spliceosome that will then produce the next transesterification reaction on the pre-mRNA.  In the rearrangement, the U5 aligns with the 5’ exon so that it is easier to attack the 3’ splice site to produce another spliced product.  To finish the splicing process, the U2, U5, and U6 release itself from the lariat intron.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Particles (snRNPs)==

Small Nuclear RiboNucleoprotein Particles (snRNPs) are the secondary molecules made of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and specific proteins.  snRNP molecules make up the larger splicosome molecules.  U1 snRNP recognizes the binding site on the 5’ end and the six-nucleotide sequence of the U1 snRNA binds to the splice site on the pre-mRNA.  From this, the spliceosome will assemble along the pre-mRNA molecule.  The U2 snRNP will bind to the branch site on the intron with its complementary sequence between the U2 snRNA sequence and the pre-mRNA.  The U4, U5, and U6 snRNPS then bind with the U1 and U2 complexes and form the necessary spliceosome.
The splicing process itself begins with the U5 interaction with the exon sequence on the 5’ splice site.  The U6 goes through intramoleculear reorganization after breaking from U4, which allows U2 to base pair and interact with the 5’ end of the intron, taking U1 out of the spliceosome.  The U2-U6 complex forms a helix that forms the center of the spliceosome itself.  U4 prevents U6 from splicing until the splice sites are correctly aligned.  Once alignment has occurred, the transesterification reaction cuts the 5’ exon at the phosphodiester bond and produces a lariat intermediate.  Splicing continues with rearrangements with the spliceosome that will then produce the next transesterification reaction on the pre-mRNA.  In the rearrangement, the U5 aligns with the 5’ exon so that it is easier to attack the 3’ splice site to produce another spliced product.  To finish the splicing process, the U2, U5, and U6 release itself from the lariat intron.

==snRNP Biogenesis Cycle==

The biogenesis of snRNPs begin with the transcription of a monomethyl-guanosine (m7G)capped snRNA-precursor using RNA polymerase II. Following its transcription, the snRNA is exported out of the nucleas to react with Sm proteins, which combine to form the Sm core domain. This then triggers the hypermethylation of them7G-cap, thereby generatingthe trimethylguanosine (TMG)m^(2,2,7)3G-cap. The two-part nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of the Sm core domain and the TMG cap causes the relocation of the snRNP back to the nucleus. Before re-entering the nucleus, the snRNP undergoes completion of the biogenesis cycle in subnuclear domains called Cajal bodies. It is still relatively unknown as to which proteins join the snRNP at which stages of the biogenesis cycle. The U6snRNP does not follow the above stated steps and is speculated to carry out its biogenesis within the nucleoplasm.

==snRNP Assembly Factors==

Current work on snRNPs have demonstrated cellular assembly strategies for RNA-protein complexes.  snRNPs form in vivo by the synchronized action of a complex assembly line containing assembly chaperones, scaffolding proteins, and catalysts. RNP assembly factors satisfy two functions. One, they augment assembly efficiency by helping the accumulation of higher order building blocks and second, they hinder the collection of Sm proteins and the assembly of snNRP centers that contain wrong RNA, or RNAs that do not entertain an Sm site.  Various reports have spoken of the ‘proofreading’ function of the assembly machinery. These new strategies employ affinity to those used by protein complexes and also admit the explanation of common rules on how molecular machines are made in vivo.

This is something of an experimental page. Below is a list of traditional recipes from various cultures that are both delicious and healthy. 

I created this page while trying to lose weight. I became bored with the healthy foods I was eating but I didn't want to go back to eating foods that promote obesity. What you see below is the result: a list of healthy, traditional dishes to die for.

Feel free to add more recipes to the list. However, I ask that you adhere to a few simple rules. If you create a page for a recipe, please present it in its most traditional form with only minor changes to make it healthy. For instance, feel free to substitute an artificial sweetener instead of sugar for a [[cookbook:Whole-Wheat Pancakes|whole wheat pancakes]] recipe. However, don't try to pass off a tofu turkey as part of a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner. In other words, if minor changes won't make a recipe healthy then don't include it in the list. Also, please don't include your own recipe creations. I'm hoping to create a large list of ''traditional'' recipes, ones that have existed for decades or perhaps even centuries. Finally, please place it in the section for the culture it's part of.

An excellent example of a recipe that meets the above criteria is [[cookbook:Gambas al Ajillo|''gambas al ajillo'']] from Spain. Have a look at the ingredient list. You could make it healthier by taking away the sherry but why do that? The sherry raises the caloric content only slightly. Also ''gambas al ajillo'' is very popular in Spain and is one of that country's famous ''tapas'', thereby making it very traditional.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why Some Computers Still Get sick ==

Malware has existed for nearly as long as Unix. In fact one of the first malware applications was a rootkit for Unix, documented by Cohen. It allowed a back door into the superuser account by bypassing the password. The unique thing about it, was that it was embedded in the Compiler, so that you couldn't compile a version of UNIX without incorporating it.

You would think that by now, most forms of malware, would be found and defended against. However that assumes that the people who are defending are always honest, and that new ways of creating malware are not always being built. This assumption is not realistic. There is no reason to believe that those who are hired to defend against malware in one environment will do so for another as well. In fact, there is reason for mistrust, since often the security professional that is fixing one type of invasion, is laying the seeds for the next.

Consider the compiler. You would think that Cohen's article would have us look at the compiler and eliminate all chance of it being used as a vehicle for malware, but instead we find that every compiler manufacturer, is known to have bugs in its standard library functions that open them to use as a vehicle for breaking the software.

How about virus defenders? well one virus scanner, actually hired virus hackers to test its software. The result is that ever since, that particular virus utility has been vulnerable to hackers. Why, well, it turns out that there is an industry that gathers information on attempts to defend against malware and attempts to foil them, just like there is an industry that gathers information on malware and attempts to defend against them. These two industries are in constant conflict and nations are often underwriting the bad guys. Every step you take to protect yourself is countered by the next generation of malware. 

Worse, some of the worst malware, is not even a virus, but is software that perverts the design of the system software in order to embed its own version of a software package that might under other conditions be valuable, or attractive. Today everyone has heard of Pop-up blockers, but few realize that the reason we need them, is that someone at Microsoft had this wonderful idea that they should trigger a sub-window to advertise, whenever someone signed onto MSN. The malware mavins figured out how to corrupt the concept, and suddenly people were faced with a flurry of windows that they had to get rid of before they could read the base page. Malware mavins didn't care if the advertisements were tasteful or not, so many of the advertisements ended up being for porn sites. When enough little old ladies and parents complained, the pop-up blocker was developed. Note that in quite a few cases, pop-ups can still get through, for instance just last week I had 61 tabs for a single site, pop up on my browser. However instead of loading with the page, they now have to wait for the user to trigger an anchor that has been corrupted.

Since most of the time you are unaware of the source of an HTML page that you are browsing, this type of malware can be fitted in anywhere that an outsider can get access to the page source. Once Microsoft spread the idea, pop-up blockers were required, and doomed to fail, because there were other ways around the problem some of which Microsoft built into their own operating systems.

Consider the wonderful idea Microsoft had of redirecting you to the update site, when you were behind on updates and signed onto MSN. What is this but a more radical form of pop-up? Funny, that pop-up blockers don't help in this regard, isn't it? Microsoft continues to try and build automatic pop-up like software that will get past pop-up blockers. Should we be surprised if the Malware industry learns from them how to bypass the blocker and put an advertisement for a site on your screen? Do you think the virus hackers are any less smart? One problem that I have always seen with virus checkers, is that once you have found the virus, it has already dropped its payload. Except of course in cases where the source is not executed until the virus checker has checked it. This more or less eliminates viruses that are known, (as long as they can be detected early enough) and are transferred over e-mail, but doesn't eliminate other forms of transmission.

Even if we could detect all viruses, there is still trojan horses, malware that masquerades as a valuable or useful application, when it is also a delivery vehicle for some form of malware. With hundreds of sources of software on the internet, it is not surprising to find that many forms of malware are based on trojan horse infections. As a result the virus checker has to detect the trojan as well, before it drops it's payload. This would be a lot easier, if dynamic link libraries were more secure, but instead, often infections seat themselves in the system libraries by convincing the library that it is being updated with a newer version.

Even the Vaunted Registry in Microsoft products is vulnerable to insertion of malware, simply because it hides a portion of the start-up process in a database where it can affect the start-up of the computer launching a malware utility every time the computer is restarted, but where the user, unaware that the software has installed itself, cannot always defend against it. 

Microsoft wanted to hide the complexity of start-up with a database that stored all the details, and in the end just gave malware another place to hide.

UNIX and LINUX operating systems claim that they don't have viruses, but in fact, some of the first and most notable viruses were found in UNIX machines, however they tightened up networking to the point where it is virtually impossible for someone to install a net-based program without a degree in network software or an installation error.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Ethics and Politics of Genome Sequencing and Science ==

&quot;As in the most important scientific advances, the HGP carries with it benefits and problems. The benefits are immeasurable, and so are the problems. As DNA techniques provide important information on human genes, many diagnostic tools and therapeutic benefits, we do not know if the same information can also be used to discriminate against such individuals, employees and insurance companies. There is a very real prospect of insurance companies insisting on large-scale genetic screening tests for the presence of genes that conferred susceptibility to common disorders such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and various mental disorders.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 

As we have seen in the past, controversy regarding stem cells, their origin, and their use has had political and scientific consequences. In 2001, President Bush banned the use of federal funds for later stem cell lines. Although this ban was later lifted, the political and human impact of science cannot be ignored; Science shows great promise with respect to human knowledge, technology, and power, but the gains we make through science carry with them great responsibilities. The freeze of federal funding on new stem cell lines significantly hindered scientific progress in a field that appears to show promise with respect to curing disease and improving the welfare of mankind, but it also serves as a reminder to the fact that science, for better or for worse, is intricately related to politics, and that our future scientific progress partly depends not on just scientists and their research, but on legislators and bureaucrats. Although DNA sequencing and genetic research is still a relatively new field, the implications of such knowledge carry social, political, and personal consequences in the field of medicine yet to be discovered. 

In addition to the political relationship with science, technology, and medicine legally and financially, there are ethical considerations to be considered with new technologies. In the future, it may be possible to reliably clone human beings, artificially modify DNA to provide physical and mental benefits, and screen for &quot;imperfections.&quot; The range of possible consequences of DNA analysis and manipulation technology is nearly infinite, and although it may be hard to forget the impact of scientific technologies and the power scientists already have today to manipulate DNA, it may be too easy to forget the responsibilities we have, both individually and socially, ethically and morally, with respect to the power we have and how we wield it. Whether there will be new laws passed regulating DNA with regard to how it is stored and used or whether there will be a new regulatory agency to protect against the misuse of DNA (through theft, sequencing, cloning, artificial manipulation, etc.) remains to be seen, partly because the technology is not widespread, and current capabilities are relatively limited by the lack knowledge we have about genes and multiple gene interactions and difficulties we have with respect to mammalian cloning. 

In the future, however, this may change, and DNA manipulation on a mammalian scale may become very easy, especially with a greater understanding of how genes interact and what they do. What this will mean politically, economically, and ethically, is still anyone's guess. But as science drives new technologies, particularly with respect to DNA and gene manipulation, these questions will come into the public spotlight, as stem cell research has, and the consequences of such technologies will become more apparent and more profound.

=== Sickle Cell Anemia ===

[[Image:Sicklecells4.jpg‎|right|thumb|A mixture of sickle cells and healthy red blood cells]]

The name Sickle Cell Anemia comes from the shape that the red blood cells take when affected with the sickle-cell trait.  The sickle shape, which is caused by red blood cells being deprived of oxygen, causes the small capillaries to clog up, and impair blood flow throughout the body.  This can result in painful swelling of the extremities when the capillaries clog up, and cause a higher risk of bacterial infection or stroke because of the poor blood flow.  Also, sickle cells do not circulate throughout the body as long as regularly shaped blood cells do, thus leading to anemia because of a decrease in amount of blood circulating.  This mutation, though unfavorable in other ways, is slightly beneficial in that this trait makes the infected persons resistant to malaria. 

Sickle Cell Anemia is caused by a variation of one specific amino acid sequence in just one hemoglobin chain.  This idea was proposed by Pauling, and proved to be correct later on.  Around 7% of the world has some sort of disease of the hemoglobin that is caused by a variation in the amino acid sequence. Then, in 1956, Vernan Ingram proved Pauling correct by showing that the specific reason for the sickle cell trait was indeed the substitution of a single amino acid in hemoglobin, more specifically, of a valine substituting a glutamate in position 6 in the beta chain of hemoglobin.  With the advancements in genome sequencing, the exact cause of these diseases can be discovered, thus becoming one step closer to discovering a cure.  In this way, genome sequencing can be related to medicine, because it helps to find the direct cause of the disease, thus allowing researchers to look at more specific ways to correct the problems, instead of just the symptoms.

=== Thalassemia ===

Thalassemia is another disorder caused by a change in the normal genome. In this case, it is caused by a loss of a single hemoglobin chain instead of a substitution like in Sickle Cell Anemia. This disorder causes anemia, pale skin, and fatigue. The loss of the single hemoglobin chain can be found by genome sequencing. Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive blood disorder. Unlike sickle cell anemia, where the globin does not function properly, thalassemia is a condition where normal globulins are not produced in high enough quantities. There are three kinds of thalassemia: alpha, beta, and delta. Each is characterized by the inability to produce the appropriate globin chain. Like sickle cell anemia, however, thalassemia provides carriers some measure of resistance against malaria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Waxes==
===Chemical Structure===

Wax is a type of long chain apolar lipid which made up of various n-alkanes, ketones, primary alcohol, secondary alcohols, monoesters, beta diketones, aldehydes,etc. Waxes will form protective coating on plants and fruits, and in animal (example: beewax, whale spermaceti, etc.). More commonly, wax is ester of alcohol and fatty acids. They differ from fats since they don’t have triglyceride ester of three fatty acids.
Waxes are water resistant, so they are insoluble in water.        
[[File:Waxester.JPG|right|thumb|Structure of a Wax Ester]]

===Properties===

Due to the versatility of waxes, nature has manipulated them for their water-resistant properties, colligative properties (high melting point, relatively low viscosity at high temperatures, transparency, etc.) and coating properties. 

===Types of Waxes===

#Beeswax – for consumption
#Chinese Wax – for polishes
#Ear Wax – used as a protective layer over the ear membrane
#Lanolin – for rust prevention and cosmetics
#Shellac – used as a wood sealant
#Spermaceti – for cosmetics and leatherworking
#Vegetable (many different types extracted from plants) – used as a protective layer on the plant to prevent loss of water
#Mineral – used as fine polishes
#Petroleum – fuels, paints, culinary, candles
#Synthetic – modified waxes for use in the medical field

===Functions and Applications===

Waxes contain many functions in society. Man has manipulated and synthesized many waxes to be used for cosmetics, sealants and lubricants, insecticides, UV protection, energy reserves, food, etc.

==Soaps==
Soap is a mixture of sodium salts forming by adding sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate to natural fatty acids. The density of soap will be decreased by air bubble forming. 
The general reaction in producing soap:
:Fat + NaOH → soap + glycerol

==Making Soaps==
An example of making soaps is called Saponification of fats and oils which is the most common method of soap making process. 
1) Heat fats and oils
2) React with liquid Alkali
[[File:Saponification.JPG|right|thumb|General View of Saponification]]

==Detergents==

Detergent is a material that helps in cleaning.  Detergent contains one of more surfactants which are capable of reducing the surface tension of liquid such as water. Commonly, detergent consists of long chain hydrocarbon and ionic group (such as alky sulfate or derivative of ammoniac group).

===Types of Detergents===
'''Anionic '''

These detergents are man-made and consist of long hydrocarbon chains and a water-soluble ionic group, which is usually negatively charged. These detergents are commonly known as surfactants, or alkyl benzene sulfonates 

'''Cationic'''

These detergents are also man-made, and they only differ from anionic detergents in that the water-soluble ionic group is positively charged. These detergents are primarily derivatives of ammonium and are commonly used as a germicide and in shampoo.

'''Neutral'''

These type of detergents contain the same general set up as all other detergents, except it’s overall charge is neutral. The head of the detergent is polar due to the presence of three hydroxyl groups and an ester group. 

'''Natural'''

Natural detergents such as bile salts (sodiumglycoholate) are made in the liver. These detergents are derivatives of cholesterol, a type of lipid. Its main function is digestion. The bile salt is capable of emulsifying fats and oils such that enzymes may break them down further.

===Function and Application===

Detergents have many functions and applications including cleaning off fats and oils, softening materials, acting as aromas or abrasives, or sanitizing and disinfecting. Though detergent and soap are used interchangeably, people can see the various uses of detergents in common house products including hand soap, laundry detergent, dish and glass detergents, etc.

      <comment>/* Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Electron microscopy is a technique used for gaining a molecular picture of matter.  The resulting picture of a compound is called an ''electron micrograph''.  Depending on the resolution of the device, micrographs can show images of particles and macromolecules on the nanometer scale. This is particularly effective in biochemistry because electron micrographs can give images of a particular protein at different angles and allow a three dimensional image of the outside of a protein to be created. This image gives an insight into the structure, and thus the function, of the protein in question.  

Electron microscopy works on the basic principle of shooting a beam of electrons at a particular material (often under vacuum to avoid electron collisions with air molecule) and &quot;reading&quot; the result. The particular way a result is &quot;read&quot; gives different types of images for different materials and classifies the different types of electron microscopy. These different types are Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), Reflection Electron Microscopy (REM), and Low Voltage Electron Microscopy (LVEM).

==Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)==
[[Image:SimpleSEMandTEM.jpg|thumb|&quot;A simple sketch of a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) compared to an optical transmission microscope and a cathode ray tube (CRT) TV screen - both systems have many things on common with the electron microscope. The optical microscope uses lenses to control the lights pathway through the system and is in many ways built up like a TEM - only the TEM uses electromagnetic lenses to direct the beam of electrons. The CRT uses electromagnetic lenses as the TEM and SEM to control the electron beam, and generates an image for the viewer by scanning the beam over a fluorescent screen - in the same way the a SEM generates an image by scanning the electron beam over a small sample.&quot;]]

SEM is a type of electron microscopy that images a sample's surface by scanning it with a high-energy beam of electrons in a rectangular formation of parallel scanning lines that is similar to the guidance of an electron beam on a television screen or a computer monitor. The electrons interact with the atoms that make up the sample producing signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography, composition and other properties such as electrical conductivity. Scanning electron microscopes usually have a magnification range from 15x to 200,000x and a resolution of around 5 nanometers.

Just recently, in December 2012, the Italian scientist, Enzo Di Fabrizio, has obtained the first real photo of the DNA double - helix structure. In the image, one can see seven strands of DNA wrapped into a cord. Di Frabrizio used electron microscopy, which is a very useful technique to obtain a molecular picture at a nanometer scale. What he did was &quot;developed a technique that pulls strands of DNA between two miniscule silicone pillars, then photographs them via an electron microscope&quot;(Grenoble). This is a great example of how well electron microscopy works to obtain images of particles and macromolecules.

==Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)==

TEM uses a high voltage electron beam to create an image. An electron gun is then used to emit these electrons, which is usually fitted with a tungsten filament cathode as the electron source. The electron beam is accelerated by an anode/cathode mechanism, which is then focused by electrostatic and electromagnetic lenses, and transmitted through the specimen that is transparent to electrons and in part scatters them out of the beam. Upon leaving the specimen, the electron beam contains information about the structure of the specimen that is visually enhanced by the microscope. The image is viewed by projecting the magnified electron image onto a fluorescent viewing screen coated with a phosphor or scintillator material such as zinc sulfide.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)==

STEM is a type of transmission electron microscope, where the electrons pass through the specimen, but, with scanning electron microscopy, the electron optics focus the beam into a narrow area which is scanned over the sample in a raster. This process makes these microscopes suitable for analysis techniques such as mapping by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and annular dark-field imaging (ADF). These signals can be obtained simultaneously, allowing direct correlation of image and quantitative data. By using this process, it is possible to form atomic resolution images where the contrast is directly related to the atomic number.

==Reflection Electron Microscopy (REM)==

In REM, an electron beam is incident on a surface, but instead of using the transmission (TEM) or secondary electrons (SEM), the reflected beam of elastically scattered electrons is detected. This technique is usually coupled with Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) and Reflection high-energy loss spectrum (RHELS). This method improves clarity by increasing the resolution and increasing light scattering for a greater sensitivity in structural differences. This method is particularly effective in identifying molecular structure since electrons reflected can have their distance measured and calculated through geometric manipulation. However, reflective methods may not be as effective in certain environments since the index of refraction may not be constant if performed outside a vacuum.

==Low Voltage Electron Microscopy (LVEM)==
The low voltage electron microscope (LVEM) is a new type of microscope that is used to observe biological specimens. LVEM is divided into 2 parts: a miniature transmission electron microscope and conventional optical microscope. The miniature transmission electron microscope has maximum magnification 500 times by using emitter source of Schottky type, magnetic lens (for image formation), and electrostatic lens (for controlling magnification). The single crystal YAG fluorescent screen converts the electron image to light image. The miniature transmission electron microscope only uses 5kV source for accelerating voltage. The electron microscope is kind of small in size (around 20cm) and fits into a conventional optical microscope which has maximum magnification 400 times. The ability of having that maximum magnification is due to the aid of CCD camera (for image recording). The low accelerating voltage 5kV helps LVEM having imaging contrast twenty times higher than for 100kV. This seems to be an advantage of LVEM. However, the disadvantage of LVEM is a low transmittable thickness of the sample below 20 nm which limits only for small objects with the size of 20 nm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Scanning Calorimetry is a technique used to study phase transitions in lipids as well as proteins and other non-organic systems. The basic idea of scanning calorimetry is the use of two cells one containing a buffer of known specific heat and the other to be studied. In scanning calorimetry, heat is added to both cells while the temperature of both are being recorded. When temperature differences occur, the calorimeter understands to add heat to one of the cells so that the temperature in both cells are always equal. The scanning part comes from the constant scanning/measurement of temperature and heat, dependent on time. As the cell being studied reaches a phase transition, it will begin to need much more heat to raise the temperature of the studied cell to that of the sample cell.

[[Image:Hdsfsde.jpg|Hdsfsde.jpg]]

== Applications in Biochemistry ==
Scanning calorimetry can be used to study the melting temperature,T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of proteins and lipids. By using the same principles as mentioned in the overview, it can be determined when a protein is becoming denatured. Also when equations of enthalpy and Gibbs free energy are combined with calorimetry, the relative amounts and specific heats of proteins, lipids, and other macromolecules can be determined. Scanning calorimetry has allowed scientists to elucidate structures and interacts occurring in macromolecules quantitatively, that otherwise would not be known. Such values as stability in native form can be measured by Scanning calorimetry, by using the equation change in G=-RT(lnK) where G is the gibbs free energy, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and K is the equilibrium constant.

==Liquid Crystals==

Scanning calorimetry can be effectively applied to study phase shifts. When a solid enters a liquid phase it is not 
simply a discrete transformation but rather one with a transition state and a gradual process involving kinetics atom arrangement.
The state that is occupied between a solid and a liquid is called the mesomorphous state and by using scanning calorimetry we can observe energy changes in a given period of time and relate that energy change to how rapidly or slowly the atoms are dispersing and rearranging themselves.

==Oxidative Stability==
Using an airtight chamber scanning calorimetry can be used to determine measures of storing a certain compound or the chemical conditions necessary for a successful procedure or investigation. Oxidative tests using nitrogen can be added to a system with the compound of interest. If oxidation occurs and depending on the rate and we can readily identify if one condition is suitable or not suitable to store a sensitive compound. Therefore scanning calorimetry makes a good safety tool. By studying an exothermic event
and assessing the stability of a certain compound in different amounts of heat scanning calorimetry can tell us the maxium temperature of the material and its characteristics of its micro chemistry under heat. 

==Polymers==
Polymers are often broken down to identify different parts of their composition. Scanning calorimetry can check the composition using databases and compilations of standards. Scanning calorimetry of individual substituents can help identify parts of complex polymers that we find the future. By degrading a polymer we can also investigate the heat and exothermic character once again and then we can tell what the composition is made of. Scanning calorimetry also provides graphs that can show crystallization peaks
which can tell us the percentage of crystallinity which will give us insight on polymer purities and freezing point depression. And of course this can be applied to medicine because scanning calorimetry can assess what temperature to process a drug so the drug does not crystallize and become untakeable. Also cross linking of polymers is common in polymer industries and each time polymers do so, scanning calorimetry can provide a graph curve to show the time of transition and that can be further evaluated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Information ==

[[Image:isoprene.gif|right|thumb|300px|Isoprene, the basic building block of isoprenoids.]]

Also, referred to as terpenoids or prenol lipids, isoprenoids are any of a class of organic compounds composed of two or more units of hydrocarbons, with each unit consisting of five carbon atoms arranged in a specific pattern. These compounds are derived from five-carbon isoprene units and are biosynthesized from a common intermediate known as mevalonic acid, which is itself synthesized from acetyl-CoA. These lipids are considered to be the largest group of natural products, playing a wide variety of roles in physiological processes of plants and animals, and having a number of commercial uses.

In living organisms, these compounds range in function from pigmentation and fragrances to vitamins and precursors of sex hormones. Uses in industrial settings range from flavorings, solvents and raw materials for chemicals. These compounds are more commonly associated with being the main ingredients of perfumes and incense. But these are just a few of the many commercial uses for isoprenoids, which to this day are still expanding. 

== Isoprenoid Isolation and Identification ==
Isolation of isoprenoids from their natural sources is achieved through numerous procedures. Substances that are volatile and plentiful, such as turpentine, are best obtained by distillation of oleoresins. Rosin acids and fatty acids, which occur together in tall oil, are separated by fractional distillation at reduced pressure. Other compounds that are more on the rare side are best isolated by chromatography. A very laborious process known as enfleurage is employed for the isolation of heat-sensitive perfume ingredients. This process involves carefully placing the petals containing the oily isoprenoids in thin layers of purified fat to dissolve the oils. The oils are then recovered from the fat by washing the solution with alcohol. 

Physical properties of an isoprenoid compound are the main factor that must be looked at to identify the best purification technique that will yield the best results. A heat-sensitive compound will not be efficiently and successfully purified with techniques such as distillation or sublimination, which require heat. Similar compounds in one source are best isolated and purified by treatment into a mixture of new substances that can be more readily separated. After separation, the original products can be attained by reconverting them. Generally, solid compounds can be purified by recrystallization and volatile compounds (solid or liquid) are best purified by distillation. Similar and nonvolatile substances might require chromatography to best achieve separation.

[[Image:Camphor.gif|right|thumb|185px|Camphor.]]

The determination of the elemental composition of isoprenoids is not a difficult task due to their simple hydrocarbon makeup and the availability of simple and reliable procedures for quantitative analysis of carbon and hydrogens. The presence of the other element in these compounds, oxygen, does not interfere with the analysis of the carbon and hydrogen makeup in a significant way, but does make it a more laborious task. A particularly difficult compound that was difficult to determine throughout the history of isoprenoid studies was camphor, which had a total of more than 30 different structures presented before the correct one was found. 

Structures are more commonly identified by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This technique uses the help of a magnetic field to generate a response of the compound to this energy. This data is then collected and interpreted (computer analysis gives the best results to this day). Mass spectrometry, x-rays, and IR spectroscopy present other alternatives to NMR. High-resolution mass spectrometry enables the exact chemical formula of a compound to be determined, while X-ray crystallography permits the detailed spatial location of each atom to be determined from a diffraction pattern of the crystallized form of the structure.

== Structural Features and Some Isoprenoid Compounds ==
The five-carbon unit that constitutes the basic building block of isoprenoids is a hydrocarbon called isoprene. This compound is a branched-chain unsaturated hydrocarbon, meaning it has one or more double bonds between carbon atoms. Isoprenoids can have one or more functional chemical groups attached to their carbon backbone, such as hydroxyls and carbonyls, which make up the diversity of isoprenoids. Isoprenoids can be classified as monoterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;) sesquiterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;), diterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;), triterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;), tetraterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;small&gt;64&lt;/small&gt;) or other polyterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; . Many isoprenoids are arranged in a “head to tail” manner in which a carbon atom of one isoprene unit is bonded to a carbon atom of the next isoprene unit. Triterpenes and tetraterpenes, though, will tend to bond its isoprene units in a “tail-to-tail” fashion.

[[Image:Squalene compound.gif|center|thumb|500px|Squalene: an example of a compound with tail-to-tail bonding of two sesquiterpene units. The dashed line indicates the bonding location.]]

[[Image:Vitamin A with separations.gif|center|thumb|500px|Vitamin A: an example of a compound with head-to-tail bonding of isoprene units. The dashed line indicates the bonding locations.]]

=== Monoterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;) ===
The first isoprenoids that were studied initially in the history of these lipids were the monoterpenes, the molecules of which contain 10 carbon atoms.  These compounds are isolated from their natural sources by distillation of the plant matter with steam.  They are characterized as volatile oils that are less dense than water and have normal boiling points in the range of 150 to 185ᵒC. Fractional distillation at reduced pressures work best at purifying these compounds. Some widely known monoterpene derivatives include the oxygenated acyclic monoterpene derivative citronellol and its corresponding aldehyde citronellal, which occur in oil of citronella. Others include the compound citral, which is found in lemongrass oil and geraniol, most commonly found in Turkish geranium oil. 

[[Image:Monoterpenes.gif|center|thumb|300px|Some common monoterpene derivatives.]]

The process used to convert citronellal is widely used commercially to supplement the natural sources of menthol, since this process produces a mixture of stereoisomeric menthols by catalytic hydrogenation. Citral is used in the production of rose-scented perfumes. The reduction of citral with sodium amalgam yields a compound called geraniol, which is responsible for the scent.  Also, citral can be treated with acetone to condense it and yield pseudoionone, which is in turn treated with acid to produce β-ionone. Although not considered a terpene, β-ionone is commonly used as a starting material for the synthesis of vitamin A.

[[Image:Menthol, pseudoionone, beta-ionone.gif|center|thumb|300px|Menthol, pseudoionone and β-ionone.]]

=== Sesquiterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;) ===
Sesquiterpenes are of lower volatility than monoterpenes and thus, can be isolated from their natural sources by extraction. Purification of these compounds involves either vacuum fractional distillation or chromatography. The oxygenated sesquiterpenes are the most commonly encountered ones. Sesquiterpenes may be acyclic or contain rings. A longer chain length and more double bonds contributes to a wide variety of cyclization structures. For example, there are two arrangements of isoprene units found in bicyclic sesquiterpenes: that of the cadalene types and the eudalene types. An example of each form is cadinene, the principal component of the optically active oils of cubeb and cade, which is of the cadalene type and β-Selinene, which is present in celery oil, and is of the eudalene type.

[[Image:Cadalene and eudalene.gif|center|thumb|300px|Forms of bicyclic sesquiterpenes.]][[Image:Cadinene and beta selinene.gif|center|thumb|300px|Examples of bicyclic sesquiterpenes.]]

=== Diterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;) ===
Diterpenes are known to be antimicrobial and antiinflammatory. They derive from geranygeranyl pyrophosphate. One well known diterpene is phythol, an oxygenated acyclic diterpene that is the building block of the chlorophyll molecule. This compound is obtained on treatment with an alkali solution. Phythol is similar to vitamin A in terms of arrangement of their isoprene units (head-to-tail arrangement). 

[[Image:Phytol.png|center|thumb|300px|Phytol.]]

Another common diterpene is the commercially utilized tricyclic abietic acid. This compound is a carboxylic acid that constitutes the major portion of rosin. Rosin is the residue left after the isolation of turpentine and is the nonvolatile portion of the oleoresin of members of the pine family. It is used in the production of varnish and coating materials, among many other products. The versatility of this compound was discovered due to it being one of the cheapest organic acids available. 

[[Image:Abietic acid.gif|center|thumb|300px|Abietic Acid.]]

=== Triterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;) ===
An example of a triterpene is the acyclic hydrocarbon squalene (pictured above). This constitutes more than half of the liver oil of certain species of sharks and is otherwise, widely distributed in nature. Among shark liver oil, is it found in other fish liver oils, vegetable oils, fungi, and in human earwax. Squalene is a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. 

The most common types of triterpenes found in nature are those having five carbon rings. β-amyrin has usually been associated with much of the research done in the study of triterpenes. β-amyrin is found in the resin elemi, which is obtained primarily from trees in the family of flowering plants known as Burseraceae. Its skeletal structure shares many similarities with that of squalene and cholesterol. 

[[Image:Beta amyrin.gif|center|thumb|300px|β-amyrin.]]

=== Tetraterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;small&gt;64&lt;/small&gt;) ===
Some biologically important tetraterpenes include carotenoids, which account for the yellow, orange or red fat-soluble plant and animal pigments. Although they have eight lesser hydrogen atoms than the general formula of tetraterpenes, they are still considered tetraterpenes since they can be built up from isoprene units.  Lycopene is the red pigment of the ripe tomato. It's structure has an interruption to the more common head-to-tail bonding of isoprene units. This interruption contains a single tail-to-tail attachment, which gives lycopene its symmetrical structure. Many tetraterpenes generally have this feature.


[[Image:Lycopene.svg|center|thumb|400px|Lycopene.]]

β-carotene is another more common tetraterpene, which is the yellow pigment of the carrot. This compound is a precursor to vitamin A, which means it is of nutritional importance since animals are able to cleave this compound at the point of symmetry to promote the production of active vitamin A. This vitamin is of considerable importance in the synthesis of pigments in the eye that are necessary for healthy vision. 

[[Image:Beta carotene.gif|center|thumb|300px|β-carotene.]]

=== Polyterpenes (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ===
A well-known example of a polyterpene is rubber, in which n = 4,000-5,000. Oxidative degradation followed by x-ray diffraction revealed rubber to be made up of repeating units. The vulcanization of such a compound involves cross-linking between the chains through sulfur atom (disulfide bridges). 

[[Image:Rubber.gif|center|thumb|400px|Rubber. The dashed lines divide the three isoprene units shown, which is why n is divided by 3.]]

== Biosynthesis ==
The synthesis of isoprenoids begins with acetyl coenzyme A, a compound derived from acetic acid and coenzyme A. In the first part of the process, mevalonic acid and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPPP) occur as important intermediates. 

[[Image:Biosynthesis of isoprenoids part 1.gif|center|thumb|700px|Formation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate.]]

Afterwards, the formation of geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP, precursor of monoterpenes), occurs by the transformation of an IPPP to dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). DMAPP then combines with an IPPP to form this precursor. 

[[Image:Geranyl pyrophosphate.gif|center|thumb|700px|Formation of geranyl pyrophosphate.]]

Further combinations of the pyrophosphate compounds in a similar fashion can yield precursors to larger polyterpenes, such as the formation of squalene from GPP and IPPP, which can then form such isoprenoids as Lanosterol.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== DALI ==

DALI stands for Distance Alignment Matrix Method. DALI is a common and popular method that breaks down the protein that is inputted into hexapeptide fragments and then calculates a distance matrix through the understanding of the contact pattern between successive fragments. Secondary structure features with residues that are contiguous in sequence are shown on the matrix's main diagonal. The other diagonals represent residues that are not next to each other in sequence. When the diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal, the features they represent are also parallel. When the diagonals are perpendicular, however, their features are anti parallel.
If two proteins' distance matrices are the same or share similar features in almost the same positions, they can be said to have similar folds and length loops connecting the secondary structure elements. When two matrices are built, DALI's actual alignment process involves conducting a series of overlapping sub matrices that are 6x6. These 6x6 matrices are then reassembled to a final alignment through a standard score-maximization algorithm.
The DALI method has been used to construct the FSSP database (Fold classification based on structure-structure alignments of proteins, or families of structurally similar proteins). This database holds all known protein structures and aligns them with each other to determine structural neighbors and fold classification. This database information can easily be found on the internet for ease of access. A DALI online database can found [http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/start| here.] A [http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali_lite/downloads/download.html downloadable program] and [http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali_server/start| web search] are other available DALI resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Combinatorial Extension==

The combinatorial extension (CE) method is like the DALI method in that it breaks each structure into a series of fragments and attempts to reassemble them into a complete alignment. Pairwise combinations of fragments, named aligned fragment pairs, or AFPs, are used to make a similarity matrix where an optimal path is generated to identify the final alignment. To reduce the amount of searching and increase efficiency, only AFPs that meet a criteria for local similarity are used in the matrix. The first CE method only included structural superpositions and inter-residue distances but has been grown to include local environmental properties like secondary structure, solvent exposure, hydrogen-bonding patterns, and dihedral angles.
An alignment path is the optimal path that is calculated through a similarity matrix by linear progression through the sequences and extending the alignment with a possible high-scoring AFP pair. The initial AFP pair that nucleates the alignment can occur at any place in the sequence matrix. This is then extended with AFPs that meet the given distance criteria which restricts the alignment to low gap sizes. The size of each AFP and maximum gap size are required input parameters that are usually set to the empirically determined values of 8 and 30, respectively. An all-to-all fold classification database from known protein structures in the PDB has been constructed using CE.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SSAP ==

[[Image:Ssap-vectors.png|frame|Illustration of the atom-to-atom vectors calculated in SSAP. From these vectors, a series of vector differences can be constructed, for example, between (FA) in Protein 1 and (SI) in Protein 2. The two sequences are plotted on the two dimensions of a matrix to form a difference matrix between the two proteins. Dynamic programming is applied to all possible difference matrices to build a series of optimal local alignment paths that are summed to form the summary matrix, on which a second round of dynamic programming is performed.]]
SSAP stands for Sequential Structure Alignment Program. SSAP method uses double dynamic programming to produce structural alignment based on atom to atom vectors in structure space. SSAP constructs the vectors using the beta carbons for all residues by glycine, instead of the alpha carbons typically used, which thus takes into account the rotameric state of each residue and its location along the backbone. SSAP first constructs a series of inter-residue distance vectors between each residue and its nearest non-contiguous neighbors on each protein. A series of matrices is then constructed containing the vector differences between neighbors for each pair of residues for which the vectors were constructed. Using dynamic programming on each resulting matrix determines a series of optimal local alignments, which are then mixed together into a &quot;summary&quot; matrix to which dynamic programming is again used to determine overall structural alignment.
SSAP originally gave only pairwise alignments, but can now provide multiple alignments. It has been used to produce a hierarchical fold classification known as CATH (Class, Architecture, Topology, Homology) through an all-to-all comparison of proteins. This has then been used to put together a CATH protein structure classification database. The constructed database can found [http://cl.sdsc.edu/| here.]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Programs Used for Structural Alignment ==

[[File:Alignment of thioredoxins2.png|thumb|300px|right|Structural alignment of thioredoxins from humans and Drosophilia Melanogaster. Human protein is in red, fly protein in yellow.]]
Although somewhat complex, the programs and methods used in structural alignment are quite interesting and hold a wealth of information to be learned. Most of the programs involve matrices and seemingly complex mathematical procedures. Although this holds the difficulty of complex mathematics, it is interesting to see how the structural alignment of proteins is determined and also what each method specifically finds out.

The goal of structural alignment techniques has been to compare individual structures, sets of structures, or an &quot;all-to-all&quot; comparison database that measures the divergence between every pair of structures present in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The worldwide protein data bank can be found here at [http://www.wwpdb.org/  this website.] These databases generally classify proteins based on their folding.

Certain methods differ in the amount of points that are given to each correct protein alignment and the amount of points deducted from each incorrect protein alignment. For instance, Glutamine and Asparagine are both polar and have a very similar hydropathy index, so, if Glutamine is present where an Asparagine should be, less points would be deducted than if, say, Valine were there. This type of method allows maximum amount of points to be granted for alignments which change the structure or function of the protein the least. The points granted for each alignment can be compared to other alignments in order to better understand how closely related certain proteins are to one another in structure or function.

== VMD ==

A way to actually compare two structures is to use VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).
VMD stands for Virtual Molecular Dynamics. One can load a pdb file using VMD and go to file-&gt;add a structure.
VMD uses RMSD structural alignment to compare two structures.
RMSD stands for Root Mean Square Distance and it compares the distances of the atoms.
Lower the RMSD values of two proteins, the more aligned.

== DALI ==

DALI involves the breaking of the input protein structure into hexapeptide fragments which are then inputted in a distance matrix that evaluates contact patterns between successive fragments. The DALI method has been used to determine structural neighbors and fold classification.

== Combinatorial Extension ==

Combinatorial Extension (CE) breaks each protein into a series of fragments and attempts to reassemble them into a complete alignment. This method can be used for structural superpositions, inter-residue distances, secondary structure, solvent exposure, hydrogen-bonding patterns, and dihedral angles.

== SSAP ==

SSAP uses double dynamic programming to produce a structural alignment based on atom-to-atom vectors in structure space. In the first step, SSAP will perform inter-residue distance vectors and adjacent non-related neighboring proteins. The dynamic programming on each matrix produce local alignments that are then recorded onto a summary matrix to determine the overall structural alignment. A SSAP score ranging 80-100 explain highly similar structures whereas scores falling between 70-80 are slightly similar with few deviations. Scores 60-70 may contain the same tertiary structure, but the class may vary.

*Beiber*

The *Beiber* method is a combinatorial algorithm for non-sequential structural alignment of proteins and similarity search in databases. This method focuses on secondary structure to evaluate similarities between two different protein structures based on contact maps.

== MAMMOTH ==

MAMMOTH's purpose was originally developed for comparing models coming from structure prediction, but now also works well with experimental models. MAMMOTH has been used to create a large database covering predicted structures of unknown proteins for 150 genomes which allows for genomic scale normalization.

== RAPIDO ==

RAPIDO is a web based program for analyzing three dimensional crystal structures of different protein molecules in the presence of conformational changes. This method involves the calculation of difference distance matrices between fragments that are structurally similar in two different proteins.

== SABERTOOTH ==

SABERTOOTH uses structural profiles to perform structural alignments. This tool recognizes structural similarities with accuracy and quality compared to that of other established alignment tools based on coordinates.

== BLOSUM ==
BLOSUM stands for Blocks of Amino Acid Substitution Matrix uses an assigned score based on the observed frequencies of such occurrences in alignment related proteins. Certain scores may be added with values of either positive or negative value. This scale is then run by a log odd ratio. In essence, two matrices are compared and evaluated by the ratio of similar or identical sequences to the ratio of unknowns missed by one.

== TOPOFIT ==

TOPOFIT analyzes protein structures based on three dimensional Delaunay triangulation patterns derived from backbone representation. TOPOFIT produces a structural alignment of proteins based on the fact that proteins have a common spatial invariant part (a set of tetrahedrons) which is mathematically described as a common spatial sub-graph volume of three dimensional contact graph derived from Delaunay tessellation (DT).

== InsightII ==

insightII is a molecular modeling package developed by Biosym. The programs included include Insight II, BioPolymer, Analysis, and Discover. InsightII therefore is a comprehensive program that can not only build any class of molecule or molecule system, but with the molecular mechanics program Discover, can manipulate these same molecules.

Insight II is primarily used for visualization. It creates, modifies, manipulates, displays, and analyzes molecular systems. Insight II essentially provides the core requirements for all software modules. Analysis revolves around mathmatical and geometric modeling of molecular properties. Molecular properties are defined interactively, evaluated dynamically, and visualized interactively through spreadsheets, graphs, and graphic representations. BioPolymer constructs models of polymers—peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids—for visualing complex structures and use in further simulation work. CHARMM is a simulation program available within insight II that uses energy functions to describe the forces on atoms in molecules.  This allows for calculation of interaction and conformational energies, free energy, and vibrational frequencies.

Through use of the Discover program, one can optimize the structure of the molecule or protein being viewed. This is due to the fact that it incorporates a range of well validated forcefields for dynamics simulations, minimization, and conformational searches. This allows for the ability to extrapolate the structure, energetics, and properties of systems, be they organic, inorganic, organometallic, or biological. Because of this program, it is possible to take the sequence of a protein and from that extrapolate a rudimentary structure from it. Discover also implements Inter Process Communications which allow for Discover turn over control to external programs and retrieve those results, inforperating them into continuing Discover computations.

Note the fair use criteria.

=== Tagalog ===

Bahay kubo, kahit munti &lt;br/&gt;
Ang halaman doon, ay sari sari&lt;br/&gt;
Singkamas at talong, sigarilyas at mani &lt;br/&gt;
Sitaw, bataw, patani. &lt;br/&gt;
kundol, patola, upo't kalabasa. at saka meron pa, labanos, mustasa. 
sibuyas, kamatis, bawang at luya, sa paligid-ligid ay puno ng linga.

      <text xml:space="preserve">International political economy is concerned with the ways in which political forces (states, institutions, individual actors, etc.) shape the systems through which economic interactions are expressed, and conversely the effects that economic interactions (including the power of collective markets and individuals acting both within and outside them) have upon political structures and outcomes. The major theoretical perspectives in international political economy are Mercantilsm, liberalism, Marxism and constructivism.

== Mercantilsm/realism ==
Mercantilsm is similar to International relations realism.

These attractive green gnocchi originated in Tuscany where, confusingly, they were known as ravioli.

==Ingredients==
* 12 oz. cooked [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], well drained and finely chopped
* 1 container (8 oz) [[Cookbook:Ricotta|Ricotta]], mashed until smooth
* 2 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
* 1 cup freshly grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* 3 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 5 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] melted, [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] and [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]

==Procedure==

===Gnocchi===
* Put the spinach, ricotta and seasoning in a saucepan and cook gently, stirring continuously, for 5 minutes.
* Turn off the heat, and beat in the eggs, the 3 tbsp. of the Parmesan and the flour.
* Chill the mixture for at least 4 hours.
* Lightly shape into small rounds and roll them into a very small amount of flour.
* [[Cookbook:Poaching|Poach]] them in water until they float to the surface. Drain and set aside.

===Sauce===
* I'll finish this tonight. Computer is dying.</text>

A prime ingredient of any 3D design flow is the ability to import from and export to other tools.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format) STL file format] is currently the most common format used.

=== import ===

Imports a file for use in the current OpenSCAD model

'''Parameters'''

; &amp;lt;file&amp;gt; : A string containing the path to the STL or DXF file.
; &amp;lt;convexity&amp;gt; : An Integer. The convexity parameter specifies the maximum number of front sides (back sides) a ray intersecting the object might penetrate. This parameter is only needed for correctly displaying the object in OpenCSG preview mode and has no effect on the polyhedron rendering.

'''Usage examples:'''
 
 import(&quot;example012.stl&quot;, convexity=3);


==== Convexity ====
[[Image:Openscad_convexity.jpg||400px||]]

This image shows a 2D shape with a convexity of 4, as the ray indicated in red crosses the 2D shape a maximum of 4 times. The convexity of a 3D shape would be determined in a similar way. Setting it to 10 should work fine for most cases.

==== Notes ====

In the latest version of OpenSCAD, import() is now used for importing both 2D (DXF for extrusion) and 3D (STL) files.


If you want to render the imported STL file later, you have to make sure that the STL file is &quot;clean&quot;. This means that the mesh has to be manifold and should not contain holes nor self-intersections. If the STL is not clean, you might get errors like:


  CGAL error in CGAL_Build_PolySet: CGAL ERROR: assertion violation!
  Expr: check_protocoll == 0
  File: /home/don/openscad_deps/mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/include/CGAL/Polyhedron_incremental_builder_3.h
  Line: 199

or

  CGAL error in CGAL_Nef_polyhedron3(): CGAL ERROR: assertion violation!
  Expr: pe_prev-&gt;is_border() || !internal::Plane_constructor&lt;Plane&gt;::get_plane(pe_prev-&gt;facet(),pe_prev-&gt;facet()-&gt;plane()).is_degenerate()
  File: /home/don/openscad_deps/mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/include/CGAL/Nef_3/polyhedron_3_to_nef_3.h
  Line: 253

In order to clean the STL file, you have the following options:

- use http://wiki.netfabb.com/Semi-Automatic_Repair_Options  . This will repair the holes but not the self-intersections.

- use netfabb basic. This free software doesnt have the option to close holes nor can it fix the self-intersections

- use MeshLab, This free software can fix all the issues


Using MeshLab, you can do:

- Render - Show non Manif Edges

- Render - Show non Manif Vertices

- if found, use Filters - Selection - Select non Manifold Edges or Select non Manifold Vertices - Apply - Close. Then click button 'Delete the current set of selected vertices...' or check http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDx0Tgy0UHo for an instruction video. The screen should show &quot;0 non manifold edges&quot;, &quot;0 non manifold vertices&quot;


Next, you can click the icon 'Fill Hole', select all the holes and click Fill and then Accept. You might have to redo this action a few times.

Use File - Export Mesh to save the STL.

=== import_stl ===
&lt;DEPRECATED.. Use the command '''import''' instead..&gt;

=== STL Export ===

To export your design, select &quot;Export as STL...&quot; from the &quot;File --&gt; Export&quot; menu, then enter a filename in the ensuing dialog box.  Don't forget to add the &quot;.stl&quot; extension.

'''Trouble shooting''':

After ''compile and render GCAL'' (F6), you may see that your design is ''simple: no''. That's bad news.

See line 8 in the following output from ''OpenSCAD 2010.02'':

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Parsing design (AST generation)...
Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...
Compilation finished.
Rendering Polygon Mesh using CGAL...
Number of vertices currently in CGAL cache: 732
Number of objects currently in CGAL cache: 12
   Top level object is a 3D object:
   Simple:         no                &lt;*****************
   Valid:         yes
   Vertices:       22
   Halfedges:      70
   Edges:          35
   Halffacets:     32
   Facets:         16
   Volumes:         2
Total rendering time: 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds
Rendering finished.
&lt;/source&gt;

When you try to export this to .STL you will get a message like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Object isn't a valid 2-manifold! Modify your design..
&lt;/source&gt;

&quot;Manifold&quot; means that it is &quot;water tight&quot; and that there are no holes in the geometry.
In a valid 2-manifold each edge must connect exactly two facets.  That means that the program must be able to connect a face with an object. E.g. if you use a cube of height 10 to carve out something from a wider cube of height 10, it is not clear to which cube the top or the bottom belongs. So make the small extracting cube a bit &quot;longer&quot; (or &quot;shorter&quot;):
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
difference() {
	// original
	cube (size = [2,2,2]);
	// object that carves out
	# translate ([0.5,0.5,-0.5]) {
	    cube (size = [1,1,3]);	
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[file:openscad-difference-cube-example.png|frame|none|Correct use of difference]]

Here is a more tricky little example taken from the [http://rocklinux.net/pipermail/openscad/2009-December/000018.html OpenSCAD] Forum (retrieved 15:13, 22 March 2010 (UTC)):
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
module example1() {
		cube([20, 20, 20]);
		translate([-20, -20, 0]) cube([20, 20, 20]);
		cube([50, 50, 5], center = true);
	}
module example2() {
		cube([20.1, 20.1, 20]);
		translate([-20, -20, 0]) cube([20.1, 20.1, 20]);
		cube([50, 50, 5], center = true);
	}
&lt;/source&gt;

Example1 would render like this:
[[file:openscad-no-simple-object.png|frame|none|A not valid 2-manifold cube (simple = no)]]

The '''example1''' module is not a valid 2-manifold because both cubes are
sharing one edge. They touch each other but do not intersect.

'''Example2''' is a valid 2-manifold because there is an intersection. Now the construct meets the 2-manifold constraint stipulating that ''each edge
must connect exactly two facets.'' 

Pieces you are subtracting must extend past the original part. ([http://www.iheartrobotics.com/2010/01/openscad-tip-manifold-space-and-time.html OpenSCAD Tip: Manifold Space and Time], retrieved 18:40, 22 March 2010 (UTC)).

For reference, another situation that causes the design to be non-exportable is when two faces that are each the result of a subtraction touch. Then the error message comes up.
&lt;source lang=text&gt;
difference () {
   cube ([20,10,10]);
   translate ([10,0,0]) cube (10);
}
difference () {
   cube ([20,10,10]);
   cube (10);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
simply touching surfaces is correctly handled. 
&lt;source lang=text&gt;
translate ([10,0,0]) cube (10);
cube (10);
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== O-GlcNAc ==

[[File:O-GlcNAc2.pdf|right|thumb|O-GlcNAc.]]

β-linked N-acetylglucosamine is also known as O-GlcNAc. It is an intercellular cabohydrate that dynamiclly modifies proteins in the nucleous and cytoplasm on the Serine and Threonine residues (Hart). The regulation of O-GlcNAc is dependent on only two enzymes OGT and O-GlcNacase (Hart). 
The difference between O-GlcNAc and many forms of protein glycosylation are:
a.O-GlcNAcylation occurs only in the cytoplasm and nuclease
b.It is not an elongated structure
c.It is attached and removed several times in the life of a (Hart.
It was discovered in 1983 (Hart). It is present all muticellular organisms,but not in yeast, for example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hart).



== O-GlcNAcylation ==

[[File:O-GlcNAc1.pdf|right|thumb|O-GlcNAc.]]

O-GlcNAcylation shares more similarities to phosphoylation than other forms of protein phosphorylation. The interplay between O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate is fact, that protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c). The enzyme that removes O-phosphate also regulates OGT. This suggests that the enzyme can remove the phosphate group and attach the O-GlcNAc. The monosaccharide B-N-Acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) attaches to serine/threonine residues via an O-linked glycosidic bond. 

== O-GlcNAcylation in Alzheimers ==
O-GlcNAcylation regulation has been proven to been an important factor in Alzheimer Disease patients as shown in the article done by Department of Neurochemistry, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities. (F.Liu, K.Iqbal, I.Grundke-Iqbal, G.W. Hart, and Cheng-Xin Gong) A microtubule associated protein, Tau, is &quot;hyperphosphorylated and aggregated into a neurofibillary tangle in Alzheimer diseased brain&quot;.{{ref|O-GlcNAcylation In Alzheimers}}The protein tau is modified by O-GlcNAcylation through process described in previous paragraph. The phosphoryl site-specificity of tau is both regulated in vitro and in vivo. Experiments were ran to show that the inverse affect that occurs when levels of O-GlcNAcylation occurs.

== Starving Mouse Experiment ==
This experiment tested the affects of decreased glucose leading to decrease in O-GlcNAcylation. The mice starved for 48h as a result decreasing brain supply of glucose. The environment of the mouse was in a cage with prevention of coprophagy. There is a reduction in cellular concentration of UDP-Glucose consequently the protein of O-GlcNAcylation. In the experiment a I(125) Western blot is ran with anti-GlcNAcyl antibodies.{{ref|O-GlcNAcylation In Alzheimers}}The tau phosphorylation increases suggesting an overall inverse regulation of tau phosphorylation by O-GlcNAcylation. The mouse's brain neurofilaments had an increased level of tau phosphorylation due to the decrease of tau O-GlcNAcylation in the brain. This is the result of deficient glucose uptake and utilization.

[[File:Starvingmice.jpg|right|thumb|Starving Mouse Experiment.]]

== O-GlcNAc Transferase ==
The catalyst that attaches O-GlcNAc from the UDP-GlcNAc substrate to either a Serine or Theronine residue forming a β-glycosidic linkage is the O-GlcNAc  tranferase(OGT) (Hart).
Mammals seem to have only one gene that catalysis the OGT.  There is a dependent relationship between OGT and viability of the embryonic stem cells. In the absence O-GlcNacylation in the mammalian cells is lethal (Hart).
The complex regularion of OGT has not been clearly defined.  But, it has been discovred that OGT is O-GlcNAcylated and phosphorylated (Hart).

== O-GlcNAcase ==

Nucleocytoplasmic β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase) is the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc from a protein (Hart).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== For Loop ===

Iterate over the values in a vector or range.

'''Vector version:''' for (variable=&lt;vector&gt;) &lt;do_something&gt; - &lt;variable&gt; is assigned to each successive value in the vector&lt;br/&gt;
'''Range version:''' for (variable=&lt;range&gt;) &lt;do_something&gt;

'''Nested loops''' :
for ( variable1 = &lt;range or vector&gt;, variable2 = &lt;range or vector&gt; ) &lt;do something, using both variables&gt;
&lt;br&gt;for loops can be nested, just as in normal programs. A shorthand is that both iterations can be given in the same for statement

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|'''Usage example 1 - iteration over a vector:'''
|-
|&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
for (z = [-1, 1]) // two iterations, z = -1, z = 1
{
    translate([0, 0, z])
    cube(size = 1, center = false);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{
    rotate( i * 360 / 6, [1, 0, 0])
    translate([0, 10, 0])
    sphere(r = 1);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

|'''Usage example 2b - iteration over a range specifying an increment:'''
|-
|&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// Note: The middle parameter in the range designation 
// ('0.2' in this case) is the 'increment-by' value
// Warning: Depending on the 'increment-by' value, the

   translate([xpos*ypos, ypos, 0]) cube([0.5, 0.5, 0.5]);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Intersection For Loop ===
Iterate over the values in a vector or range and take an [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#intersection|intersection]] of the contents.

'''Note:''' &lt;code&gt;intersection_for()&lt;/code&gt; is a work around because of an issue that you cannot get the expected results using a combination of the standard &lt;code&gt;for()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;intersection()&lt;/code&gt; statements. The reason is that &lt;code&gt;for()&lt;/code&gt; do a implicit &lt;code&gt;union()&lt;/code&gt; of the contents.

'''Parameters'''

; &amp;lt;loop variable name&amp;gt; : Name of the variable to use within the '''for''' loop. 

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;

|}

=== If Statement ===

Conditionally evaluate a sub-tree.

'''Parameters'''

* The boolean expression that should be used as condition

'''NOTE:''' 

Do not confuse the assignment operator '=' with the equal operator '==' 
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
 if (a=b) dosomething();  // WRONG - this will FAIL to be processed without any error message
 if (a==b) dosomething(); // CORRECT - this will do something if a equals b
&lt;/source&gt;
'''NOTE:''' 

Assignment is not allowed within either branch of an if statement.  Consider using the ternary operator 'condition ? consequent: alternative'. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// WRONG - this will FAIL to be processed with a syntax error message
if (condition)
{
    x = consequent;
} else {
    x = alternative;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// CORRECT - this will set 'x' to either 'consequent' or 'alternative'
x = condition ? consequent : alternative;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Usage example:'''
 &lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot; &gt;
if (x &gt; y)
{
    cube(size = 1, center = false);
} else {
    cube(size = 2, center = true);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Assign Statement ===

Set variables to a new value for a sub-tree.

'''Parameters'''

* The variables that should be (re-)assigned

'''Usage example:'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
for (i = [10:50])
{
    assign (angle = i*360/20, distance = i*10, r = i*2)
    {
        rotate(angle, [1, 0, 0])
        translate([0, distance, 0])
        sphere(r = r);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">For including code from external files in OpenSCAD, there are two commands available:

* '''&lt;code&gt;include &lt;''filename''&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' acts as if the contents of the included file were written in the including file, and
* '''&lt;code&gt;use &lt;''filename''&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' imports modules and functions, but does not execute any commands other than those definitions.

Library files are searched for in the same folder as the design was open from, or in the library folder of the OpenSCAD installation. You can use a relative path specification to either. If they lie elsewhere you must give the complete path.
Newer versions have predefined user libraries, see the [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Libraries]] page, which also documents a number of library files included in OpenSCAD.

Windows and Linux/Mac use different separators for directories. Windows uses '''\''', e.g. directory\file.ext, while the others use '''/''', e.g. directory/file.ext. This could lead to cross platform issues. However OpenSCAD on Windows correctly handles the use of '''/''', so using '''/''' in all '''include''' or '''use''' statements will work on all platforms.

Using '''&lt;code&gt;include &lt;''filename''&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' allows default variables to be specified in the library. These defaults can be overridden in the main code. An openscad variable only has one value during the life of the program. When there are multiple assignments it takes the last value, but assigns when the variable is first created. This has an effect when assigning in a library, as any ''variables'' which you later use to change the default, must be assigned before the include statement. See the second example below.

A library file for generating rings might look like this (defining a function and providing an example):

'''ring.scad:'''

 module ring(r1, r2, h) {
     difference() {
         cylinder(r = r1, h = h);
         translate([ 0, 0, -1 ]) cylinder(r = r2, h = h+2);
     }
 }
 
 ring(5, 4, 10);

Including the library using

 include &lt;ring.scad&gt;;
 rotate([90, 0, 0]) ring(10, 1, 1);

would result in the example ring being shown in addition to the rotated ring, but

 use &lt;ring.scad&gt;;
 rotate([90, 0, 0]) ring(10, 1, 1);

only shows the rotated ring.

If using the use function, make sure to place the use statements at top of the file, or at least not within a module!

This will work fine:
  
  // a.scad
  use &lt;ring.scad&gt;;
  module a() {
    ring();
  }

but this will result in an syntax error:

  //a.scad
  module a() {
    use &lt;ring.scad&gt;;
    ring();
  }
Default variables in an '''&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;''' can be overridden, for example

'''lib.scad'''

 i=1;
 k=3;
 module x() {
     echo(&quot;hello world&quot;);
     echo(&quot;i=&quot;,i,&quot;j=&quot;,j,&quot;k=&quot;,k);
 }

'''hello.scad'''
 j=4;
 include &lt;lib.scad&gt;;
 x();
 i=5;
 x();
 k=j;
 x();
 
Produces the following

 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, 4
 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, 4
 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, 4

However, placing '''&lt;code&gt;j=4;&lt;/code&gt;''' after the '''&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;''' fails, producing

 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, undef
 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, undef
 ECHO: &quot;hello world&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;i=&quot;, 5, &quot;j=&quot;, 4, &quot;k=&quot;, undef

== Trigonometric Functions ==
&lt;!--If I get around to it I want to have a brief coverage of trig and/or a few links to help people like me who didn't remember the school work--&gt;
The trig functions use the C Language mathematics functions, which are based in turn on Binary Floating Point mathematics, which use approximations of Real Numbers during calculation. OpenSCAD's math functions use the C++ 'double' type, inside Value.h/Value.cc, 

A good resource for the specifics of the C library math functions, such as valid inputs/output ranges, can be found at the Open Group website [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/math.h.html math.h] &amp; [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/acos.html acos]

=== cos ===

 for (i = [0:5]) {
  echo(360*i/6, sin(360*i/6)*80, cos(360*i/6)*80);
   translate([sin(360*i/6)*80, cos(360*i/6)*80, 0 ])
    cylinder(h = 200, r=10);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

   translate([tan(360*i/6)*80, 0, 0 ])
    cylinder(h = 200, r=10);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Mathematical '''two-argument atan''' function, taking y as its first argument. Returns the principal value of the arc tangent of y/x, expressed in degrees.  See: [[w:Atan2|atan2]]

== Other Mathematical Functions ==

=== abs ===
Mathematical '''absolute value''' function. Returns the positive value of a signed decimal number.

'''Usage examples:'''
 abs(-5.0);
 abs(0);
 abs(8.0);

'''Results:'''
 5.0
 0.0
 8.0

=== ceil ===
Mathematical '''ceiling''' function.  ceil(x) is the smallest integer not less than x.

See: [[w:Ceil_function|Ceil Function]]

=== concat ===
{{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

Return a vector containing the arguments.

Where an argument is a vector the elements of the vector are individually added to the result vector.
Strings are distinct from vectors in this case.

'''Usage examples:'''
 echo(concat(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;));          // produces ECHO: [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;]
 echo(concat([&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;],[&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;]));      // produces ECHO: [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;]
 echo(concat(1,2,3,4,5,6));                      // produces ECHO: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Vector of vectors
 echo(concat([ [1],[2] ], [ [3] ]));             // produces ECHO: [[1], [2], [3]]

Contrast with strings

 echo(concat([1,2,3],[4,5,6]));                   // produces ECHO: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 echo(concat(&quot;abc&quot;,&quot;def&quot;));                       // produces ECHO: [&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;def&quot;]
 echo(str(&quot;abc&quot;,&quot;def&quot;));                          // produces ECHO: &quot;abcdef&quot;

=== cross ===

Calculates the cross product of two vectors in 3D space. The result is a vector that is perpendicular to both of the input vectors.

Using invalid input parameters (e.g. vectors with a length different from 3 or other types) will produce an undefined result.

'''Usage examples:'''
 echo(cross([2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]));     // produces ECHO: [-3, 6, -3]
 echo(cross([2, 1, -3], [0, 4, 5]));    // produces ECHO: [17, -10, 8]
 echo(cross([2, 3, 4], &quot;5&quot;));           // produces ECHO: undef

=== exp ===
Mathematical '''exp''' function. Returns the base-e exponential function of x, which is the number e raised to the power x.  See: [[w:Exponent|Exponent]]

=== floor ===
Mathematical '''floor''' function.  floor(x) =  is the largest integer not greater than x 

See: [[w:Floor_function|Floor Function]]

 echo(floor(4.4),floor(-4.4));    // produces ECHO: 4, -5

=== ln ===
Mathematical '''natural logarithm'''.  See: [[w:Natural_logarithm|Natural logarithm]]

=== len ===
Mathematical '''length''' function.  Returns the length of an array, a vector or a string parameter.

'''Usage examples:'''
 str1=&quot;abcdef&quot;; len_str1=len(str1);
 echo(str1,len_str1);
 
 a=6; len_a=len(a);
 echo(a,len_a);
 
 array1=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]; len_array1=len(array1);
 echo(array1,len_array1);
 
 array2=[[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]]; len_array2=len(array2);
 echo(array2,len_array2);
 
 len_array2_2=len(array2[2]);
 echo(array2[2],len_array2_2);

'''Results:'''
 ECHO: &quot;abcdef&quot;, 6
 ECHO: 6, undef
 ECHO: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 8
 ECHO: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]], 4
 ECHO: [1, 0], 2



This function allows (e.g.) the parsing of an array, a vector or a string.

'''Usage examples:'''
 str2=&quot;4711&quot;;
 for (i=[0:len(str2)-1])
 	echo(str(&quot;digit &quot;,i+1,&quot;  :  &quot;,str2[i]));

'''Results:'''
 ECHO: &quot;digit 1  :  4&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;digit 2  :  7&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;digit 3  :  1&quot;
 ECHO: &quot;digit 4  :  1&quot;

Note that the len() function is not defined when a simple variable is passed as the parameter. 

This is useful when handling parameters to a module, similar to how shapes can be defined as a single number, or as an [x,y,z] vector; i.e. cube(5) or cube([5,5,5])

For example

 module doIt(size) {
 	if (len(size) == undef) {
 		// size is a number, use it for x,y &amp; z. (or could be undef)
 		do([size,size,size]);
 	} else { 
 		// size is a vector, (could be a string but that would be stupid)
 		do(size);
 	}
  }
  
 doIt(5);	// equivalent to [5,5,5]
 doIt([5,5,5]);	// similar to cube(5) v's cube([5,5,5])

=== log ===
Mathematical '''logarithm'''. See: [[w:Logarithm|Logarithm]]

=== lookup ===

Look up value in table, and linearly interpolate if there's no exact match.  The first argument is the value to look up.  The second is the lookup table -- a vector of key-value pairs. 

'''Parameters'''
; key : A lookup key
; &amp;lt;key,value&amp;gt; array : keys and values
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
'''Notes'''
&lt;br&gt; There is a bug where out-of-range keys will return the first value in the list.   Newer versions of Openscad should use the top or bottom end of the table as appropriate instead.
|'''Usage example:'''
* Will create a sort of 3D chart made out of cylinders of different height.
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
 function get_cylinder_h(p) = lookup(p, [
 		[ -200, 5 ],
 		[ -50, 20 ],
 		[ -20, 18 ],
 		[ +80, 25 ],
 		[ +150, 2 ]
 	]);
 
 for (i = [-100:5:+100]) {
 	// echo(i, get_cylinder_h(i));
 	translate([ i, 0, -30 ]) cylinder(r1 = 6, r2 = 2, h = get_cylinder_h(i)*3);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

  }
 }

 echo(pow(10,2)); // means 10^2 or 10*10
 // result: ECHO: 100
 
 echo(pow(10,3)); // means 10^3 or 10*10*10
 // result: ECHO: 1000
 
 echo(pow(125,1/3)); // means 125^(0.333...) which equals calculating the cube root of 125
 // result: ECHO: 5

=== rands ===
Random number generator.
Generates a constant vector of pseudo random numbers, much like an array. The numbers are doubles not integers.
When generating only one number, you still call it with variable[0]

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a '''list of country names''' in Tagalog.  Many countries (''bansâ'', similar to ''bangsa'' in Malay and Indonesian) have corresponding names in Tagalog, which are mostly derived from Spanish and spelled according to Tagalog spelling conventions, and which are pronounced as they would normally be in Spanish.  Some countries meanwhile have native Tagalog equivalents, and others are borrowed from English, but spelled according to Tagalog conventions and whose pronunciation would be similar to their Spanish counterparts.   Still other countries meanwhile don't have names in Tagalog, and as such use their English names.

Tagalog country names are not encountered colloquially, where English names are commonly used.  However, they are used in formal documents, correspondence, speech and literature written in Tagalog.

=== Scalar Arithmetical Operators ===

The scalar arithmetical operators take numbers as operands and produce
a new number.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|&amp;#43;
|add
|-
|&amp;#45;
|subtract
|-
|*
|multiply
|-
|/
|divide
|-
|%
|modulo
|}

The &quot;-&quot; can also be used as prefix operator to negate a number.

=== Relational Operators ===

All relational operator take numbers as operands and produce
a Boolean value. The equal and not-equal operators can also compare
Boolean values.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|&lt;
|less than
|-
|&lt;=
|less equal
|-
|==
|equal
|-
|!=
|not equal
|-
|&gt;=
|greater equal
|-
|&gt;
|greater than
|}

=== Logical Operators ===

All logical operators take Boolean values as operands and produce
a Boolean value.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|&amp;&amp;
|Logical AND
|-
|&amp;#124;&amp;#124;
|Logical OR
|-
|!
|Logical NOT
|-
|}

===Conditional Operator===

The &lt;tt&gt;?:&lt;/tt&gt; operator can be used to conditionally evaluate one or another expression.
It works like the &lt;tt&gt;?:&lt;/tt&gt; operator from the family of C-like programming languages.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;?&amp;nbsp;:
|Conditional operator
|}
{| width=&quot;75%&quot;
|'''Usage Example:'''
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a=1;
b=2;
c= a==b ? 4 : 5;
&lt;/source&gt;
If a equals b, then c is set to 4, else c is set to 5.
&lt;br&gt;
The part &quot;a==b&quot; must be something that evaluates to a boolean value.
|}

=== Vector-Number Operators ===

The vector-number operators take a vector and a number as operands and produce a new vector.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|*
|multiply all vector elements by number
|-
|/
|divide all vector elements by number
|}

=== Vector Operators ===

The vector operators take vectors as operands and produce a new vector.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|&amp;#43;
|add element-wise
|-
|&amp;#45;
|subtract element-wise
|}

The &quot;-&quot; can also be used as prefix operator to element-wise negate a vector.

=== Vector Dot-Product Operator ===

The vector dot-product operator takes two vectors as operands and produces a scalar.
{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot;
|*
| sum of vector element products
|}

=== Matrix Multiplication ===

Multiplying a matrix by a vector, vector by matrix and matrix by matrix 
{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot;
|*
| matrix/vector multiplication
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{incomplete}}

=== Special variables ===

All variables starting with a '$' are special variables. The semantic is
similar to the special variables in lisp: they have dynamic instead of
lexical scoping. 

What that means is that they're effectively automatically passed onward as arguments. Comparing a normal with a special variable:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
     normal=2;
     module doesnt_pass_it()
     {   echo(normal); }
     module normal_mod()
     {   doesnt_pass_it(); }
     normal_mod(normal=1); //Should echo 2
     
     $special=3; $another=5;
     module passes_it()
     {   echo($special, $another); }
     module special_mod()
     {   $another=6;
         passes_it(); 
     }
     special_mod($special=4); //Should echo 4,6
&lt;/source&gt;
So basically it is useful when you do not want to pass many parameters all the time.

====$fa, $fs and $fn====

The $fa, $fs and $fn special variables control the number of facets used to
generate an arc:

$fa is the minimum angle for a fragment. Even a huge circle does not have
more fragments than 360 divided by this number. The default value is 12 (i.e. 30 fragments
for a full circle). The minimum allowed value is 0.01. Any attempt to set a lower value will cause a warning.

$fs is the minimum size of a fragment. Because of this variable very small
circles have a smaller number of fragments than specified using $fa. The
default value is 2. The minimum allowed value is 0.01. Any attempt to set a lower value will cause a warning.

$fn is usually 0. When this variable has a value greater than zero, the
other two variables are ignored and full circle is rendered using this
number of fragments. The default value is 0.

When $fa and $fs are used to determine the number of fragments for a
circle, then OpenSCAD will never use less than 5 fragments.

This is the C code that calculates the number of fragments in a circle:

       int get_fragments_from_r(double r, double fn, double fs, double fa)
       {
              if (r &lt; GRID_FINE) return 3;
              if (fn &gt; 0.0) return (int)(fn &gt;= 3 ? fn : 3);
              return (int)ceil(fmax(fmin(360.0 / fa, r*2*M_PI / fs), 5));
       }

Spheres are first sliced into as many slices as the number of fragments being used
to render a circle of the sphere's radius, and then every slice is rendered
into as many fragments as are needed for the slice radius. You might have
recognized already that the pole of a sphere is usually a pentagon. This is
why.

The number of fragments for a cylinder is determined using the greater of
the two radii.

The method is also used when rendering circles and arcs from DXF files.

You can generate high resolution spheres by resetting the $fX values in
the instantiating module:

       $fs = 0.01;
       sphere(2);

or simply by passing the special variable as parameter:

       sphere(2, $fs = 0.01);

You can even scale the special variable instead of resetting it:

       sphere(2, $fs = $fs * 0.01);

====$t====

The $t variable is used for animation. If you enable the animation frame with view-&gt;animate and give a value for &quot;FPS&quot; and &quot;Steps&quot;, the &quot;Time&quot; field shows the current value of $t. With this information in mind, you can animate your design. The design is recompiled every 1/&quot;FPS&quot; seconds with $t incremented by 1/&quot;Steps&quot; for &quot;Steps&quot; times, ending at either $t=1 or $t=1-1/steps.  

If &quot;Dump Pictures&quot; is checked, then images will be created in the same directory as the .scad file, using the following $t values, and saved in the following files:
* $t=0/Steps filename=&quot;frame00001.png&quot;
* $t=1/Steps filename=&quot;frame00002.png
* $t=2/Steps filename=&quot;frame00003.png&quot;
* . . .
* $t=1-3/Steps filename=&quot;frame&lt;Steps-2&gt;.png&quot;
* $t=1-2/Steps filename=&quot;frame&lt;Steps-1&gt;.png&quot;
* $t=1-1/Steps filename=&quot;frame00000.png&quot;

Or, for other values of Steps, it follows this pattern:

* $t=0/Steps filename=&quot;frame00001.png&quot;
* $t=1/Steps filename=&quot;frame00002.png
* $t=2/Steps filename=&quot;frame00003.png&quot;
* . . .
* $t=1-3/Steps filename=&quot;frame&lt;Steps-2&gt;.png&quot;
* $t=1-2/Steps filename=&quot;frame&lt;Steps-1&gt;.png&quot;
* $t=1-1/Steps filename=&quot;frame&lt;Steps-0&gt;.png&quot;
* $t=1-0/Steps filename=&quot;frame00000.png&quot;

Which pattern it chooses appears to be an unpredictable, but consistent, function of Steps.  For example, when Steps=4, it follows the first pattern, and outputs a total of 4 files.  When Steps=3, it follows the second pattern, and also outputs 4 files.  It will always output either Steps or Steps+1 files, though it may not be predictable which.  When finished, it will wrap around and recreate each of the files, looping through and recreating them forever.

====$vpr, $vpt and $vpd ====

These contain the current viewport rotation and translation and camera distance - at the time of doing the rendering. Moving the viewport does not update them. During an animation they are updated for each frame.
*$vpr shows rotation
*$vpt shows translation (i.e. won't be affected by rotate and zoom)
*$vpd shows the camera distance {{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

Example
  cube([10, 10, $vpr[0] / 10]);
which makes the cube change size based on the view angle, if an animation loop is active (which does not need to use the $t variable)

You can also make bits of a complex model vanish as you change the view.

All three variables are writable but only assignments at the top-level of the main file will have an effect on the viewport. {{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

Example
  $vpr = [0, 0, $t * 360];
which allows a simple 360 degree rotation around the Z axis in animation mode.

The menu command ''Edit - Paste Viewport Rotation/Translation'' copies the current value of the viewport, but not the current $vpr or $vpt.

=== Echo Statements ===

This function prints the contents to the compilation window (aka Console).  Useful for debugging code. Also see the String function [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/String_Functions#str|str()]].

Numeric values are rounded to 5 significant digits.

The OpenSCAD console supports a subset of HTML markup language. See [http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.7/richtext-html-subset.html here] for details.

'''Usage examples:'''

 my_h=50;
 my_r=100;
 echo(&quot;This is a cylinder with h=&quot;, my_h, &quot; and r=&quot;, my_r);
 cylinder(h=my_h, r=my_r);
 //
 echo(&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Qt!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;);

Shows in the Console as
 ECHO: &quot;This is a cylinder with h=&quot;, 50, &quot; and r=&quot;, 100
 ECHO: &quot;&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Qt!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;

=== Render ===

Forces the generation of a mesh even in preview mode. Useful when the boolean operations become too slow to track.

Needs description.

'''Usage examples:'''

 render(convexity = 2) difference() {
  cube([20, 20, 150], center = true);
  translate([-10, -10, 0])
   cylinder(h = 80, r = 10, center = true);
  translate([-10, -10, +40])
   sphere(r = 10);
  translate([-10, -10, -40])
   sphere(r = 10);
 }

=== Offset ===

{{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

Offset allows moving polygon outlines outward or inward by a given amount.

'''Parameters'''

; delta : Double. Amount to offset the polygon. When negative, the polygon is offset inwards.

; join_type : String. Defines how the lines are joined. Possible values are &quot;bevel&quot;, &quot;round&quot; and &quot;miter&quot;. Defaults to &quot;miter&quot;.

{{multiple image
 | align = center
 | width = 350
 | footer = Result for different values of the join_type parameter. The black polygon is the input for the offset() operation.
 | image1 = OpenSCAD offset join-type out.svg
 | caption1 = Positive delta value
 | image2 = OpenSCAD offset join-type in.svg
 | caption2 = Negative delta value
 }}

: Note the effect of the miter_limit in the join_type = &quot;miter&quot;, positive delta example. The left top corner is beveled because a straight connection is longer than the limit given as miter_limit.

; miter_limit : Double. This is only valid with join_type = &quot;miter&quot;. Defines the limit where lines at a small angle are not joined with a sharp long edge anymore reverting to bevel style join.

'''Examples'''

[[File:OpenSCAD offset example.png|thumb|Example 1: Result.]]
 // Example 1
 
 linear_extrude(height = 60, twist = 90, slices = 60) {
   difference() {
     offset(delta = 10, join_type = &quot;round&quot;) {
       square(20, center = true);
     }
     offset(delta = 8, join_type = &quot;round&quot;) {
       square(20, center = true);
     }
   }
 }
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

=== Surface ===

Surface reads [[:w:Heightmap|Heightmap]] information from text or image files.

'''Parameters'''

; file : String. The path to the file containing the heightmap data.

; center : Boolean.  This determines the positioning of the generated object.  If true, object is centered in X- and Y-axis.  Otherwise, the object is placed in the positive quadrant.  Defaults to false.

; invert : Boolean. Inverts how the color values of imported images are translated into height values. This has no effect when importing text data files. Defaults to false. {{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

; convexity : Integer. The convexity parameter specifies the maximum number of front sides (back sides) a ray intersecting the object might penetrate. This parameter is only needed for correctly displaying the object in OpenCSG preview mode and has no effect on the final rendering.

==== Text file format ====

The format for text based heightmaps is a matrix of numbers that represent the height for a specific point. Rows are mapped to the Y-axis, columns to the X axis.
The numbers must be separated by spaces or tabs. Empty lines and lines starting with a # character are ignored.

==== Images ====

{{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

Currently only PNG images are supported. Alpha channel information of the image is ignored and the height for the pixel is determined by converting the color value to [[:w:Grayscale|Grayscale]] using the linear luminance for the sRGB color space (Y = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B). The gray scale values are scaled to be in the range 0 to 100.

==== Examples ====

'''Example 1:'''
 //surface.scad
 surface(file = &quot;surface.dat&quot;, center = true, convexity = 5);
 %translate([0,0,5])cube([10,10,10], center =true);

 #surface.dat
 10 9 8 7 6 5 5 5 5 5 
 9 8 7 6 6 4 3 2 1 0 
 8 7 6 6 4 3 2 1 0 0
 7 6 6 4 3 2 1 0 0 0
 6 6 4 3 2 1 1 0 0 0
 6 6 3 2 1 1 1 0 0 0
 6 6 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
 6 6 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Result:

[[File:Openscad_surface_example_x1.png]]

'''Example 2'''

  // example010.dat generated using octave:
  // d = (sin(1:0.2:10)' * cos(1:0.2:10)) * 10;
  // save(&quot;example010.dat&quot;, &quot;d&quot;);
  intersection() {
    surface(file = &quot;example010.dat&quot;, center = true, convexity = 5);
    rotate(45, [0, 0, 1]) surface(file = &quot;example010.dat&quot;, center = true, convexity = 5); 
  }

'''Example 3:'''

{{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

 // Example 3a
 scale([1, 1, 0.1])
   surface(file = &quot;smiley.png&quot;, center = true);

 // Example 3b
 scale([1, 1, 0.1])
   surface(file = &quot;smiley.png&quot;, center = true, invert = true);

=== Search ===

The search() function is a general-purpose function to find one or more (or all) occurrences of a value or list of values in a vector, string or more complex list-of-list construct.

==== Search Usage ====

:search( ''match_value'' , ''string_or_vector'' [, ''num_returns_per_match'' [, ''index_col_num'' ] ] );

==== Search Arguments ====

* '''match_value'''
:* Can be a single value or vector of values.
:* Strings are treated as vectors-of-characters to iterate over; the search function does '''not''' search for substrings.
:* '''Note:''' If ''match_value'' is a vector of strings, search will look for exact string matches.
::* See '''Example 9''' below.

* '''string_or_vector'''
:* The string or vector to search for matches.

* '''num_returns_per_match''' (default: 1)
:* By default, search only looks for one match per element of match_value to return as a list of indices
:* If num_returns_per_match &gt; 1, search returns a list of lists of up to num_returns_per_match index values for each element of match_value.
::* See '''Example 8''' below.
:* If num_returns_per_match = 0, search returns a list of lists of '''all''' matching index values for each element of match_value.
::* See '''Example 6''' below.

* '''index_col_num''' (default: 0)
:* When ''string_or_vector'' is a vector-of-vectors, multidimensional table or more complex list-of-lists construct, the match_value may not be found in the first (index_col_num=0) column.
:* See '''Example 5''' below for a simple usage example.

==== Search Usage Examples ====

:See '''example023.scad''' included with OpenSCAD for a renderable example.

 echo(v[search(&quot;D&quot;,v,1,0)[0]][1]);               // -&gt; 8

=== OpenSCAD Version ===

version() and version_num() will return OpenSCAD version number.
* The version() function will return the OpenSCAD version as a vector, e.g. [2011, 09, 23]
* The version_num() function will return the OpenSCAD version as a number, e.g. 20110923

=== parent_module(n) and $parent_modules ===

$parent_module contains the number of modules in the instantiation stack.
parent_module(i) returns the name of the module i levels above the current module in the instantiation stack.
The stack is independent of where the modules are defined. It's where they're instantiated that counts.
This can be used to e.g. build BOMs.

Example:

  module top() {
    children();
  }
  module middle() {
    children();
  }
  top() middle() echo(parent_module(0)); // prints &quot;middle&quot;
  top() middle() echo(parent_module(1)); // prints &quot;top&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Encoders ==

'''Encoders''' are devices that act on data to transform it in such a way that the data acquires some new characteristics. These characteristics can vary from reduction in length to inclusion of error correction properties to use of security measures. At the most basic level, encoders can be used to reduce the size of data. Consider the following block diagram : 

       ____
 A ---|    |
 B ---|    |-- X
 C ---|    |-- Y
      |____|


If out of ABCD only one is high at any given time, then we can only have the following possibilities for input : 000, 001, 010, 100. Thus we can make the internal circuit of the encoder in such a way that when it sees 000 it outputs 00, when it sees 001 it outputs 01, when it sees 010 it gives 10 and when it sees 100 it outputs 11


     __________
 ---| 000 | 00 |
 ---|-----|----|
 ---| 001 | 01 |
 ---|-----|----|
 ---| 010 | 10 |
 ---|-----|----|
 ---| 100 | 11 |
 ---|_____|____|



Thus we have effectively reduced the size of the data, by exploiting the fact that all possible combinations of input will never be provided at the input terminals.

The internal circuit of the encoder can be easily derived by using truth tables


     _____________________
 ---| A | B | C ||| X | Y |
 ---| 0 | 0 | 0 ||| 0 | 0 |
 ---| 0 | 0 | 1 ||| 0 | 1 |
 ---| 0 | 1 | 0 ||| 1 | 0 | 
 ---| 1 | 0 | 0 ||| 1 | 1 |
 ---|___|___|___|||___|___|


Clearly X  = A + B and Y = A + C

So the circuit diagram can be : 

 A ----------[ OR ]----------X
     |   B---[ OR ]
     |
     |-------[ OR ]----------Y
         C---[ OR ]
 

This scheme can be extended for n inputs.

This was a very basic encoder, it could act only on data when a single line was high. It is possible that multiple lines may be high, in that case one may use priority encoders which assign output based on priority, that is if two lines are high, for example A and C in the previous example, then a priority encoder will, based on a prior decision by the designer, decide to assign output to either C or A thereby assigning it a higher priority.

In some cases we don't want priority encoding, rather when faced with multiple signals, we wish to create a new code for that particular combination as well, and still obtain some reduction in size.

At other times we may wish to modify the incoming code in a manner that allows the receiver to detect any errors that may have crept in during transmission. These topics will be elaborated upon in appropriate topics.

I saw your comments about at the Linear Algebra.  I wanted to encourage you to also make comments on the discussion pages of the modules that you find too difficult, needing explanations in plain english, etc.  In addition to being more likely to be seen, it may be that someone can help you in your studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The history of AI has had some embarrassingly optimistic predictions, particularly in the early years. In short, AI researchers severely underestimated the difficulty of some of the problems. Though there was success with designing programs that could play chess, it turned out that recognizing the chess pieces in video was much more difficult.

Futurist Ray Kurzweil continues to publish optimistic predictions. He has popularized the term &quot;singularity&quot; as it applies to AI (though the term was coined by Vernor Vinge for this purpose.) The singularity is the point in time when Artificial Intelligence can automatically improve on itself faster than humans where previously able to. The reason it's called the singularity is because it is very difficult to know what will happen afterward, since the future will then depend on the decisions of beings more intelligent than we are.

Kurzweil's predictions are based on a number of observations about the exponential growth in certain fields, such as nanotechnology, computational power, genetic analysis, and accuracy of brain scanning. Very basically, his argument is as follows: Brain scanning technology is getting better at an exponential rate. Therefore, soon we will be able to scan entire brains at the level of detail necessary to understand everything, physically, we need to know to create a simulation of a brain in software. The exponential growth of computational power will allow future computers to be able to process all of this data. Having a brain in software will allow us to rapidly test and understand how intelligence works in human beings (as well as other animals.) It will then be a short time before we can improve on it.

Kurzweil predicts that the singularity will occur at approximately 2041.

      <comment>/* Hinged DNA */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">DNA does not always take the form of a double helix. It can often be found creating structures considered abnormal when compared to what is commonly considered DNA. Normally, DNA contains a B-form helix. Improper formation of base pairs can greatly affect DNA's structure and flexibility.

Single-stranded nucleic acids can form hairpins. Such formations can affect the transcription terminations in prokaryotes. With regard to double-stranded DNA, they can form something called cruciforms.

== Hairpins ==
Hairpin loops are formed by a fold in a single strand of DNA, causing several bases to remain unpaired before the strand loops back upon itself. A hairpin loop is only possible if the strand of DNA contains the complimentary bases in correct sequence to those that appear earlier in the strand. For example; if a DNA strand contained CCGT followed by several bases including ACGG, the strand is capable of creating a hairpin loop by folding back on itself.

Hairpin loops can occur in both DNA and RNA, though in RNA the thymine base is replaced by uracil. The number of bases in the loop itself is variable, though it never exists in the length of three bases, as the steric hindrance makes the configuration too unstable.

Here is an image example of hairpin DNA: 
(Image is of a Long-alpha hairpin)
[[File:PDB_2qoz_EBI.png]]

== Cruciforms ==
Cruciform DNA structure appears as several hairpin loops, creating a crucifix-like structure composed of DNA.

DNA structure is formed by incomplete exchange of the strands between the double-stranded helices.

Cruciform DNA 
Eukaryotic cells contain DNA-binding protein that can specifically recognize cruciform DNA. Interactions with ubiquitous protein plays a crucial role for the conformation of cruciform DNA.

An example of a DNA-binding Protein is Crp1p. This DNA-binding protein is found in the yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''

Image of the formation of Cruciform DNA can be found 
[http://www.utoronto.ca/medicalgenetics/Documents/publications/Cote%20and%20Lewis%20-%20Focus%20on%20Research.jpg here].

== Triple Helix ==
The triple helix form of DNA is similar to the double helix DNA except that it contains another oligonucleotide that hydrogen bonds to the bases that are already included in the double helix strands of DNA. 

'''Background'''&lt;br /&gt;
The triple-stranded DNA was a very common hypothesis in the 1950s when scientists were having trouble figuring out the true structure of DNA. Watson and Crick, Pauling and Corey all published a triple-helix model proposal. Watson and Crick found problems with the model. The problems were as follows:

# Negatively charged phosphates near the axis will repel each other, leaving the question as to how the three-chain structure would stay together. &lt;br /&gt;
# In a triple-helix model (specifically Pauling and Corey's model), some of the van der Waals distances appear to be too small.[http://www.zampwiki.com/?t=Triple-stranded_DNA 1]

For more information on Triple-stranded DNA see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-stranded DNA Triple-stranded DNA]


An image of the triple helix form can be found [http://employees.csbsju.edu/hjakubowski/classes/ch331/bind/triplehelixnew.gif here].

== Hinged DNA ==
Hinged DNA (H-DNA) is a triple helix structure that exists based on hydrogen bonds between DNA bases. The three strands base pair by Hoogsteen base pairing. Hoogsteeen base pairing is a variation of base-pairing in the nucleic acids such as the A-T pair or the G-C pair. The Hoogsteen base pair applies the &quot;N7 position of purine base and c6 amino group which bind the Waston-Crick fafce of pyrimidine base.&quot; More information on the Hoogsteen base pair can be found [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoogsteen_base_pair here.] It is also called H-DNA because of its dependence on hydrogen bonds. The H-DNA can be found in vitro or during recombination and also in DNA repair. 

An example of H-DNA can be found [http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/mirkin/images/Fig3.jpg here].

== G-Quadruplex ==
G-quadruplexes are a family of quadruple-stranded structures formed by a guanine-rich sequences of nucleic acids. Members of this family share a common square arrangement of four guanines centered around a monovalent cation and stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. The guanines may adopt either an anti or syn alignment about the glycosidic bond. The backbone strands of the g-tetrad can also adopt a variety of directionalities: all four strands may be oriented in the same direction, three strands are oriented in one direction while the fourth is in another direction, two adjacent strands can be oriented in one direction while the other two will be oriented in another direction, or each strand will have adjacent anti parallel neighbors. The sequence of amino acid that has the potential to form g-quadruplex is: GxNaGxNbGxNcGx, where x is the number of G residues and Na, Nb, and Nc are loops of different lengths. Furthermore, they can form in DNA, RNA, LNA, and PNA, and either be intramolecular, bimolecular and tetramolecular compounds. Their four stranded motifs create four grooves each with varying widths and depths. Their folding depends on many factors; DNA sequence, presence of ions, temperatures, and presence of various ligands. They are a special area of interest due to their biological implications specifically in telomeres and as contributors to gene regulation.


A shows a G-tetrad, B shows the Anti and Syn conformations of Guanine, C shows the various directionailities of the backbone strands, D shows the different types of loops 


Structure determination of G-quadruplex based on crystallography or solution NMR demonstrates significant deviations in conformation and loop geometry suggesting heterogeneity in strand topology and loop conformation of G-quadruplexes. Varying conformations can result in varying stability. Furthermore, studies of the various conformations reveal that the nature of the loop sequence and the formation of interactions between loops and the quadruplex core are important elements in controlling quadruplex topology and stability. For example, in examining the bindinging of quinacridine-based ligand to a G-quadruplex, interactions with the sides of the G-stack do not alter the topology but interaction with the loop sequence ended up altering the conformation of the loops. This hints at the notion that the loop sequences of the quadruplex are what actually moderate the binding affinity and specificity of the whole structure. 

The four-stranded structure with four grooves instead of the normal two found in typical DNA structure, provides a variety of surfaces for interactions with ligands. Aromatic compounds of various dimensions showed favorable interactions with the planer surfaces of terminal guanine tetrads. Intercalation between layers of G-tetrads does not occur, however because G-tetrads do not allow for bulky aromatic compounds to insert itself between layers of guanine. 

In eukaryotic telomeres, there exists repeats of g-rich sequences that can fold into g tetrads. It has been postulated that this structure plays an important role in cell aging and human diseases such as cancer, then making them targets to anticancer drugs.

== Overview ==

This page provides basic code for creating a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix  distance matrix] and running and plotting a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling  Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling] (NMDS) ordination. 

Read more about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination_(statistics)  Ordination] on Wikipedia.

This code relies on package vegan in R by [http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/  Jari Oksanen].

== Data ==

First, import data and load required libraries:
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
require(MASS)
require(vegan)
data(varespec)   # species data
data(varechem)   # environmental data
&lt;/source&gt;

== Distance matrix ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
bray &lt;- vegdist(varespec, method = &quot;bray&quot;)				# calculate a distance matrix

# There are many distance measure options for 'dist', 
# discoverable by running '?dist'. Common distance measures include:
       # 'bray' = Bray-Curtis
       # 'canb' = Canberra
       # 'euclidean' = Euclidean
&lt;/source&gt;

= Unconstrained Ordination =
== Displaying dissimilarity using NMDS ==

NMDS analysis and plotting: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
nmds &lt;- metaMDS(varespec, k = 2, 
          distance = 'bray', autotransform = FALSE) 	# semi-black box NMDS function

ordiplot(nmds, type = &quot;text&quot;)			      # Plot NMDS ordination
fit &lt;- envfit(nmds, varechem[ ,1:4])			   # Calculates environmental vectors
fit						        # Lists vector endpoint coordinates and r-squared values
plot(fit)						   # adds environmental vectors
# a linear representation of environmental variables is not always appropiate
# we could also add a smooth surface of the variable to the plot
ordisurf(nmds, varechem$N, add = TRUE, col = &quot;darkgreen&quot;)
nmds$stress                                             # stress value 
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Nmds.pdf|thumb|resulting nmds plot]]


In the metaMDS function, k is user-defined and relates to how easily the projection fits the dataframe when contrained to k dimensions. Conventional wisdom seems to suggest that stress should not exceed 10-12%. Stress is reduced by increasing the number of dimensions. However, increasing dimensionality might decrease the &quot;realism&quot; of a 2-dimensional plot of the first two NMDS axes.


We can also run a nMDS with 3 dimensions, fit environmental vectors and create a dynamic graph:
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
nmds3d &lt;- metaMDS(varespec, k = 3, 
  distance = 'bray', autotransform = FALSE)              # run nmds with 3 dimensions
nmds3d$stress                                            # stress drops
fit3d &lt;- envfit(nmds3d, varechem[ ,1:4], choices = 1:3)  # fit environmental vectors to 3d space
ordirgl(nmds3d, envfit = fit3d)                          # dynamic 3D graph
&lt;/source&gt;

== Running a principle component analysis (PCA) on environmental data ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
chem_pca &lt;- rda(varechem, scale = TRUE)    # Run PCA
biplot(chem_pca, scaling = 2)              # display biplot
&lt;/source&gt;

===Creating graphics with transparent backgrounds===
#Click on the INSERT Tab
#Click on either Picture or Clip Art
#Find the picture you want and bring it into the slide
#Click on the PICTURE TOOLS button at the top of the window
#Click the RECOLOR button in the ADJUST group
#Click on the Set Transparent color button at the bottom of the dialog box
#Click on the one color you want to be transparent
NOTE: if you want more than one color transparent you will need to do this in a photo editor and save the picture as a PNG, GIF, or TIFF

===Transitions===
Transitions are the motion of how to get to the current slide.  
#Go to the Animation tab
#Go to the TRANSITION TO THIS SLIDE group
#Choose a transition for how this slide will enter
#*if you want the presentation to run automatically then on the far right change the Advance Slide to Automatically and set the amount of time. 
#*If you want to have to click to get the slides to advance click the ON MOUSE CLICK check box
#You can also set the speed of the transition
#You can also add sounds for the transition

===Animations===
One of the more fun things you can do in PowerPoint is to make things move. One thing to keep in mind is for formal presentations, don't overdo the animations.  Let your audience focus on your content and not be distracted with all the motion.  If the motion adds to the meaning or content, then it belongs.  

&lt;p&gt; Under the Animation Tab you have several choices for how you will add animation to your show.  
*Text can be animated with these custom entrances to add flair:
**Whip
**Swish
**Flip
**Unfold
**Grow &amp; Turn
**Color Typewriter
**many others
*Pictures can be animated simply
**Fade
**Wipe
**Fly In
*Slide Transitions
**Fades
**Cuts
**Dissolves
**Wipes
**Uncovers
**Wheels
**Many variations of each

===Custom Animations===
Pictures can be animated more dramatically with Custom Animations.  To get there go to the: 
&lt;p&gt;Animations Tab - Animations Group - Custom Animation Button
&lt;p&gt;There are four main groups of animations: 
*Entrance
**Appear
**some other affect to enter onto the screen
*Emphasis
**spin either direction and any set number of degrees
**Many other motions
*Exit
**Disappear
**Many other ways to remove off the screen
*Motion Paths
**Draw Custom Path - Scribble
**Many other ways to move on the screen

&lt;p&gt;The best thing to do is take a graphic and try some of the animations out.

&lt;p&gt;Once you have several affects added to your picture or text you might want some of them to occur at the same time.  In the drop down under the Custom Animations you can set them to: 
*on Click
*with Previous
*after Previous
With these settings and the speed settings you can get many dramatic affects.

&lt;p&gt;Try to take a picture of a skier and have them fall down a hill by adding a spin and a motion path that occur with previous.

===Sounds===
Sounds are another way to add a special touch to a presentation. But here to you can go overboard.  Only add sounds that really need to be there for the effect you want.  

&lt;p&gt;To get to sounds go to: 
&lt;p&gt;Insert Tab - Media Clips Group - Sounds icon
&lt;p&gt;You can add sounds from the following sources: 
*Sounds from file
*Sound from the clip organizer
*Play CD Audio Track
*Record sound
&lt;p&gt;If you have a folder of Royalty Free sounds you can add any of them to your PowerPoint by browsing to it. If you use the clip organizer it is just like adding a clip art. If you play with the CD then you need to make sure the CD is in the CD player anytime you want to view the presentation. If you want to create something like a kids book where the book reads along with the kid, you can record your own sounds.  You must have a microphone hooked up for this option to work.  

&lt;p&gt; Once you have the sounds in the presentation they will appear in the Custom Animation list and you can set when in the presentation you want them to play.  You can set them to play automatically or after you click or after some other action.  You can also set it to repeat the sound, and to hide the sound icon during the presentation.

===Rehearsal Timing===
A finishing touch to a presentation is to have practiced your presentation and have the slide change automatically for you when you are ready for them.  This can be done easily with the rehearsal timings.  To get to this go to the: 
*Slide Show Tab - Set up Group - Rehearse Timings button
*Give your presentation as you would normally
*Press space bar as you need
*Re-play the slide show and it will keep the timings you just set.

==Project==
Create a mini movie on a school apropriate topic of your choosing.  
&lt;p&gt;Examples: 
*snowmobile safety
*chemistry lab safety
*Newtons laws of motion
*World War II
*Frogs in their natural habitat
*A video game prototype
Requirements:
#Custom animations on every page
#Slide transitions between every slide
#One slide needs to have a picture for a background
#Individual creativity
#Creating graphics with transparent backgrounds
#A Sound must be added to at least one slide for emphasis
Helpful hits to make this extrodinary:
*Use a tool such as Photoshop or Gimp to edit your graphics
*Use layers with some layers semi-transperant to make it look like you are behind glass or under water
*Use layers so you can go behind different items
*Bring in a CD to add music in the background
*Work with the custom animations and have several of them &quot;start with previous&quot;.  This works really well with a motion path and an emphasis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Proteins with new functions can be created through directed changes in DNA. In the classic genetic approach, mutations are generated randomly throughout the genome. Analysis of mutatants reveal which genes are altered and DNA sequencing identifies the exact changes. Now, utilizing recombinant DNA technology, specific mutations can be made in vitro. New genes can be constructed by three changes to the sequence: deletions, insertions, and substitutions.

==Deletions==
Deletions occur when one or multiple base pairs are cleaved from a DNA sequence. A specific deletion can be produced by cleaving a plasmid at two sites with a restriction enzyme which removes a large segment of DNA. A smaller deletion can be made by cutting a plasmid at a one site and the linear DNA can be digested by an exonuclease that removes nucleotides from both strands. T

Deletion is when a base pair is removed from the DNA sequence.  This causes the DNA strand to be shorter.

==Substitutions==
Single amino acid substitutions can be produced by oligonuleotide-directed mutagenesis. This mutation can be made if (1) a plasmid containing the gene or cDNA for the protein is obtained and (2) the base sequence around to site to be altered is known. If serine is to be changed to cystine, the code TCT needs to be changed to TGT, a point mutation. The key to this mutation is to prepare an oligonucleotide primer that is complementary to this region except that it contains TGT instead of TCT. The mismatch of one base pair out of 15 does not make a large difference. Replication of these DNA strands with the mutated primers leads to two kinds of plasmids, one with the original sequence and one with the mutated sequence.

A substitution occurs when one base pair is replaced with another.  There are three main effects of substitutions in DNA:  

1. The substituted base could encode a stop codon.  This will stop the DNA from producing the rest of the amino acids and could lead to a nonfunctioning protein that might be harmful to the biological system or damaging to the DNA. 

2. The new substituted base could encode a different amino-acid, which will make the DNA produce a different amino-acid than it was supposed to.

3. Silent Mutation- This is when the changed base still codes for the same amino acid.  These mutations are rarely harmful to the DNA or biological system.

==Insertions==
Insertions of a DNA sequence can be made using cassette mutagenesis. In this technique, plasmid DNA is cut with a pair of restriction enzymes to remove a short segment which can be replaced by a synthetic double stranded oligonucleotide.

{{BookCat}}

Insertions are the result of extra bases added into the DNA sequence.

==Frame Shifts==
This is caused by insertions and deletions.  Deletions will make the DNA sequence shorter, while insertions will extend the DNA sequence’s length.  Codons are encoded in groups of 3 bases.  A deletion or insertion of bases will shift the whole sequence, and the DNA could potentially encode a whole new set of amino-acids.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Fatty Wax''' ==

A wax is a simple lipid that is an ester of a long-chain alcohol and a fatty acid. The alcohol may be made up of 12-32 carbon atoms. 

These waxes can be found in nature as coatings on leaves and stems of plants, and prevents the plant from losing excessive amounts of water. Carnuba wax is found on the leaves of Brazilian palm trees and is used in floor and automobile waxes. Lanolin coats lamb's wool. Beeswax is secreted by bees to make cells for honey and eggs. Spermaceti wax is found in the head cavities and blubber of the sperm whale. 
Many of these waxes are used in ointments, hand creams, and cosmetics, which can be seen in the ingredients lists.

Paraffin wax which is used in some candles, is not based upon the ester functional group, but instead is a mixture of high molecular weight alkanes. Ear wax, on the other hand, is a mixture of phospholipids and esters of cholesterol.

The waxes with their component alcohols and fatty acids are listed below:

&lt;u&gt;Carnuba&lt;/u&gt;:

Alcohol- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH, Fatty Acid- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;COOH

&lt;u&gt;Beeswax&lt;/u&gt;:

Alcohol- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH, Fatty Acid- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;COOH

&lt;u&gt;Spermacetic&lt;/u&gt;:

Alcohol- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH, Fatty Acid- CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;COOH 


----

&lt;big&gt;'''Ester Synthesis:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Simple esters contain an organic acid and an alcohol. The ester functional group is of significance in the biochemical group of compounds called waxes, triglycerides, and phospholipids.
The simplified reaction reveals the process of breaking some bonds and forming the ester and the by product, water. It is as follows:
First, the -OH bond of the acid is broken as well as the -H bond of the alcohol. Both join to make HOH, a water molecule.
Secondly, the oxygen of the alcohol forms a bond to the acid at the carbon with the double bond oxygen. This forms the ester functional group.
Note that the long carbon chains do not participate in the reaction, but are just part of the final molecule.


----

&lt;big&gt;'''Lipstick:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Lipstick is a common form of fatty wax. It consists of a suspension of coloring agents in high molecular weight hydrocarbons, waxes, and/or fats. The color usually comes from a dye precipitated by a metal ion such as Fe (III), Ni(II), or Co(II) ions. An ingredients list on the lipstick might contain: dye (4-8%); castor oil, paraffin, or fats to dissolve dye (50%); lanolin (25%); carnauba and/or beeswax as a stiffening agent (36%); perfume (1.5%). The lipstick is made by first dispersing the dye in the castor oil. Then, the other waxes and lanolin are added as the mixture is heated and stirred. The molten waxes are then cast in a suitable form to harden.


&lt;big&gt;'''Eye Makeup:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Eye makeup is also another form of fatty wax. Eyebrow pencils are similar to lipstick but contain lamp black (carbon soot) as a black coloring agent. A different mixture of waxes may be used to give the desired melting point. Brown pencils are made by adding iron oxide (rust) as a pigment.
A water-resistant mascara has a mixture of waxes, fats, oils, and soap. Other coloring agents in addition to blacks and browns may be chromic oxide (dark green) and ultramarine (blue pigment of sodium and aluminum silicate).

      <comment>/* Soap */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Soap ==



Soap is a form of lipid which is a mixture of sodium salts of various naturally occurring fatty acids. When air bubbles are added to a molten soap, the density of the soap decreases thus making it float on water. A softer soap lather results when the fatty acid salt contains potassium rather than sodium. Soap is the product of a saponification or basic hydrolysis reaction of a fat or oil. Sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide is currently used to neutralize the fatty acid and convert it to the salt.

The basic hydrolysis reaction is as follows:
:Fat + NaOH → sodium salt of fatty acid + glycerol

This reaction occurs in two steps and the net effect is the broken ester bonds. The glycerol first turns back into an alcohol, then the fatty acid portion is turned into a salt due to the presence of the basic NaOH solution. The oxygen of the carboxyl group now has a negative charge which attracts the positive sodium ion.

==Structure==
Micelles are formed when a certain molecule are added with water. The molecule is fatty acids, phospholipids, or a salt of a fatty acid (soap). The molecule has a strong polar head and non-polar hydrocarbon tail. When this molecule is added to water, the non-polar tails associate each other in the center like a ball because their hydrophobic tails or “water hating” are not soluble in water. The polar heads of the molecule form a shell outside of the ball and interact with the water molecules. &lt;br&gt;


----

&lt;big&gt;'''Types of Soap:'''&lt;/big&gt; 

The unique properties of different soaps are based on the type of fatty acid and length of the carbon chain of the molecule. 
Tallow or animal fats give primarily sodium stearate (18 carbons)- a very hard, insoluble soap. 
Fatty acids with longer chains are even more insoluble. As a matter of fact, zinc stearate is used in talcum powders because it is water repellent.

Coconut oil is a source of lauric acid (12 carbons) which can be made into sodium laurate. This soap, on the other hand, is very soluble and will lather easily even in sea water.

Fatty acids with only 10 or fewer carbons are not used in soaps because they irritate the skin and have objectionable odors. 


----

&lt;big&gt;'''Cleansing Action of Soap:'''&lt;/big&gt;

The cleansing action of soap is determined by its amphipathic properties- polar and non-polar structures, as well as its solubility characteristics. The long hydrocarbon chain is non-polar and hydrophobic (repelled by water); and the &quot;salt&quot; end of the soap molecule is ionic and hydrophilic (water soluble).

&lt;u&gt;Monolayer:&lt;/u&gt; 
As soap is combined with water, the ionic-salt end of the soap molecule is attracted to the water molecules and consequently dissolves in it. The non-polar hydrocarbon end of the soap molecule is repelled by the water molecules. A drop or two of soap in water forms a monolayer on the water surface. The soap molecules &quot;stand up&quot; on the surface as the polar carboxyl salt end is attracted to the polar water. The non-polar hydrocarbon tails are repelled by the water, which makes them appear to stand up.

&lt;big&gt;'''Soap vs. Oil vs. Water:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Due to their opposite polarity, water by itself cannot penetrate grease or oil. However, when grease or oil (non-polar hydrocarbons) are mixed with a soap-water solution, the soap molecules work as a &quot;bridge&quot; between polar water molecules and non-polar oil molecules. Soap molecules are amphipathic and thus have both properties of non-polar and polar at opposite ends of the molecule.

The oil is a pure hydrocarbon so it is non-polar. The non-polar hydrocarbon tail of the soap dissolves into the oil. That leaves the polar carboxylate ion of the soap molecules are sticking out of the oil droplets, the surface of each oil droplet is negatively charged. As a result, the oil droplets repel each other and remain suspended in solution (this is called an emulsion) to be washed away by a stream of water. The outside of the droplet is also coated with a layer of water molecules. This is also similar to a micelle which works with the same principles- the center of the micelle would contain the oil.


----

&lt;big&gt;'''Effect of Hard Water:'''&lt;/big&gt;

When soap is used in &quot;hard&quot; water, it will be precipitated as a &quot;bath-tub ring&quot; by calcium or magnesium ions present in the &quot;hard&quot; water. The effects of &quot;hard&quot; water calcium or magnesium ions decrease with the addition of &quot;builders&quot;. The most common &quot;builder&quot; is sodium trimetaphosphate. The phosphates react with the calcium or magnesium ions thus keeping them in solution but away from the soap molecule. The soap molecule can then do its job without interference from calcium or magnesium ions. Other &quot;builders&quot; include sodium carbonate, borax, and sodium silicate, which are currently in detergents. 



----

&lt;big&gt;'''Shampoo:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Water is the primary ingredient in shampoo, making up 60-70% of its content. The ingredients in shampoo are most often biodegradable. Detergents are the next most abundant ingredients in shampoo. Detergents are surfactants that react with the surface in order to remove oil and dirt particles from the hair follicle. The insoluble portion aligns with the hair’s oil particles while the water soluble portion aligns on the outside, creating a micelle. Common detergents include ammonium laurel sulfate, sodium laurel sulfate, and sodium laurel ether sulfate. Sodium laurel ether sulphates are a popular ingredient in shampoos because of their biodegradability and ability to give a “foaming” effect. The sulphates are made from either natural or synthetic linear C12-C15 alcohols. Thickeners are then added in order to increase viscosity. Popular thickeners include sodium chloride and methylcellulose. Shampoo strips the hair of its sebum, which is required to protect the hair shaft. Therefore, shampoos must also contain an ingredient to replace the lost sebum. Silicones, polymers, and quaternary agents coat the hair and replace the lost sebum. Because shampoos consist of mostly water and organic compounds, preservatives such as parabens are added to prevent the growth of bacteria and maintain freshness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bacterial Transformation==
Bacterial Transformation is a basic technique that is commonly used in a molecular biological laboratory. The technique is performed by introducing a foreign plasmid into the bacteria and the bacteria is used to amplify the foreign DNA. Bacteria can replicate the foreign DNA if the foreign DNA has an origin of replication that its DNA polymerases can recognize. The bacteria will then replicate the foreign DNA along with its own. This new DNA strand can at times provide the organism with new trait(s) that can be identified after transformation.
===Role of Heat Shock in Transformation===
Heat Shock is subjecting a cell to a higher temperature than it is normally found in the organism. Heat Shock causes pores to form in the outer membrane which permits DNA to enter the cell. The heat source is then removed from the cell and the membrane reforms with the DNA inside

===Role of Electroporation in Transformation===
[[File:ELECTROPORATION.gif|thumb|foreign DNA inserts genes in eukaryote cells]]
The role of electroporation in transformation is the same as Heat Shock, though the method is different. In electroporation, an electric field is applied to the cell that has a significant increase in the electrical conductivity and permeability of the cell membrane which allows foreign DNA to enter the cell.
Bacteria also contain a cell wall made of peptidoglycan that are naturally porous and only act as a shell that protects the bacteria. If plasmids are mixed with bacteria, plasmids can be transferred into the cell after electroporation. The electric field in electroporation is created by appliances called electroporators.

===Role of Calcium Chloride in Transformation===
The addition of  Calcium Chloride produces calcium ions which help the cell membrane become more permeable to DNA plasmid. This method of disrupting the cell membrane using electronics is generally used in conjunction to heat shocking. In which drastic changes in temperature causes the membrane to be more porous, enabling a greater efficiency for the desired DNA segments to transform into the targeted bacteria. This method of competence is more effective when used with plasmid DNA than linear DNA since certain enzymes exist within the bacteria that readily degrade linear DNA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Overview=
Bacterial and viral genes are not the only sequences that can be introduced into a host. Eukaryotic genes can be introduced into bacteria to produce a desired protein product. It is also possible to introduce DNA into higher organisms which has lead to gene therapy. Although the manipulation of eukaryotic genes holds many possibilities and advantages, it is also a source of controversy.

==Cloning Eukaryotic DNA==
Most eukaryotic DNA are interspersed with introns and exons that interrupt genes and cannot be expressed by bacteria. This obstacle is overcome by utilizing DNA that is complementary to mRNA (mRNA splices introns). The key to forming complementary DNA is Reverse Transcription which synthesizes a DNA strand complementary to an RNA template. Complementary DNA for all mRNA that a cell contains can be made, inserted into vectors, and then inserted into bacteria (Such a collection is called a cDNA library). 

Complementary DNA molecules can be inserted into vectors that favor their efficient expression in hosts, called expression vectors. In order to maximize transcription, the cDNA is inserted into the vector near a promoter. Clones can be screened on the basis of their capacity to direct the synthesis of a foreign protein in bacteria.

==Recombinant DNA in Higher Organisms==
Bacteria lack the necessary enzymes to carry out posttranslational modifications. Thus, many eukaryotic genes can be correctly expressed only in eukaryotic host cells. Recombinant DNA molecules can be introduced into animal cells in several ways. First, foreign DNA molecules precipitated by calcium phosphate are taken up by animal cells. Another method involves microinjecting DNA into cells. A third method utilizes viruses, specifically retroviruses since they usually do not kill their hosts and becomes randomly incorporated into host chromosomal DNA, to introduce new genes into animal cells. 

'''Moloney murine leukemia virus''' accepts inserts as long as 6 kilobase pairs and some genes introduced by this vector are efficiently expressed.
'''Vaccinia virus''' is a large DNA containing virus that replicates in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells where it shuts down host cell protein synthesis.
'''Baculovirus''' infects insect cells which can be easily cultured.

==Plant Cell Modifications==


[[File:Electroporation.jpg|thumb|Electroporation]]

What is '''Electroporation'''? is the method used to introduce the foreign DNA into plant cells by helping polar molecules to insert into a host cell through the cell membranes.  The process is to initiate a large electric fields to make the plasma membranes permeable to the polar molecules that are allowing the molecules to pass through the cell.

1st: the cellulose wall is removed by adding cellulase to produce protoplast.

2nd: applied electric fulses to disturb the hydrophobic membrane and make its permeable to plasmid DNA to enter.

3rd: The cell wall is then allowed to reform.


'''Electroporation:'''Tumor-inducing plasmids (Ti plasmids) carry instructions for the switch to the tumor state. Ti plasmids can deliver foreign genes into some plant cells by integrating into itself into the genome of an infected plant cells (T-DNA). Foreign DNA can be introduced into plant cells by electroporation. The cellulose walls are removed which produces protoplasts. Electric pulses are then applied to a suspension of protoplasts and plasmid DNA. The high electric fields make membranes transiently permeable to large molecules, and the plasmid DNA molecules enter the cells. When the cell wall reforms, the plant cells become viable. 

'''Gene Guns:''' The most effective means of transforming plant cells fires microprojectiles at the target cells.

Genetically modified organisms create plants with beneficial characteristics such as the ability to grow in poor soils, resistance to climatic variation, resistance to pests, and nutritional fortification. However, their uses are highly controversial because of unknown side effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several single molecule DNA sequencing (SMDS) techniques under development, yet only single molecule sequencing by cyclic
synthesis is currently advanced to the point that sequence information is produced in a massively parallel way directly from single DNA molecules. This sequencing technology relies on the use of fluorescently labeled nucleotides by DNA polymerase into complementary strands of DNA that are immobilized to a surface. The individual DNA strands are separated by a few microns and can be monitored as independent entities. The fluorescent signal of each incorporated labeled nucleotide is then sequentially detected using fluorescent microscopy. Since each DNA molecule is sequenced separately, there is no need for synchronization between different molecules. Tens of millions of molecules can be  sequenced in parallel in single small reaction volume, and thus this method readily produces high through put sequencing at a minimal cost. Currently this technique produces short reading lengths, which make it suitable to re-sequence applications in which a reference sequence is given. A single reference genome can serve as a template for the thousands of genomes produced by the short DNA fragments. This data can be used to find rare mutations and genetic heterogeneity in multiple target environments with great accuracy, high rates and low cost. The ability to extract a massive amount of sequence information will equip cancer research with a powerful tool needed to defeat various genetic diseases. 

Single molecule sequencing is a goal that has been pursued for almost two decades as a possible candidate to replace the Sanger method of sequencing. DNA sequencing by cyclic synthesis (SBS) differs from the Sanger method, which relies on length separation of amplified DNA strands that terminate with a particular color according to the last base in the chain. Instead, in SBS the synthesis itself is followed by various methods, which monitor many reactions in parallel and thus accelerate sequencing rate and reduce cost. Out of all the cycle-extension approaches, single molecule sequencing has the highest sequence information density, i.e. the number of sequence reads per unit area.

Current Sanger sequencing methods require a large amount of DNA to be replicated and then each of the sequencing runs is performed on one sequence at the time, a lengthy and expensive route. The alternative that DNA sequencing by cyclic synthesis offers is the sequencing of millions of fragments in parallel, and in the case of SMDS by cyclic synthesis no duplication of the DNA is needed at all. This combination would not only make whole genome sequencing far cheaper, it would also make it a lot faster. This would allow for rapid sequencing of numerous genomes and generate useful statistical comparisons. 

The basic scheme of SMDS by cyclic synthesis is as follows:

1) DNA is sheared and cut into short fragments

2) These fragments are elongated by a common DNA tail

3) The DNA fragments are immobilized onto a glass surface that contains primers that match the common DNA tail.

4) All bound fragments are then sequenced in parallel by -

4a) Polymerase extension of one base with a fluorescently labeled nucleotide.

4b) Detection by TIRM of multiple fields of view to record incorporation events on tens of millions of DNA fragments.

4c) Removal of the dye molecule.

4d) Return to 4a with a different nucleotide.

5) The data of each sequence is compared to a known sequence and aligned with it.

6) Data analysis from this alignment reveals the sequence information in the target DNA. 

The sequencing of DNA using single molecule fluorescence calls for careful experimental design in order to be able to observe the incorporation of single nucleotides into the DNA template. The goal is to collect the sequence information from each molecule by itself. As multiple fields of view are imaged in order to monitor incorporations on millions of templates simultaneously, techniques that precisely monitor the position of the molecules should be addressed. The sequence information from each molecule should then be aligned to the reference sequence. For long enough sequences, it is possible to align the found sequences to the reference even if there is disagreement or ‘error’. This ‘error’ could come from either a real error in the sequencing, or from the data under analysis – i.e. the mutations, polymorphism or heterogeneity that the re-sequencing reveals. In order to have enough statistics to provide a meaningful picture of the DNA sequence, an over-sampling is required which averages out random error, and reveals the sequence content of the sample. As the amount of strands that are sequenced at the same time is enormous, this is not a strong limitation on the method.

SMDS by cyclic synthesis is a technique that minimizes cost and enhances throughput over current Sanger sequencing methods. The ability to sequence millions of bases in parallel at very high density and high data rates, without the constraint ofsynchronous incorporations, establishes this method as a viable option for massive DNA resequencing applications. Significant reductions in reagent use, combined with minimal sample preparation, contribute to lower the cost and time of the resequencing, as well as virtually eliminating the amplification biases. The microfluidic implementation of this method could reduce, even further, the cost of the reagents and of the device as a whole. Further, the use of Förster Resonant Energy Transfer as a local illumination source in single molecule sequencing by fluorescence is useful for reducing noise and false positive signals from unspecific binding of nucleotides, and is applicable in other situations where a tightly confined excitation light is desirable. The use of cleavable fluorescent markers substantially increases the read lengths in single molecule sequencing as steric interactions between adjacent dyes are eliminated. Further increase in read length is anticipated by optimizing reaction conditions and by choice of the DNA polymerase used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A. Introduction'''

One of the most significant contributions of Recombinant DNA technology is the ability to manipulate the DNA of microorganisms. Also, referred to as Recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology, this manipulation of DNA involves the insertion of DNA segments from various organisms into a different host (rDNA host). This is often practiced through the use of a vector which allows for the DNA  to replicate in the host cell producing a new manipulated microorganism. Thus, the practice of the manipulation of microorganisms has been the focus of hundreds of companies, laboratories, and even governmental agencies. The reason that the manipulation of DNA microorganisms is such a studied topic is the benefits it could provide on a economic level. Possible areas of the use of manipulated microbes include as a organism for degrading environmental contaminants, pesticides, providing protection for agricultural crops, in medicine, etc. The release of genetically engineered microorganisms (GEM) however has been a much disputed topic. The worries are the 
effects that would result from the addition of genetically altered microorganisms to the environment. The two main concerns are 1. host cells could contain pathogenic genes in the rDNA that was originally unknown which provides threats to all living organisms. 2. 
the altered organisms might have effects on the ecosystem especially in terms of evolution and providing an organism an advantage of another possibly altering such things as the nutrient cycle, energy flow, and ecosystem. This is the main reason that the addition of GEM to the environment (genetically engineered microorganisms) must be carefully studied and regulated. Research though therefore has been done therefore do identify genetically altered microorganisms in the environment led by three researchers from the University of Tennessee. 

'''B. Requirements for rDNA Environmental Monitoring'''

In order for a technique method/applied to observe and search for genetically engineered microorganisms in the environment, a series of questions must first be asked to determine if a method is valid and/or a realistic technique. 

1. It should be applicable under a wide variety of environmental conditions
2. It should be suitable for technical application in terms of its simplicity. 
3. It should be able to detect, identify and enumerate the GEMs
4. It should be sensitive and specific to detect a small population
5. It should be capable of differentiating the specific GEMS from the other organisms in the environment
6. It should be able to discriminate GEMS from other strains of the same species 
7. It should be efficient, cost effective, and time-economic. 

These methods reflect the rules determined by the three scientists from the University of Tennessee

'''C. Conventional Methods'''

I. Selective Plating and Enrichment Techniques 

The process of selective plating of microorganisms involves the presence of a selective media. The selective media can be made differential on basis of physical growth conditions (temperature, oxygen concentration) or constituents. In terms of detecting the rDNA of microorganisms, plating only selects for the rDNA host rather than a specific rDNA sequence. Complex media are used to accommodate the complexity of rDNA host which allows for the differentiation between the non recombinant strains. Furthermore, this technique is only considered a preliminary technique because it must be considered presumptive, which requires conformation for an rDNA to be present. 

II. Enumeration by the Most-Probable-Number (MPN) Method 

In this method, samples are first diluted to extinction and then viable cells are allowed to grow in tubes of appropriate medium.
Then, a probability theory is performed to determine the original density of the population. The medium used determines both selection or enrichment and a species growth and activity thus it is another method of differentiation. There are some drawbacks however to this method which includes the necessity to use a large number of dilutions and tubes in order for precision. 

III. Epifluorescence Count Technique

The technique involves concentrating the bacteria onto membrane filters, then staining the bacteria, and then counting the bacteria by microscopy. This technique know is not applied as much for GEM because of the fact that it lacks specificity like 
the other conventional techniques. 

Weaknesses of the Conventional Method

1.  weakness is that the technique lacks specificity. 2. technique require the growth of target organisms and consequently will underestimate or produce false-negative results if organisms are stressed at a immediate time of sampling. 3. there is no universal medium that allows growth of all potential host organisms within the sample. 

'''D. Developing Methods'''

I. Immunological Techniques-The technique involves the use of antibodies (either polyclonal and monoclonal antisera) providing 
a sensitive and specific technique for identifying GEM.  

II. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA)- This biochemical technique involves the use of a particular antibody that is used to find a specific antigen, or vice versa in which a particular antigen is used to detect a particular antibody. This process is sensitive and specific, which might reflect its value when locating GEM (genetically engineered microorganisms). 

III. Radioactive Markers-This technique involves the conjugation of some radioactive species, which allows for Genetically engineered microorganisms to be marked radioactively. The main drawback though is the cost and high amounts of radioactive use. 

IV. Fluorescent Markers- This technique also involves the use of a antibody that is conjugated to a fluorescent dye. The antibody is added to a sample of interest and therefore could be observed by fluorescence microscopy. 

V. Use of Plasmid Epidemiology and Restriction Profiles (DNA fingerprinting)-This technique is a method to study specific genetic engineered microorganisms by specifically studying the plasmid of the microorganisms. The plasmids are separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and studied by staining the gel by ethidium bromide and observing by ultraviolet light. 

VI. Use of Selectable Genotypic Markers-Two different markers can be used to study GEM

1. chromogenic markers

2. antibody or heavy resistance markers-many of these markers are found in plasmids or transposons which can be used to incorporate into bacterial chromosomes. 

The markers could be placed on either the plasmid or the chromosome of the microorganism. 

VII. Use of nucleic Acid Sequence Analysis

VIII. Nucleic Acid Hybridization Techniques

IX. DNA: DNA Colony Hybridization 

X. Southern Blot Hybridization 

XI. Nucleic Acid Hybridization with DNA Extracts

XII. DNA: RNA Hybridization 

XIII. Use of Biotinlyated Probes

Today the page [[Computer Programming/Language concepts]] was deleted
[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Computer+Programming%2FLanguage+concepts&amp;year=2009].
(What about [[Talk:Computer Programming/Language concepts]]?).
As far as I can see, it was deleted without discussion.
I'm not sure if this is connected to the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Computer Programming]] debate.

I think that &quot;language concepts&quot; seems like a reasonable name for part of a book on computer programming.
As far as I can tell, the content of that page was what [[Help:Etiquette#Votes for deletion]] calls &quot;a good faith effort to start something useful.&quot;
And so I think that page should be undeleted and perhaps listed on VfD.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 19:57, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

:I remember a vfd for the deletion of the complete book (that IIRC failed). Can you place here any information if the same person/admin executed the deletion or if it was a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; request. Have you contacted the executor of the action before requesting the undeletion (since this is not a reversal of a vfd). If so I've always been of the opinion that the status quo rules over bold edits and that consensus means no stated opposition (that makes the last change non consensual by your opposition to it)... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:47, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

:: Is that a requirement to get a page undeleted?
:: If so, ''please'' edit the top of this page to add that requirement of which I was previously unaware.
:: ''&quot;same person&quot;''? No. The links I already posted show that ( [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Computer+Programming%2FLanguage+concepts&amp;year=2009] ) Adrignola deleted the page, while ( [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Computer Programming]] ) darklama started the VfD on the whole [[Computer Programming]] book, which was closed as keep.
:: ''&quot;contacted&quot;'' ? Hang on ... OK, I've dropped a note at [[User talk:Adrignola]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 21:32, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

::: Starting a request for undeletion means that you are asking if any Wikibookiane opposes the undeletion (even people that weren't aware or have a real involvement with the issue, it can even promote band wagoning if the subject is volatile), for what I remembered (correctly by the above reply) there wasn't a vfd validating the deletion and so a it falls into personal judgment that only fits a be bold edit action (deletion, moving or any edit per default goes under this category, if no reaching of consensus validated the action). In this case you are left objecting to a administrative action (deletion) that can easily be reverted (if people are in good will) or you can even be persuaded to agree with the deletion. In this case you would have only to address that one single user opinion/view on the issue...
::: Making a disagreement more visible that it merits can be a barrier to reach an commonly accepted outcome. I think it can be more agreeable and simpler to wait and see if [[User:Adrignola]] agrees with the reversal or you decide to drop the request after he explains his reasons for the action before this process proceeds any further.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:01, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

'''This page was deleted on the 22 of June, not today. The VfD discussion closed on the 9 of July. This action was prior to closing.'''

A good deal of pages of [[Computer Programming]] have been merged with other books or moved into other books. The VfD ended as keep to allow for additional merging/moving or the development of the book further. This particular page only links to other books and did not have meaningful content at the time I deleted it. My goal at the time was to try to move/merge all the pages of [[Computer Programming]] and delete anything that did not have meaningful content. I somewhat agreed with Darklama's assessment of the book but did not want to delete the pages outright.  This page was, in my opinion, an exception.  You disagree (or maybe you'll agree upon viewing the page), so the page has been restored.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:32, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

This book was deleted back in 2006. I am guessing it was deleted because the &quot;content was: 'France in Revolution' (and the only contributor was '172.142.196.73)')&quot;.  This content was probably intended to link to [[A-level Ancient History/French Revolution]].  I could not find anther book on A-level history to merge this into, so thought it may make sense to restore the stub. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:03, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

:Not much content, really, but it's been restored.  What you see is what it had, with the addition of the modern categories of today. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:07, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

: '''Opposed'''. Keep this deleted. There is no content, just a single link that was changed a few times. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:48, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

:: Ok, there is really nothing to the book, I just wanted its subpage to end up somewhere it would be seen.  I moved the subpage to the [[French History]] book, which was missing a section on the french revolution.  This seems like a better place anyways, because I don't think the french revolution generally falls under ancient history. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:12, 29 July 2009 (UTC)
