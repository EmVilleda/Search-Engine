{{Redirect|Sandwich theorem|the result in measure theory|Ham sandwich theorem}}

In [[calculus]], the '''squeeze theorem''' (known also as the '''pinching theorem''', the '''sandwich theorem''', the '''sandwich rule''' and sometimes the '''squeeze lemma''') is a [[theorem]] regarding the [[limit (mathematics)|limit of a function]].

The squeeze theorem is a technical result that is very important in proofs in calculus and [[mathematical analysis]]. It is typically used to confirm the limit of a function via comparison with two other functions whose limits are known or easily computed. It was first used geometrically by the [[mathematician]]s [[Archimedes]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] in an effort to compute [[pi|π]], and was formulated in modern terms by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]].

In [[Italy]], [[China]], [[Chile]], [[Russia]], [[Poland]] and [[France]], the squeeze theorem is also known as the '''two [[carabinieri]] theorem''', '''two [[militsia|militsioner]] theorem''', '''[[sandwich]] theorem''', '''two [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] theorem''',  &quot;Double sided theorem&quot; or '''two policemen and a drunk theorem'''.  The story is that if two policemen are escorting a drunk prisoner between them, and both officers go to a cell, then (regardless of the path taken, and the fact that the prisoner may be wobbling about between the policemen) the prisoner must also end up in the cell.

== Statement ==
The squeeze theorem is formally stated as follows.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let ''I'' be an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] having the point ''a'' as a limit point.  Let ''f'', ''g'', and ''h'' be [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on ''I'', except possibly at ''a'' itself. Suppose that for every ''x'' in ''I'' not equal to ''a'', we have:

: &lt;math&gt;g(x) \leq f(x) \leq h(x) \, &lt;/math&gt;

and also suppose that:

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \lim_{x \to a} h(x) = L. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* The functions ''g'' and ''h'' are said to be [[upper bound|lower and upper bounds]] (respectively) of ''f''.
* Here ''a'' is ''not'' required to lie in the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of ''I''. Indeed, if ''a'' is an endpoint of ''I'', then the above limits are left- or right-hand limits.
* A similar statement holds for infinite intervals: for example, if ''I'' = (0, ∞), then the conclusion holds, taking the limits as ''x'' → ∞.

===Proof===
From the above hypotheses we have, taking the [[limit inferior]] and superior:
:&lt;math&gt;L=\lim_{x \to a} g(x)\leq \liminf_{x\to a}f(x)\leq\limsup_{x\to a}f(x)\leq \lim_{x \to a}h(x)=L,&lt;/math&gt;
so all the inequalities are indeed equalities, and the thesis immediately follows.

Another proof, using the (ε, δ) definition of limit, would be to prove that for all real ε &gt; 0 there exists a real δ &gt; 0 such that for all x with 0 &lt; |x − a | &lt; δ, we have -ε &lt;f(x) − L &lt; ε. Symbolically,

: &lt;math&gt; \forall \varepsilon &gt; 0\ \exists \ \delta &gt; 0 : \forall x\ (0 &lt; |x - a | &lt; \delta \ \Rightarrow \ - \varepsilon &lt; f(x) - L &lt; \varepsilon).&lt;/math&gt;.

As

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;

means that

: &lt;math&gt; \forall \varepsilon &gt; 0\ \exists \ \delta_1 &gt; 0 : \forall x\ (0 &lt; |x - a| &lt; \delta_1 \ \Rightarrow \ - \varepsilon &lt; g(x) - L &lt; \varepsilon).&lt;/math&gt; (1)

and 
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} h(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;

means that

: &lt;math&gt; \forall \varepsilon &gt; 0\ \exists \ \delta_2 &gt; 0 : \forall x\ (0 &lt; |x - a | &lt; \delta_2\ \Rightarrow \ - \varepsilon &lt; h(x) - L &lt; \varepsilon).&lt;/math&gt;, (2)

then we have

: &lt;math&gt;g(x) \leq f(x) \leq h(x) \, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;g(x) - L\leq f(x) - L\leq h(x) - L\, &lt;/math&gt;

We can choose &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt;; ''e.g.'', by choosing &lt;math&gt;\delta:=\frac{1}{2}\min\left\{\delta_1,\delta_2\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, if &lt;math&gt;|x - a|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, combining (1) and (2), we have

: &lt;math&gt; - \varepsilon &lt; g(x) - L\leq f(x) - L\leq h(x) - L\ &lt; \varepsilon, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; - \varepsilon &lt; f(x) - L &lt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;,

which completes the proof.  &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

=== First example ===

[[File:Squeeze theorem example.svg|thumb|right|250px|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;sin(1/''x'') being squeezed in the limit as x goes to 0]]

The limit

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0}x^2 \sin(\tfrac{1}{x})&lt;/math&gt;

cannot be ascertained through the limit law

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a}(f(x)\cdot g(x)) = 
\lim_{x \to a}f(x)\cdot \lim_{x \to a}g(x),&lt;/math&gt;

because

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}\sin(\tfrac{1}{x})&lt;/math&gt;

does not exist.

However, by the definition of the [[sine function]],

: &lt;math&gt;-1 \le \sin(\tfrac{1}{x}) \le 1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that

: &lt;math&gt;-x^2 \le x^2 \sin(\tfrac{1}{x}) \le x^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}-x^2 = \lim_{x\to 0}x^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, by the squeeze theorem, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0} x^2 \sin(\tfrac{1}{x})&lt;/math&gt; must also be 0.

=== Second example ===

Probably the most well-known examples of finding a limit by squeezing are the proofs of the equalities

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} =1, \\[10pt]
&amp; \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x} = 0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first follows by means of the squeeze theorem from the fact that

: &lt;math&gt; \cos x &lt; \frac{\sin x}{x} &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;

for ''x'' close enough, but not equal to 0.

These two limits are used in proofs of the fact that the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function.  That fact is relied on in other proofs of derivatives of trigonometric functions.

=== Third example ===

It is possible to show that

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{d\theta} \tan\theta = \sec^2\theta &lt;/math&gt;

by squeezing, as follows.

[[File:Tangent.squeeze.svg|thumb|500px|right]]

In the illustration at right, the area of the smaller of the two shaded sectors of the circle is

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\sec^2\theta\,\Delta\theta}{2}, &lt;/math&gt;

since the radius is sec&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;'' and the arc on the [[unit circle]] has length&amp;nbsp;Δ''&amp;theta;''.  Similarly the area of the larger of the two shaded sectors is

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\sec^2(\theta + \Delta\theta)\,\Delta\theta}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

What is squeezed between them is the triangle whose base is the vertical segment whose endpoints are the two dots.  The length of the base of the triangle is&amp;nbsp;tan(''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''&amp;theta;'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;tan(''&amp;theta;''), and the height is&amp;nbsp;1.  The area of the triangle is therefore

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\tan(\theta + \Delta\theta) - \tan(\theta)}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

From the inequalities

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\sec^2\theta\,\Delta\theta}{2} \le \frac{\tan(\theta + \Delta\theta) - \tan(\theta)}{2} \le \frac{\sec^2(\theta + \Delta\theta)\,\Delta\theta}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

we deduce that

: &lt;math&gt; \sec^2\theta \le \frac{\tan(\theta + \Delta\theta) - \tan(\theta)}{\Delta\theta} \le \sec^2(\theta + \Delta\theta),&lt;/math&gt;

provided&amp;nbsp;Δ''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and the inequalities are reversed if&amp;nbsp;Δ''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.  Since the first and third expressions approach sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;theta;'' as Δ''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0, and the middle expression approaches (''d''/''d&amp;theta;'')&amp;nbsp;tan&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;'', the desired result follows.

=== Fourth example ===

The squeeze theorem can still be used in multivariable calculus but the lower (and upper functions) must be below (and above) the target function not just along a path but around the entire neighborhood of the point of interest and it only works if the function really does have a limit there. It can, therefore, be used to prove that a function has a limit at a point, but it can never be used to prove that a function does not have a limit at a point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 15.2 Limits and Continuity|pages=909–910|title=Multivariable Calculus|year=2008|last1=Stewart|first1=James|authorlink1=James_Stewart_(mathematician)|edition=6th|isbn=0495011630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{(x,y) \to (0, 0)} \frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

cannot be found by taking any number of limits along paths that pass through the point, but since

: &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2} \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;-\left | y \right \vert \leq y \leq \left | y \right \vert &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;-\left | y \right \vert \leq \frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2} \leq \left | y \right \vert &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{(x,y) \to (0, 0)} -\left | y \right \vert = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{(x,y) \to (0, 0)} \left |y \right \vert = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0  \leq  \lim_{(x,y) \to (0, 0)} \frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2}  \leq  0&lt;/math&gt;

therefore, by the squeeze theorem,

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{(x,y) \to (0, 0)} \frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

As the positive [[integer]] ''n'' becomes larger and larger, the value ''n''&amp;nbsp;sin(1/''n'') becomes arbitrarily close to 1. We say that &quot;the limit of the sequence ''n''&amp;nbsp;[[sine|sin]](1/''n'') equals&amp;nbsp;1.&quot;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The '''[[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]]''' &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is, intuitively, the unique number or point ''L'' (if it  exists) such that the terms of the sequence become arbitrarily close to ''L'' for &quot;large&quot; values of ''n''. If the limit exists, then we say that the sequence is '''convergent''' and that it '''converges to L'''.

Convergence of sequences is a fundamental notion in [[mathematical analysis]], which has been studied since ancient times.

== Formal definition ==
* For a sequence of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\left( x_n:n\in \mathbb{N}\right)\;&lt;/math&gt;

:A real number ''L'' is said to be '''the limit''' of the sequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, written

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n=L, &lt;/math&gt;

:if and only if for every real number &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; such that for every natural number &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;|x_n-L|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.


* As a generalization of this, for a sequence of points &lt;math&gt;\left(x_n:n\in \mathbb{N}\right)\;&lt;/math&gt; in a [[topological space]] ''T'':

:An element {{nowrap|''L'' &amp;isin; ''T''}} is said to be '''a limit''' of this sequence if and only if for every [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] ''S'' of ''L'' there is a natural number ''N'' such that {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''S''}} for all {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ ''N''}}. In this generality a sequence may admit more than one limit, but if ''T'' is a [[Hausdorff space]], then each sequence has at most one limit. When a unique limit ''L'' exists, it may be written

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = L.&lt;/math&gt;

If a sequence has a limit, we say the sequence is '''convergent''', and that the sequence '''converges''' to the limit.  Otherwise, the sequence is '''divergent''' (see also [[oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]]).

A '''null sequence''' is a sequence that converges to 0.
===Hyperreal definition===
A sequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to ''L'' if for every infinite [[hypernatural]] ''H'', the term ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt; is infinitely close to ''L'', i.e., the difference  ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt; - ''L'' is [[infinitesimal]].  Equivalently, ''L'' is the [[standard part]] of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; L = {\rm st}(x_H)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, the limit can be defined by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n= {\rm st}(x_H),&lt;/math&gt;
where the limit exists if and only if the righthand side is independent of the choice of an infinite ''H''.

=== Comments ===
The definition means that eventually all elements of the sequence get as close as we want to the limit. (The condition that the elements become arbitrarily  close to all of the following elements does ''not'', in general, imply the sequence has a limit. See [[Cauchy sequence]]).

A sequence of real numbers may tend to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, compare [[Limit_of_a_function#Limit_of_a_function_at_infinity|infinite limits]]. Even though this can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

such a sequence is called divergent, unless we explicitly consider it a sequence in the [[affinely extended real number system]] or (in the first case only) the [[real projective line]]. In the latter cases the sequence has a limit (in the space itself), so could be called convergent, but when using this term here, care should be taken that this does not cause confusion.

The limit of a sequence of points &lt;math&gt;\left(x_n:n\in \mathbb{N}\right)\;&lt;/math&gt; in a topological space ''T'' is a special case of the [[Limit_of_a_function#Functions_on_topological_spaces|limit of a function]]: the domain is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; in the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \cup \lbrace +\infty \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; with the [[induced topology]] of the [[affinely extended real number system]], the range is ''T'', and the function argument ''n'' tends to +∞, which in this space is a [[limit point]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
* The sequence 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, ...  is oscillatory.
* The [[Series (mathematics)|series]] with partial sums 1/2, 1/2 + 1/4, 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8, 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16, ... converges with limit 1. This is an example of an [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]].
* If ''a'' is a real number with [[absolute value]] |'' a ''| &lt; 1, then the sequence ''a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has limit 0. If 0 &lt; ''a'', then the sequence ''a''&lt;sup&gt;1/''n''&lt;/sup&gt; has limit 1.

Also:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n^p} = 0 \hbox{ if } p &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a^n = 0 \hbox{ if } |a| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} n^{\frac{1}{n}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a^{\frac{1}{n}} = 1 \hbox{ if } a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties ==
Consider the following function: ''f''('' x '') = ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' if '' n-1 ''&amp;lt;'' x '' ≤ '' n''.  Then the limit of the sequence of ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is just the [[limit of a function|limit]] of ''f''('' x'') at infinity.

A [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'', defined on a [[first-countable space]], is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] if and only if it is compatible with limits in that (''f''(''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')) converges to ''f''(''L'') given that (''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') converges to ''L'', ''i.e.''
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=L&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}f(x_n)=f(L)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that this equivalence does ''not'' hold in general for spaces which are not first-countable.

Compare the basic property (or definition):
:''f'' is continuous at ''x'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to L}f(x)=f(L)&lt;/math&gt;

A ''[[subsequence]]'' of the sequence (''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is a sequence of the form (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''a''(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt;) where the ''a''(''n'') are natural numbers with ''a''(''n'') &lt; ''a''(''n''+1) for all ''n''. Intuitively, a subsequence omits some elements of the original sequence. A sequence is convergent if and only if all of its subsequences converge towards the same limit.

Every convergent sequence in a [[metric space]] is a [[Cauchy sequence]] and hence [[metric space|bounded]]. A bounded [[monotonic]] sequence of real numbers is necessarily convergent: this is sometimes called the fundamental theorem of analysis. More generally, every Cauchy sequence of real numbers has a limit, or short: the real numbers are [[completeness (topology)|complete]].

A sequence of real numbers is convergent if and only if its [[limit superior and limit inferior]] coincide and are both finite.

The algebraic operations are continuous everywhere (except for division around zero divisor); thus, given
:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{n \to \infty}x_n = L_1
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
\lim_{n \to \infty}y_n = L_2
&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{n \to \infty}(x_n+y_n) = L_1 + L_2
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{n \to \infty}(x_ny_n) = L_1L_2
&lt;/math&gt;

and (if ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and  ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are non-zero)

:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{n \to \infty}(x_n/y_n) = L_1/L_2
&lt;/math&gt;

These rules are also valid for infinite limits using the rules
* ''q'' + ∞ = ∞ for ''q'' ≠ -∞
* ''q'' &amp;times; ∞ = ∞ if ''q'' &gt; 0
* ''q'' &amp;times; ∞ = -∞ if ''q'' &lt; 0
* ''q'' / ∞ = 0 if ''q'' ≠ ± ∞

(see [[extended real number line]]).

==History==
The Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] is famous for formulating [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes that involve limiting processes]].

[[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]], [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] and [[Archimedes]] developed the [[method of exhaustion]], which uses an infinite sequence of approximations to determine an area or a volume. Archimedes succeeded in summing what is now called a [[geometric series]].

[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] dealt with series in his works on ''Analysis with infinite series'' (written in 1669, circulated in manuscript, published in 1711), ''Method of fluxions and infinite series'' (written in 1671, published in English translation in 1736, Latin original published much later) and ''Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum'' (written in 1693, published in 1704 as an Appendix to his ''Optiks''). In the latter work, Newton considers the binomial expansion of (''x''+''o'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; which he then linearizes by ''taking limits'' (letting ''o''→0).

In the 18th century, [[mathematician]]s like [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] succeeded in summing some ''divergent'' series by stopping at the right moment; they did not much care whether a limit existed, as long as it could be calculated. At the end of the century, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] in his ''Théorie des fonctions analytiques'' (1797) opined that the lack of rigour precluded further development in calculus. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in his etude of [[hypergeometric series]] (1813) for the first time rigorously investigated under which conditions a series converged to a limit.

The modern definition of a limit (for any ε there exists an index ''N'' so that ...) was given independently by [[Bernhard Bolzano]] (''Der binomische Lehrsatz'', Prague 1816, little noticed at the time) and by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] in his ''Cours d'analyse'' (1821).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Calculus}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''continuous function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] for which, intuitively, small changes in the input result in small changes in the output. Otherwise, a function is said to be '''discontinuous'''. A continuous function with a continuous [[inverse function]] is called '''bicontinuous'''. An intuitive though imprecise (and inexact) idea of continuity is given by the common statement that a continuous function is a function whose graph can be drawn without lifting the chalk from the blackboard.  

Continuity of functions is one of the core concepts of [[topology]], which is treated in full generality in a [[continuous function (topology)|more advanced article]]. This introductory article focuses on the special case where the inputs and outputs of functions are [[real number]]s. In addition, this article discusses the definition for the more general case of functions between two [[metric space]]s. In [[order theory]], especially in [[domain theory]], one considers a notion of continuity known as [[Scott continuity]].

As an example, consider the function ''h''(''t'') which describes the [[height]] of a growing flower at time ''t''. This function is continuous.  In fact, there is a dictum of [[classical physics]] which states that ''in nature everything is continuous''.  By contrast, if ''M''(''t'') denotes the amount of money in a bank account at time ''t'', then the function jumps whenever money is deposited or withdrawn, so the function ''M''(''t'') is discontinuous.

== Real-valued continuous functions ==
Suppose we have a function that maps [[real number]]s to real numbers and whose [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] is some [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], like the functions ''h'' and ''M'' above.  Such a function can be represented by a [[graph of a function|graph]] in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]]; the function is continuous if, roughly speaking, the graph is a single unbroken [[curve]] with no &quot;holes&quot; or &quot;jumps&quot;.

To be more precise, we say that the function ''f'' is continuous at some [[point (geometry)|point]] ''c'' when the following two requirements are satisfied:
* ''f''(''c'') must be defined (i.e. ''c'' must be an element of the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of ''f'').
* The [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of ''f''(''x'') as ''x'' approaches ''c'' must exist and be equal to ''f''(''c'').  (If the point ''c'' in the domain of ''f'' is not a [[limit point]] of the domain, then this condition is [[vacuous truth|vacuously true]], since ''x'' cannot approach ''c''.  Thus, for example, every function whose domain is the set of all integers is continuous, merely for lack of opportunity to be otherwise.  However, one does not usually talk about continuous functions in this setting.) 

We call the function '''everywhere continuous''', or simply '''continuous''', if it is continuous at every point of its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]].  More generally, we say that a function is continuous on some [[subset]] of its domain if it is continuous at every point of that subset.  If we simply say that a function is continuous, we usually mean that it is continuous for all real numbers.

The notation ''C''(Ω) or ''C''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) is sometimes used to denote the set of all continuous functions with domain Ω. Similarly, ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) is used to denote the set of differentiable functions whose derivative is continuous, ''C''²(Ω) for the twice-differentiable functions whose second derivative is continuous, and so on. In the field of computer graphics, these three levels are sometimes called ''g0'' (continuity of position), ''g1'' (continuity of tangency), and ''g2'' (continuity of curvature). The notation ''C''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'', &amp;alpha;)&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) occurs in the definition of a more subtle concept, that of [[Hölder continuity]].

=== Cauchy definition (epsilon-delta) ===
Without resorting to limits, one can define continuity of real functions as follows.

Again consider a function ''f'' that maps a set of [[real numbers]] to another set of real numbers, and suppose ''c'' is an element of the domain of ''f''. The function ''f'' is said to be continuous at the point ''c'' if the following holds: For any number &amp;epsilon; &amp;gt; 0, however small, there exists some number &amp;delta; &amp;gt; 0 such that for all ''x'' in the domain with ''c'' &amp;minus; &amp;delta; &amp;lt; ''x'' &amp;lt; ''c'' + &amp;delta;, the value of ''f''(''x'') satisfies 
:&lt;math&gt; f(c) - \varepsilon &lt; f(x) &lt; f(c) + \varepsilon.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively written: Given subsets ''I'', ''D'' of '''R''', continuity of ''f'' : ''I'' &amp;rarr; ''D'' at ''c'' &amp;isin; ''I'' means that for all &amp;epsilon; &amp;gt; 0 there exists a &amp;delta; &amp;gt; 0 such that ''x'' &amp;isin; I and |&amp;thinsp;''x'' &amp;minus; ''c''&amp;thinsp;| &amp;lt; &amp;delta; implies
:&lt;math&gt;| x - c | &lt; \delta \Rightarrow | f(x) - f(c) | &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

This &quot;epsilon-delta definition&quot; of continuity was first given by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]].

More intuitively, we can say that if we want to get all the ''f''(''x'') values to stay in some small [[topological neighbourhood|neighborhood]] around ''f''(''c''), we simply need to choose a small enough neighborhood for the ''x'' values around ''c'', and we can do that no matter how small the ''f''(''x'') neighborhood is; ''f'' is then continuous at ''c''.

=== Heine definition of continuity ===
The following definition of continuity is due to [[Eduard Heine|Heine]].

:A real function ''f'' is continuous if for any [[sequence]] (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) such that
::&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} x_n=x_0,&lt;/math&gt; 
:it holds that
::&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} f(x_n)=f(x_0).&lt;/math&gt;
:(We assume that all points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; belong to the domain of ''f''.)

One can say, briefly, that a function is continuous if and only if it preserves limits.

Cauchy's and Heine's definitions of continuity are equivalent on the reals. The usual (easier) proof makes use of the [[axiom of choice]], but in the case of global continuity of real functions it was proved by [[Wacław Sierpiński]] that the axiom of choice is not actually needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Heine continuity implies Cauchy continuity without the Axiom of Choice|work=Apronus.com|url=http://www.apronus.com/math/cauchyheine.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more general setting of topological spaces, the concept analogous to Heine definition of continuity is called ''sequential continuity''. In general, sequential continuity is not equivalent to the analogue of Cauchy continuity, which is just called ''continuity'' (see [[continuity (topology)]] for details).

=== Examples ===
* All [[polynomial|polynomial function]]s are continuous.
* If a function has a domain which is not an interval, the notion of a continuous function as one whose graph you can draw without taking your pencil off the paper is not quite correct.  Consider the functions ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'' and ''g''(''x'') = (sin&amp;nbsp;''x'')/''x''.  Neither function is defined at ''x'' = 0, so each has domain '''R''' \ {0} of [[real numbers]] except 0, and each function is continuous.  The question of continuity at ''x'' = 0 does not arise, since it is not in the domain.  The function ''f'' cannot be extended to a continuous function whose domain is '''R''', since no matter what value is assigned at 0, the resulting function will not be continuous.  On the other hand, since the limit of ''g'' at 0 is 1, ''g'' can be extended continuously to '''R''' by defining its value at 0 to be 1.
* The [[rational function]]s, [[exponential function]]s, [[logarithm]]s, [[square root]] function, [[trigonometric function]]s and [[absolute value]] function are continuous.
* An example of a discontinuous function is the function ''f'' defined by ''f''(''x'') = 1 if ''x'' &gt; 0, ''f''(''x'') = 0 if ''x'' ≤ 0. Pick for instance ε = &amp;frac12;. There is no δ-neighborhood around ''x'' = 0 that will force all the ''f''(''x'') values to be within ε of ''f''(0). Intuitively we can think of this type of discontinuity as a sudden jump in function values.
* Another example of a discontinuous function is the [[sign function]].
* A more complicated example of a discontinuous function is [[Thomae's function]].
* The function 
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{cases}
  0\mbox{ if }x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}\\
  x\mbox{ if }x \in \mathbb{Q}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; 
:is continuous at only one point, namely ''x'' = 0.

=== Facts about continuous functions ===
If two functions ''f'' and ''g'' are continuous, then ''f'' + ''g'' and ''fg'' are continuous. If ''g''(''x'') ≠ 0 for all ''x'' in the domain, then ''f''/''g'' is also continuous. 

The [[Function composition|composition]] ''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g'' of two continuous functions is continuous.

If a function is [[derivative|differentiable]] at some point ''c'' of its domain, then it is also continuous at ''c''. The converse is not true: a function that's continuous at ''c'' need not be differentiable there. Consider for instance the [[absolute value]] function at ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

====Intermediate value theorem====
[[Image:ExtremeValueTheorem.png|thumb|A continuous function on a closed interval has a maximum (green here) and a minimum (blue), and assumes all values between them.]]
The [[intermediate value theorem]] is an [[existence theorem]], based on the real number property of [[Real_number#Completeness|completeness]], and states: 

: If the real-valued function ''f'' is continuous on the [[interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] [''a'', ''b''] and ''k'' is some number between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b''), then there is some number ''c'' in [''a'', ''b''] such that ''f''(''c'') = ''k''.

For example, if a child grows from 1[[metre|m]] to 1.5m between the ages of 2 years and 6 years, then, at some time between 2 years and 6 years of age, the child's height must have been 1.25m. 

As a consequence, if ''f'' is continuous on [''a'', ''b''] and ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') differ in [[Negative and non-negative numbers|sign]], then, at some point ''c'' in [''a'', ''b''], ''f''(''c'') must equal [[0 (number)|zero]].

====Extreme value theorem====
The [[extreme value theorem]] states that if a function ''f'' is defined on a closed interval [''a'',''b''] (or any closed and bounded set) and is continuous there, then the function attains its maximum, i.e. there exists ''c''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[''a'',''b''] with ''f''(''c'') ≥ ''f''(''x'') for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[''a'',''b'']. The same is true of the minimum of ''f''. These statements are false if the function is defined on an open interval (''a'',''b'') (or any set that is not both closed and bounded), as, for example, the continuous function ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'', defined on the open interval (0,1), does not attain a maximum, being unbounded above.
====Continuous functions as [[integrand]]s====
Let &lt;math&gt;~f~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~g~&lt;/math&gt; be real continuous functions defined at the real segment &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there exist &lt;math&gt;~y \in  [a,b]~&lt;/math&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) g(x) ~{\rm d}x=f(y)\int_a^b g(y)~ {\rm d} y ~.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- This is theorem abot the [[median value]].!--&gt;

===Directional continuity===
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;Image:Right-continuous.svg|A right continuous function
Image:Left-continuous.svg|A left continuous function&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A function may happen to be continuous in only one direction, either from the &quot;left&quot; or from the &quot;right&quot;. A '''right-continuous''' function is a function which is continuous at all points when approached from the right.  Technically, the formal definition is similar to the definition above for a continuous function but modified as follows:

The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be right-continuous at the point ''c'' if and only if the following holds: For any number &amp;epsilon; &amp;gt; 0 however small, there exists some number &amp;delta; &amp;gt; 0 such that for all ''x'' in the domain with ''c'' &amp;lt; ''x'' &amp;lt; ''c'' + &amp;delta;, the value of ''f''(''x'') will satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt;f(c) - \varepsilon &lt; f(x) &lt; f(c) + \varepsilon.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise a '''left-continuous''' function is a function which is continuous at all points when approached from the left.

A function is continuous if and only if it is both right-continuous and left-continuous.

== Continuous functions between metric spaces ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[F-space]] --&gt;
Now consider a function ''f'' from one [[metric space]] (''X'', d&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) to another metric space (''Y'', d&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;). Then ''f'' is continuous at the point ''c'' in ''X'' if for any positive real number ε, there exists a positive real number δ such that all ''x'' in ''X'' satisfying d&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''c'') &lt; δ will also satisfy d&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''(''x''), ''f''(''c'')) &lt; ε.

This can also be formulated in terms of [[sequence]]s and [[limit (mathematics)|limits]]: the function ''f'' is continuous at the point ''c'' if for every sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''X'' with limit lim ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c'', we have lim ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''c''). ''Continuous functions transform limits into limits.''

This latter condition can be weakened as follows: ''f'' is continuous at the point ''c'' if and only if for every convergent sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''X'' with limit ''c'', the sequence (''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) is a [[Cauchy sequence]], and ''c'' is in the domain of ''f''. ''Continuous functions transform convergent sequences into Cauchy sequences.''

== Continuous functions between topological spaces ==
{{main|Continuous function (topology)}}

The above definitions of continuous functions can be generalized to functions from one [[topological space]] to another in a natural way; a function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', where ''X'' and ''Y'' are topological spaces, is continuous [[if and only if]] for every [[open set]] ''V'' &amp;sube; ''Y'', the inverse image 
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(V) = \{x \in X \; | \; f(x) \in V \}&lt;/math&gt; 
is open.

== Continuous functions between partially ordered sets ==
In [[order theory]], continuity of a function between [[Partially ordered sets|posets]] is [[Scott continuity]]. Let ''X'' be a [[complete lattice]], then a function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X'' is continuous if, for each subset ''Y'' of ''X'', we have [[supremum|sup]]&amp;nbsp;''f''(''Y'') = ''f''(sup&amp;nbsp;''Y'').

== Continuous binary relation ==
A binary [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] ''R'' on ''A'' is continuous if ''R''(''a'', ''b'') whenever there are sequences (''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and (''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'' which converge to ''a'' and ''b'' respectively for which ''R''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) for all ''k''.  Clearly, if one treats ''R'' as a [[characteristic function]] in three variables, this definition of continuous is identical to that for continuous functions.

[[File:HomotopySmall.gif|thumb|The two dashed paths shown above are homotopic relative to their endpoints. The animation represents one possible homotopy.]]
In [[topology]], two [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]]s from one [[topological space]] to another are called '''homotopic''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ὁμός (''homós'') = same, similar, and τόπος (''tópos'') = place) if one can be &quot;continuously deformed&quot; into the other, such a deformation being called a '''homotopy''' between the two functions. A notable use of homotopy is the definition of [[homotopy groups]] and [[cohomotopy groups]], important [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s in [[algebraic topology]].

In practice, there are technical difficulties in using homotopies with certain spaces.  Algebraic topologists work with [[compactly generated space]]s, [[CW complex]]es, or [[Spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectra]].

==Formal definition==
[[File:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|right|250px|An isotopy of a coffee cup into a doughnut ([[torus]]).]]
Formally, a homotopy between two [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]]s ''f'' and ''g'' from a 
topological space ''X'' to a topological space ''Y'' is defined to be a continuous function {{nowrap|1=''H'' : ''X'' &amp;times; [0,1] → ''Y''}} from the [[product topology|product]] of the space ''X'' with the [[unit interval]] [0,1] to ''Y'' such that, if {{nowrap|1=''x'' &amp;isin; ''X''}} then {{nowrap|1=''H''(''x'',0) = ''f''(''x'')}} and {{nowrap|1=''H''(''x'',1) = ''g''(''x'').}}

If we think of the second [[parameter]] of ''H'' as time then ''H'' describes a ''continuous deformation'' of ''f'' into ''g'': at time 0 we have the function ''f'' and at time 1 we have the function ''g''. We can also think of the second parameter as a &quot;slider control&quot; that allows us to smoothly transition from ''f'' to ''g'' as the slider moves from 0 to 1, and vice versa.

An alternative notation is to say that a homotopy between two continuous functions {{nowrap|1=''f'', ''g '': ''X'' → ''Y''}} is a family of continuous functions {{nowrap|1=''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} for {{nowrap|1=''t'' ∈ [0,1]}} such that {{nowrap|1=''h&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''f''}} and {{nowrap|1=''h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g'',}} and the map {{nowrap|1=''(x,t)'' ↦ ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;(x)''}} is continuous from {{nowrap|1=''X'' &amp;times; [0,1]}} to Y. The two versions coincide by setting {{nowrap|1=''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = ''H''(''x'',''t'').}} It is not sufficient to require each map {{nowrap|1=''t'' ↦ ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;(x)''}} to be continuous.&lt;ref&gt;http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/104515/path-homotopy-and-separately-continuous-functions&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties===

Continuous functions ''f'' and ''g'' are said to be homotopic if and only if there is a homotopy ''H'' taking ''f'' to ''g'' as described above.
Being homotopic is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of all continuous functions from ''X'' to ''Y''. 
This homotopy relation is compatible with [[function composition]] in the following sense: if {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' → ''Y''}} are homotopic, and {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''Y'' → ''Z''}} are homotopic, then their compositions {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' → ''Z''}} are also homotopic.

==Homotopy equivalence==
Given two spaces ''X'' and ''Y'', we say they are '''homotopy equivalent''', or of the same '''homotopy type''', if there exist continuous [[map (mathematics)|map]]s {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} and {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∘ ''f''}} is homotopic to the [[identity function|identity map]] id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g''}} is homotopic to id&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The maps ''f'' and ''g'' are called '''homotopy equivalences''' in this case.  Every [[homeomorphism]] is a homotopy equivalence, but the converse is not true: for example, a solid disk is not homeomorphic to a single point (since there is no bijection between them), although the disk and the point are homotopy equivalent (since you can deform the disk along radial lines continuously to a single point). Spaces that are homotopy equivalent to a point are called [[contractible]]. 

Intuitively, two spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are homotopy equivalent if they can be transformed into one another (''i.e.'', made [[homeomorphic]]) by bending, shrinking and expanding operations.
For example, a solid disk or solid ball is homotopy equivalent to a point, and {{nowrap|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; {(0,0)}}} is homotopy equivalent to the [[unit circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
However, one has to be careful to not think of such transformations in terms of [[Embedding|embeddings]] only &amp;mdash; for example, the [[double torus]] and the double torus with the rings interlinked are homotopy equivalent (since they are homeomorphic), even though the said transformation cannot be embedded in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] without the rings &quot;passing through&quot; each other.

===Null-homotopy===
A function ''f'' is said to be '''null-homotopic''' {{anchor|null homotopic}} if it is homotopic to a constant function.  (The homotopy from ''f'' to a constant function is then sometimes called a '''null-homotopy'''.)  For example, a map ''f'' from the [[unit circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to any space ''X'' is null-homotopic precisely when it can be extended to a map from the [[unit disk]] ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X'' that agrees with ''f'' on the boundary.

It follows from these definitions that a space ''X'' is contractible if and only if the identity map from ''X'' to itself&amp;mdash;which is always a homotopy equivalence&amp;mdash;is null-homotopic.

==Homotopy invariance==
Homotopy equivalence is important because in [[algebraic topology]] many concepts are '''homotopy invariant''', that is, they respect the relation of homotopy equivalence.  For example, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are homotopy equivalent spaces, then:
* If ''X'' is [[connected space|path-connected]] then so is ''Y''.
* If ''X'' is [[simply connected]] then so is ''Y''.
* The (singular) [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] and [[cohomology group]]s of ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].
* If ''X'' and ''Y'' are path-connected, then the [[fundamental group]]s of ''X'' and ''Y'' are isomorphic, and so are the higher [[homotopy group]]s. (Without the path-connectedness assumption, one has π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) isomorphic to π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'',''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)) where {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is a homotopy equivalence and {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''X''.)}}

An example of an algebraic invariant of topological spaces which is not homotopy-invariant is [[compactly supported homology]] (which is, roughly speaking, the homology of the [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]], and compactification is not homotopy-invariant).

==Relative homotopy==

In order to define the [[fundamental group]], one needs the notion of '''homotopy relative to a subspace'''. These are homotopies which keep the elements of the subspace fixed. Formally: if ''f'' and ''g'' are continuous maps from ''X'' to ''Y'' and ''K'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', then we say that ''f'' and ''g'' are homotopic relative to ''K'' if there exists a homotopy {{nowrap|1=''H'' : ''X'' &amp;times; [0,1] → ''Y''}} between ''f'' and ''g'' such that {{nowrap|1=''H''(''k'',''t'') = ''f''(''k'') = ''g''(''k'')}} for all {{nowrap|1=''k'' ∈ ''K''}} and {{nowrap|1=''t'' ∈ [0,1].}} Also, if ''g'' is a [[retract]] from ''X'' to ''K'' and ''f'' is the identity map, this is known as a strong [[deformation retract]] of ''X'' to ''K''.
When ''K'' is a point, the term '''pointed homotopy''' is used.

==Homotopy groups==

{{main|Homotopy group}}
Since the relation of two functions {{nowrap|1=''f'', ''g'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} being homotopic relative to a subspace is an equivalence relation, we can look at the [[equivalence class]]es of maps between a fixed ''X'' and ''Y''. If we fix {{nowrap|1=''X'' = [0,1]''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'',}} the unit interval [0,1] [[cartesian product|crossed]] with itself ''n'' times, and we take a subspace{{clarify|date=November 2012}} to be its [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] &lt;big&gt;∂&lt;/big&gt;([0,1]''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'') then the equivalence classes form a group, denoted π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'',''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is in the image of the subspace &lt;big&gt;∂&lt;/big&gt;([0,1]''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'').

We can define the action of one equivalence class on another, and so we get a group. These groups are called the [[homotopy group]]s. In the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1,}} it is also called the [[fundamental group]].

==Homotopy category==
The idea of homotopy can be turned into a formal category of [[category theory]]. The '''homotopy category''' is the category whose objects are topological spaces, and whose morphisms are homotopy equivalence classes of continuous maps. Two topological spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are isomorphic in this category if and only if they are homotopy-equivalent.  Then a [[functor]] on the category of topological spaces is homotopy invariant if it can be expressed as a functor on the homotopy category.

For example, homology groups are a ''functorial'' homotopy invariant: this means that if ''f'' and ''g'' from ''X'' to ''Y'' are homotopic, then the [[group homomorphism]]s induced by ''f'' and ''g'' on the level of [[homology group]]s are the same: H&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'') = H&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') : H&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') → H&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'') for all ''n''.  Likewise, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are in addition [[connectedness|path connected]], and the homotopy between ''f'' and ''g'' is pointed, then the group homomorphisms induced by ''f'' and ''g'' on the level of [[homotopy group]]s are also the same: π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'') = π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') : π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') → π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'').

==Timelike homotopy==
On a [[Lorentzian manifold]], certain curves are distinguished as [[timelike]]. A [[timelike homotopy]] between two timelike curves is a homotopy such that each intermediate{{clarify|date=November 2012}} curve is timelike. No [[closed timelike curve]] (CTC) on a Lorentzian manifold is timelike homotopic to a point (that is, null timelike homotopic); such a manifold is therefore said to be [[multiply connected]] by timelike curves. A manifold such as the [[3-sphere]] can be [[simply connected]] (by any type of curve), and yet be [[timelike multiply connected]].[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10701-008-9254-9]

==Homotopy lifting property==

{{main|Homotopy lifting property}}
If we have a homotopy {{nowrap|1=''H'' : ''X'' &amp;times; [0,1] &amp;rarr; ''Y''}} and a cover {{nowrap|1=''p'' : &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;''Y''&lt;/span&gt; &amp;rarr; ''Y''}} and we are given a map {{nowrap|1=&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;''h''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' &amp;rarr; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;''Y''&lt;/span&gt;}} such that {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p'' ○ &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;''h''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}   (&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;''h''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is called a [[Lift (mathematics)|lift]] of ''h''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), then we can lift all ''H'' to a map {{nowrap|1=&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;''H''&lt;/span&gt; : ''X'' &amp;times; [0,1] &amp;rarr; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;''Y''&lt;/span&gt;}} such that {{nowrap|1=''p'' ○ &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;''H''&lt;/span&gt; = ''H''.}} The homotopy lifting property is used to characterize [[fibration]]s.

== Homotopy extension property ==
Another useful property involving homotopy is the [[homotopy extension property]],
which characterizes the extension of a homotopy between two functions from a subset of some set to the set itself. It is useful when dealing with [[cofibration]]s.

== Isotopy ==
In case the two given continuous functions ''f'' and ''g'' from the topological space ''X'' to the topological space ''Y'' are [[embedding]]s, one can ask whether they can be connected 'through embeddings'. This gives rise to the concept of '''isotopy''', which is a homotopy, ''H'', in the notation used before, such that for each fixed ''t'', ''H''(''x'',''t'') gives an embedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|Isotopy|Isotopy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related, but different, concept is that of [[ambient isotopy]].

Requiring that two embeddings be isotopic is a stronger requirement than that they be homotopic. For example, the map from the interval [&amp;minus;1,1] into the real numbers defined by ''f''(''x'') = &amp;minus;''x'' is ''not'' isotopic to the identity ''g''(''x'') = ''x''.  Any homotopy from ''f'' to the identity would have to exchange the endpoints, which would mean that they would have to 'pass through' each other. Moreover, ''f'' has changed the orientation of the interval and ''g'' has not, which is impossible under an isotopy. However, the maps are homotopic; one homotopy from ''f'' to the identity is ''H'':&amp;nbsp;[&amp;minus;1,1]&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;[0,1]&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[&amp;minus;1,1] given by ''H''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''yx''-''x''.

Two homeomorphisms (which are special cases of embeddings) of the unit ball which agree on the boundary can be shown to be isotopic using [[Alexander's trick]]. For this reason, the map of the [[unit disc]] in ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; defined by ''f''(''x'',''y'') = (&amp;minus;''x'',&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''y'') is isotopic to a 180-degree [[rotation]] around the origin, and so the identity map and ''f'' are isotopic because they can be connected by rotations.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Blue_Unknot.png
Image:Blue_Trefoil_Knot.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[unknot]] is not equivalent to the [[Trefoil knot]] since one cannot be deformed into the other through a continuous path of embeddings. Thus they are not ambient isotopic.
&lt;/div&gt;

In [[geometric topology]]&amp;mdash;for example in [[knot theory]]&amp;mdash;the idea of isotopy is used to construct equivalence relations. For example, when should two knots be considered the same?  We take two knots, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in three-[[dimension]]al space. A knot is an [[embedding]] of a one-dimensional space, the &quot;loop of string&quot; (or the circle), into this space, and this embedding gives a homeomorphism between the circle and its image in the embedding space. The intuitive idea behind the notion of knot equivalence is that one can ''deform'' one embedding to another through a path of embeddings: a continuous function starting at t=0 giving the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; embedding, ending at t=1 giving the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; embedding, with all intermediate values corresponding to embeddings. This corresponds to the definition of isotopy. 
An [[ambient isotopy]], studied in this context, is an isotopy of the larger space, considered in light of its action on the embedded submanifold. Knots ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are considered equivalent when there is an ambient isotopy which moves ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is the appropriate definition in the topological category. 

Similar language is used for the equivalent concept in contexts where one has a stronger notion of equivalence.  For example a path between two smooth embeddings is a '''smooth isotopy'''.

==Applications==
Based on the concept of the homotopy, computation methods for algebraic and differential equations have been developed. The methods for algebraic equations include the [[numerical continuation|homotopy continuation]] method  &lt;ref name=Allgower1990&gt;{{cite web|last=Allgower|first=Eugene|title=Introduction to Numerical Continuation Methods|url=ftp://210.45.114.81/math/%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E7%9B%AE%E5%BD%95/Computing/Introduction%20to%20numerical%20continuation%20methods%20(Colorado%201990%20Allgower%20397s).pdf|publisher=CSU|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the continuation method. The methods for differential equations include the [[homotopy analysis method]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[differential geometry]], '''Stokes' theorem''' is a statement about the [[integral|integration]] of [[differential form]]s which generalizes several [[theorem]]s from [[vector calculus]]. It is named after Sir [[George Gabriel Stokes]] (1819&amp;ndash;1903), although the first known statement of the theorem is by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] ([[Lord Kelvin]]) and appears in a letter of his to Stokes in [[July]] 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Darrigol,''Electrodynamics from Ampere to Einstein'', p. 146,ISBN 0198505930 Oxford (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  The theorem acquired its name from Stokes's habit of including it in the [[Cambridge university|Cambridge]] prize examinations.  In 1854, he [http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/SmithsPrizeExam_Stokes.pdf asked] his students to prove the theorem on an examination.

==Introduction==
The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that the [[integral]] of a function ''f'' over the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'', ''b''] can be calculated by finding an [[antiderivative]] ''F'' of ''f'':

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm dx = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of this theorem in the following sense. 
* By the choice of ''F'', &lt;math&gt;\frac{dF}{dx}=f&lt;/math&gt;. In the parlance of [[differential form]]s, this is saying that ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;''dx'' is the [[exterior derivative]] of the 0-form (i.e. function) ''F'': ''dF = f&amp;nbsp;dx''. The general Stokes theorem applies to higher differential forms &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; instead of ''F''.
* In fancy language, the closed interval [''a'', ''b''] is a one-dimensional [[manifold]] with boundary. Its boundary is the set consisting of the two points ''a'' and ''b''. Integrating ''f'' over the interval may be generalized to integrating forms on a higher-dimensional manifold. Two technical conditions are needed: the manifold has to be [[orientable]], and the form has to be [[compact support|compactly supported]] in order to give a well-defined integral. 
* The two points ''a'' and ''b'' form the boundary of the open interval. More generally, Stokes' theorem applies to oriented manifolds ''M'' with boundary. The boundary ∂''M'' of ''M'' is itself a manifold and inherits a natural orientation from that of the manifold. For example, the natural orientation of the interval gives an orientation of the two boundary points. Intuitively, ''a'' inherits the opposite orientation as ''b'', as they are at opposite ends of the interval. So, &quot;integrating&quot; ''F'' over two boundary points ''a'', ''b'' is taking the difference ''F''(''b'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''F''(''a'').

So the fundamental theorem reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{[a, b]} f(x)\,dx = \int_{[a, b]} dF = \int_{\{a\}^- \cup \{b\}^+} F = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

==General formulation==

Let ''M'' be an oriented [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] ''n'' and let &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; be an ''n''-[[differential form]] that is [[compactly supported]] on ''M''. The integral of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; over ''M'' is defined as follows: Let {''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''} be a [[partition of unity]] associated with a [[Locally finite collection|locally finite]] [[Cover (topology)|cover]] {''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''} of (consistently oriented) coordinate neighborhoods, then the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \alpha \,&lt;/math&gt;

is defined to be 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i \int_{U_i} f_i \, \alpha ,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where each term in the sum is evaluated by pulling back to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. This is well-defined.

Stokes' theorem reads: If &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is an (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-form with compact support on ''M'' and ∂''M'' denotes the [[manifold|boundary]] of ''M'' with its induced [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], then 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \mathrm {d}\omega = \oint_{\partial M} \omega.\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''d'' is the [[exterior derivative]], which is defined using the manifold structure only. 

The theorem is often used in situations where ''M'' is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold on which the form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined.

==Topological reading==

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold. A (C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;-)singular ''k''-simplex of ''M'' is a smooth map from the standard simplex in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''M''. The free abelian group ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' generated by singular ''k''-simplices is said to consist of singular ''k''-[[Chain (algebraic topology)|chains]] of ''M''. These groups, together with [[Boundary (topology)|boundary map]] ∂, defines a [[chain complex]]. The corresponding homology (resp. cohomology) is called the (C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;-)[[singular homology]] (resp. cohomology) of ''M''. 

On the other hand, the differential forms, with exterior derivative ''d'' as the connecting map, form a cochain complex, which defines [[de Rham cohomology]]. 

Differential ''k''-forms can be integrated over a ''k''-simplex in a natural way, by pulling back to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. Extending by linearity allows one to integrate over chains. This gives a linear map from the space of ''k''-forms to the ''k''-th group in the singular cochain ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;*'', the linear functionals on ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. In other words, a ''k''-form
&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; defines a functional

:&lt;math&gt;I(\omega)(c) = \int_c \omega \,&lt;/math&gt;

on the ''k''-chains. Stokes' theorem says that this is a chain map from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology; the exterior derivative ''d'' behaves like the &quot;dual&quot; of ∂ on forms. This gives a homomorphism from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology. On the level of forms, this means 

#closed forms have zero integral over boundaries and,
#exact forms have zero integral over cycles.

[[de Rham's theorem]] shows that this homomorphism is in fact an isomorphism. So the converse to 1 and 2 above hold true. In other words, if {''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''} are cycles generating the ''k''-th homology group, then for any corresponding real numbers {''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}, there exist a closed form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{c_i} \omega = a_i ,&lt;/math&gt; 

and this form is unique up to exact forms.

==Special cases==

The general form of the Stokes theorem using differential forms is more powerful and easier to use than the special cases. Because in [[Cartesian coordinates]] the traditional versions can be formulated without the machinery of differential geometry they are more accessible, older and have familiar names. The traditional forms are often considered more convenient by practicing scientists and engineers but the non-naturalness of the traditional formulation becomes apparent when using other coordinate systems, even familiar ones like spherical or cylindrical coordinates. There is potential for confusion in the way names are applied, and the use of dual formulations.

===Kelvin-Stokes theorem===
[[Image:Stokes' Theorem.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of Kelvin-Stokes theorem with surface &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, its boundary &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\partial \Sigma,}&lt;/math&gt; and orientation ''n''.]]

This is the (dualized) 1+1 dimensional case, for a 1-form (dualized because it is a statement about [[vector field]]s). This special case is often just referred to as the ''Stokes' theorem'' in many introductory university vector calculus courses. It is also sometimes known as the '''[[Curl (mathematics)|curl theorem]]'''.

The classical Kelvin-Stokes theorem:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\Sigma} \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{\Sigma} = \oint_{\partial\Sigma} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}, &lt;/math&gt;

which relates the [[surface integral]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a [[vector field]] over a surface &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; in Euclidean three-space to the [[line integral]] of the vector field over its boundary, is a special case of the general Stokes theorem (with ''n'' = 2) once we identify a vector field with a 1 form using the metric on Euclidean three-space. The curve of the line integral ( ∂Σ ) must have positive [[curve orientation|orientation]], meaning that ''d''''' ''r'' ''' points counterclockwise when the surface normal ( '''d Σ''' ) points toward the viewer, following the [[right-hand rule]].

It can be rewritten for the student acquainted with forms as

:&lt;math&gt;\iint\limits_{\Sigma}\left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z}\right)\,dy\,dz &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; +\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial R}{\partial x}\right)\,dz\,dx &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; +\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\,dx\,dy &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; =\oint\limits_{\partial\Sigma}P\,dx+Q\,dy+R\,dz&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'', ''Q'' and ''R'' are the components of '''F'''.

These variants are frequently used:
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\Sigma} \left( g \left(\nabla \times \mathbf{F}\right)  + \left( \nabla g \right) \times \mathbf{F} \right) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;  \cdot d\mathbf{\Sigma} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\ = \oint_{\partial\Sigma} g \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\Sigma} \left( \mathbf{F} \left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{G} \right) - \mathbf{G}\left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \right) + \left( \mathbf{G} \cdot \nabla \right) \mathbf{F} - \left(\mathbf{F} \cdot \nabla \right) \mathbf{G}  \right) \cdot d\mathbf{\Sigma} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\ = \oint_{\partial\Sigma} \left( \mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{G}\right) \cdot d \mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

====In electromagnetism====
Two of the four [[Maxwell equations]] involve curls of 3-D vector fields and their differential and integral forms are related by the Kelvin-Stokes theorem. Caution must be taken to avoid cases with moving boundaries: the partial time derivatives are intended to exclude such cases. If moving boundaries are included, interchange of integration and differentiation introduces terms related to boundary motion not included in the results below:

{\mathrm d \over {\mathrm dt}} \int_S \mathbf{D} \cdot d \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''C'' and ''S'' stationary
|}

===Divergence theorem===
Likewise the [[Divergence theorem|Ostrogradsky-Gauss theorem]]  (also known as the Divergence theorem or Gauss' theorem)

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathrm{Vol}} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \ d_\mathrm{Vol} = \oint_{\partial \mathrm{Vol}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

is a special case if we identify a vector field with the ''n''−1 form obtained by contracting the vector field with the Euclidean volume form.

===Green's theorem===
[[Green's theorem]] is immediately recognizable as the third integrand of both sides in the integral in terms of ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' cited above.

In [[differential geometry]], '''Stokes' theorem''' (also called '''the generalized Stokes' theorem''') is a statement about the [[integral|integration]] of [[differential form]]s on [[manifolds]], which both simplifies and generalizes several [[theorem]]s from [[vector calculus]].  Stokes' theorem says that the integral of a differential form ω over the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of some [[orientation (vector space)|orientable]] manifold Ω is equal to the integral of its [[exterior derivative]] dω over the whole of Ω, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial \Omega}\omega=\int_{\Omega}\mathrm {d}\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

This modern form of Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of a [[#Kelvin.E2.80.93Stokes theorem|classical result]] first discovered by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], who communicated it to [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]] in a letter dated July 2, 1850.&lt;ref&gt;See:

This footnote appears to have been the cause of the theorem's being known as &quot;Stokes' theorem&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; This classical Kelvin–Stokes theorem relates the [[surface integral]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a [[vector field]] F over a surface Σ in Euclidean three-space to the [[line integral]] of the vector field over its boundary ∂Σ:

:&lt;math&gt; \iint_{\Sigma} \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma} = \oint_{\partial\Sigma} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}. &lt;/math&gt;

This classical statement, as well as the classical [[Divergence theorem]], [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], and [[Green's Theorem]] are simply special cases of the general formulation stated above.

== Introduction ==
The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that the [[integral]] of a function ''f'' over the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'', ''b''] can be calculated by finding an [[antiderivative]] ''F'' of ''f'' :

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm dx = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of this theorem in the following sense. 
* By the choice of ''F'', &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}x}=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. In the parlance of [[differential form]]s, this is saying that ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;d''x'' is the [[exterior derivative]] of the 0-form, i.e. function, ''F'': in other words, that d''F'' = ''f''&amp;nbsp;d''x''. The general Stokes theorem applies to higher differential forms ω instead of ''F''.
* A closed interval [''a'', ''b''] is a simple example of a one-dimensional [[manifold]] with boundary.  Its boundary is the set consisting of the two points ''a'' and ''b''. Integrating ''f'' over the interval may be generalized to integrating forms on a higher-dimensional manifold. Two technical conditions are needed: the manifold has to be [[orientable]], and the form has to be [[compact support|compactly supported]] in order to give a well-defined integral.
* The two points ''a'' and ''b'' form the boundary of the open interval. More generally, Stokes' theorem applies to oriented manifolds ''M'' with boundary. The boundary ∂''M'' of ''M'' is itself a manifold and inherits a natural orientation from that of the manifold. For example, the natural orientation of the interval gives an orientation of the two boundary points. Intuitively, ''a'' inherits the opposite orientation as ''b'', as they are at opposite ends of the interval. So, &quot;integrating&quot; ''F'' over two boundary points ''a'', ''b'' is taking the difference ''F''(''b'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''F''(''a'').
In even simpler terms, one can consider that points can be thought of as the boundaries of curves, that is as 0-dimensional boundaries of 1-dimensional manifolds. So, just as one can find the value of an integral (''f'' d''x'' = d''F'') over a 1-dimensional manifolds ([''a'', ''b'']) by considering the anti-derivative (''F'') at the 0-dimensional boundaries ([''a'', ''b'']), one can generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus, with a few additional caveats, to deal with the value of integrals (dω) over ''n''-dimensional manifolds (Ω) by considering the anti-derivative (ω) at the (''n''−1)-dimensional boundaries (dΩ) of the manifold.

So the fundamental theorem reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{[a, b]} f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x = \int_{[a, b]} \mathrm{d}F = \int_{\{a\}^- \cup \{b\}^+} F = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

==General formulation==
Let Ω be an oriented [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] ''n'' and let α be an ''n''-[[differential form]] that is [[Support (mathematics)#Compact support|compactly supported]] on Ω. First, suppose that α is compactly supported in the domain of a single, [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[coordinate chart]] {''U'', φ}. In this case, we define the integral of α over Ω as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \alpha = \int_{\phi(U)} \left(\phi^{-1}\right)^* \alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., via the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of ''α'' to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

More generally, the integral of α over Ω is defined as follows: Let {''ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''} be a [[partition of unity]] associated with a [[locally finite collection|locally finite]] [[cover (topology)|cover]] {''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;} of (consistently oriented) coordinate charts, then define the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \alpha \equiv \sum_i \int_{U_i} \psi_i \alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

where each term in the sum is evaluated by pulling back to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as described above.  This quantity is well-defined; that is, it does not depend on the choice of the coordinate charts, nor the partition of unity.

Stokes' theorem reads: If ω is an (''n''−1)-form with compact support on Ω and ∂Ω denotes the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of Ω with its induced [[orientation (mathematics)#Geometric algebra|orientation]], then

[[Image:Green's-theorem-simple-region.svg|thumb|upright|180 px|A &quot;normal&quot; integration manifold (here called ''D'' instead of Ω) for the special case ''n'' = 2]]

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \mathrm{d}\omega = \int_{\partial \Omega} \omega \ \ \left( = \oint_{\partial \Omega} \omega\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here d is the [[exterior derivative]], which is defined using the manifold structure only. On  the r.h.s., a circle is sometimes used within the integral sign to stress the fact that the (n-1)-manifold ∂Ω is ''closed''.&lt;ref&gt;For  mathematicians this fact is known, therefore the circle is redundant and often omitted.  However, one should keep in mind here that in [[thermodynamics]], where frequently expressions as &lt;math&gt;\oint_W \,\{d_{\,total\,}U\}&lt;/math&gt; appear (wherein the total derivative, see below, should not be confused with the exterior one), the integration path ''W'' is a one-dimensional closed line on a much higher-dimensional manifold. That is, in a thermodynamic application, where ''U'' is a function of the temperature &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1:=T&lt;/math&gt;, the volume &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2:=V,&lt;/math&gt; and the electrical polarization &lt;math&gt;\alpha_3:=P&lt;/math&gt;  of the sample, one has &lt;math&gt;\{d_{\,total\,}U\}=\sum_{i=1}^3\,\frac{\partial U}{\partial\alpha_i}\mathrm d\alpha_i,&lt;/math&gt; and the circle is really necessary, e.g. if one considers the ''differential'' consequences of the ''integral'' postulate &lt;math&gt;\oint_W\,\{d_{\,total\,}U\}\, \stackrel{!}{=}\,0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The r.h.s. of the equation is often used to formulate ''integral'' laws; the l.h.s. then leads to equivalent ''differential'' formulations (see below).

The theorem is often used in situations where Ω is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold on which the form ω is defined.

A proof becomes particularly simple if the submanifold Ω is a so-called &quot;normal manifold&quot;, as in the figure on the r.h.s., which can be segmented into vertical stripes (e.g. parallel to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction), such that after a partial integration concerning this variable, nontrivial contributions come only from the upper and lower boundary surfaces (coloured in yellow and red, respectively), where the complementary mutual orientations are visible through the arrows.

==Topological preliminaries; integration over chains==

Let ''M'' be a [[smooth manifold]]. A smooth singular [[Simplex|''k''-simplex]] of ''M'' is a [[smooth map]] from the standard simplex in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''M''. The [[free abelian group]], ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', generated by singular ''k''-simplices is said to consist of singular ''k''-[[chain (algebraic topology)|chains]] of ''M''. These groups, together with [[boundary (topology)|boundary map]], ∂, define a [[chain complex]]. The corresponding homology (resp. cohomology) is called the smooth [[singular homology]] (resp. cohomology) of ''M''.

On the other hand, the differential forms, with exterior derivative, ''d'', as the connecting map, form a cochain complex, which defines [[de Rham cohomology]].

Differential ''k''-forms can be integrated over a ''k''-simplex in a natural way, by pulling back to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. Extending by linearity allows one to integrate over chains. This gives a linear map from the space of ''k''-forms to the ''k''-th group in the singular cochain, ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;*'', the linear functionals on ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. In other words, a ''k''-form ω defines a functional

:&lt;math&gt;I(\omega)(c) = \oint_c \omega&lt;/math&gt;

on the ''k''-chains. Stokes' theorem says that this is a chain map from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology; the exterior derivative, ''d'', behaves like the ''dual'' of ∂ on forms. This gives a homomorphism from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology. On the level of forms, this means:

#closed forms, i.e., dω = 0, have zero integral over ''boundaries'', i.e. over manifolds that can be written as &lt;math&gt;\partial \,\sum\nolimits_c M_c&lt;/math&gt;, and
#exact forms, i.e., ω = dσ, have zero integral over ''cycles'', i.e. if the boundaries sum up to the empty set: &lt;math&gt;\sum\nolimits_c\partial M_c=\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.

[[De Rham's theorem]] shows that this homomorphism is in fact an isomorphism. So the converse to 1 and 2 above hold true. In other words, if {''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''} are cycles generating the ''k''-th homology group, then for any corresponding real numbers, {''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}, there exist a closed form, ω, such that

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{c_i} \omega = a_i,&lt;/math&gt;

and this form is unique up to exact forms.

== Underlying principle ==
[[Image:Stokes patch.svg|200px|left]]
To simplify these topological arguments, it is worthwhile to examine the underlying principle by considering an example for ''d'' = 2 dimensions. The essential idea can be understood by the diagram on the left, which shows that, in an oriented tiling of a manifold, the interior paths are traversed in opposite directions; their contributions to the path integral thus cancel each other pairwise. As a consequence, only the contribution from the boundary remains. It thus suffices to prove Stokes' theorem for sufficiently fine
tilings (or, equivalently, [[Simplex|simplices]]), which usually is not difficult.

==Special cases==
The general form of the Stokes theorem using differential forms is more powerful and easier to use than the special cases. The traditional versions can be formulated using [[Cartesian coordinates]] without the machinery of differential geometry, and thus are more accessible. Further, they are older and their names are more familiar as a result. The traditional forms are often considered more convenient by practicing scientists and engineers but the non-naturalness of the traditional formulation becomes apparent when using other coordinate systems, even familiar ones like spherical or cylindrical coordinates. There is potential for confusion in the way names are applied, and the use of dual formulations.

===Kelvin–Stokes theorem===
[[Image:Stokes' Theorem.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of the Kelvin–Stokes theorem, with surface Σ, its boundary ∂Σ and the &quot;normal&quot; vector ''n''.]]

This is a (dualized) 1+1 dimensional case, for a 1-form (dualized because it is a statement about [[vector field]]s). This special case is often just referred to as the ''Stokes' theorem'' in many introductory university vector calculus courses and as used in physics and engineering. It is also sometimes known as the '''[[Curl (mathematics)|curl]]''' theorem.

The classical [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\Sigma} \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma} = \oint_{\partial\Sigma} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}, &lt;/math&gt;

which relates the [[surface integral]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a [[vector field]] over a surface Σ in Euclidean three-space to the [[line integral]] of the vector field over its boundary, is a special case of the general Stokes theorem (with {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}) once we identify a vector field with a 1 form using the metric on Euclidean three-space. The curve of the line integral, ∂Σ, must have positive [[curve orientation|orientation]], meaning that d'''r''' points counterclockwise when the surface normal, d'''Σ''', points toward the viewer, following the [[right-hand rule]].

One consequence of the formula is that the [[field line]]s of a vector field with zero curl cannot be closed contours.

The formula can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;\iint_{\Sigma}\left\{\left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z}\right)\mathrm{d}y\mathrm{d}z +\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial R}{\partial x}\right)\mathrm{d}z\mathrm{d}x  +\left (\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;=\oint_{\partial\Sigma}\left \{P\mathrm{d}x+Q\mathrm{d}y+R\mathrm{d}z\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'', ''Q'' and ''R'' are the components of '''F'''.

These variants are rarely used:
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\Sigma} \left \{ g \left(\nabla \times \mathbf{F} \right) + \left( \nabla g \right) \times \mathbf{F} \right \} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma} = \oint_{\partial\Sigma} g \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\Sigma} \left\{ \mathbf{F} \left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{G} \right) - \mathbf{G}\left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \right) + \left( \mathbf{G} \cdot \nabla \right) \mathbf{F} - \left(\mathbf{F} \cdot \nabla \right) \mathbf{G} \right \} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= \oint_{\partial\Sigma} \left( \mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{G}\right) \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Green's theorem===
[[Green's theorem]] is immediately recognizable as the third integrand of both sides in the integral in terms of ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' cited above.

====In electromagnetism====
Two of the four [[Maxwell equations]] involve curls of 3-D vector fields and their differential and integral forms are related by the [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]]. Caution must be taken to avoid cases with moving boundaries: the partial time derivatives are intended to exclude such cases. If moving boundaries are included, interchange of integration and differentiation introduces terms related to boundary motion not included in the results below (see [[Differentiation under the integral sign]]):

The above listed subset of Maxwell's equations are valid for electromagnetic fields expressed in SI units. In other systems of units, such as [[Maxwell's_equations#CGS_units|CGS]] or [[Gaussian units]], the scaling factors for the terms differ. For example, in Gaussian units, Faraday's law of induction and Ampère's law take the forms&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Jackson, ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd Ed (Wiley, New York, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Born and E. Wolf, ''Principles of Optics'', 6th Ed. (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t},&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}} {\partial t} + \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J},&lt;/math&gt;

respectively, where ''c'' is the speed of light in vacuum.

===Divergence theorem===
Likewise, the [[Divergence theorem|Ostrogradsky-Gauss theorem]] (also known as the Divergence theorem or Gauss's theorem)

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathrm{Vol}} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \ \mathrm{d}_\mathrm{Vol} = \oint_{\partial \mathrm{Vol}} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

is a special case if we identify a vector field with the ''n''−1 form obtained by contracting the vector field with the Euclidean volume form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Uniq is a line-oriented Unix command-line tool dealing with adjacent identical lines, available on many platforms.

==Options==
Command-line options aka switches of uniq:
* -u: (for ''unique'') Output singleton blocks: output only lines that are not part of blocks of multiple adjacent identical lines.
* -d: (for ''duplicate'') Output collapsed multiline blocks: output a single line for each block of multiple adjacent identical lines, discarding lines for blocks of size one.
* -c: (for ''count'') Output a single line per a block of one or more adjacent identical lines, preceded by the number of lines in the block.

Command-line options aka switches of some versions of uniq:
* -f''number'': Disregard a number of fields in a line
* -i: Case insensitive.
* -s''number'': Disregard a number of characters in a line

Links
* [http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#uniq-invocation Uniquify files], coreutils, gnu.org

==Examples==
Examples of uniq use:
* uniq file.txt
** Of adjacent one or more identical lines, outputs only one of them.
* sort file.txt | uniq 
** Sorts and then, of identical lines, outputs only one of them. Sorting ensures that originally non-adjacent lines that were identical become adjacent.
* sort file.txt | uniq -u
** Outputs singleton blocks only.
* sort file.txt | uniq -d
** Outputs a single line per multiline block, filtering out singletons.
* sort file.txt | uniq -c
** Precedes each line with the block size.
* sort file.txt | uniq -u -d
** In GNU uniq, outputs nothing, since each of the two options acts as a filter, and combined they filter out everything.

==Versions==
A version of GNU uniq for MS Windows is available from [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm GnuWin32 project], as well as from [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin].

Here is [[Biomedical Engineering Theory And Practice/Introduction]] before 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This page should be a concise introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Biomedical Engineering. The emphasis should be on the interdisciplinary nature of this filed and that it needs mastering different tools.

[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]

This is supposed to be the first part of the book! It is the main part and it is the motivation to write this book. The chapters in this part should have many cross-references to other chapters in the book. Most of the cross-references are there to point out the needed tools to master the respective chapter as a career.
TODO: add a copy of the Contents of this part here

1.1 What is biomedical engineering?

1.2 A very brief history biomedical engineering.

1.3 The state of the art.: a broad look at things.

1.4 Opportunities for growth.


==TODO==

import [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering wikipedia: Biomedical_engineering] 

article as a seed for the introduction.
Expand the history section a bit. Give roughly equal coverage to the disciplines covered in this book and show how they overlap.</text>

== Unclear passages ==

I'm not an expert in either monads or Haskell, but I am rather familiar with both. Yet I do not understand the following phrase in the beginning: &quot;that monad does not allow to extract pure values from it by design; in contrast, you can extract pure values from Maybe or lists using pattern matching or appropriate functions&quot;. I expect this phrase --as it stands now, in particular the word &quot;extract&quot;-- is not helpful for beginners.

Related, the last sentence of section &quot;Translating the bind operator&quot; says: &quot;Notice that the variables left of the &lt;- in the do block have been extracted from the monad, so if action produces e.g. a IO String, the type of result will be String.&quot; Should I have been able to make this observation myself, or is it the author's task to explain the observation? I think the latter. This is the first point where I can make sense of the concept of &quot;extracting a value out of a monad&quot;.

I think the example (in Translating the bind) can be made clearer. Now it reads: &quot;do result &lt;- action; another_result &lt;- another_action; (action_based_on_previous_results result another_result)&quot; and I would prefer &quot;do x1 &lt;- action1; x2 &lt;- action2; (action3 x1 x2)&quot;.

: This chapter is indeed a little problematic. The more I look at it, the less satisfactory it appears. Even removing it doesn't seem such a bad idea, except that it would force us to talk more about do notation in Understanding Monads, which would not be appropriate. [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 08:32, 11 October 2013 (UTC)

: I just changed the text rather extensively to address the concerns raised above and provide better advice. [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 21:51, 13 October 2013 (UTC)</text>

Standard is to link only the first mention of another article... and check very carefully with a preview to make certain that the links you're adding actually go somewhere. A red link is very disruptive when reading.

      <text xml:space="preserve">OS X has a function for playing notification sounds (Alerts) that parts of OS X and third party programs use. Once these are turned off in System Preferences it won't be necessary to turn them off in Applications to be able to listen to music without extra noise. To turn them off:

# Go to '''System Preferences''' (it's in the Apple Menu)
# Make sure you're on the main list (click '''Show All''' to get there if you aren't)
# Click on '''Sound''' (on the second row in Mountain Lion)
# Ensure that you're on the '''Sound Effects''' tab
# Drag the '''Alert Volume''' all the way to the left

There are two other types of sound you can turn off:

* Play user interface sound effects (function unknown)
* Play feedback when volume is changed (disables the clicking sound when changing the volume)

{{categorize}}

Simplex means Simple. Physica means Physics.

This book is an attempt to explain physics in a simple manner. It will not teach a method to obtain better grades but rather it will teach the material. There might be times where the material is confusing and difficult to follow but that material will be revised later on to be as simple as we can make it.

We realize that there are many physics books available but this book was created in order to attempt explaining in a non-technical and non-professional manner.

Why did you write ''original creator'' on the user page of [[User:DaisukeHamasaki‎]]?  Please don't edit the user pages of other users.

Well done on the creation of the new book.  I have queried the [[Simplex Physica/Mechanics‎]] page because it contains no content.  Please don't create pages unless you are ready to add content.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:53, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

The World [[File:Blender255WorldContextButton.png]] settings are where you control the background or sky settings for your scene. A scene doesn’t have to have a World, in which case the background will simply be black. Or you might be saving your images with a transparent Sky setting, in which case the background doesn’t matter anyway. But in other situations, you will want to control what appears here.

[[File:Blender270WorldSettingsDefault.png|thumb]]
Here is what the top two panels in the World Context look like in a new default document. (Settings further down for Ambient Occlusion, Environment Lighting and Indirect Lighting will be discussed later, when we get into lighting.)

“Ambient Color” is a sourceless, shadowless light, coming from all directions, to apply to all objects. Trouble is, its effect is very “flat”, washing out detail; it is probably better to use the Environment Lighting or Ambient Occlusion options (in panels further down) to soften murky shadows.

With none of the boxes checked, “Zenith Color” has no effect, only “Horizon Color” does; the sky will simply be a flat expanse of this colour. Also, checking “Paper Sky” and “Real Sky” on their own has no effect; they only work in conjunction with “Blend Sky”.

Check “Blend Sky” on its own. Now the sky takes on a gradation from “Zenith Color” at the zenith (straight up) to “Horizon Color”, not at the horizon, but at the nadir (straight down).

Check both “Blend Sky” and “Real Sky”. Now you get “Horizon Color” at the horizon, with a gradation to “Zenith Color” at both zenith ''and'' nadir.

The effect of “Blend Sky” with “Paper Sky” is a bit more subtle; it seems to mean that the horizon is always in the middle of the image, regardless of the orientation of the camera. The effect is more noticeable if you check “Real Sky” as well; otherwise it looks little different from “Blend Sky” on its own.

{{Clear}}

[[File:Blender270WorldSettingsExample1.png|thumb]]
Here is an example with contrasting horizon and zenith colours. I also set the camera field of view to 90°.
{{Clear}}

[[File:Blender270WorldExample1BlendSky.png|thumb]]
With only “Blend Sky” checked, a render looks like this.
{{Clear}}

[[File:Blender270WorldExample1RealSky.png|thumb]]
With “Blend Sky” and “Real Sky” checked, this is how the render comes out. Note how the cube is noticeably off-centre relative to the horizon band, because the camera view is at an angle to the horizontal.
{{Clear}}

[[File:Blender270WorldExample1RealPaperSky.png|thumb]]
And with all three of “Blend Sky”, “Real Sky” and “Paper Sky” checked, the result is this. The cube now looks like it is on the horizon, even though the camera angle is the same as the previous image.
{{Clear}}

You can also add a texture to your sky; this will be discussed [[../Texture Settings|later]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ORP-top}}
The [[&quot;queues&quot; Container]] is a top-level [[config.txt file]] entry used by various [[Content Types]].

The [[&quot;queues&quot; Container]] is a list of queue subcontainers (Queues) with no standalone tags. Queues are used by certain asset types (such as [[KIND Industry]] and [[KIND Traincar]]) to 'hold' [[KIND Product]] instances. Queues can make use of animated meshes or custom attachments to visually represent the amount of product they hold in game. Each queue subcontainer uses the following format.

Instances of queue subcontainers are represented in [[TrainzScript]] via [[Class ProductQueue]].



==Supported Tags==
Each queue subcontainer supports the following tags. Each tag is shown here with its default value.

  size                  0
  product-kuid          &lt;KUID:0:0&gt;
  initial-count         0
  passenger-queue       0
  per-hour              120
  animated-mesh         &quot;&quot;
  custom-attachments    &quot;&quot;
  attachment-points
  {
  }
  allowed-products
  {
  }
  allowed-categories
  {
  }
  conflicts-with-queues
  {
  }


====size====
:Type: Positive Integer
:Desc: The maximum size of the queue, in other words this is the maximum amount of product the queue can 'hold'.
====product-kuid====
:Type: KUID
:Desc: Used in conjuntion with the 'initial-count' tag, product-kuid specifies the initial {{TR|K|KIND Product}} type in the queue.

====initial-count====
:Type: Positive Integer
:Desc: Used in conjuntion with the 'product-kuid' tag, initial-count specifies the initial amount of product in the queue.
====passenger-queue====
:Type: Boolean
:Desc: Specifies that the queue can hold passengers.
====per-hour====
:Type: Positive Integer
:Desc: This flag is used for passenger stations and sets the base number of passengers that will accumulate over the period of one hour.
====animated-mesh====
:Type: String
:Desc: Specifies the name of an animated mesh from the mesh table. This mesh is used to visually represent the amount of product in the queue while in game and should animate from empty to full.
====custom-attachments====
:Type: String
:Desc: Specifies that this queue has custom attachment points. Custom attachments are used in game to visually represent the amount of product in the queue. An 'attachment-points' container is used to list the custom attachments.
====attachment-points====
:Type: String Container
:Desc: The 'attachment-points' container lists all of the mesh attachment points used to visually represent the amount of product in the queue. When the queue is empty the meshes attached on these points will be invisible, as the queue fills they will be progressively shown. The number of attachment points cannot exceed the total queue size.
====allowed-products====
:Type: KUID Container
:Desc: Lists the KUIDs of all of the various [[KIND Product]] assets that can accumulate in the queue.
====allowed-categories====
:Type: KUID Container
:Desc: Lists the KUIDs of all of the [[KIND Product-category]] assets that can accumulate in the queue. Allowing a product category means that all products of this category are allowed, they therefore do not need to be specified in the 'allowed-products' container.
====conflicts-with-queues====
:Type: String Container
:Desc: Sets a number of queues that this queue conlicts with. If any of the conflicting queues have product in them, then product cannot be added to this queue.

====kind====
:Type:       String
:Compulsory: Yes from 3.4 up
:Desc:       Identifies the asset as Kind Product.

====allows-mixing====
:Type:       Boolean
:Compulsory: Yes from 3.4 up
:Desc:       If set to '1', this product type may be mixed with other products in a single product queue. This is appropriate for some classes of boxed goods, for example, but not appropriate for most gases, liquids, or solid bulk loads such as gravel or coal.

====icon-texture====
:Type:       String (image file name including path)
:Compulsory: No
:Desc:       The ''icon-texture'' tag defines an icon which is used when referring to this product in-game, for example in a {{TR|KD|KIND Industry}} configuration panel.

====instance-type====
:Type:       String
:Compulsory: Yes from 3.4
:Desc:       This tag describes how products of this type are created (instanced) within a {{TR|c|queues container|s=product_queue|product queue}} and may be one of the following values:

{| border=1 cellpadding=2|colspan=2|
| '''''resource''''' || This indicates that instances of this product type are uniform, and that the software can track this product with a total number rather than a description of each instance. 
* ''This is by far the most efficient 'instance-type' and should be used unless there is a very strong reason to use another type.''
|-
|'''''instance'''''  || This indicates that each instance of this product is of a specific sub-type. The subtype is assigned randomly when the instance is first created, but is preserved as the instance is moved from queue to queue throughout the system.
* Queues of this ''instance-type'' are currently limited to 254 instances for performance reasons.
|-
| '''''unique'''''  || This indicates that each instance of this product is a true gamescript object. The object is preserved as the instance is moved from queue to queue throughout the system.
* Queues of this ''instance-type'' are currently limited to 4 instances for performance reasons.
|}


====mass====
:Type:       Float 
:Compulsory: Yes from 3.4
:Desc:       Determines the mass (in kilograms) of a single unit (or, single instance) of this product. This is used when calculating the mass of a loaded [[KIND Traincar]] instance.

====product-category====
:Type:       Kuid 
:Compulsory: Yes
:Desc:       Each product type may be assigned to a single [[KIND Product-category]].

====product-texture====
:Type:       String (image file name including path)
:Compulsory: No
:Desc:       The ''product-texture'' tag allows the specification of a local texture file to use when this product is visible as a bulk load. (TBD: link to product queue description.)

Possibly [[IB Physics]] should be deleted. It is more a set of notes than a book. It does not relate to the current IB Physics syllabus. And it appears to have been lifted without permission or attribution from [http://kstruct.com/ib_notes/IB_Physics]. I have good intentions to work on a rewrite although am not in any position to commit the time required to complete this. --[[User:Russell E|Russell E]] ([[User talk:Russell E|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Russell E|contribs]]) 09:46, 10 October 2012 (UTC)
:The 'notes' does not seem to be much of an issue as a set of notes can also be a book. Updating it to fit the current syllabus may also not be that difficult. However, as it was copied from a website without any copyright statement whatsoever, I agree that we'd better play safe and '''delete'''. [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

:The link to the copied website no longer functions. A definition of something should remain the same, no matter where it is. I will see if I have time to update this book so that it matches the current syllabus. However I am working on the IB Math HL book as well, I shall see if there is anyone from my school also in IB Physics that can help me with this. --[[::User:Lichking21st|Lichking21st]]

*: FTR, the Web site in question is still available [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://kstruct.com/ib_notes/IB_Physics from the Wayback machine.]  — [[User:Ivan Shmakov|Ivan Shmakov]] ([[User talk:Ivan Shmakov|d]] ▞ [[Special:Contributions/Ivan Shmakov|c]]) 17:58, 13 September 2013 (UTC)

[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Keep''' I am for updating it to the syllabus, rather than deleting it. I'm up to contribute as well, but I think it will be smarter to wait for the new syllabus. IB syllabuses are updated and changed every 3 years. This examination session (May 2013) will be the last one with the 2009 syllabus, after that, the new syllabus will be announced. It doesn't seem very smart to updated to a soon-out-of-date syllabus. 
(UPDATE: The book right now has very little in common with the actual syllabus, after updating it to a different syllabus it will have absolutely nothing to do with its previous version, thus there would be no copyvio)[[User:Gustavoh|Gustavoh]] ([[User talk:Gustavoh|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gustavoh|contribs]]) 17:03, 17 April 2013 (UTC)

* Keep it and fix it.  Parts of the document are ideal for IB study, especially the Q &amp; A format for assessment statements. {{unsigned3|Fzxbez}}
* I don't see a consensus to delete, or any indication that it wasn't moved over by the author (who used mediawiki too).  But rename to 'IB Physics 2009'.  The basics of IB Physics doesn't change, but the taxonomy and ordering does, as do details.

[[Esperanto/History]] should be deleted as it is out of the scope of the [[Esperanto]] book and is outdated.  [[User:Ebe123|Ebe123]] ([[User talk:Ebe123|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ebe123|contribs]]) 01:05, 5 August 2013 (UTC)
* {{question}} Could you explain, as background to your nomination of this,
:* how history of Esperanto can be out of scope for a book on Esperanto?
:* how ''history'' can be out of date?
: I can't imagine how, even if the &quot;history&quot; is out of date, that could be grounds for deletion.  If it's out of date, it should be updated.  Out-of-scope ''would'' seem to be a more significant reason, if it didn't seem on the face of it so unlikely for history of Esperanto in a book about Esperanto.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 11:50, 5 August 2013 (UTC)

In the past 4 years, my students of Structural Biochemistry at UC San Diego have been writing the wikibook. Without being perfect, it has reached a point in coverage, depth and quality that I feel confident that a student taking the course can do as well in the class consulting the wikibook, instead of purchasing an expensive book. We'll continue working on it. I believe that people interested in the field might find it useful too. Thank you, Hector Viadiu.

:{{support}}  What a monumental book!  It could use some navigation, but it sure appears to cover the subject in depth. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 03:09, 7 December 2011 (UTC)
:{{support}} I agree.  The subject matter goes over my head in parts but this is clearly a pretty outstanding book and it is truly collaborative which is exactly the kind of Featured Book we need to promote on Wikibooks.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:06, 7 December 2011 (UTC)
:{{comment}} Not quite ready yet. Needs all pages checked and flagged and the typos and formating errors removed. I looked at just two pages at random. The first had several spelling mistakes and the second had a messed up piece of Wiki format that meant the section heading was displaying incorrectly. I'm fine with the content, but it needs to be tidier to be truly featured quality. [[Structural_Biochemistry/Organic_Chemistry]] is a good example page - some of the images are too big, there are bare URLs with no explanation pointing to Wikipedia, a reference section right in the middle of the page, etc. Someone basically needs to copyedit it. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:12, 7 December 2011 (UTC)
::And it also needs someone to look at the image usage, and the text related to images. Many of the images are getting deleted from Commons resulting in text that refers to an image that is no longer there. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:32, 9 December 2011 (UTC)

I recommend Skateboard Alphabet Coloring Pages as a Wikijunior featured book.

Preschool, kindergarten and grade school children will have fun learning letters and numbers in coloring pictures of a &quot;skateboarding boy&quot; forming the letters and numbers. Alphabet charts and numbers charts worksheets are also available for kids, parents and teachers to print out.

:{{support}} I like it.  I do think the pictures ought to be made bigger so that if it were printed out, each one would take up an entire page.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 23:59, 20 February 2013 (UTC)

:'''oppose'''. No offence, but you're posting content already featured on your site, and there's nothing on the WB version that makes it significantly different from the one on your site. This may also constitute spamming to some. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Kayau|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]]) &lt;/small&gt; 13:19, 28 February 2013 (UTC)

Using my own interpretation of [[WB:WIW]], I set out to create a simple &quot;textbook&quot; guide that local campaigns could use to (quoting the introduction) &quot;create pragmatic, clear, and useful information to establish a consistent tone, style, and format between all of the messages&quot; they produce. I needed it to be short and easy to read so that short-term volunteers (like those in short municipal races, for example) would not have to invest a lot of their time reading all of this stuff on their own. If people wanted to read more, I wanted to make sure it was available ''vis-à-vis'' references and further information. At the same time, I wanted to make sure I avoided [[WB:SOAP]], so that anyone could use it, regardless of affiliation.

Overall, I think I've done that, hence the reason I'm nominating this for FB status. Although I'm sure I could add to or fiddle with a few sections here and there, I believe it meets the guidelines listed in [[Wikibooks:Good books]]. Your thoughts and constructive criticism is greatly appreciated.

*{{support}} It appears to be a well-written work.  It has decent navigation, and I detected no SOAP or NPoV violations.  For the type of work this is, that is impressive. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 17:26, 24 February 2013 (UTC)

*{{support}} I haven't read the book in detail but from the pages I have read I have to say that I really like this book.  The presentation is simple and the pages are short.  The questions asked on the pages are challenging and provide useful feedback to readers.  The use of images and video definitely adds to the book as well.  All in all, a very worthy candidate for Featured Books.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:06, 16 March 2013 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Uruguay=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first meters were installed in 1924.
* Most franks contain “URUGUAY”. One contains the abbreviation “R. O. del U.”, and one post office meter does not show the country name or an abbreviation.
* The stamps are grouped by design usage:
:: A – Private use stamps with simulated perforation border&quot;
:: B – Private use stamps with open design, incomplete outer border&quot;
:: C - Private use stamps with straight line border
:: PO – Stamps generated by meters in post offices

'''NOTE''': The typing scheme for Uruguay has been completely revised from the printed catalog. Apologies to those inconvenienced by this.

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The country was a region of the former Soviet Union and became an independent country in 1991.
* Meter stamps with former Soviet Union markings (“CCCP”, hammer and sickle logo, etc) were used after 1991.
* Meter stamps marked Uzbekisan have not yet been seen by us or reported although they probably exist.

==Introduction==
Trainz '''scenery assets''' are the heart and soul of Trainz' ability to depict a three-dimensional alternate reality in creating and allowing us to operate or build virtual worlds. They can be amazingly simple, or extremely complex dynamic animated objects which include {{n3V|TrainzScript Language Reference|Trainz scripting features}}. After the TS2009 data model solidified, a former similar grouping of assets, &quot;Trackside&quot; objects (with attachments to track splines, usually containing an offset and direction from the track they are attached onto) were gradually altered to a new standard which uses a {{N3V|Class Trackside|Trackside Class}}, so that both used the same base {{TRC|scenery-container}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The higher cost and lower cost of computer have an enormous impact on the modeling and design. The easy availability of powerful computer workstations and softwares or programming languages (e.g., MATLAB, LabView, wxMaxima, R and so on) allow for the interactive design of high-performance, robust controllers. The risk of failure often precludes the design and evaluation of controllers in live humans, so that devices and treatments are often tested on computer and animal models first. In the past, animals have been the preferred, but this approach is continually reevaluated as animals are rarely perfect models of human diseases and conditions. Tissue cultures start to satisfy some of this need, and computer modeling and simulation may also do this need. Today, computer models is used to (1) demonstrate feasibility,(2) increase confidence in controller designs by complementing animal studies, (3) help design better animal and clinical experiments, and (4) reduce the number of required animal and human experiments. In the future, use of the computer model would be extended.

==Basic Models of Physiologic Systems-Compartment Models==
This analysis involves dividing the physiological system into a number of interconnected compartments - where a compartment can be any anatomical, physiological, chemical or physical subdivision of a system. A basic assumption is that the tracer is uniformly distributed throughout a compartment. Among various compartment models, the simplest is the single compartment model. 

===Single Compartment Model===
[[Image:NM14_1a.gif|150 px|thumb|left|Figure 4.1.The single compartment model]]
[[File:NM14_5.gif|250px|thumb|right|Figure 4.2.Graphical illustration of the quantity of tracer, &lt;font color=red&gt;q&lt;/font&gt; versus time for relatively high and low values of the fractional turnover, &lt;font color=red&gt;k&lt;/font&gt;.]]
Figure 4.1 shows a single compartment model that the flow of a tracer through a blood vessel follows an ideal bolus injection. The compartment in the system is closed except for the inflow and outflow of the trace, and the tracer is injected as illustrated. In this theory, the tracer will mix immediately and uniformly throughout the compartment according to its injection.  And its quantity will reduce with time depending on the rate of outflow. 
The variables used in the system are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''q'':  the quantity of tracer in the compartment at time, ''t'', and&lt;br /&gt;
''F'': the outflow.&lt;/center&gt;
If we define the '''fractional turnover''', ''k'', as the ratio of these two parameters, i.e.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{-dq/dt}{q}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

which can be rewritten as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt} = -kq&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

And the solution to this equation is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;q = q_0\ exp(-kt)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the quantity of tracer present at time, ''t'' = 0.
This equation is plotted in Figure 4.2.

===Two Compartment Model-a closed system===
[[Image:NM14_6.gif|300px|thumb|left|Figure 4.3 Closed two compartment model]]
[[Image:NM14_16.gif|300px|thumb|left|Figure 4.4 The change in the quantity of tracer in Compartments #1 and #2 versus time in a closed compartment model.]]
In a closed system the tracer simply moves between the two compartments without any overall loss or gain as shown in Figure 4.3. Therefore,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq_1}{dt} = k_{21} q_2 - k_{12} q_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\frac{dq_2}{dt} = k_{12} q_1 - k_{21} q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Since there is no loss of tracer from the system,

&lt;math&gt;q_1 + q_2 = \text{constant} = q_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq_1}{dt} = -\frac{dq_2}{dt}\,,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
As the quantity of tracer in Compartment #1 decreases, the quantity in Compartment #2 increases, and vice versa. And when the tracer is injected into Compartment #1 at time, t = 0,

{| cellpadding=&quot;8&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:0px auto;&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;q_1 = q_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || and || &lt;math&gt;q_2 = 0\,,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

So, at the initial stage

{| cellpadding=&quot;8&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:0px auto;&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{dq_1}{dt} = -k_{12} q_0&lt;/math&gt; || and || &lt;math&gt;\frac{dq_2}{dt} = k_{12} q_0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The solutions to this system are:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;q_1 = q_0 \left \lbrack 1 - \frac{k_{12}}{k_{12} + k_{21}} \left \lbrace 1 -\ \text{exp}\ - (k_{12} + k_{21}) t \right \rbrace \right \rbrack&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;q_2 = q_0 \left \lbrack \frac{k_{12}}{k_{12} + k_{21}} \left \lbrace 1 -\ \text{exp}\ - (k_{12} + k_{21}) t \right \rbrace \right \rbrack&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Figure 4.4 shows one of these system if the volume of the compartment are the same.
===Two Compartment Model - Open Catenary System===
Two compartments connected like chain and the last compartment have a sink as shown in Figure 4.5.
[[File:NM14_17.gif|left|300px|thumb|Figure 4.5 Open catenary two compartment model.]]
[[File:NM14_22.gif|right|150px|thumb|Figure 4.6 The quantity of tracer versus time in the open catenary two compartment model.]]
In this model,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq_1}{dt} = -k_{12} q_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\frac{dq_2}{dt} = k_{12} q_1 - k_{20} q_2&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions to these equations are:

&lt;math&gt;q_1 = q_0\ \text{exp}(-k_{12}t)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;q_2 = q_0 \frac{k_{12}}{k_{12} - k_{20}}\lbrack \text{exp}(-k_{20}t) - \text{exp}(-k_{12}t)\rbrack\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the behaviour of ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is shown in Figure 4.6.

===Two compartment Model- Open Mammillary System===
The central compartment have a sink which is not related to the other compartment. Although these compartments do not necessarily have a physiological significance, 
common designations are: 
*Comp 1 (central) - blood and well perfused organs, e.g. liver, kidney, etc.; &quot;plasma&quot;
*Comp 2 (peripheral) - poorly perfused tissues, e.g. muscle, lean tissue, fat; &quot;tissue&quot;
[[Image:NM14_23.gif|300px|left|thumb|Figure 4.7 Open mamillary two compartment model.]]
[[Image:NM14_33.gif|right|thumb|Figure 4.8 The quantity of tracer versus time in the open mamillary two compartment model.]]
In this case,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq_1}{dt} = -k_{10}q_1 - k_{12}q_1 + k_{21}q_2&lt;/math&gt; 
and 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq_2}{dt} = k_{12}q_1 - k_{21}q_2&lt;/math&gt;

At ''t'' = 0:

&lt;math&gt;q_1 = q_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2 = 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

So,the solutions are:

&lt;math&gt;q_1 = q_0 \left \lbrack \frac{k_{21} - a_1}{a_2 - a_1} \text{exp}(-a_1t) + \frac{k_{21} - a_2}{a_1 - a_2}\text{exp}(-a_2t) \right \rbrack&lt;/math&gt;
and

&lt;math&gt;q_2 = \frac{q_0 k_{12}}{a_2 - a_1} \lbrack \text{exp}(-a_1t) - \text{exp}(-a_2t) \rbrack&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Trainz Templates Documentation|TR]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;div style={{TRS-style}}&gt;
;Purpose
This template presents a single template to access sub-pages of major Trainz reference 'Tabs' (divisions) making a proper link to [[Trainz/Kinds]]/subpage, [[Trainz/references]]/subpage and [[Trainz/tags]]/subpage when given &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as the subpage link. Otherwise it connects to each of those parent division pages.

;usage
This template forms an internal link to ''the specified Trainz Books {{TR|R|3=references}} pages (Wikibook sub-pages or '''Chapters''''') (with the case-insensitive &lt;code&gt;controlling parameter &lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; being used to switch which chapter and table of contents is being selected.
&amp;nbsp;

The first parameter ('1' or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) also varies formatting of the displayed link and how the &lt;code&gt;''subpage name parameter'' &lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted ''during link formation''.
:* In general, if &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; contains &lt;code&gt;the letter 'D' &lt;/code&gt; the template processes &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as a'' 'literal' or ''''d'''irect link' case, and otherwise (no 'd' or 'D' in '1')... will append suffixed keywords tag, container, or prefix KIND to the keyword.
&amp;nbsp;
:* These forms correspond directly to the same page names as pages in the TrainzOnline Wiki main namespace&amp;mdash;the reference and normally the source page for the EXPANDED material added in the pages here.
&lt;br&gt;
;Linking externally
:* The one deviation is we always omit the encapsulating quote marks and link to the N3V wiki to any apropos redirect page title instead -- that is a page without paired quotes in the name... Note the [[Template: N3V]] may be used to make a direct link to ANY OF the N3V wiki namespace pages--given a partial url (interim, TOBECONTINUED), and [[Template:Plain link]] will take any url and connect to a web page given a full URL.
&amp;nbsp;
:* The template also handles certain singular or plural suffixing on the pass parameter. Experience shows that if the page exists, the link needs must be the other form. So for example if the page is an important tag keyword, and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TR|T|tag-name}} is a redlink, try {{TR|S|tagname}} or {{TR|TS... or {{TR|ST... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, each being valid '1' placeholder parameter values handled by the template logic for class tags.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
{{TextBox|1=For any class data case, link formation may also contain a section title. This is specified by defining one of the explicit parameters &lt;code&gt; 'sect', 's', or 'sect' &lt;/code&gt; and these must be lower case. ( 's' != 'S', nor does SECT equate to sect).
}}
---- 
;Detailed usage
# When the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}} parameter&lt;/nowiki&gt; is undefined, the template links to the [[Trainz/references]] page which holds the reference pages '''Table of Contents'''. This link is shown above this usage as most of the template becomes irrelevant (vaporware!). 
# In implementation, to make this template serve as many uses as possible, ''this style template operates slightly differently than a direct linking template:''
## Those that append or Prefix a key word (suffix==container while KIND==prefix, and the tags are suffixed either tag or tags) also have a direct mode for passing the full spelling of their string. (See table under, containers, Kinds, and Tags only.)
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; has these legal values and forms the matching links: 
## {{Col|&lt;nowiki&gt;'|CON|C='&lt;/nowiki&gt;|blue}} selects the page [[Trainz/containers]] (TOC) or one of it's sub-pages by building a link &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ Trainz/containers/{{{2}}} container&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Col|&lt;sup&gt;#3&lt;/sup&gt;|blue}}&lt;nowiki&gt;| {{{3|{{{2|}}} container}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ⇒ (a space+container added as suffix) {{bullR
}} The {{Col|&lt;sup&gt;#3&lt;/sup&gt; represents a logical test|blue}} to see if &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; pass parameter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is defined, and if so, appends it as a section link to a anchor or '''section title''' (tags on kind and containers pages have sections detailing their scope and use) as part of the link.{{BullR
}} As always with section linking, the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; parameter {{col|'''must use''' underscores}} for spaces.{{BullR}}For the benefit of those less familiar with template parsing, {{Tlx|3=References_TOC_notations}} will form a link to the page addressed. In this example, to the 'References TOC notations' section of [[Trainz/references]].{{BullR
}} {{Col|While not shown again, the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; parameter is tested and appended when defined to all links formed by any and all of the following options as well.
## {{Col|&lt;nowiki&gt;'|KD|DK=&lt;/nowiki&gt;|blue}} (kind's 'direct mode') selects the page &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Kinds/{{{2|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Col|&lt;sup&gt;#3&lt;/sup&gt;|blue}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|{{{3|{{{2|}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (TOC) or one of it's sub-pages by building a link &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ Trainz/Kinds/KIND {{{2}}}|{{{3| KIND {{{2|}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;{{bullR}}{{Col|&lt;sup&gt;#3&lt;/sup&gt;|blue}} is as advertised...
## {{Col|&lt;nowiki&gt;'|KIND|K|KINDS=&lt;/nowiki&gt;|blue}} selects the page [[Trainz/Kinds]] (TOC) or one of it's sub-pages by building a link &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ Trainz/Kinds/KIND {{{2}}}| KIND {{{3|{{{2|}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
## {{Col|&lt;nowiki&gt;'|L|DIR|DIRECT=&lt;/nowiki&gt;|blue}} selects the page &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/{{{2}}}|{{{3|{{{2|}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (the Main / TOC page) or one of it's sub-pages in the same way.
## Similarly, {{Col|&lt;nowiki&gt;'|A|AM|AM&amp;C=&lt;/nowiki&gt;|blue}} selects the page &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/AM&amp;C/{{{2}}}|{{{3|{{{2|}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (the {{TA}} / TOC page) or one of it's sub-pages in the same way. 
## Similarly, {{Col|&lt;nowiki&gt;'|CC=&lt;/nowiki&gt;|blue}} selects the page &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/content Creation/{{{2}}}|{{{3|{{{2|}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (the {{TC|}} TOC page) or one of it's sub-pages in the same way. 
## {{Col|&lt;nowiki&gt;'|TAG1|T1|T='&lt;/nowiki&gt;|blue}} selects the page &lt;code&gt;[[Trainz/tags]]&lt;/code&gt; (Sub-TOC) or one of it's sub-pages by building a link &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ Trainz/tags/{{{2}}} tag&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Col|&lt;sup&gt;#3&lt;/sup&gt;|blue}}&lt;nowiki&gt;| {{{3|{{{2|}}} tag}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
## Similarly, {{Col|&lt;nowiki&gt;'|ST|S|TS|TAGS|T2=&lt;/nowiki&gt;|blue}} selects the page a&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/tags/{{{2}}}|{{{3|{{{2|}}} tags}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (the same sub-TOC page) or one of it's sub-pages in the same way, but suffix is &lt;u&gt;plural&lt;/u&gt;, which names end with 'S'.  

* Likely Reference 'chapters' (major &lt;code&gt;Sub-TOC's and topic groups&lt;/code&gt;) ''as currently schemed/expected (in mid-May 2014)'' are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;/Appendixes, /tags, /containers, Kinds, /Scenery, /Scripting, /Splines, /Tracks, /Trackside,&lt;/code&gt; etc. (partial and conjectural) As of mid-August, only Kinds, tags, and containers have any population pages.

{{TextBox|1=
: IN ALL Cases, including the below the parameter ''''&lt;nowiki&gt;|p=&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''' so {{col|'''(&lt;nowiki&gt;p=&lt;/nowiki&gt;''pretty-name'')'''|blue}} forms a over-riding'' 'pretty name' ''for display'' of the desired link-to-page of the '[[Trainz references]] division' ''of the [[Trainz]] Wikibook projects.
:* It is in fact the case for &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; [[:category:Trainz Templates|Trainz linking templates]] by design.
}} 
'''&lt;u&gt;In-line Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TR|DC|queues container}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; links as if written: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/containers/queues container]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the actual link and display
:::generated is: &lt;code&gt;{{TR|DC|queues container}} &lt;/code&gt; shows this mode.

* Similarly to link a sub-section: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TR|DC|queues|custom-attachments}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links as if written: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/containers/queues container#custom-attachments|custom-attachments]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the link 
:::displays only: &lt;code&gt;{{TR|DC|queues|custom-attachments}}&lt;/code&gt; 
:'''But!''' ... is much easier to edit around on a page when trying to get the best prose presentation.

      <comment>/* A Basic Program */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">:This book attempts to introduce the C Language to new users while making the learning process interesting and giving them code to play with and modify as they continue educating themselves. The author of this book is a novice C programmer, writing for beginners, so I may not always use the best practice. Users who are interested in a more indepth understanding of the C language are recommended to check out the excellent [[C Programming|C_Programming Wikibook]].

== Code Disclaimer ==

:I'm new to sharing code with others, so I feel I should state that the code included in this Wikibook is generated by the author and any resemblance to code out in the wild is not intentional unless it is something basic like the implementation of a data structure (linked list, heap, etc). 

== Work Environment ==

This book recommends beginners use a Linux distribution, such as Linux Mint or Ubuntu. Although I'm unfamiliar with C programming on Windows, Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler should be able to compile C code, if it is available to you. The C language is easy to start learning in the Unix/Linux environment because the Gnu C Compiler (GCC) is included by default on most distributions. GCC is a command line utility that transforms C source code into machine instructions (binary). For writing your code, you'll need a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE). A easy to use IDE is Geany, which you can find using your package manager on Linux.

Text Editors can be as basic as notepad or as complex as Vim and Emacs.

== A Basic Program ==

Let's cover variables and standard IO in one fell swoop.

intro.c
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    char input[50];   // # of characters we can read from standard input.
    char name[50];    // variable to contain a name

    printf(&quot;What is your name good sir?\n&quot;);
    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
    sscanf(input, &quot;%s&quot;, &amp;name);
    printf(&quot;Ah, %s, a pleasure to meet you.\n&quot;, name);
    return(0);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Before we compile this, let's review what our code does.

=== Header Files ===

The '''#include''' statement at the start of the program lets the compiler know that we want to use a library. Libraries in C are called Header files and end in the &quot;.h&quot; file extension. The C language contains standard libraries to perform all sorts of common tasks. STDIO, as the name implies, contains various functions for printing and reading. 

=== Main Function / Statements ===

At the heart of every C program is the Main function. It contains the body of the program and is the first function called when the program is started. All functions follow this syntax:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;datatype functionName (datatype argument) { 
   statement;
   return (datatype);   // The datatype before the function name lets the 
                        // compiler know this is the kind of variable we will return.
}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A statement can be a variable declaration ( x = 100; ) or a function call ( CallingFunction(); ). All statements end with a semicolon and it is good practice to give every statement its own line. It's also important to check your code carefully to make sure you aren't missing any semicolons.

=== Data Types ===

There are 3 basic data types in C that we must use to declare our variables. We declare them using data types so
the compiler knows exactly what each variable contains. They include:
# char  (example 'a' | a single character)
# int   (example 123 | a whole number)
# float (example 12.345 | a fractional number)

In our example we use char, but add brackets and a number after it. The syntax '''Variable[#]''' lets the compiler know that instead of a single character, we want an '''Array''' (string of characters).

=== Input/Output ===

We are using 3 functions from STDIO: printf, fgets, and sscanf. Our stdin and stdout comes from the command line where we will run the code.

'''Printf''' prints a string (as denoted by quotation marks) to standard output. If placeholders are present in the string (%letter) it will also print variables. '''Fgets''' reads in a line from standard input and puts it in our variable called Input. '''Sscanf''' looks at our variable called input and transfers it over to the variable called name. We'll want to use Input again when we get user input, so we can't leave our information in there or we'll overwrite it!

=== Returns ===

Return statements can return 1 datatype or variable from a function. The simplest example of why we use returns is to see if something is true or false. If you have a function called isCapital and call it on a letter, for example, isCapital('a') we would return(False). If we called isCapital('B'), we'd have our function return(True). The function that called the isCapital function would be designed to make a decision based on the value we returned.

Functions don't need to return a value though. Sometimes you may see 'void' used before a function. This means that the function doesn't return a datatype at all.

=== Compilation ===

Now that we've covered what our code does, let's compile and run it. Navigate to the folder that your C program is contained in. If you are unfamiliar with BASH, you'll need to learn about the '''cd''' and '''ls''' commands.  From the command terminal type:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;gcc intro.c -o intro&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This command calls the compiler (GCC) to compile Intro.c and output an executable called Intro. If for some reason your file is not set as an executable after compilation, you can type:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;chmod +x intro&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To run your executable, type:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./intro&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

That wasn't as simple as printing &quot;Hello World&quot; but hopefully it wasn't too difficult to follow. As you continue reading, things should start to make more sense as you begin recognizing common patterns in programming.

=== Experiment #1 ===

Before we move on, take a moment to tweak our Intro program. Declare an int variable called age. Change the first print statement to ask your age and use the integer placeholder %d to print your age in the second print statement.

== A Modular Lifestyle ==

It would be very difficult to read large programs if we kept all of our functions and variables in one file. Suppose also, that we create a great function and want to use it in all of our programs, how would we do that?

If we want our reusable function to do what our last program did, we just take all the statements from before, put them in a function with a unique name, and place them in a header file. 

greet.h
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int Greet() {
    char input[50];   // # of characters we can read from standard input.
    char name[50];    // variable to contain a name

    printf(&quot;What is your name good sir?\n&quot;);
    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
    sscanf(input, &quot;%s&quot;, &amp;name);
    printf(&quot;Ah, %s, a pleasure to meet you.\n&quot;, name);
    return(0);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Greet.h can now be included in our program like STDIO, and we don't even need to compile it before using it. The only difference is that instead of sharp brackets &lt;&gt; we use quotes &quot;&quot;. If your main program and your header file are in the same folder, '''#include &quot;Greet.h&quot;''' is all you need to specify. If they are in different folders, you'll need to provide the fullpath for the compiler '''#include &quot;fullpath/Greet.h&quot;''' 

main_prog.c
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &quot;greet.h&quot;

int main() {
   Greet();    // We declared this function in greet.h
   return(0);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

When main_prog.c is compiled, the compiler looks for the header files and includes them in the compilation. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
gcc main_prog.c -o main_prog
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

main_prog, the executable, will contain the machine instructions for the main program and the Greet file.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
./main_prog
What is your name good sir?
Theodore Roosevelt
Ah, Theodore Roosevelt, a pleasure to meet you.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

= Models and Theories in Human Computer Interaction =

== Goal ==
We will develop content for a new wikibook where we critically assess models and theories relevant to the field of Human Computer Interaction.

==Foreword==
Being that the nature of the field of Human Computer Interaction is that it is interdisciplinary, theories and models proceed and are adapted from many other disciplines. There are but a few of which we could call &quot;genuinely native&quot; HCI theories and models. To complicate matters, computerized systems change at a vertiginous pace and changes are often surreptitious. It seems as if Kurzweil was not as far off from fact with his predictions. Through this course, we will learn, critique, apply, and expand theories and models to make them relevant to the state of the field.

Looking through the Association of Computer Machinery Special Interest Group on Computer Human Interaction's (SIGCHI) repository, this researcher has not been able to zero in on a book that addresses the needs of a course in models and theories for our discipline. Therefore, we will use our textbook and articles to guide our discussion and we will collaborate in documenting the state of matters through this WikiBook.

Monoids aren't so complicated. I think this chapter could be improved to be a little more friendly and step-by-step with beginners in mind and then moved into the beginners track. [[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 17:45, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

:I have thought about moving it to Intermediate Haskell too, either just before or just after the Functor chapter. It would make us able to mention monoids in the MonadPlus chapter without further ado, and perhaps make it easier to at least mention Foldable and Traversable early on. However, moving it would probably require toning down the examples, which would be unfortunate. Another thing to consider is that at least half of Advanced Haskell (the first part of the track) is not really &quot;advanced&quot; at all, but merely &quot;stuff that happens to be after monads&quot; (I would say that about Monoid, Applicative, mutable state, a future chapter about Foldable and Traversable, and perhaps even Arrow).--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 18:53, 13 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

== [[Chapter 1: Intro, What’s a Model/Theory?, Framework: Perception]] ==

This book which you created recently has been queried by a Wikibooks user because it does not seem to be a book nor part of an existing book.  There is no book called ''Chapter 1:Intro, What's a Model''.  Should it be part of another book?  If the page isn't developed further it may be deleted within the next 7 days.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:56, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
:OK, I have now moved the sub-page and the main page of the book to new locations so that they match titles of other books and so that they can be found more easily.  The new locations are:
* [[Models and Theories in Human-Computer Interaction]] - for the main page of the book
* [[Models and Theories in Human-Computer Interaction/What’s a Model]] - for the sub-page.

I think most people who want to learn HTML are aware that HTML is not a programming language. I think it's best not to keep them. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Kayau|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]]) &lt;/small&gt; 11:28, 17 March 2013 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt;{{keep}}&lt;/s&gt; That's not necessarily the case. I think it's best to keep it. [[User:Liam987|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;border:1px solid;background:#0055A4;text-shadow:0 5px 8px #850000&quot;&gt;'''Liam987'''&lt;/span&gt;]] 13:22, 17 March 2013 (UTC)
:WB doesn't generally have 'similar meaning' redirects (e.g. [[Introduction to Lorem Ipsum]] wouldn't redirect to [[A Beginner's Guide to Lorem Ipsum]]) and in this case, the redirects are actually ''wrong''... [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Kayau|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]]) &lt;/small&gt; 14:13, 17 March 2013 (UTC)

:{{keep}} Seems to be a useful redirect.  There are plenty of people who would consider it to be a programming language even if it isn't and people are far more likely to search for 'HTML Programming' than the wordy 'Hyper-text markup language' (which is the actual name of the book).--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:34, 17 March 2013 (UTC)
:{{del}} subpage redirects, {{keep}} book redirect. People can still find it by searching for 'HTML Programming' without the subpages. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:44, 17 March 2013 (UTC)
:: {{comment}} I hadn't realised that there were redirects for every page of the book.  In that case, any redirects other than the front page should be deleted. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:15, 17 March 2013 (UTC)
:{{comment}} Be aware that [[HTML]] already redirects to this book, and it is likely that those who do not know the name of the book on HTML are likely to simply type this in to the search box, instead of the full &quot;[[HTML Programming]]&quot;  - [[User:Liam987|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;border:1px solid;background:#0055A4;text-shadow:0 5px 8px #850000&quot;&gt;'''Liam987'''&lt;/span&gt;]] 14:16, 18 March 2013 (UTC)

* {{keep}} Lack of progress isn't  reason to delete.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:31, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
* {{keep}}. I was inclined to revert the {{tlx|rfd}} as an editor who turns up once every 2 years to RFD the same book and do nothing else does not appear to be acting constructively. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 13:18, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
* {{keep}} Just a clarification: [[User:Bartek.a.gorny]] and [[User:Bartek.gorny]] are probably the same person, and the latter did make substantial contributions to the book back in 2007. That doesn't justify the RfD though. Also, note that, though the book is inactive, the [http://www.erp5.com/ ERP5 project] is active, so we are not even talking about obsolete software.--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 15:55, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

====Prokofiev====
* written in 1917, during the time of the Russian Revolution, this meant that that everything was in chaos as there was such fight for power. The economy collapsed causing composers either stay or leave. Prokofiev decided to leave. He went to France and then the US, where he wasn't all that successful. 



====Chen Yung====
* written in 1967, during the Cultural Revolution, this meant that anything that wasn't Chinese was to be eliminated because they didn't want any influence from other cultures, under Mao's orders. In this period people weren't allowed to play western instruments like the piano, violin, to the point where if they were caught their fingers would be crushed. However, there were exceptions, which is where Chen Yung came in, as he played an arrangement of the &quot;Yellow River Cantata,&quot; which was a highly favoured piece, as it was written for the revolution. It was known as a propaganda piece written to promote communism and recall the atrocities of the Japanese invasion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">(texture can refer to orchestration or the use of that instrumentation)

====Prokofiev====
* As he is imitating the classical period, as his piece is neoclassical, he uses instrumentation of the classical period meaning that the texture can be seen as polyphonic with intervals of complex homophony and imitation. 

====Chen Yung====
* Thinner texture as the piano is emphasized and the orchestra is more for support. Sometimes there is a conversation (call and response) between the piano and the orchestra. The texture can be seen as homophonic as the piano is being featured, while the orchestra is playing more of an accompanying role.</text>

      <comment>/* G protein-gated Ion Channels */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'See also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology Wikipedia,Electrophysiology].

Electrophysiology is the branch of the biomedical engineering dealing with the study of electric activity in the body. Electrophysiology includes the study of the production of electrical activity and the effects of that electrical activity on the body.  It involves measurements of voltage change or electrical current flow by electrodes in various systems, from single ion channel proteins to single neurons (particularly action potentials) and whole tissues like the heart. 

==Membrane Potential==
[[File:Basis of Membrane Potential2.png|thumb|right|400px|Differences in concentration of ions on opposite sides of a plasma membrane lead to a voltage called the membrane potential. Typical values of membrane potential are in the range –40 mV to –80 mV. Many ions have a concentration gradient across the membrane, including  potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), which is at a high concentration inside and a low concentration outside the membrane.  Sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and chloride (Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) ions are at high concentrations in the extracellular region, and low concentrations in the intracellular regions.  These concentration gradients provide the potential energy to drive the formation of the membrane potential.  This '''voltage''' is established when the membrane has permeability to one or more ions.  In the simplest case, illustrated here, if the membrane is selectively permeable to potassium, these positively charged ions can diffuse down the concentration gradient to the outside of the cell, leaving behind uncompensated negative charges.  This separation of charges is what causes the membrane potential.  Note that the system as a whole is electro-neutral.  The &quot;uncompensated&quot; positive charges outside the cell, and the uncompensated negative charges inside the cell, physically line up on the membrane surface and attract each other across membrane.  Thus, the membrane potential is physically located only in the  immediate vicinity of the membrane. It is the separation of these charges across the membrane that is the basis of the membrane voltage.  Note also that this diagram is only an approximation of the ionic contributions to the membrane potential.  Other ions including sodium, chloride, calcium and others play a more minor role, even though they have strong concentration gradients, because they have more limited permeability than potassium.  Key: Blue pentagons - sodium ions; Purple squares - potassium ions; Yellow circles - Choloride ions; Orange rectangles - Anions (these arise from a variety of sources including proteins).  The large purple structure with an arrow represents a transmembrane potassium channel and the direction of net potassium movement. ]]

Our Body is electrically neutral but our body cells are surrounded by a membrane made up of a lipid bilayer with proteins embedded in it. The membrane have a role as an insulator and a diffusion barrier to the movement of ions. Ion transporter/pump proteins push ions across the membrane to get concentration gradients across the membrane, and ion channels allow ions to move across the membrane down those concentration gradients. Ion pumps and ion channels are electrically same to a set of batteries and resistors in the membrane. Within membrane and outside membrane, one charge may predominates. Opposite charges try to attract and energy must be used to separate them. Conversely when opposite charges bring together, energy is liberated. Therefore separated electrical charges have potential energy.

In electrically active tissue, voltage can be measured by inserting an electrode at two point, for instance one inside and one outside the cell, and is called the potential difference or difference in electrical potential. Voltage is the ability to drive an electric current across a resistance. Flow of electrical charge from one point to another is called current. The amount of charge moving between two points depends on voltage and resistance (hindering of flow of charge). So, the simplest definition of a voltage is given by '''Ohm's law''':

&lt;math&gt;V=IR&lt;/math&gt;

where I is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, V is the potential difference measured across the conductor in units of volts, and R is the resistance of the conductor in units of '''ohms'''. Current is proportional to voltage (the greater the voltage, the greater the current) and is inversely proportional to resistance (the greater the resistance, the less the current). 

In the body, electrical currents correspond to the flow of ions across cellular membranes and any resistance is provided by the membrane themselves. Various ion channels occur in the plasma membranes and classified as being either passive or active:
*Passive (leakage) channels are always open
*Active (gated) channels that are made up of one or more proteins capable of undergoing changes to open or close
**Chemically gated channels
**Voltage-dependent channels
**Other gated channels
Ions move along chemical gradients (due to diffusion) and along electrical gradients (move toward an opposite charge); therefore ions flow along electrochemical gradients.

In non-excitable cells, and in excitable cells in their baseline states, the membrane potential has a relatively steady value, called the resting potential. The opening and closing of ion channels can cause a departure from the resting potential. This is called a '''depolarization''' if the interior voltage moves to a more positive membrane potential, or a '''hyperpolarization''' if the interior voltage becomes more negative . In excitable cells, a sufficiently large depolarization can make an action potential, in which the membrane potential changes rapidly and clearly for a short time (on the order of 1 to 100 milliseconds), often reversing its polarity. 

Changes in membrane potential (specially if induced by activation of ligand-gated channels) are also defined as either: 
* '''Excitatory''': membrane depolarization
* '''Inhibitory''': membrane hyperpolarization

===Transport Membrane===
[[File:Active-passive transport.jpg|300 px|thumbnail|left|Figure 5.1 Transport membrane]]
Membrane transport means the movement of particles (solute) across or through a membranous barrier&lt;ref name=&quot;tm1&quot;&gt; {{cite book |author=Reginald H. Garrett;Charles M. Grisham|title=Biochemistry|publisher=Brooks Cole; 4th Ed |location=Boston |year=2008 |isbn=10- 0495109355|doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cell, these membranous barriers is composed of a phospholipid bilayer. The phospholipids orient themselves automatically so that the hydrophilic (polar) heads are nearest the extracellular and intracellular mediums, and the hydrophobic (non-polar) tails align between the two hydrophilic head groups like the principle of the soap in the water.

Membrane transport depends on the permeability of the membrane, transmembrane solute concentration, and the size and charge of the solute. &lt;ref name=&quot;tm1&quot; /&gt;Solute particles can pass through the membrane via three mechanisms: passive, facilitated, and active transport. Some of these transport mechanisms need the input of energy and use of a transmembrane protein, whereas other mechanisms do not accept secondary molecules.&lt;ref name=&quot;tm2&quot;&gt; {{cite book |author=Stein, W. D. |title=The Movement of Molecules Across Cell Membranes|publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |year=1967. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Passive transport====
Passive transport rely on the concentration gradient, hydrophobicity, the size and charge of the solute. In passive transport, small uncharged solute particles diffuse across the membrane until both sides of the membrane have reached an equilibrium that is similar in concentration. &lt;ref name=&quot;tm3&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Mathews  C. K. | author2 = Van Holde, K.E | author3 = Ahern, K.G | title = Bioquímica | edition = 3rd | year = 2003 |  isbn = 84-7829-053-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=====Fick's first law=====
Fick's first law could be used to describe the passive transport of molecules across membranes.
 
&lt;math&gt;\bigg. J = -D \frac{\Delta c}{\Delta x} \bigg. &lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt; J&lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;diffusion flux&quot; [(amount of substance) per unit area per unit time], for example &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{\mathrm{mol}}{ \mathrm m^2\cdot \mathrm s})&lt;/math&gt;. 

* &lt;math&gt;\, D&lt;/math&gt; is the '''diffusion coefficient''' or '''diffusivity''' in dimensions of [length&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; time&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;], for example &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{\mathrm m^2}{\mathrm s})&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\, \Delta c&lt;/math&gt; (for ideal mixtures) is the concentration in dimensions of [amount of substance per unit volume], for example &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{\mathrm {mol}}{\mathrm m^3})&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\, \Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the position [length], for example &lt;math&gt;\,\mathrm m&lt;/math&gt;

====Facilitated transport====
Facilitated diffusion is a kind of passive transport mediated by transport proteins imbedded within the cellular membrane.&lt;ref name=&quot;tm4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cusslera, E.; Arisa, R.;  Bhown, A.|title=On the limits of facilitated diffusion. |journal= Journal of Membrane Science|volume=2-3|pages=149-164|year= 1989|DOI:10.1016/S0376-7388(00)85094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Active transport====
Active transport is the movement of particles through a transport protein from low concentration to high concentration at the expense of metabolic energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;tm4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hodgkin, A.; Keynes, R.|title=Active transport of cations in giant axons from sepia and loligo. |journal= The Journal of Physiology|volume=128|pages=28-60|year=1955|pmc=1365754}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=====Primary active transport=====
[[File:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|300px|thumbnail|left|The action of the sodium-potassium pump is an example of primary active transport.]]
Primary active transport directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane. Most of the enzymes that perform this type of transport are transmembrane ATPases.Based on the transport mechanism as well as genetic and structural homology, These ATP-dependent ion pumps can be classified into four types:&lt;ref&gt;Guyton, Arthur C.; Hall, John E. (2006). &quot;Textbook of Medical Physiology&quot;, Elsevier. &lt;/ref&gt;

# '''P-type ATPase''': sodium potassium pump, calcium pump, proton pump
# '''F-ATPase''': mitochondrial ATP synthase, chloroplast ATP synthase
# '''V-ATPase''': vacuolar ATPase
# '''ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter''': MDR, CFTR, etc.

The P-, F- and V-types only transport ions, while the ABC superfamily also transports small molecules.

=====Secondary active transport=====
{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=horizontal|width=300|image1=Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|caption1=Secondary active transport|image2=Porters.PNG|caption2=Function of Symports and Antiports}}

Secondary active transport is known as ''coupled transport'' or ''co-transport'' as energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, compared to primary active transport, there is no direct coupling of ATP; instead, the electrochemical potential difference by pumping ions out of the cell is used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physiologyweb.com/lecture_notes/membrane_transport/secondary_active_transport.html Physiologyweb,lecture note]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1960, in Prague, Robert K. Crane presented for the first time his cotransport mechanism for intestinal glucose absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Robert K. Crane |first1=Robert K. |last1=Crane |first2=D. |last2=Miller |first3=I. |last3=Bihler |chapter=The restrictions on possible mechanisms of intestinal transport of sugars |editor=Kleinzeller, A.; Kotyk, A. |title=Membrane Transport and Metabolism. Proceedings of a Symposium held in Prague, August 22–27, 1960 |publisher=[[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Czech Academy of Sciences]] |location=Prague |year=1961 |pages=439–449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotransporters can be divided as symporters and antiporters depending on whether the substances move in the same or opposite directions.

# '''symporters''': Both molecules are transported into the same direction across a membrane.
# '''antiporters''': Two species of ion or other solutes are pumped in opposite directions across a membrane.

===Ion Channels===
[[Image:Ion channel.png|thumb|left|200px|Schematic diagram of an ion channel. '''1''' - channel domains (typically four per channel), '''2''' - outer vestibule, '''3''' - selectivity filter, '''4''' - diameter of selectivity filter, '''5''' - phosphorylation site, '''6''' -cell membrane.]]
Ion channels are pore-forming membrane proteins whose functions is establishing a resting membrane potential, shaping action potentials and other electrical signals by gating the flow of ions across the cell membrane, controlling the flow of ions across secretory and epithelial cells, and regulating cell volume.&lt;ref name=&quot;ic1&quot;&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel Wikipedia,ion channel]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-87893-321-2&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Hille, Bertil | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes | edition = 3rd | language = | publisher = Sinauer Associates, Inc. | location = Sunderland, Mass | year = 2001 | origyear = 1984 | pages = 5 | quote = | isbn = 0-87893-321-2 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Well-known laboratory techniques for ion channels could be voltage clamp, patch clamp techniques.

Ion channels are different from other ion transporter proteins:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hille|first=Bertil|title=Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The rate of ion transport through the channel is very high (often 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; ions per second or above).
#Ions pass through channels down their electrochemical gradient, which is a function of ion concentration and membrane potential, &quot;downhill&quot;, without the input  of metabolic energy (e.g. Adenosine triphosphate, active transport mechanisms, co-transport mechanisms).

Ion channels are located within the plasma membrane of over 300 types of cells and many intracellular organelles. They are often described as narrow, water-filled tunnels that accept only specific type ions. This characteristic is called selective permeability. Ion channels are integral membrane proteins, formed as assemblies of several proteins.  Such &quot;multi-subunit&quot; assemblies usually make a circular arrangement of identical or homologous proteins closely packed around a water-filled pore through the plane of the lipid bilayer membrane&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-87893-741-2&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Purves,| authorlink = | editor = Dale Purves, George J.

Ion channels are synthesized and inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. They are glycosylated in the Golgi, and transported and inserted into target membranes by membrane fusion. They are controlled by phosphorylation, trafficking, ubiquitination, reversible interactions with other signaling proteins and second messengers, proteolytic cleavage, and other modifications. Ion channels are related to various biological processes that cause rapid changes in cells, such as muscle contraction, epithelial transport of nutrients and ions, T-cell activation and pancreatic beta-cell insulin release.

====Voltage-gated Ion Channels====
'''Voltage-gated Ion Channels''' are protein channels that can be opened or closed in response to changes in the electric potential across a cell membrane. They have an important role in excitable neuronal and muscle tissues, causing a rapid and coordinated depolarization in response to triggering voltage change. They generally consist of several subunit proteins which make a pore according to their electrochemical gradients. 
[[File:Sodium-channel.svg|thumb|left|400px|Diagram of a voltage-sensitive sodium channel &amp;alpha;-subunit. G – glycosylation, P – phosphorylation, S – ion selectivity, I – inactivation.

Examples include:
* the sodium and potassium voltage-gated channels of nerve and muscle.
* the voltage-gated calcium channels that play a role in neurotransmitter release in pre-synaptic nerve endings.
* the voltage-gated proton channels in phagocytes during the &quot;respiratory burst.&quot;
The process in the sodium and potassium voltage-gated channels is follows:
# Depolarization of the cell interior causes the protein channel to move, inducing a conformational change such that ions may flow through the channel (the open state).
# The Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions flood into the cell (along their concentration gradient).
# The delayed rectifier opens and the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; V-gated channel inactivates.
# K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions flood out of the cell (along their concentration gradient)
# The Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pump uses ATP to restore the concentration gradients

====Ligand-gated Ion Channels====
[[Image:LGIC.png|thumb|300px|left|Ligand-gated ion channel]]
'''Ligand-gated ion channels ''' are protein channels which open to accept ions such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, or Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; to pass through the membrane in response to the binding of a chemical messenger like ligand&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|two/000019817|ligand-gated channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;,neurotransmitter and so on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Purves&quot; &gt;{{cite book | author = Purves, Dale, George J.

These proteins typically consist of at least two domains: a transmembrane domain which includes the ion pore, and an extracellular domain which includes the ligand binding location&lt;ref&gt;Hille B (2001) Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes, 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. &lt;/ref&gt;. LGICs are categorized into three superfamilies:  the cysteine-loop channels, ionotropic glutamate channels and the purinergic receptor channels.They are usually pentameric with each subunit including 4 transmembrane helices constituting the transmembrane domain, and a beta sheet sandwich type, extracellular, N terminal, ligand binding domain.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15023997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cascio M | title = Structure and function of the glycine receptor and related nicotinicoid receptors | journal = J.

The ionotropic glutamate receptors (gluR) are tetramers of homologous subunits, forming a central pore strikingly similar to the voltage-gated superfamily, but with reverse topological orientation in the membrane. The purinergic receptor channels (P2XR) is opened by extracellular nucleotides such as ATP.

====G protein-gated Ion Channels====
Generally, G protein-gated ion channels are specific ion channels placed in the plasma membrane of cells that are directly activated by associated proteins. '''G proteins''' also known as '''guanosine nucleotide-binding proteins''' is a heterotrimer of three subunits:  α-, β-, and γ- subunits.  The α-subunit (G&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;) typically binds the G protein to G protein-coupled receptor.  This receptor protein has a large, extracellular binding domain which will bind its respective ligands such as neurotransmitters and hormones.  Once the ligand is bound to its receptor, a conformational change occurs.  This conformational change in the G protein leads G&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; to bind GTP.  This allows to another conformational change in the G protein, causing the separation of the βγ-complex (G&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt;) from G&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berg&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Stryer, Lubert; Berg, Jeremy Mark; Tymoczko, John L. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Biochemistry | edition = 6th | language = | publisher = W.H.

===Donnan Equilibrium===
[[Image:Gibbs-donnan-en.svg|thumb|left|400px|Donnan equilibrium across a cell membrane (schematic)]]
The charged particles like ions near a semi-permeable membrane sometimes fail to distribute evenly across the two sides of the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Reference/dictionary/Biologie/G/13.html, retrieved 28 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually,it happens as a different charged substance could not pass through the membrane and creates an uneven electrical charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mikuleck/courses/gdeq/sld001.htm The Gibbs–Donnan Equilibrium...], D.C. Mikulecky, retrieved 28 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the large anionic proteins in blood plasma do not permeate to capillary walls. Because small cations are attracted, but are not bound to the proteins, small anions will cross capillary walls away from the anionic proteins more readily than small cations.
====Nernst potential====
The Nernst equation is used to calculate the potential of an ion of charge ''z'' across a membrane. This potential is determined using the concentration of the ion both inside and outside the cell:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{R T}{z F} \ln\frac{[\text{ion outside cell}]}{[\text{ion inside cell}]} = 2.303\frac{R T}{z F} \log_{10}\frac{[\text{ion outside cell}]}{[\text{ion inside cell}]}.&lt;/math&gt;
For monovalent cations,z= 1:
:&lt;math&gt;E = -60 mV \ln\frac{[\text{ion outside cell}]}{[\text{ion inside cell}]}&lt;/math&gt;

===Resting Potential===
[[File:Sodium-potassium pump and diffusion.png|thumb|400px|right|The Sodium-potassium pump|{{chem|Na|+|/K|+}}-ATPase, as well as effects of diffusion of the involved ions, are major mechanisms to maintain the resting potential across the membranes of animal cells.]]

The negative charge that exists intracellularly and not electrically active, is the resting potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;squid&quot;&gt;An [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10931/figure/A146/?report=objectonly example] of an electrophysiological experiment to demonstrate the importance of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for the resting potential. The dependence of the resting potential on the extracellular concentration of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is shown in Figure 2.6 of ''Neuroscience'', 2nd edition,  by Dale Purves, George J. Augustine, David Fitzpatrick, Lawrence C. Katz, Anthony-Samuel LaMantia, James O. McNamara, S. Mark Williams. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer Associates, Inc.; 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; As potassium is also the ion with the most negative equilibrium potential, usually the resting potential can be no more negative than the potassium equilibrium potential.All cells as well as neurons have a resting potential.   But in neurons and in muscle fibers, the resting potential is very important, since all electrical activity will be changes from this resting potential. The resting potential can be calculated with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation using the concentrations of ions as for the equilibrium potential including the relative permeabilities, or conductances, of each ionic species.

The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; monovalent positive ionic species and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; negative:

:&lt;math&gt;E_{m} = \frac{RT}{F} \ln{ \left( \frac{ \sum_{i}^{N} P_{M^{+}_{i}}[M^{+}_{i}]_\mathrm{out} + \sum_{j}^{M} P_{A^{-}_{j}}[A^{-}_{j}]_\mathrm{in}}{ \sum_{i}^{N} P_{M^{+}_{i}}[M^{+}_{i}]_\mathrm{in} + \sum_{j}^{M} P_{A^{-}_{j}}[A^{-}_{j}]_\mathrm{out}} \right) }&lt;/math&gt;

This results in the following if we consider a membrane separating two &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{K}_{x}\mathrm{Na}_{1-x}\mathrm{Cl}&lt;/math&gt;-solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;E_{m, \mathrm{K}_{x}\mathrm{Na}_{1-x}\mathrm{Cl} } = \frac{RT}{F} \ln{ \left( \frac{ P_{Na^{+}}[Na^{+}]_\mathrm{out} + P_{K^{+}}[K^{+}]_\mathrm{out} + P_{Cl^{-}}[Cl^{-}]_\mathrm{in} }{ P_{Na^{+}}[Na^{+}]_\mathrm{in} + P_{K^{+}}[K^{+}]_{\mathrm{in}} + P_{Cl^{-}}[Cl^{-}]_\mathrm{out} } \right) }&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;E_{m}&lt;/math&gt; = The membrane potential (in volts, equivalent to joules per coulomb)
*&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{ion}&lt;/math&gt; = the permeability for that ion (in meters per second)
*&lt;math&gt;[ion]_\mathrm{out}&lt;/math&gt; = the extracellular concentration of that ion moles per cubic meter, to match the other  [[SI]] units)
*&lt;math&gt;[ion]_\mathrm{in}&lt;/math&gt; = the intracellular concentration of that ion (in moles per cubic meter)
*&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = The ideal gas constant (joules per kelvin per mole)

===Graded potential===
Graded potentials are changes in membrane potential which arise from the summation of the individual actions of ligand-gated ion channel proteins, and decrease over time and space.They do not typically involve voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hille|2001|pp=169&amp;ndash;200}}. &quot;Chapter 6. Ligand-gated channels of fast chemical synapses.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:1223 Graded Potentials-02.jpg|400px|thumbnail|left|Graded potential]]
There are 3 primary types of graded potentials: 
# '''Receptor potentials''' is the transmembrane potential difference of a sensory receptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Bertil|last=Hille|authorlink=Bertil Hille|title=Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes|edition=3rd|year=2001|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Massachusetts|chapter=Chapter 8. Sensory transduction and excitable cells.|pages=237&amp;ndash;268|isbn=0-87893-321-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They result from transduction processes (the conversion of an energy stimulus into a electrical potential). They can be caused by the opening of either mechano- or ligand-gated channels
# '''Postsynaptic potentials''' are changes in the membrane potential of the postsynaptic terminal of a chemical  synapse in neurons.  Postsynaptic potentials are  graded potentials, and should not be confused with action potentials although they initiate or inhibit action potentials&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postsynaptic_potential, Wikipedia,postsynaptic potentials]&lt;/ref&gt;. They result from the activation of ligand-gated channels. '''Depolarizing''' are called '''excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs)'''. '''Hyperpolarizing''' are called inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs).The ionic basis of postsynaptic potentials is thought to neurotransmission.

# '''End plate potenials''' are chemically induced change in electric potential of the motor end plate,the part of the muscle-cell membrane that lies opposite the terminal of a nerve fibre at the neuromuscular junction&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/186724/end-plate-potential-EPP Britanica,end-plate potential (EPP)]&lt;/ref&gt;. They result from the activation of ligand-gated channels.

===Action potential===
[[Image:Action potential.svg|thumb|300px|Approximate plot of a typical action potential shows its various phases as the action potential passes a point on a cell membrane.  The membrane potential starts out at -70 mV at time zero.  A stimulus is applied at time = 1 ms, which raises the membrane potential above -55 mV (the threshold potential).  After the stimulus is applied, the membrane potential rapidly rises to a peak potential of +40 mV at time = 2 ms.  Just as quickly, the potential then drops and overshoots to -90 mV at time = 3 ms, and finally the resting potential of -70 mV is reestablished at time = 5 ms.]]

In physiology, an '''action potential''' is  the brief (about one-thousandth of a second) reversal of electric polarization of the membrane of a  excited cells such as nerve cell (neuron), muscle cell, endocrine cell and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/4491/action-potential, Britanica, action potential]&lt;/ref&gt;. In neurons,  an action potential happens when a neuron sends information down an axon, away from the cell body. In other types of cells, they activate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action potential  produces the contraction required for all movement. In beta cells of the pancreas, they induce release of insulin.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16464129&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = MacDonald PE, Rorsman P | title = Oscillations, intercellular coupling, and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = e49 |date=February 2006 | pmid = 16464129 | pmc = 1363709 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0040049 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Action potentials in neurons are also known as &quot;'''nerve impulses'''&quot; or &quot;spikes&quot;, and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its &quot;'''spike train'''&quot;. A neuron that emits an action potential is often said to &quot;fire&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential Wikipedia,Action Potential]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Action potentials are generated by specific voltage-gated ion channels embedded in a cell's plasma membrane.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17515599&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnett MW, Larkman PM | title = The action potential | journal = Pract Neurol | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 192–7 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17515599 | doi = | url = http://pn.bmj.com/content/7/3/192.short | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These channels are shut when the membrane potential is near the resting potential of the cell, but stimulation of the cell by neurotransmitters or by sensory receptor cells partially opens channel-shaped protein molecules in the membrane. Sodium diffuses into the cell, shifting that part of the membrane toward a less-negative polarization. If this local potential reaches a critical state called the threshold potential (measuring about −60 mV), sodium channels open completely. Sodium floods inside the cell quickly depolarizes to an action potential of about +55 mV. The declining phase of the action potential is from the closing of sodium channels and the opening of potassium channels, which let a charge about equal to the stage which the cell leaves in the form of potassium ions. Therefore, protein transport molecules pump sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions in. This restores the original ion concentrations and the membrane is ready for a new action potential.

==Volume Conductor Theory==
Volume conductor models are a basis for source analysis in Magnetocardiography (MCG), Electrocardiography (ECG),Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Volume conduction in bioelectromagnetism, can be defined as the transmission of electric or magnetic fields from an electric primary current source through biological tissue towards measurement sensors. Volume conductor means a continuously conductive medium.The brain, meninges, skull, and scalp make a volume conductor throughout which currents created by ionic flow can be measured.
[[File:VolumeConductorprinciple.jpeg|450px|left|thumb|Volume Conductor principle]]
For instance,in Electrocardiogram(ECG), it is possible to place electrodes on the body surface and measure cardiac potentials as the body behaves as a conductor of the electrical currents by the heart. In the resting, polarized state, no potential difference would exist between the positive and negative electrodes(i.e., isoelectric - flat red line). Within ventricles, when the left side of the tissue becomes depolarized (representing firing of the SA node), a wave of depolarization starts to spread across the ventricles. During this time, some part temporarily remains positive on the outside (polarized) and while some is negative (depolarized); thus, there is a separation of charges which induce a potential difference between the two electrodes. As the wave of depolarization moves toward the positive electrode, conventionally, a positive voltage (upward deflection) is recorded. The voltage reaches its maximal positive value when half the part is depolarized. Once the entire ventricle mass is depolarized (all cells negative on outside), there is no longer be a potential difference and the voltage is the same to the polarized state.  When repolarization occurs, starting first with the left side ( SA nodal region) then moving across the ventricle, there will once again be both positive and negative charges on the surface of the ventricle, but this time, the negative charges will be closest to the positive electrode. The wave of repolarization sweeping across the ventricle away from the negative electrode and toward the positive electrode causes, conventionally, a negative voltage (upward deflection in ventricles. It is different according to the part.) to occur.  Finally, when all of the cells are repolarized, the measured voltage difference will once again be the same to the initial stage until another wave of depolarization occurs.

[[File:Volume conductor model.png|thumb|Volume conductor model generated from 3D cine MRI data with two axial MR scans with overlaid electrode positions (segmented liquid capsules) from a left lateral oblique view; also shown: the triangular model of the chest surface, the surface models of the both lungs (LL, RL), and the ventricular model (RV, LV).]]
The human body would be thought as a resistive, piecewise homogeneous and linear volume conductor. Most of the tissue is isotropic. The muscle is, however, strongly anisotropic, and the brain tissue is anisotropic,too.

==Electrophysiological technique==
===Classical electrophysiological techniques===
The principal types of electrodes are:

# simple solid conductors, such as conductive discs and needles (singles or arrays, often insulated except for the tip),
# conductive tracings on printed circuit boards, also insulated except for the tip, and
# hollow tubes filled with an electrolyte, such as glass pipettes filled with potassium chloride solution or another electrolyte solution, also for extra- or intracellular recording.

The principal sample preparations include:

# living organisms,
# excised tissue (acute or cultured),
# dissociated cells from excised tissue (acute or cultured),
# artificially grown cells or tissues, or
#  hybrids of the above.

===Optical electrophysiological technique===
[[File:Microscope for Electrophysiological Research and Recording Equipment.jpg|thumb|300px|Microscope for Electrophysiological Research and Recording Equipment]]
Optical electrophysiological techniques were invented to overcome the limitations of classical techniques. In classical techniques, electrical activity could be observed at approximately a single point within a volume of tissue. Classical techniques need to singularize a distributed phenomenon. Interest in the spatial distribution of bioelectric activity prompted development of molecules capable of emitting light in response to their electrical or chemical environment. Examples are voltage sensitive dyes and fluorescing proteins.

With one or more such compounds administrated via perfusion, injection or gene expression, the distribution of electrical activity may be observed and recorded. According to the development of optical instrument and computer software, three dimensional molecular level experiments become possible.
===Experimental Techniques===
====Voltage clamp technique====
Through voltage clamp techniques, it became possible to understand the mechanisms involved in an action potential that is changing with voltage and time as it travels down an axon. 
An experimenter &quot;clamp&quot; the cell potential at a chosen value. In other words, it is to measure how much ionic current crosses a cell's membrane at any given voltage. It is important as a lot of the ion channels in the membrane of a neuron are voltage-gated ion channels, which open only when the membrane voltage is within a range.  
The data obtained from these experiments were validated by mathematical reconstruction of an action potential. &lt;ref name=&quot;ionchannel2&quot;&gt;Cole K.S. (1955) Ions, potentials and the nerve impulse. In Shedlovsky, T (ed.) Electrochemistry in biology ad medicine. New York, Wiley. p 121-140&lt;/ref&gt;
====Patch clamp technique, newer voltage clamp tool since 1990====
[[File:Patch Clamp Resistance Animation.gif|400px|thumbnail|left|Patch Clamp]]
[[File:Patchmodes-de.svg|200 px|thumb|Patchmodes-de]]
The patch clamp technique is a specialized version of the voltage clamp. The patch clamp micropipette  is a micropipette with a relatively large open tip diameter(diameter of about one micron) with a polished surface rather than a sharp point.
&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |author=Hamill OP, Marty A, Neher E, Sakmann B, Sigworth FJ. |title=Improved patch-clamp techniques for high-resolution current recording from cells and cell-free membrane patches |journal=Pflügers Archiv European Journal of Physiology |year=1981 |volume=391 |issue=2 |pages=85–100 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h348734770442854/ |doi=10.1007/BF00656997 |pmid=6270629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|bibcode = 2012JMiMi..22k5008T }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This patch pipette is pressed against a cell's surface and gentle suction is applied through the microelectrode to draw a piece of the cell membrane (the 'patch') inside its tip. The suction causes the pipette to form a tight seal with the cell's membrane with an electrical resistance of several gigaohms. This configuration is the &quot;cell-attached&quot; mode, and it is useful for studying the activity of the ion channels in the patch of membrane.

There are multiple patch clamp configurations for various experimental observations. If more suction is applied, the small patch of membrane in the electrode tip can be displaced, leaving the electrode sealed to the rest of the cell. This &quot;whole-cell&quot; mode provides very stable intracellular recording. A disadvantage is  that some components of the intracellular fluid could be diluted as the intracellular fluid of the cell mixes with the solution inside the recording electrode. 

The &quot;perforated patch&quot; technique tries to minimize these problems. Instead of suction, it uses small holes on the patch with small amounts of an antifungal or antibiotic agent, such as amphothericin-B, nystatin, or gramicidin. As the antibiotic molecules diffuse into the membrane patch, they form small perforations in the membrane, allowing ions to pass through the holes freely. The problem is that it takes long to allow the antibiotic to diffuse in the cell. And the electric resistance can be higher and the patch can be rupture by the antibiotic.

This technique was developed by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann who received the Nobel Prize in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1991/ Nobel prize Medicine 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Single electrode voltage clamp tool====
Until the late 1970s the use of two microelectrodes to control the voltage in nerve and muscle cells had become a well established to measure the membrane current. But, the two-electrode voltage clamp technique faced limits in two application areas. First,as a second electrode penetrate in small cells, it caused damage. Second, in in vivo preparations the cells were commonly out of sight. Both of these problems can be resolved if the voltage clamp is implemented with a single electrode.&lt;ref name=&quot;axon&quot;&gt;[http://www.moleculardevices.com/pages/instruments/axon_guide.html The Axon Guide for Electrophysiology &amp; Biophysics Laboratory Techniques(1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Single Electrode Voltage Clamp is a special purpose circuit clamping arrangement where a single microelectrode is used both to measure the membrane voltage and to pass the current necessary to control the voltage level. A fast electronic switch alternates the connection to the microelectrode between these two functions.

====Planar patch clamp technique,novel automated patch clamp tool====
Planar patch clamp systems  is beginning to replace manual patch clamping since 1990 by research lab and companies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nanion.de/pdf/PlanarPatchClamping.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. In classical patch clamp technique, the patch pipette is moved to the cell using a micromanipulator under optical control. Relative movements between the pipette and the cell should be avoided  to keep the cell-pipette connection intact. In planar patch configuration the cell is placed by suction – relative movements between cell and aperture can be excluded after sealing. An Antivibration table is not necessary. Chips are typically made from silicon, glass, PDMS, polymide. The automated patch clamp systems are usually more complex and expensive but have the advantage of parallel and hands-free operation including a large amount of data within a short time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Rolle's_theorem.svg|300px|right]] 
In [[calculus]], '''Rolle's theorem''' states that if a function ''f'' is [[Continuous function|continuous]] on a closed interval &lt;math&gt;\left[a,b\right]&lt;/math&gt; and [[derivative|differentiable]] on the open interval &lt;math&gt;\left(a,b\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f\left(a\right) = f\left(b\right)&lt;/math&gt; then there is some number ''c'' in the open interval &lt;math&gt;\left(a,b\right)&lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt;f'\left(c\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Intuitively, this means that if a smooth curve is equal at two points then there must be a stationary point somewhere between them.  Just continuity is not sufficient.  (However, differentiability is not quite necessary; see note below.)  For example, if 

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = |x|&lt;/math&gt;

the [[absolute value]] of ''x'', then we have that

: &lt;math&gt;f\left(-1\right) = f\left(1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

but there is no ''x'' between -1 and 1 for which &lt;math&gt;f'\left(x\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This is because that function, although continuous, is not differentiable at ''x''=0.

A version of the theorem was first stated by [[India]]n astronomer [[Bhāskara II|Bhaskara]] in the 12th century.[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Projects/Pearce/Chapters/Ch8_5.html] A proof of the theorem had to wait until centuries later when [[Michel Rolle]] in [[1691]] used the methods of differential calculus.

== Proof ==
The idea of the proof is to argue that if &lt;math&gt;\ f(a) = f(b)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must attain either a maximum or a minimum somewhere between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\ f'(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; at either of these points.

Now, by assumption, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;\ [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, and by the [[continuity property]] attains both its maximum and its minimum in &lt;math&gt;\ [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. If these are both attained at endpoints of &lt;math&gt;\ [a,b]&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; is constant on &lt;math&gt;\ [a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\ f'(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; at every point of &lt;math&gt;\ (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose then that the maximum is obtained at an interior point &lt;math&gt;\ x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; (the argument for the minimum is very similar). We wish to show that &lt;math&gt;\ f'(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. We shall examine the left-hand and right-hand derivatives separately.

For &lt;math&gt;\ x_1&lt;/math&gt; less than &lt;math&gt;\ x&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\ f(x)-f(x_1) \over {x-x_1}&lt;/math&gt; is non-negative since &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a maximum. Thus the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] as &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from below is non-negative. (Note that we assume that &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable to guarantee that the left-hand and right-hand derivatives exist; it does not follow from the other assumptions).

For &lt;math&gt;\ x_2&lt;/math&gt; greater than &lt;math&gt;\ x&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\ f(x)-f(x_2) \over {x-x_2}&lt;/math&gt; is non-positive. Thus the limit as &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from above is non-positive.

Finally, since &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;\ x&lt;/math&gt;, these two limits must be equal and hence are both 0. This implies that &lt;math&gt;\ f'(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Relaxed assumptions == 
The theorem is usually stated in the form above, but it is actually valid in a slightly more general setting:
We only need to assume that 

: &lt;math&gt;f : \left[a,b\right] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

is [[continuous function|continuous]] on &lt;math&gt;\left[a,b\right]&lt;/math&gt;, that 

: &lt;math&gt;f\left(a\right)=f\left(b\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and that

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \left(a, b\right) ,\; \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{f\left(x + h\right) - f\left(x\right)}{h} \in \left[ -\infty,+\infty \right]&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalizations ==

The [[mean value theorem]] gives a similar statement but for functions that do not have the same value at the end points; that is, &lt;math&gt;f(a) \neq f(b)&lt;/math&gt;.  The conclusion is that there is a point of the domain where the instantaneous slope equals the mean slope.  Rolle's theorem can be used to prove the mean value theorem and vice versa.

We can also generalize Rolle's theorem by requiring that ''f'' has more zeros and greater regularity.  Specifically, suppose the following
* the function ''f'' is ''n'' times differentiable: &lt;math&gt;\dipslaystyle f\in C^{n-1}[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f^{(n)}(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists on &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the function ''f'' has ''n''+1 roots: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(x_i)=0&lt;/math&gt; for distinct points &lt;math&gt;x_0, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt;, in &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;.
Then there is a &lt;math&gt;c\in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f^{(n)}(c)=0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- boy, a diagram sure would be handy here to explain this; just even showing a function with three roots and its derivative with one root would do--&gt;

{{displaytitle|title=Problem Solving: Reverse Polish Notation}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

'''Reverse Polish  notation''' (otherwise known as post-fix, RPN for short) is a way of representing mathematical equations. The notation is used because the format that the equation is in is easier for machines to interpret rather than the notation we are used to, infix notation, where the operator is in between the numbers. The equation can be complex or simple. RPN doesnt require brackets as the equations are layed out in such a format that it isn't required for machines to understand.

The name RPN is named after [[w:Jan Łukasiewicz|Jan Łukasiewicz]], a Polish  logician who invented Polish notation (prefix notation) some time in the 1920's.

== Reverse Polish Notation ==
Reverse polish notation should be ordered like this:

 &lt;FirstNumber&gt; &lt;SecondNumber&gt; &lt;Operation&gt;

Rather than the normal convention(infix) of:

 &lt;FirstNumber&gt; &lt;Operation&gt; &lt;SecondNumber&gt;

== Examples ==

===Examples of equivalent equations:===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! &lt;big&gt;PostFix&lt;/big&gt; !! &lt;big&gt;Infix&lt;/big&gt; !! &lt;big&gt;Answer&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| &lt;big&gt;3 4 +&lt;/big&gt; || &lt;big&gt;3 + 4&lt;/big&gt; || &lt;big&gt;7&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| &lt;big&gt;3 5 6 + *&lt;/big&gt; || &lt;big&gt;(5 + 6) * 3&lt;/big&gt; || &lt;big&gt;33&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| &lt;big&gt;2 4 / 5 6 - *&lt;/big&gt; || &lt;big&gt;(2/4)*(5-6)&lt;/big&gt; || &lt;big&gt;-0.5&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| &lt;big&gt;2 3 ↑&lt;/big&gt; || &lt;big&gt;2³&lt;/big&gt; || &lt;big&gt;8&lt;/big&gt;
|}

=== Implementation as a Stack ===

=== Usage ===
* This template provides the [[Help:Editnotice|editnotice]] for all Module pages.

=== Hiding the message ===
This template is marked with the CSS id &quot;module-namespace-editnotice&quot;, so that editors can apply their own CSS customization if they wish, in particular to hide it. To hide the message, add

:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#module-namespace-editnotice { display: none !important; }&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

into [[Special:MyPage/skin.css]], which redirects to your current skin's CSS file (open in new tab/window to see).

== Deletion Request ==

Hi.
:I have added the deletion request for your three pages as requested in the page content. Might I suggest, in case, you believe that you might be required to create more pages, but not sure of the same, you can utilise the sandbox for better understanding. This would assist all. The latest revision can be viewed here [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_2_(Exam)&amp;curid=300026&amp;diff=2655586&amp;oldid=2655579], [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_(Exam)&amp;curid=300023&amp;diff=2655585&amp;oldid=2655580], and [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_1_(Coursework)&amp;curid=300025&amp;diff=2655584&amp;oldid=2655578].

== [[A-level Graphic Products]] ==

Hello.
:I see that you are doing a good job of creating the better articles out here. Might you be able to add some links, or sources to the reference lists, or rather paste few of the links from your source at my talk page please. It would assist myself in reviewing it better. Also, in case you are expanding it further, you would like to remove the '''stub''' template, once its expanded properly. Danke.

== Bookcat ==

I have now fixed the book category. Hope it helps. Danke. [[User:Harrybrowne1986|Vishal]][[User Talk:Harrybrowne1986| Bakhai]] - [[Special:Contributions/Harrybrowne1986|Works]][[Image:Flag_of_India.svg|15px]] 17:18, 17 May 2014 (UTC)

== Categories ==

{{tmbox|type=notice|text='''Please use our [[WB:CAT|category system]] to help people find new pages and books.''' Every page in a book should include {{tl|BookCat}} or a book navigation template. A book's main page should include {{tl|subjects}} with a few [[:Category:Subject|subjects]] that reflect the book's specific scope.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Being that the nature of the field of Human Computer Interaction is that it is interdisciplinary, theories and models proceed and are adapted from many other disciplines.  There are but a few of which could call &quot;genuinely native&quot; HCI theories and models. To complicate matters, computerized systems change at a vertiginous pace and changes are often surreptitious.  It seems as if [http://www.kurzweilai.net/ Kurzweil] was not as far off from fact with his predictions. Through this course, we will learn, critique, apply, and expand theories and models to make them relevant to the state of the field.

Looking through the [http://www.sigchi.org/ Association of Computer Machinery Special Interest Group on Computer Human Interaction's (SIGCHI)] repository, this researcher has not been able to zero in on a book that addresses the needs of a course in models and theories for our discipline.  Therefore, we will use our textbook and articles to guide our discussion and we will collaborate in documenting the state of matters through this WikiBook.

The page was created some five years ago by [[Special:Contributions/89.134.159.109|89.134.159.109]] with a copy of http://coding.derkeiler.com/Archive/Lisp/comp.lang.lisp/2007-02/msg00272.html (a news:comp.lang.lisp article, as it seems.)  The copy was then [{{fullurl:Prolog/Usergroups|diff=prev&amp;oldid=2486285}} commented out] last year, with a [{{fullurl:Talk:Prolog/Usergroups|diff=2486291&amp;oldid=1413304}} comment left] at the talk page.  The page now bears entirely inappropriate {{tl|review}} and {{tl|rejected}} templates, and has no useful content whatsoever.

Frankly, I can see the original intent.  However, using Wikibooks to essentially ''archive'' Internet fora (be it Usenet or something else), is out of the project’s scope, is prone to copyright violations, and, in this particular case, just failed to really start off.

==Introduction==
Running Content Manager can sometimes be frustrating given the kludgy nature of the user interface. The worst problems occur after downloading a route which suddenly bequeaths a variety of faulty content items, with some of that missing other dependencies, and so instead of playing, you have to track what is going on. Perhaps you do as I do and keep a log file or spreadsheet of downloads. 

==Adding kuids to a list==
[[File:Trainz CM Tricks-01_in TS10 (w-small icons)_Using an ORed_KUID_list to view fixed asset and then to see certain dependencies not in first KUID group.png &lt;!--
---&gt;|thumb|right|476px&lt;!-- 40% of 1440 px 
---&gt;|{{bull}}1) Keep 'just fixed' asset Woodchips 2BayOp... by setting up an OR (2nd) 'Asset KUID' field with the Woodchips gondola's kuid. {{bullR}}2) Then commit the asset. 3) This asset then showed ''the 'Faulty Dependency Puzzle' piece'', so got this view by examining the assets dependencies (RMBHdrag etc){{bullR}} 4) The faulty dependencies are not in the just downloaded list, but are present, or might be (''very, very, most commonly... On the DLS so you need them listed in the main view for a drag N drop into the Download Helper pane).{{bullR
}} 5) So continue the second kuid list with the missing or faulty kuids so you can deal with all that now. &lt;!--
---&gt;]]
Adding kuids to a Search list you want to keep static requires a trick--a double use of a kuid list.
;Consider this common scenario
# Assume you keep a log file of downloads by version, or put that up in a spreadsheet
# Assume the aftermath of a download&amp;mdash;you want the main view list captured and put into a text file anyway, so do that or paste them into an Open Office (Calc) spreadsheet.
# Assume further, the download was a route, and the dependencies, all of them new to you ran to the hundreds. 
# You've got 8-12 new faulty assets, scattered through that big list in the main view
# and further, you run more than one Trainz, so you need to track fixed assets so you can output CDP's for the one's you fix.&lt;br/&gt;(Elsewhere in AM&amp;C you were advised, if your ISP speed is high enough to separately download assets instead of copying or exporting cdp files across versions. We repeat that advice here!--Fabartus)
# If you are just focused on faulty assets, your initial list is too long and unweildy, so after selecting the download by 'View in Main List' you set an auxiliary filter {{kp|Faulty|True}}, so now you can see just the errors.

== The Problem ==
As mentioned in a [[../SELECT: IS NULL Predicate|previous chapter]] of this wikibook and in [[w:Null (SQL)|wikipedia]] sometimes there is no value in a column of a row, or - to say it the other way round - the column stores the ''NULL marker'' (a flag to indicate the absence of any data), or - to use the notion of the SQL standard - the column stores the ''NULL value''. This NULL marker is very different from the numeric value zero or a string with a length of zero characters! Typically it occurs when an application yet hasn't stored anything in the column of this row.

(A hint to Oracle users: For Oracle the NULL marker is identical to a string of zero characters.)

The existence of the NULL marker introduces a '''new fundamental problem'''. In the usual boolean logic there are the two logical values TRUE and FALSE. Every comparision evaluates to one of the two - and the comparisions negation evaluates to the opposite one. If a comparision evaluates to TRUE, its negation evaluates to FALSE and vice versa. As an example, in the usual boolean logic one of the following two comparisions is TRUE and the other one is FALSE: 'x &lt; 5', 'x &gt;= 5'.

Imagine now the new situation that x holds the NULL marker. It is not feasible that 'NULL &lt; 5' is true (1). But if we say, 'NULL &lt; 5' is false (2), its negation 'NULL &gt;= 5' is true (3)! Is (3) more feasible than (1)? Of course not. (1) and (3) have the same 'degree of truth', so they shall evaluate to the same value. And this value must be different from TRUE and FALSE.

Therefore the usual boolean logic is extended by a third logic value. It is named '''UNKOWN'''. All comparisions to the NULL marker results per definition in this new value. And the well known statement 'if a statement is true, its negation is false' gets lost because there is a third option.

SQLs logic is an implementation of this so called [[w:Three-valued logic|trivalent, ternary or three-valued logic (3VL)]]. The existence of the NULL marker in SQL is not without [[w:Null (SQL)#Criticisms|controversy]]. But if NULLs are accepted, the 3VL is a necessity.

This page proceeds in two stages: First it explains the handling of NULLs concerning comparsions, grouping, etc. . Second it explains the boolean logic for the cases where the new value UNKOWN interacts with any other boolean value - including itself.

== Step 1: Evaluation of NULLs  ==

=== Comparision Predicates, IS NULL Predicate ===
SQL knows the six comparision predicates &lt;, &lt;=, =, &gt;=, &gt; and &lt;&gt; (unequal). Their main purpose is the arithmetic comparision of numeric values. Each of them needs two variables or constants ([[w:Infix notation|infix notation]]). This implies that it is possible that one or even both operants hold the NULL marker. As stated before the common and very simple rule is: &quot;All comparisions to the NULL marker results per definition in this new value ('''unkown''').&quot;. Here are some examples:
:* NULL = 5  evaluates to UNKNOWN.
:* 5 = NULL  evaluates to UNKNOWN.
:* NULL &lt;= 5  evaluates to UNKNOWN.
:* col_1 = 5  evaluates to UNKNOWN for rows where col_1 holds the NULL marker.
:* col_1 = col_2  evaluates to UNKNOWN for rows where col_1 or col_2 holds the NULL marker.
:* NULL = NULL  evaluates to UNKNOWN.
:* col_1 = col_2  evaluates to UNKNOWN for rows where col_1 and col_2 holds the NULL marker.
The WHERE clause returns such rows where it evaluates to TRUE. It does not return rows where it evaluates to FALSE or to UNKNOWN. In consequence it is not garanteed that the following SELECT will return the complete table ''t1'':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- This SELECT will not return such rows where col_1 holds the NULL marker.
SELECT *
FROM   t1
WHERE  col_1 &gt; 5
OR     col_1 = 5
OR     col_1 &lt; 5;
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course there are use cases where rows with the NULL marker must be retrieved. Because the arithmetic comparisions are not able to do so, another language construct must do the job. It is the ''IS NULL predicate''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- This SELECT will return exactly these rows where col_1 holds the NULL marker.
SELECT *
FROM   t1
WHERE  col_1 IS NULL;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Other Predicates ===
For the other predicates there is no simple rule of thumb. They must be explained one after the other.

The &lt;u&gt;IN predicate&lt;/u&gt; is a shortcut for a sequence of OR operations:
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Shortcut for: col_1 = 3 OR col_1 = 18 OR col_1 = NULL
SELECT *
FROM   t1
WHERE  col_1 IN (3, 18, NULL);  -- the NULL case will never hit with the IN predicate!
-- a second example which is a little more complex
-- WHERE  col_1 IN (SELECT col_x FROM t2 WHERE id &lt; 10);
&lt;/source&gt;
Only the two comparisions 'col_1 = 3' and 'col_1 = 18' are able to retrieve rows (possibly many rows). The comparision 'col_1 = NULL' will never evaluate to TRUE. It's alway UNKNOW, even if col_1 holds the NULL marker. To retrieve those rows it's necessary - as shown above - to use the 'IS NULL' predicate.

The subselect of an &lt;u&gt;EXISTS predicate&lt;/u&gt; evaluates to TRUE if the cardinality of the retrieved rows is greater than 0, and to FALSE if the cardinality is 0. It is not possible that the UNKNOWN value occurs.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The subselect to t2 can hit some rows - or not. If there are hits in the subselect, ALL rows of t1
-- are returned, else no rows of t1 are returned.
SELECT *                                 -- The select to table t1
FROM   t1
WHERE  EXISTS
       (SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE id &lt; 10); -- The subselect to table t2
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;u&gt;LIKE predicate&lt;/u&gt; compares a column with a regular expression. If the column contains the NULL marker, the LIKE predicate returns the UNKOWN value, what means that the row is not retrieved.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The LIKE retrieves NO rows if col_2 contains the NULL marker.
SELECT *
FROM   t1
WHERE  col_2 LIKE 'Hello %';
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Predefined Functions  ===
The [[../SELECT: Predefined Functions#Aggregate functions|aggregate functions]] &lt;code&gt;COUNT(&lt;column_name&gt;), MIN(&lt;column_name&gt;), MAX(&lt;column_name&gt;), SUM(&lt;column_name&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;AVG(&lt;column_name&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; ignores such rows where &lt;column_name&gt; contains the NULL marker. On the other hand &lt;code&gt;COUNT(*)&lt;/code&gt; includes all rows.

If a parameter of one of the [[../SELECT: Predefined Functions#Scalar functions|scalar functions]] like &lt;code&gt;UPPER(), TRIM(), CONCAT(), ABS(), SQRT(), ...&lt;/code&gt; contains the NULL marker the resulting value is - in the most cases - the NULL marker.

=== Grouping ===
There are some situations where column values are compared to each other to answer the question, whether they are distinct. For usual numbers and strings the result of such decisions is obvious. But how shall the DBMS handle NULL markers? Are they distinct from each other, are they equal to each other or is there no answer to this question at all? To get results, which are expected by (nearly) every end user, the standard defines &quot;Two null values are not distinct.&quot;, they build a single group.

&lt;code&gt;SELECT DISTINCT col_1 FROM t1;&lt;/code&gt; retrieves one and only row for all rows where ''col_1'' holds the NULL marker.

&lt;code&gt;... GROUP BY col_1 ...;&lt;/code&gt; builds one and only one group for all rows where ''col_1'' holds the NULL marker.

== Step 2: Boolean Operations within 3VL ==
After we have seen how various comparisions and predicates on the NULL marker produces TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN it's necessary to explain the rules for the new logic value UNKNOWN.

=== Inspection ===
A first elementary operation is the inspection of a truth value: is it TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWN? Analogous to the ''IS NULL predicate'' there are three additional predicates:
:* IS [NOT] TRUE
:* IS [NOT] FALSE
:* IS [NOT] UNKNOWN

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Check for 'UNKNOWN'
SELECT *
FROM   t1
WHERE  (col_1 = col_2) IS UNKNOWN;  -- parenthesis are not necessary

-- ... is semantically equivalent to
SELECT *
FROM   t1
WHERE  col_1 IS NULL 
OR     col_2 IS NULL;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the abstract syntax of logical systems ''p'' shall represent any of its truth values. Herein the new predicates evaluate according to the following table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 ! ''p'' !! IS TRUE !! IS FALSE !! IS UNKNOWN !! &amp;nbsp; !! IS NOT TRUE !! IS NOT FALSE !! IS NOT UNKNOWN
 |-
 | TRUE || TRUE || FALSE || FALSE || || FALSE || TRUE || TRUE
 |-
 | FALSE || FALSE || TRUE || FALSE || || TRUE || FALSE || TRUE
 |-
 | UNKNOWN || FALSE || FALSE || TRUE || || TRUE || TRUE || FALSE
|}
Please notice that all predicates leads to TRUE or FALSE and never to UNKNOWN.

=== NOT ===
The next operation is the negation of the new value. To which value evaluates 'NOT UNKNOWN'? The UNKNOWN value represents the impossibility to decide between TRUE and FALSE. It is not feasible that the negation of this impossibility leads to TRUE or FALSE. Likewise it is UNKNOWN. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Which rows will match?  (1)
SELECT *
FROM   t1
WHERE  NOT col_2 = NULL; -- 'col_2 = NULL' evaluates to UNKNOWN in all cases, see above.

-- Is this SELECT equivalent to the first one?  (2)
SELECT *
FROM   t1
  EXCEPT
SELECT *
FROM   t1
WHERE  col_2 = NULL;

-- No, it's different!! Independent from NULL markers in col_2, (1) retrieves
-- absolutely NO row and (2) retrieves ALL rows.
&lt;/source&gt;

The above SELECT (1) will retrieve no rows as 'NOT col_2 = NULL' evaluates to the same as 'col_2 = NULL', namely UNKNOWN. And the SELECT (2) will retrieve all rows, as the part after EXCEPT will retrieve no rows, hence only the part before EXCEPT is relevant.

In the abstract syntax of logical systems ''p'' shall represent any of its truth values and NOT ''p'' its negation. Herein the following table applies:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 ! ''p'' !! NOT ''p''
 |-
 | TRUE || FALSE
 |-
 | FALSE || TRUE
 |-
 | UNKNOWN || UNKNOWN
|}

=== AND, OR ===
There are the two binary operations AND and OR. They evaluate as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 ! ''p'' !! ''q'' !! ''p'' AND ''q'' !! ''p'' OR ''q''
 |- 
 | TRUE || TRUE || TRUE || TRUE
 |-
 | TRUE || FALSE || FALSE || TRUE
 |-
 | TRUE || UNKNOWN || UNKNOWN || TRUE
 |- 
 | FALSE || TRUE || FALSE || TRUE
 |-
 | FALSE || FALSE || FALSE || FALSE
 |-
 | FALSE || UNKNOWN || FALSE || UNKNOWN
 |- 
 | UNKNOWN || TRUE || UNKNOWN || TRUE
 |-
 | UNKNOWN || FALSE || FALSE || UNKNOWN
 |-
 | UNKNOWN || UNKNOWN || UNKNOWN || UNKNOWN
|}

The precedence of the operations is defined as usual: IS predicate, NOT, AND, OR.

== Some Examples ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Add a new row to the test data base
INSERT INTO person (id, firstname, lastname)  -- Omit some columns to generate NULL markers
VALUES             (99, 'Tommy',   'Test');
COMMIT;

SELECT *
FROM   person
-- focus all tests to the new row
WHERE  id = 99                  -- (1): TRUE 
AND                             -- (3): (1) AND (2) ==&gt; TRUE AND UNKNOWN ==&gt; UNKNOWN
(
       date_of_birth = NULL     -- (2): UNKNOWN
);                              -- no hit

SELECT *
FROM   person
WHERE  id = 99                  -- (1): TRUE 
AND                             -- (3): (1) AND (2) ==&gt; TRUE AND TRUE ==&gt; TRUE
(
       date_of_birth IS NULL    -- (2): TRUE
);                              -- hit

SELECT *
FROM   person
WHERE  id = 99                  -- (1): TRUE 
OR                              -- (3): (1) OR (2) ==&gt; TRUE OR UNKNOWN ==&gt; TRUE
(
       date_of_birth = NULL     -- (2): UNKNOWN
);                              -- hit

SELECT *
FROM   person
WHERE  id = 99                  -- (1): TRUE 
AND                             -- (4): (1) AND (3) ==&gt; TRUE AND FALSE ==&gt; FALSE
(
NOT                             -- (3): NOT (2) ==&gt; NOT TRUE ==&gt; FALSE
       date_of_birth IS NULL    -- (2): TRUE

);                              -- no hit (same as AND date_of_birth IS NOT NULL)

-- Clean up the test database
DELETE FROM person WHERE id = 99;
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;

{{closed|Not successful}}
I have been working on this book for quite some time, and although it is not finished, I have decided to nominate it for featured status. The book features a page for each country in the world, with a large photograph of the country surrounded by some other basic information. A good page to look at as an example is [[Wikijunior:Countries A-Z/Belgium|Belgium]]. The fact that it is incomplete is not a bad thing. Because I have designed the book specifically so that expanding it is simple, just a matter of filling in parameters for each country and then selecting an image. The simplicity is achieved through preloading and complex templates. To see what I mean try creating a page. Go to the latest page, [[Wikijunior:Countries A-Z/Honduras]] at the time of writing, and click on the red link in the corner that says the name of the next page (Hungary is next after Honduras). If it isn't red the page has already been created. The following will be preloaded on to the page:
&lt;center&gt;{{hidden|header=Click to show/hide|headerstyle= background: #ccccff; width:75%; |content=&lt;pre style=&quot;border:1px solid blue&quot;&gt;&lt;!--Fill out the parameters and then delete the notes when you are done. Press save and then click [Add an image]--&gt;
{{Template:Wikijunior:Countries A-Z/Page layout
 |name=
 |native-lang=&lt;!-- Two letter ISO 369-1 code, for example &quot;es&quot; for Spanish and &quot;de&quot; for German. If you don't know look it up --&gt;
 |language=&lt;!-- Name of the language --&gt;
 |native-name=&lt;!-- Name of country in the native language--&gt;
 |lang-status=Official&lt;!--change as necessary--&gt;
 |map=&lt;!--Should be in the format &quot;&lt;name&gt; on the globe (&lt;continent&gt; centered).svg&quot;--&gt;
 |continent=
 |capital=
 |previous=&lt;!--Previous page in alphabetical order, see [[wikipedia:List of sovereign states]] for an alphabetized list--&gt;
 |next=&lt;!--See above--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;
After the page has been created you will see links that say:&lt;center&gt;
{{hidden|header=Click to show/hide|headerstyle= background: #ccccff; width:75%;|contentstyle=text-align:center; |content=
&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[[{{fullurl:WB:Sandbox|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Wikijunior:Countries_A-Z/Preload/Image}}  Add an image]]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;([[{{fullurl:WB:Sandbox|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Wikijunior:Countries_A-Z/Preload/Missing_image}} Can't find a good image? Tag this page as missing an image]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;
Clicking on the &quot;Add an image&quot; link will preload the [[Template:Wikijunior:Countries A-Z/Image]] template on to the page, and all that has to be done is to copy-and-paste the name of the image into the indicated spot.&lt;br /&gt;
I have also devised a reader rating/review system for the images. Try this out by clicking the &quot;Rate this image&quot; link near the bottom of the page on the left side.&lt;br /&gt;
The use of a &quot;Page layout&quot; template allows easy reformatting of all pages at once, which will save trouble in the long run as there will eventually be over a hundred pages.&lt;br /&gt;
Please ask if you have any questions. [[User:Liam987|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;border:1px solid;background:#0055A4;text-shadow:0 5px 8px #850000&quot;&gt;'''Liam987'''&lt;/span&gt;]] 18:32, 23 June 2012 (UTC)

 Hi! I would need the reviewer permission to revert vandalism and review others' edits. I have made more than 90 edits here. I have also done many mathematical codings as well. I would be making many edits related to mathematical codings and I think my edits can be automatically reviewed. I am a reviewer and rollbacker in English Wikipedia and I have rollback on several Wikimedia projects. By the way, am I close to autopromotion? Thanks.

:A few edits away from autopromotion. Give it a couple of days (we need to leave the request open anyway as some people object to early granting) [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 14:47, 17 February 2014 (UTC)

::[[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]], I have 118 edits now. But I'm not autopromoted. What do I lack? [[User:Jianhui67|'''&lt;font color=&quot;#0E0&quot;&gt;Jianhui67&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt; [[User talk:Jianhui67|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#1E90FF&quot;&gt;'''talk'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;★&lt;/span&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Jianhui67|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#1E90FF&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:33, 20 February 2014 (UTC)
::: By my count, you have ''exactly'' 100 content-space edits (3 in Wikijunior space and 97 in mainspace).  At a guess, looking at the [[WB:Reviewers#Automatic criteria|criteria for autopromotion]], I suspect you're not yet up to &quot;8 edits are spaced 2 or more days apart from each other (which takes at least 14 days, if you edit every 2 days).&quot;  That one is hard to judge by eye, but I'm guessing you've got an edit on Feb 20, Feb 17, Sep 23, Sep 20, and Sep 17.  That's five, although, depending on exactly how the algorithm counts, edits later today could bring the number up to six.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 11:56, 20 February 2014 (UTC)
:::: Note that the objective is not the edits counts by themselves but to give wikibookians time and experience on the project.

::::: Indeed.  To be clear, we don't mean ''deliberate'' disruption; it's just a matter of having had breadth of experience on the project, as a stable foundation for ones' judgements when exercising the bit.  Since not having the reviewer bit doesn't seriously limit contribution, we allow people to accumulate that sort of breadth before they're autopromoted.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 13:53, 20 February 2014 (UTC)

Not sure if I don't have the permissions or if I am to stupid to figure out how to do it...  If I read [[Help:Tracking changes|these instructions correctly]] I don't have permissions, because that is not what I am seeing. when I look [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Wyoming&amp;action=history here].  I work OTRS tickets mostly for Wikisource, but Wikibooks has more then Wikisource so I peak in on yours once in while to answer the easy stuff.  Wikibooks could defiantly user a stronger presence at OTRS, to answer questions. In the mean time could some one review and approve the 3 pending changes at [[History of Wyoming]] to correct a red link issue? [[User:Jeepday|Jeepday]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Jeepday|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:29, 30 September 2013 (UTC)
:That much I can do for you, though ISTR that it isn't strictly necessary in WB. Except for the kids' sections, the latest edit is what shows by default, rather than the latest approved, so the redlink issue was already resolved. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:16, 30 September 2013 (UTC)
* As Chazz notes, there's likely no great need for you to have the reviewer priv here.  Promotion is automatic once you meet the [[WB:Reviewers|criteria]]; by my count, though, over the years you've only made about 20 content-space edits (your first edit was apparently in 2006, though don't ask me how that can be so when your account here was created in 2007&amp;nbsp;:-).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 11:54, 30 September 2013 (UTC)
* I also edit with the account [[User:JeepdaySock]], not sure if that brings the count up high enough to make a difference, but given [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_administrators/G-O#J this] &amp; [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Administrators this] I am probably pretty low risk from being a potential problem.

Neuroengineering is a discipline within biomedical engineering that uses engineering techniques to understand, repair, replace, or enhance neural systems.
==Overview and History of Neuroengineering==
===Definition and Basic Principle===

Neural Engineering is the highly interdisciplinary field of neuroscience, electrical engineering,clinical neurology, materials science, nanotechnology computer engineering and so on. Prominent goals in the field is to better understand and to mimic the functioning and dysfunctioning of the nervous system and to engineer appropriate augmentation and/or substitution for dysfunctioning parts of the nervous system.

Neural Engineering combines a broad range of engineering and basic science principles together with an wide range of biological and medical sciences. It connects basic and applied engineering and science R&amp;D with basic and applied neuroscience.

===Background and History===
{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=horizontal|width=220|image1=Luigi Galvani Experiment.jpeg|image2=Guillaume Duchenne de Boulogne performing facial electrostimulus experiments.jpg|caption1=Luigi Galvani Experiment based on frog|caption2=Guillaume Duchenne de Boulogne performing facial electrostimulus experiments.}}
Electricity (in the form of electric fish) was used by ancient Egyptians and Romans for therapeutic purposes. During the 1790s, Italian physician Luigi Galvani demonstrated the electrical basis of nerve impulses when he made frog muscles twitch by jolting them with a spark from an electrostatic machine.&lt;ref name=Whittaker&gt;{{citation|last=Whittaker|first= E. T.|title=A history of the theories of aether and electricity. Vol 1| publisher=Nelson, London |year=1951|url =http://www.archive.org/details/historyoftheorie00whitrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67–71}} Scientific fellows generally accepted Galvani’s views; but Alessandro Volta demonstrated that the electricity did not come from the animal tissue but was by the contact of different metals, brass and iron, in a moist environment. On the other hand, in another experiment, Galvani caused muscular contraction by touching the exposed muscle of one frog with the nerve of another. And he proved for the first time that bioelectric forces exist within living tissue. Guillaume Duchenne (September 17, 1806, in Boulogne-sur-Mer – September 15, 1875, in Paris) revived Galvani's research. He was the first to describe several nervous and muscular disorders and, in advancing medical treatment for them, created electrodiagnosis and electrotherapy.

In the mid-twentieth century, electrical recordings became popular as a window into neuronal function

==Electrical Stimulation of Central Nervous System==
[[File:Neuronactivity.jpeg|500 px|thumb|The membrane potential in neural activity]]
The different distribution of charges between the interior and the exterior of plasma membrane produce '''membrane potential''' (also '''transmembrane potential''' or '''membrane voltage'''). Two forces that establish and maintain '''resting membrane potential''' are passive (diffusion via channels) and active (sodium-potassium pump)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Franco R, Bortner CD, Cidlowski JA |title=Potential roles of electrogenic ion transport and plasma membrane depolarization in apoptosis |journal=J. Membr. Biol. |volume=209 |issue=1 |pages=43–58 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16685600 |doi=10.1007/s00232-005-0837-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With respect to the cytoplasmic side of neuron's membrane, typical values of the resting potential range '''from –70 to –80 millivolts'''. Like muscles, neurons use changes in their membrane potential as communication signals to receive, integrate, and send information. The difference in membrane potential can be produced by the permeability of the ions and the ion concentration on the two sides of the membrane. The opening and closing of ion channels can evoke a departure from the resting potential. This is called a '''hyperpolarization''' if the interior voltage becomes more negative (say from –70 mV to –80 mV) or '''depolarization''' if the interior voltage becomes less negative (say from –70 mV to –60 mV). In excitable cells, a clearly large depolarization can cause an '''action potential''' (long distance signals). But, the ion concentrations do not normally change very quickly. Therefore, '''graded potentials''' result from the passive electrical property of the neuronal membrane.
{{Clear}}
===Action Potential===
{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=horizontal|width=300|left|image1=Action Potential.gif|image2=Action potential.svg|caption1=As an action potential travels down the axon, there is a change in polarity across the cell membrane. The Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gated Voltage-gated ion channel open and close as the membrane reaches the threshold potential, in response to a signal from another neuron. At the beginning of the action potential, the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels open and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; moves into the axon, causing depolarization. Repolarization occurs when the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels open and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; moves out of the axon. This creates a change in polarity between the outside of the cell and the inside. The impulse travels down the axon in one direction only, to the axon terminal where it signals other neurons.|caption2=Approximate plot of a typical action potential shows its various phases as the action potential passes a point on a cell membrane.  The membrane potential starts out at -70 mV at time zero.  A stimulus is applied at time = 1 ms, which raises the membrane potential above -55 mV (the threshold potential).  After the stimulus is applied, the membrane potential rapidly rises to a peak potential of +40 mV at time = 2 ms.  Just as quickly, the potential then drops and overshoots to -90 mV at time = 3 ms, and finally the resting potential of -70 mV is reestablished at time = 5 ms.}}

There are cell-to-cell communication with excitable membranes. They do not decrease in strength with distance and are referred to as &quot;nerve impulse&quot; or &quot;spikes&quot;. The temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its &quot;spike train&quot;.  Stimulus changes permeability of neuron's membrane by opening specific '''voltage-regulated gated channels''' located on axons. Axons only could generate action potentials.

Generation of Action Potential (induced by depolarization) follows three sequential changes:

'''1.Sodium permeability increases and the membrane potential is on the contrary.'''

'''2.Sodium permeability decreases.'''

'''3.Potassium permeability increases and repolarization happens.'''

===Graded Potential===
[[File:IPSPsummation.JPG|thumb|left|500px|Graph displaying an EPSP, an IPSP, and the summation of an EPSP and an IPSP]]
Voltage impulses in neuronal dendrites with various strength. Stimulation (by another neuron or as a special receptor) of the dendrites in a neuron produce a graded potential. Stimulation can occur in various ways like chemical stimulation (neurotransmitters, etc.), mechanical stimulation (certain pain receptors, hair receptor, etc.), light stimulation (photoreceptors) and a few others. Anyways, these stimulation bring the same result. Certain receptor protein ion channels on the dendrites are activated, and opened. This causes an influx (or efflux) of ions. It can cause either a depolarization (become less negative,-70 to -60mV,an excitatory response that may lead to an action potential) or hyperpolarization (become more negative, -70 to -80mV, an inhibitory response which makes it harder for an action potential to occur) according to the ion let in (or out). The more receptor protein ion channels that are stimulated the stronger, or more intense the signal. A slight stimulation of a receptor protein ion channel will often open the channel and accept ions. 

However, a depolarization of threshold strength to reach the axon hillock, it generally needs multiple depolarizing receptor protein ion channels to open. Therefore, graded potentials are accumulated. The total polarizing effect of the ion channels adds together.One channel cannot stimulate an action potential, It takes multiple channels working together to depolarize a membrane enough to cause and action potential. Graded potentials (or receptor potentials) are short lived depolarizations or hyperpolarizations of an area of membrane. These changes cause local flows of current that decrease with distance. 

The  graded potential is proportional to a direct reflection of the intensity or strength of the stimulus. The more intense the stimulus, the more ion channels that are opened, and the greater the voltage change (hyper or de- polarization) and the farther the current flows. 

Stimulated polarization happens as ions rush in. These ions accumulate near to the stimulated area. From there the surplus of ions radiates out in all directions, polarizing adjoining membranes. As this polarization spreads like a wave it leaves behind it a wake of formerly polarized membrane that very quickly returns to resting membrane potential.

===Transmission at Synapses===
Like wires in our home's electrical system, nerve cells are connected to one another in circuits called neural pathways. Unlike wires in our home, nerve cells do not touch, but come close together at synapses. At the synapse, the two nerve cells are separated by synaptic cleft. The sending neuron is called the presynaptic cell, while the receiving one is called the postsynaptic cell. Nerve cells send chemical messages with neurotransmitters in a one-way direction through the synapse from presynaptic cell to postsynaptic cell.

The transmission process at synpases that uses the neurotransmitter is follows:
# '''Synthesis and storage of neurotransmitter'''
# '''Neurotransmitter Release'''
# '''Neurotransmitter Postsynaptic Receptors'''
# '''Inactivation of Neurotransmitters'''
[[File:The synthesis, packaging, secretion, and removal of neurotransmitters..jpg|700 px|thumb|center|The synthesis, packaging, secretion, and removal of neurotransmitters. (A) The life cycle of transmitter agents entails (1) neurotransmitter synthesis, (2) packaging into vesicles, (3) fusion of vesicles resulting in neurotransmitter release, and (4) activation of postsynaptic receptors. Neurotransmitters are then removed from the synaptic cleft (5). In many cases, the neurotransmitter and/or a breakdown product is reused for neurotransmitter synthesis. (B) Small-molecule neurotransmitters are synthesized at nerve terminals. The enzymes necessary for neurotransmitter synthesis are made in the cell body of the presynaptic cell (1) and are transported down the axon by slow axonal transport (2). Precursors are taken up into the terminals by specific transporters, and neurotransmitter synthesis and packaging take place within the nerve endings (3). After vesicle fusion and release (4), the neurotransmitter may be enzymatically degraded. The reuptake of the neurotransmitter (or its metabolites) starts another cycle of synthesis, packaging, release, and removal (5). (C) Peptide neurotransmitters, as well as the enzymes that modify their precursors, are synthesized in the cell body (1). Enzymes and propeptides are packaged into vesicles in the Golgi apparatus. During fast axonal transport of these vesicles to the nerve terminals (2), the enzymes modify the propeptides to produce one or more neurotransmitter peptides (3). After vesicle fusion and exocytosis, the peptides diffuse away and are degraded by proteolytic enzymes (4).]] 

==== Synthesis and storage of neurotransmitter====
Neurotransmitter synthesized in neurons are divided into two major categories: '''small-molecule neurotransmitter''' and '''neuropeptide'''. '''Small-molecule neurotransmitters''' are synthesized within the axon terminal(e.g.acetylcholine (ACh)). Some of the precursors for the synthesis of these molecules are taken up by selective transporters on the membrane of the terminal. Others are byproducts of cellular processes within the neuron and are thus readily available. '''Neuropeptide''' are different from small-molecule neurotransmitters in both size and in the way of the synthesis. Neuropeptides generally range from 3 to 36 amino acids in length. So, they are larger than small-molecule neurotransmitters. Small neurotansmitters are made within the axon terminal as they need the simple enzymatic reactions but neuropeptides are made in the cell body as their synthesis requires peptide bond formation.The synthesis of a neuropeptide is similar to the process of any secretory protein within the cell. First, within the cell nucleus, during which a specific peptide-coding sequence of DNA,gene transcription takes place and It is used as a template to build a corresponding strand of messenger RNA. The mRNA then travels to a ribosome, where the process of translation begins. During translation, the sequence of the mRNA act as a code to string together a corresponding sequence of amino acids that will become the neuropeptide needed at the terminal. Before this molecule can be transported to the terminal for release into the synaptic cleft, it must be processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), packaged in the golgi apparatus, and transported in storage vesicles down the axon to the terminal.

Once they are synthesized, neurotransmitters, both small molecules and neuropeptides, are stored in vesicles within the axon terminal until an action potential arrives and they are released. Most small-molecule neurotransmitters are stored in small vesicles in the range of 40~60 nm in diameter.The vesicles that store neuropeptides are larger, ranging from 90 to 250 nm in diameter.

====Neurotransmitter Release====
Neurotransmitter-including vesicles are stored at the terminal of the neuron in '''active zone''' or near active zone. These vesicles are held in place by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive vesicle membrane proteins binding to actin filaments, microtubules, and various components of the cytoskeleton. When an action potential reaches the terminal of a presynaptic neuron, voltage-dependent calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) channels in the pre-synaptic membrane open and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rushes in. This influx of calcium ions triggers a series of events, which eventually release the neurotransmitter from a storage vesicle into the synaptic cleft.

====Neurotransmitter Postsynaptic Receptors====
After release into the synaptic cleft, neurotransmitters communicate with receptor proteins on the membrane of the postsynaptic cell, causing ionic channels on the membrane to open or close. When these channels open, depolarization occurs, involving the initiation of another action potential. 
There are two types of postsynaptic receptors that recognize neurotransmitters: Ionotropic receptors called ligand-gated ion channels and metabotropic receptors called G-protein linked receptors.

====Inactivation of Neurotransmitters====
After the recognition of a neurotransmitter molecule by a post-synaptic receptor, it is released back into the synaptic cleft. Once in the synapse, it must be chemically inactivated or quickly removed in order to avoid constant stimulation of the post-synaptic cell and an excessive firing of action potentials.

===Neurotransmitter===
'''Neurotransmitters''' are the brain chemicals that communicate information throughout our brain and body. Communication of information between neurons is done by movement of neurotransmitter across a small gap called the synapse. Neurotransmitters are released from one neuron at the presynaptic nerve terminal. Neurotransmitter agents include agonists, antagonists, degradation inhibitors, uptake inhibitors, depleters, precursors, and modulators of receptor function&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2011/MB_cgi?mode=&amp;term=Neurotransmitter National Library of Medicine - Medical Subject Headings,Neutrotransmitter]&lt;/ref&gt;. Neurotransmitters can be divided into amino acids, peptides, and monoamines.

==How it works==
===Neuromodulation and Neuroaugmentation===
'''Neuromodulation''' is defined as “the alteration of nerve activity through the delivery of electrical stimulation or chemical agents to targeted sites of the body,”by the International Neuromodulation Society. It is carried out to normalize – or modulate – nerve function. Neuromodulation is the process in which diverse neurotransmitters in the nervous system control various populations of neurons (one neuron uses different neurotransmitters to connect to several neurons). Neuromodulation can involve electromagnetic stimuli such as a strong magnetic field repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, a very small electric current or, potentially, light optogenetics.&lt;ref name=INS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.neuromodulation.com//neuromodulation-defined|title= International Neuromodulation Society home page|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Neuromodulation use medical device technologies to enhance or suppress activity of the nervous system for the treatment of disease. These technologies contain implantable as well as non-implantable devices that deliver electrical, chemical or other agents to reversibly modify brain and nerve cell activity.&lt;ref name=INS /&gt;

===Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation(NMES)===
'''Neuromuscular electrical stimulation''' can be widely categorized as functional or therapeutic. '''Therapeutic neuromuscular stimulation''' refers to the use of stimulation of paralyzed muscles to minimize specific impairments like motor weakness, spasticity, limited range of motion and cardiovascular deconditioning. '''Functional neuromuscular stimulation(FNS)''' refers to the use of stimulation to activate paralyzed muscles at an exact sequence to assist in the performance of daily lives(ADLs) or to provide stability to a joint to maintain original biomechanical property and the function. Devices or systems that provide FNS are called as '''neuroprosthetics'''.&lt;ref&gt;Joel A. DeLisa, ‎Bruce M. Gans, ‎Nicholas E. Walsh(2005),Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation: Principles and Practice,Lippincot Williams &amp; Wilkins,p.1405&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroregeneration===
[[File:The concept of neuroregeneration.png|left|350px|thumb|The large concept of neuroregeneration contains three landmarks: endogenous protection by growth factors, neurogenesis and neurorestoration. Rather than perceiving them as isolated events, they should be viewed interrelated, one creating the premises for generating the other.]]
Neuroregeneration indicates to the regrowth or repair of nervous tissues, cells or cell products&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroregeneration Wikipedia, Neuroregeneration]&lt;/ref&gt;. The processes that occur in regeneration can be divided into the following major events: Wallerian degeneration, axon regeneration/growth, and nerve reinnervation&lt;ref&gt;[http://missinglink.ucsf.edu/lm/ids_104_cns_injury/Response%20_to_Injury/WallerianDegeneration.htm Trauma and Wallerian Degeneration]&lt;/ref&gt;. In other views, neuroregneration contains neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, and neurorestoration--implantation of viable cells as a therapeutical approach&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2377/11/75  Enciu AM et al.Neuroregeneration in neurodegenerative disorders,BMC Neurology 2011, '''11''':75]&lt;/ref&gt;. Neuroregeneration mechanisms are very different between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the central nervous system (CNS) in view of the extents and the speeds.
====Peripheral nervous system regeneration====
Peripheral nerve damage is classified in the Seddon classification based on the extent of damage to the nerve and the surrounding connective tissue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Peripheral Nerve Injuries | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1270360-overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The lowest degree of nerve injury with a temporary interruption of conduction without loss of axonal continuity is called neurapraxia&lt;ref&gt;Otto D.Payton &amp; Richard P.Di Fabio et al.Manual of physical therapy. Churchill Livingstone Inc. ISBN 0-443-08499-8&lt;/ref&gt;. The second degree called axonotmesis is related to the loss of the relative continuity of the axon and its covering of myelin, but it preserves the connective tissue framework of the nerve ( the encapsulating tissue, the epineurium and perineurium, are preserved ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Classification of Nerve Injuries| url = http://www.medstudents.com.br/neuroc/neuroc4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The last degree called neurotmesis is a total severance or disruption of the entire nerve fiber&lt;ref&gt;Otto D.Payton &amp; Richard P.Di Fabio et al.Manual of physical therapy. Churchill Livingstone Inc. Page:24. ISBN 0-443-08499-8&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Unlike in the central nervous system, regeneration in the peripheral nervous system is possible&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenrich2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenrich|first=Keith|author2=Gordon, Tessa|title=Axonal Regeneration in the Peripheral and Central Nervous Systems - Current Issues and Advances|journal=Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences|year=2004|volume=31|issue=2|pages=142–156|url=http://cjns.metapress.com/content/u7ehr13l36wkhf9a/|issn=0317-1671}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Wallerian degeneration occurs before nerve regeneration. During Wallerian degeneration Schwann cells and macrophages interact to remove specially myelin and the damaged axon, from the distal injury site. Bands of Büngner are formed when un-innervated Schwann cells proliferate and the remaining connective tissue basement membrane forms endoneurial tubes. Bands of Büngner are important in order to guide the regrowing axon&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=William W.|title=Evaluation and management of peripheral nerve injury|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|date=31 August 2008|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1951–1965|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2008.03.018|pmid=18482862}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

At the neuronal cell body, a chromatolysis occurs in which the nucleus moves to the periphery of the cell body and the endoplasmic reticulum breaks up and disperses. Nerve damage change the metabolic function of the cell. The cell tries to produce molecules for growth and repair instead of producing molecules for synaptic transmission. These factors contains GAP-43, tubulin and actin. When the cell is ready for axon regeneration, chromatolysis is reversed&lt;ref name=&quot;medscape&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnett|first=Mark G.|title=Pathophysiology of Peripheral Nerve Injury: A Brief Review|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/480071_5|publisher=Medscape Today: Neurosurgical Focus|accessdate=11 August 2013|author2=Zager, Eric L.|year=2004|volume=16|issue=5|issn=1092-0684}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Axon regeneration is characterized by the formation of a growth cone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yoo|first=S|coauthors=van Niekerk EA, Merianda TT, Twiss JL.|title=Dynamics of axonal mRNA transport and implications for peripheral nerve regeneration|journal=Experimental Neurology|date=2010|volume=223|series=1|page=19-27|doi=10.1016/j.expneurol.2009.08.011|pmc=2849851|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849851/|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The growth cones are located on the very tips of nerve cells on structures called axons and dendrites. They include bundles of actin filaments (F-actin) that give them shape and support. The growth cone interacts with molecules produced by Schwann cells such as laminin and fibronectin&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 2008&quot;/&gt;.

====Central nervous system regeneration====
Unlike peripheral nervous system regeneration, that of the central nervous system is not followed by extensive regeneration. It is limited by the inhibitory influences of the glial and extracellular environment. Regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) would be possible that new neurons, generated from proliferation of endogenous stem/progenitor cells or under administration of exogenous stem/precursor cells with potential to substitute for lost tissue, will differentiate, survive, and integrate into existing neural networks and that axons regenerate&lt;ref name=&quot;Johansson&quot;&gt;[http://www.nature.com/jcbfm/journal/v27/n8/full/9600486a.html Johansson BB: Regeneration and plasticity in the brain and spinal cord.

==Research and Application==
===Neural Imaging===
'''Neuroimaging''' contains a variety of techniques to directly or indirectly image of the structure, function/pharmacology of thenervous system. It is a relatively new fields within medicine, neuroscience and psychology.&lt;ref name=Filler2009b&gt;{{cite journal|last=Filler|first=Aaron|title=The History, Development and Impact of Computed Imaging in Neurological Diagnosis and Neurosurgery: CT, MRI, and DTI|journal=Nature Precedings|date=12 July 2009|doi=10.1038/npre.2009.3267.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians who specialize in the performance and interpretation of neuroimaging in the clinical setting are neuroradiologists.

Neuroimaging is classified into two categories: 
* '''Structural imaging''', which deals with the structure of the nervous system and the diagnosis of gross (large scale) intracranial disease (such as tumor), and injury.
* '''functional imaging''' for diagnosing metabolic diseases and lesions on a finer scale (such as Alzheimer's disease) and for neurological and cognitive psychology research and building brain-computer interfaces.

===Neural Networks===
See also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network#History Artificial neural network]

A '''Neural Networks'''(An Artificial Neural Network:ANN) is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by animals central nervous systems, such as the brain, process information. The key element of this paradigm is the novel structure of the information processing system. It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected '''neurons''' which can compute values from inputs. The first artificial neuron was developed in 1943 by the neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and the logician Walter Pits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCulloch|first=Warren|author2=Walter Pitts|title=A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity|journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics|year=1943|volume=5|pages=115–133|doi=10.1007/BF02478259|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many important studies have been boosted by cheap computer emulations. Neural network studies slow down after publishing machine learning research by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=M.|title=An Introduction to Computational Geometry|year=1969|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-63022-2|author2=S. Papert}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1969). They found out two key issues with the computational machines that processed neural networks. The first issue was that single-layer neural networks could not process the exclusive-or circuit. The second issue was that computers were not sophisticated enough to effectively handle the long run time required by large neural networks. Neural network research slowed until computers got greater processing power. Also key later advances was the backpropagation algorithm which effectively solved the exclusive-or problem (Werbos 1975).&lt;ref name=&quot;Werbos 1975&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Werbos|first=P.J.|title=Beyond Regression: New Tools for Prediction and Analysis in the Behavioral Sciences|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Artificial Neurons====
[[File:Artificialneuronhjdevias.jpeg|300px|left|thumb| The model of an artificial neuron as the activation function of the linear combination of weighted inputs]]
An artificial neuron is a mathematical function as a model of biological neurons. Artificial neurons are the constitutive units in an artificial neural network. For a given artificial neuron, let suppose that there are ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 inputs with signals ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; through ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and weights ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; through ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;. Usually, the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; input would be the value +1, which makes it a ''bias'' input with ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''k''0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. This leaves only ''m'' actual inputs to the neuron: from ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The output of ''k''th neuron is:

:&lt;math&gt;y_k =  \varphi \left( \sum_{j=0}^m w_{kj} x_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; (phi) is the transfer function&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron wikipedia,artificial neuron]&lt;/ref&gt;.
The output is similar to the axon of a biological neuron, and its value propagates to input of the next layer, through a synapse. It may also exit the system, as part of an output vector. Its transfer function weights are calculated and threshold value are predetermined.
The limitation is simple artificial neurons, such as the McCulloch–Pitts model, are sometimes expressed as &quot;caricature models&quot;, since they try to reflect one or more neurophysiological observations, but without regard to realism.&lt;ref&gt;

Neural interface system provides a direct communication pathway between the nervous system and the outside world by stimulating or by recording from neural tissue to help people with sensory, motor, or other disabilities of neural function. These research is called a new branch of experimental neuroscience, variously named brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), neural prostheses, or neural interface systems (NISs). An electronics package in each device activates an array of tiny electrodes that contact healthy neurons in the body. Signals  by the electrodes bypass damaged areas of the brain or part of the nervous system to restore function, block pain, or prevent seizures. Although electrical stimulation systems have already broadly used for clinical application, neural interfaces that record and decipher neural signals are just starting for clinically systems to assist impaired people.

Since the late 1990, neural interface studies have developed remarkably on the basis of the closed-loop control using neuronal spikes. Chapin and colleagues showed a rat's ability to control a one-dimensional feeder through multielectrode recordings from sensorimotor cortex&lt;ref&gt;Chapin JK, Moxon KA, Markowitz RS, Nicolelis MA. Real-time control of a robot arm using simultaneously recorded neurons in the motor cortex. Nat. Neurosci. 1999;2:664–70.&lt;/ref&gt;. After that, a lot of studies(Carmena et al. 2003&lt;ref&gt;Carmena JM, Lebedev MA, Crist RE, O'Doherty JE, Santucci DM, et al. Learning to control a brain-machine interface for reaching and grasping by primates. Public Library Sci. Biol. 2003;1:1–16.&lt;/ref&gt;, Musallam et al. 2004&lt;ref&gt;Musallam S, Corneil BD, Greger B, Scherberger H, Andersen RA. Cognitive control signals for neural prosthetics.

Science. 2002;296:1829–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and so on) demonstrated that closed-loop control in primates is available. The common closed-loop neural interface system is composed of four components: (1) a recording array that extracts neural signals, (2) a decoding algorithm that translates these neural signals into a set of command signals, (3)an output device that is controlled by these command signals, and (4) sensory feedback in the form of vision and potentially other sensory modalities.

Neural implants must be designed to be as tiny as possible so as to be minimally invasive, in special areas srrounding the brain, eyes or cochlea. These implants communicate with their prosthetic counterparts wirelessly. In addition, power is currently received through wireless power transmission through the skin. Usually, the tissue near the implant is highly sensitive to temperature rise. It means that power consumption must be minimal to avoid tissue damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/qjjwu2l4n363j278/| title=Minimizing Thermal Effects of In Vivo Body Sensors | author=Daniel Garrison | accessdate=May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intracranial electrodes is composed of conductive electrode arrays implanted on a polymer or silicon, or a wire electrode with an exposed tip and insulation for the part that stimulation or recording is not needed. 

Current implantable microelectrodes could not record single- or multi-unit activity depending on a chronic scale.  Lebedev and Nicolelis reviewed the specific needs in the field to truly improve the technology to the level of clinical implementation.  In short, the 4 requirements in their review are:  
# Consistent long term (over the  years) recording of large neuronal populations in multiple brain areas;
# Efficient processing of recorded data; 
# Incorporation of feedback into the user’s body using native plasticity; 
# Advances in prosthetic technology to create artificial limbs which can reproduce the full motion.&lt;ref&gt;Lebedev, M.A., Brain–machine interfaces: past, present and future.

====Hardware====
Chips have incorporated a various amount of data compression on chip&lt;ref&gt;O'Driscoll, S.; Meng, T.H.; Shenoy, K.V. and Kemere, C. (2006). Neurons to Silicon: Implantable Prosthesis Processor IEEE ISSCC (talk) : 552-553. &lt;/ref&gt;, containing spike sorting (Chae et al., 2009). While a lot of systems have too high power consumption in order to be powered from a battery implant, Sarpeshkar et al have fabricated amplifiers and analog to digital converters at a power costless than 9 uW per 20 ksps channel&lt;ref&gt;Sarpeshkar, R. et al. (2008). Low-Power Circuits for Brain–Machine Interfaces IEEE Trans BioCAS 2(3): 173-183&lt;/ref&gt;. Although the small area and low power consumption of available integrated circuits is enough to process most of channels of neural data, some problem should be resolved. For instance, how long the implant can stay in the body? Electronics coated with 6 um parylene C have been proved to work for up to 276 days&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, A. et al. (2011). Long term in vitro functional stability and recording longevity of fully integrated wireless neural interfaces based on the Utah Slant Electrode Array J. Neural Eng. 8: 1-7&lt;/ref&gt;. Commercial systems such as Plexon, Tucker Davis, NeuroLynx, and so on depend on hermetically sealed feed-through connectors into a welded titanium casing, in which the electronics are housed. But, Brain machine interfaces which use hundreds of electrodes and high-density miniature hermetic feedthroughs do not exist yet.

===Neurorobotics===
'''Neurorobotics''' is the part of neuroscience with robotics, dealing with the study and application of science and technology of embodied autonomous neural systems like brain-inspired algorithms. Neurorobotics starts from the idea &quot;the brain is embodied and the body is embedded in the environment.&quot; A simulated environment can provide unintentional biases to the model. In addition, real environments are unpredictable, multimodal, and noisy; an artificial design of such an environment would be difficult to simulate. Therefore, most neurorobots need to work with the real world, instead of a simulated environment.&lt;ref&gt;Chiel, H. J., &amp; Beer, R. D. (1997). The brain has a body: adaptive behavior emerges from interactions of nervous system, body and environment. [Editorial Material]. Trends in Neurosciences, 20(12), 553-557.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Darwin XI's environment and experimental protocol..jpg|300px|thumb|Darwin XI's environment and experimental protocol. (A) Darwin XI at the choice point of its plus-maze environment. Darwin XI began a trial alternately at the east or west start arm and used its artificial whiskers to follow the maze arm until it reached the choice point. As it followed the maze wall, its whiskers sensed patterns of pegs, its camera sensed color cue cards on the perimeter, its compass provided heading, and its laser provided range information. (B) In the beginning of training, Darwin XI was given a rewarding stimulus when it chose the south goal arm (B1). After it successfully learned that task, the rewarding stimulus was switched to the north goal arm (B2).]]
There are a lot of classes of neurobiologically inspired robotic devices. The three common types of neurorobots are used to study motor control, memory, and action selection.
# Motor control and locomotion
# Learning and memory systems
# Value systems and action selection 
 
====Motor control and locomotion====
Neurorobots have proved good for studying animal locomotion and motor control, and for developing robot controllers. Locomotion control in robots is designed by a number of neurologically inspired theories based on the action of motor systems. Neural models of central pattern generators, clumps of motorneurons capable of driving a repetitive behavior, have been used for the vertebrate-legged locomotion like four-legged walking robots &lt;ref&gt;Ijspeert, A. J., Crespi, A., Ryczko, D., and Cabelguen, J. M. (2007). From swimming to walking with a salamander robot driven by a spinal cord model.

Philos Transact A Math Phys Eng Sci 365, 153-170&lt;/ref&gt;.
Another method for motor control is to use a predictive controller to convert awkward, error prone movements into smooth, accurate movements. Using these ideas,the robot designed to avoid obstacles &lt;ref&gt;McKinstry, J. L., Edelman, G. M., and Krichmar, J. L. (2006).

Eur J Neurosci 16, 1361-1376.&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Learning and memory systems====
Robots designed to test theories of animal memory systems. Currently,  many studies focus on the memory system of rats, the rat hippocampus, dealing with place cells, which fire  specifically at a spatial location that has been learned.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, J., and Nadel, L. (1978). The hippocampus as a cognitive map (Oxford: Clarendon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=behavior-based&gt;Mataric, M. J. (1998). Behavior-based robotics as a tool for synthesis of artificial behavior and analysis of natural behavior. [Review]. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 2(3), 82-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Value systems and action selection====
Action selection studies deal with negative or positive feedback to an action and its outcome. Examples of this studies in the brain contain the dopaminergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic systems as neurotransmitters such as dopamine or acetylcholine positively reinforce neural signals that are beneficial&lt;ref&gt;Aston-Jones, G., and Bloom, F. E. (1981). Nonrepinephrine-containing locus coeruleus neurons in behaving rats exhibit pronounced responses to non-noxious environmental stimuli.

One study of such interaction involved the robot Darwin VII, which used visual, auditory, and a simulated taste input to &quot;eat&quot; conductive metal blocks. The randomly chosen good blocks had a striped pattern on them while the bad blocks had a circular shape on them. The taste sense was simulated by conductivity of the blocks. Doya’s group has been studying the effect of multiple neuromodulators in the “Cyber-rodent” such as two-wheeled robots that move autonomously in an environment &lt;ref&gt;Doya, K., and Uchibe, E. (2005). The Cyber Rodent Project: Exploration of Adaptive Mechanisms for Self-Preservation and Self-Reproduction. Adaptive Behavior 13, 149 - 160.&lt;/ref&gt;. These robots could move for self-preservation and self-reproduction exemplified by searching for and recharging from battery packs on the floor and then communicating this information to other robots through their infrared communication ports. Including examining how neuromodulators such as dopamine can influence decision making, neuroroboticists have been investigating the basal ganglia as a model that mediates action selection

Neural Netw 19, 31-61&lt;/ref&gt;. Prescott and colleagues embedded a model of the basal ganglia in a robot that had to select from several actions relying on the environment.

===Neural tissue regeneration===
====Surgical connection in PNS====
In the peripheral nervous system, nerves can regenerate on their own if injuries are small. However, In the case of a small gap like between the proximal and distal nerve ends, it is possible to surgically reconnect the severed nerve by taking the two ends of the nerve and suturing them together. When suturing the nerves together, the fascicles of the nerve are each reconnected, bridging the nerve together. This method does not work over gaps of longer distances because of the tension that should stay on the nerve endings. This tension interrupt the nerve regeneration.&lt;ref name = Schmidt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Christine|author2=Jennie Leach|title=Neural Tissue Engineering: Strategies for Repair and Regeneration|journal=Annuls Review of Biomedical Engineering|date=June 2003|volume=5|pages=293–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tissue grafts in PNS====
Tissue grafts use nerves or other materials to bridge the two ends of the severed nerve. Tissue grafts are catagorized into autologous tissue grafts, nonautologous tissue grafts, and acellular grafts. '''Autologous tissue grafts''' means the transfer of tissue from one site to another on the same body&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/autologous+graft Free dictionary, autologous graft]&lt;/ref&gt;. These autologous nerve grafts are the current standard for PNS nerve grafting as it is highly biocompatible, but there are some problem related to harvesting the nerve from the patients themselves and storing a large amount of autologous grafts for future use. '''nonautologous tissue grafts''' and '''acellular grafts''' (containing ECM-based materials) are tissues that do not come from the patient, but can be harvested from cadavers or animals. As they are not from the patients, it is easy to get it but these tissue have some difficulty in the potential of disease transmission. Currently, there are on being investigated to increase the efficacy of nonautologous tissue grafts.&lt;ref name=Schmidt /&gt;

====Nerve guidance channel====

C, electrospun collagen/PCL nerve conduit. D, the detailed outer wall morphology of collagen/PCL nerve conduit. (Bar in A,B = 10 μm; bar in C = 100 μm; Electrospun collagen/PCL fibers which were collected onto a 1.2 mm diameter rotating mandrel formed a hollow guidance structure, as shown in Figure 2(C,D). Guidance conduits had uniform wall thickness of about 100-120 μm and inner diameter of 1.2 mm.]]
A '''nerve guidance conduit''' as opposed to an autograft is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to help nerve regeneration and is one of clinical treatments for nerve injuries. Because of the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autografting, neural tissue engineering studies has focused on the bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment. Similar techniques are also being studied for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the central nervous system would be challenged because its axons do not regenerate in their native environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmidt-2003-ARBE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schmidt | first = C.

In this method, two types of materials are used:natural materials and synthetic materials.

'''Biological materials''' mostly have good biocompatibility and can be easily degraded as it is from nature. However, unfortunately, it has the limitation in order to control mechanical properties and degradation rates. Besides, there is always the possibility that naturally-derived materials may cause an immune response or contain microbes&lt;ref name=&quot;Lavik-2004-AMB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lavik | first = E. |author2=Langer, R. |date=July 2004 | title = Tissue engineering: current state and perspectives | journal = Applied Microbiology Biotechnology | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | pmid = 15221227 | url = | doi = 10.1007/s00253-004-1580-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the production of naturally-derived materials there will  be unexpected results in large-scale purification process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cai-2005-JBMRa&quot;/&gt; Some other problems is plaguing natural polymers could not support growth across long lesion gaps due to the possibility of collapse, scar formation, and early re-absorption.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cai-2005-JBMRa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cai | first = J. | coauthors = Peng, X.; Nelson, K.

'''Synthetic materials''' also provide an another method for tissue regeneration. synthetic polymers may be non-degradable or degradable. But, for neural tissue engineering degradable materials are preferred as long-term effects such as inflammation and scar could damage nerve function. Mechanical properties and degradation rates of the polymers can be controlled according to the purpose, and they eliminate the concern for immunogenicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lavik-2004-AMB&quot;/&gt; There are many different synthetic materials currently being used in neural tissue engineering. However, the problem is a lack of biocompatibility and bioactivity of these materials. It means these polymers are not perfect for promoting cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wu-2006-JHUST&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wu | first = Y. | coauthors = Zheng, Q.; Du, J.; Song, Y.; Wu, B. &amp; Guo, X. | year = 2006 | title = Self-assembled IKVAV peptide nanofibers promote adherence of PC12 cells | journal = Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Medical Science) | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 594–596 | pmid = 17219978 | url = | doi = 10.1007/s11596-006-0530-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the materials most commonly researched mainly focus on biodegradable polyesters such as copolymer or blend of poly lactic acid, poly glycolic acid, polycaprolactone, polyethyleneglycol(FDA approved), biodegradable polyurethane, other polymers, and biodegradable glass are also being investigated. Other potentials for synthetic materials are conducting polymers and biologically modified polymers to promote cell axon growth and maintain the axon channel.&lt;ref name=Schmidt /&gt;

====Implantation of stem cells or neural tissue====

[[File:MESC EBs.jpg|right|thumb|Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESCs) embryoid bodies (EBs)]]
It is possible to artificially create tissue outside of the body to implant into the injury site. This method could treat injuries with large cavities, where a lot of neural tissue needs to be replaced and regenerated. Neural tissue could be grown in vitro with neural stem or progenitor cells in a 3D scaffold, forming embryoid bodies (EBs). These EBs is composed of a sphere of stem cells, where the inner cells are undifferentiated neural cells, and the surrounding cells are more differentiated. 3D scaffolds is for transplant of tissue to the injury site and building the suitable interface between the artificial and the brain tissue. The scaffolds should be biodegradable and biocompatible. It need to fit injury site, close to existing tissue and support growing cells and tissues. The combination of using the stem cells and scaffolds increase the survival of the stem cells in the injury site, increasing the efficacy of the treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forraz&quot;&gt;Forraz, N.; Wright, K.

====Delivery of molecules====
[[File:Drugdeliverybrain.jpeg|left|300px|thumb|Strategies for brain drug delivery]]
Molecules that enhance the regeneration of neural tissue, including pharmaceutical drugs, growth factors known as morphogens, and miRNA can also be directly injected to the injury site of the damaged CNS tissue. The strategies for brain drug delivery may be widely categorized into invasive (neurosurgical-based), pharmacologic-based, or physiologic-based. The neurosurgical-based strategies contain intraventricular drug infusion, intracerebral implants, and BBB disruption. The pharmacologic-based strategies include the use of particles such as microspheres, nanospheres made by emulsion, spraydrying, dispersion and so on. &lt;ref&gt;William M Pardridge,Drug Delivery to the Brain,Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism (1997) 17, 713–731&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menei P, Montero-Menei C, Venier MC, Benoit JP,Drug delivery into the brain using poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres,Expert Opin Drug Deliv. 2005 Mar;2(2):363-76&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deep brain stimulation (DBS)''' is a neurosurgical procedure which implant a tiny medical device called a brain pacemaker, which sends electrical impulses through implanted electrodes to specific area of the brain for the treatment of movement and affective disorders.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved DBS as a treatment for Parkinson's disease in 2002,&lt;ref name=USDHHS&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/NEW00580.html FDA approves implanted brain stimulator to control tremors.] Retrieved October 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  dystonia in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://knbc-tvhealth.ip2m.com/index.cfm?pt=itemDetail&amp;item_id=97349&amp;site_cat_id=470 'Brain pacemaker' treats dystonia.] KNBC TV, April 22, 2003.

The deep brain stimulation system is composed of three components: the implanted pulse generator (IPG), the lead, and the extension.  The '''IPG''' is a battery -powered neurostimulator enclosed in a titanium housing, which sends electrical pulses to the brain to interfere with neural activity at the target site. The '''lead''' is a coiled wire insulated in biocompatible but nondegradable polymer like polyurethane with four platinum or iridium electrodes and is placed in one or two different nuclei of the brain. The lead is connected to the IPG by the '''extension'''. It is an insulated wire that runs below the skin, from the head, down the side of the neck, behind the ear to the IPG, which is placed below the clavicle or, in some cases, the abdomen.&lt;ref name=NINDS&gt;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

All three components are surgically implanted in the brain. Lead implantation may cause local anesthesia or general anesthesia (&quot;asleep DBS&quot;). A hole about 14&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter is drilled in the skull and the probe electrode is inserted. During the awake procedure with local anesthesia, feedback from the patient determines the best placement of the permanent electrode. During the asleep procedure, intraoperative MRI guidance is used for the determination of the electrode. &lt;ref&gt;Starr PA, Martin AJ, Ostrem JL, Talke P, Levesque N, Larson PS.

[[Image:Diagram of the human heart (cropped).svg|thumb|left|350px|Diagram of the human heart]]
As all the cell in the human body could not exchange with nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and the waste products of metabolism, energy and momentum, the high way network in the physiological system transport the mass between the cell in order to hold all the body. This high way network, called cardiovascular system, includes a pumping station, the heart; a working fluid, blood; a complex branching configuration of distributing and collecting pipes and channels, blood vessels; and a complicated means for intrinsic (inherent) and extrinsic (autonomic and endocrine) control.
===The blood===
The blood supplies oxygen and nutrients including constitutional elements to tissues and remove waste products. Blood also transport hormones and other substances to tissues and organs. 

Blood consists of plasma(55% of blood volume) and blood cell or hematocytes (approximately, %8±1 of body weight). Hematocytes are suspended in continus plasma fluid and could divided into red blood cells (erythrocytes, totalling nearly 95% of the formed elements), white blood cells(leukocytes, averaging &lt;0.15% of all hematocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes, on the order of 5% of all blood cells). Hematocytes are derived in the active (“red”) bone marrow from undifferentiated stem cells (called hemocytoblasts) and matured through hematocytopoiesis.

==Endocrine System==
'See also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system Wikipedia,endocrine system] and [[Human Physiology/The endocrine system]]
[[Image:Illu endocrine system.png|left|thumb|350 px|Major endocrine glands. (Male left, female on the right.) '''1.''' Pineal gland '''2.''' Pituitary gland '''3.''' Thyroid gland '''4.''' Thymus '''5.''' Adrenal gland '''6.''' Pancreas '''7.''' Ovary '''8.''' Testis]]
The endocrine system means the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones(in other words, produce messengers like small molecules) directly into the circulatory system to be carried toward a distant target organ. In order to grow, maintain a constant temperature, produce offspring, or perform the basic actions and functions, essentially, hormones like small chemicals(in other words, messengers) should  enter the blood stream. So, the endocrine system could provides an electrochemical connection from the hypothalamus of the brain to all the organs for controling the body metabolism, growth and development, and reproduction.

The endocrinology is a relatively long history. But In the late 1960s as sensitive and relatively specific analytical methods introduced,the measurement of low concentrations of circulating hormones is easier and cheaper. Since then, it is easier to understand endocrine physiology and mechanisms of regulation and control. Competitive protein binding and radioimmunoassays brought progress of the study about the physiology of individual endocrine glands and of the neural control of the pituitary gland and the overall feedback control of the endocrine system. Cellular and molecular biology and recombinant DNA technology helped the endocrine system research, too.

At the same time, the interactive researches between mathematical modeling and experimental studies make it possible to understand endocrine dynamics.

===Hormones and signal, interaction between the tissue and the cell===
Hormones can be classified into four groups (1) steroid hormones, (2) peptide and protein hormones, (3) amino acids derivatives, principally
the aromatic amino acid tyrosine, and (4) the eicosanoids (fatty acid derivatives).

1. Steroids are lipids, more specifically, derivatives of cholesterol produced by chemical modification.

2. Peptide and protein hormones are synthesized in the cellular endoplasmic reticulum and then transferred to the Golgi apparatus where they are packaged into secretory vesicles for export.

3. Amino acid derivatives: There are two groups of hormones derived from the amino acid tyrosine;thyroid hormones and catecholamines.
Thyroid hormones are basically a “double” tyrosine ring incorporating three or four iodine atoms. Catecholamines include epinephrine and norepinephrine that have the capability of functioning as both hormones and neurotransmitters.

4.Eicosanoids are large groups of polyunsaturated fatty acids derivatives like the prostaglandins, prostacyclins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes.
===Hormone actions at cell level===
[[File:Steroid and Lipid Hormones.svg|center|thumb|500px|The left diagram shows a steroid (lipid) hormone (1) entering a cell and (2) binding to a receptor protein in the nucleus, causing (3) mRNA synthesis which is the first step of protein synthesis. The right side shows protein hormones (1) binding with receptors which (2) begins a transduction pathway. The transduction pathway ends (3) with transcription factors being activated in the nucleus, and protein synthesis beginning. In both diagrams, a is the hormone, b is the cell membrane, c is the cytoplasm, and d is the nucleus.]]

==Nervous System==
[[Image:Nervous system diagram-en.svg|Nervous system|framed|center]]
The nervous system can be defined as the network of nerve cells and fibers that that sends messages for controlling movement and feeling between the brain and the other parts of the body. This nervous system is composed of the brain and spinal cord, nerves, ganglia, and parts of the receptor organs and that receives and interprets stimulus and transmits impulses to the effector organs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that we've covered the basics of compilation and modularity (we'll refine that section later) lets move on to game design. Our game will be implemented using the terminal and will not rely on any third party libraries, save for the ones that come with C by default. We'll take a [[wikipedia:Top-down_and_bottom-up_design| Bottom-Up]] approach to creating our [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game Role-playing Game] (hereafter referred to as an RPG).

== Specifications ==

When undergoing a new project of some complexity, it is important to do some brainstorming about what your program will do and how you'll implement it. While that may sound painfully obvious, it is often tempting to jump right into coding and implement ideas as they pop into your head. It isn't until the code becomes hundreds of lines long does it become clear that organizing your thoughts is necessary. The initial brainstorming phase takes the main idea, an RPG in this case, and breaks it down into more elementary pieces. For each element, we either break it down into still smaller elements, or give a short summary of how we might implement it. In a commercial environment, this brainstorming session produces a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document Specification Document].

At the heart of every RPG, we have players.

'''Players shouldː'''
* Have stats that tell us about their abilities.
* Be able to interact with each other (i.e. Talking, Fighting)
* Be able to move from one location to another.
* Be able to carry items.

'''Statsː'''
Easy. Just a variable telling us what the stat is for (like, health) and containing an integer value.

'''Talkingː'''
To facilitate conversation, players need scripted dialog. This dialog could be stored with the main character, or the person with whom the main character will interact, and in the case of the latter, must be accessible by the main character.

'''Fightingː'''
A function, that when given a player (to attack) initiates a battle sequence, that persists until someone retreats or a player's health is reduced to 0.

'''Movingː'''
A player should contain a node for a linked list or binary tree. The first location node tells us where the player came from, where he is currently, and where he can go from there. &quot;Where we can go&quot; is a memory address (think, RAM) that tells the computer where another location node can be found. This new node will be structured the same as the first, but contain different information. Moving will involve changing the memory address of the current node (Swamp, let's say), to the memory address of another node (Forest). If that sounds confusing, don't worry, I'll make pictures to illustrate the concept. ː)

'''Inventoryː'''
Inventory will start out as a doubly linked list. An item node contains an item (Health Potion), the number of that item, a description of the item, and two links. One link to the previous item in the list, and a second link to the next item in the list.

This preliminary specification acts as a blueprint for the next phase, the actual coding portion. Now that we've broken the main idea into smaller elements, we can focus on creating separate modules that enable these things. As an example, we will implement the player and player functions in the Main file for testing. Once we're positive that our code is working properly, we can migrate our datatypes and functions into a Header file, which we'll call whenever we want to create and manipulate players. Doing this will significantly reduce the amount of code to look at in the main file, and keeping player functions in the player header file will give us a logical place to look for, add, remove, and improve player functions. As we progress, we may think of new things to add to our specification.

== Player Implementation ==

Because a player is too complex to represent with a single variable, we must create a Structure. Structures are complex datatypes that can hold several datatypes at once. Below, is a rudimentary example of a player structure.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
struct playerStructure {
    char name[50];
    int health;
    int mana;
};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Using the keyword '''struct''', we declare a complex datatype called '''playerStructure'''. Within the curly braces, we define it with all the datatypes needs to hold for us. This structure can be used to create new structures just like it. Let's use it to make a Hero and display his stats.

''player.c''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct playerStructure {
    char name[50];
    int health;
    int mana;
} Hero;

// Function Prototype
void DisplayStats (struct playerStructure Target);

int main() {
    // Assign stats
    strcpy(Hero.name, &quot;Sir Leeroy&quot;);
    Hero.health = 60;
    Hero.mana = 30;

    DisplayStats(Hero);
    return(0);
}

// Takes a player as an argument and prints their name, health, and mana. Returns nothing.
void DisplayStats (struct playerStructure Target) {
    // We don't want to keep retyping all this.
    printf(&quot;Name: %s\nHealth: %d\nMana: %d\n&quot;, Target.name, Target.health, Target.mana);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Let's review what our code does. We've included a new standard library called '''&lt;string.h&gt;''' which contains functions that are helpful in working with strings. Next, we define the complex datatype playerStructure and immediately declare a playerStructure called Hero right after it. Be aware, the semicolon is always necessary after defining the struct. Unlike higher level languages, strings cannot be assigned in C using the assignment operator =, only the individual characters that make up the string can be assigned. Since name is 50 characters long, imagine that we have 50 blank spaces. To assign &quot;Sir Leeroy&quot; to our array, we must assign each character to a blank space, in order, like so:

name[0] = 'S'

name[1] = 'i'

name[2] = 'r'

name[3] = ' '

name[4] = 'L'

name[5] = 'e'

name[6] = 'e'

name[7] = 'r'

name[8] = 'o'

name[9] = 'y'

name[10] = '\0'   // End of string marker

The function Strcpy() essentially loops through the array until it reaches the end of string marker for either arguments and assigns characters one at a time, filling the rest with blanks if the string is smaller than the size of the array we're storing it in.

The variables in our structure, Player, are called members, and they are accessed via the syntax '''struct.member'''.

Now our game would be boring, and tranquil, if it just had a Hero and no enemies. In order to do add more players, we would need to type &quot;struct playerStructure variableName&quot; to declare new players. That's tedious and prone to mistakes. Instead, it would be much better if we had a special name for our player datatype that we could call as wisfully as char or int or float. That's easily done using the keyword '''typedef'''ǃ Like before, we define the complex datatype playerstructure, but instead of declaring a playerStructure afterward, we create a keyword that can declare them whenever we want.

''player2.c''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

typedef struct playerStructure {
    char name[50];
    int health;
    int mana;
} player;

// Function Prototype
void DisplayStats (player Target);
 
int main () {
    player Hero, Villain;
    
    // Hero
    strcpy(Hero.name, &quot;Sir Leeroy&quot;);
    Hero.health = 60;
    Hero.mana = 30;
 
    // Villain
    strcpy(Villain.name, &quot;Sir Jenkins&quot;);
    Villain.health = 70;
    Villain.mana = 20;

    DisplayStats(Hero);
    DisplayStats(Villain);
    return(0);
}

// Takes a player as an argument and prints their name, health, and mana. Returns nothing.
void DisplayStats (player Target) {
    printf(&quot;Name: %s\nHealth: %d\nMana: %d\n&quot;, Target.name, Target.health, Target.mana);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

There is still the problem of creating players. We could define every single player who will make an appearance in our game at the start of our program. As long as the list of players is short, that might be bearable, but each of those players occupies memory whether they are used or unused. Historically, this would be problematic due to the scarcity of memory on old computers. Nowadays, memory is relatively abundant, but for the sake of scalability, and because users will have other applications running in the background, we'll want to be efficient with our memory usage and use it dynamically. 

Dynamically allocating memory is accomplished through the use of the '''malloc''', a function included in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;. Given a number of bytes to return, malloc finds unused memory and hands us the address to it. To work with this memory address, we use a special datatype called a '''pointer''', that is designed to hold memory addresses. Pointers are declared like any other datatype, except we put an asterisk (*) in front of the variable name. Consider this line of codeː

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
player *Hero = malloc(sizeof(player));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This is the standard way of declaring a pointer and assigning it a memory address. The asterisk tells us that instead of declaring a player, with a fixed, unchangeable address in memory, we want a variable that can point to any player's address. Uninitialized pointers have NULL as their value, meaning they don't point to an address. Since it would be difficult to memorize how many bytes are in a single datatype, let alone our player structure, we use the sizeof function to figure that out for us. Sizeof returns the number of bytes in player to malloc, which finds enough free memory for a player structure and returns the address to our pointer.

If malloc returns the memory address 502, Hero will now point to a player who exists at 502. Pointers to structures have a unique way of calling members. Instead of a period, we now use an arrow (-&gt;).

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
player *Hero = malloc(sizeof(player));
strcpy(Hero-&gt;name, &quot;Leeroy&quot;);
Hero-&gt;health = 60;
Hero-&gt;mana = 30;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Remember, pointers don't contain values like integers and chars, they just tell the computer where to find those values. When we change a value our pointer points to, we're telling the computer &quot;Hey, the value I want you to change lives at this address (502), I'm just directing traffic.&quot; So when you think of pointers, think &quot;Directing Traffic&quot;. Here's a table to show what pointer declarations of various types meanː


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Declaration !! What it means.
|-
| char *variable || Pointer to char
|-
| int *variable || Pointer to int
|-
| float *variable || Pointer to float
|-
| player *variable || Pointer to player
|-
| player **variable || Pointer to a pointer to player
|}

Now that we're using pointers, we can write a function to dynamically allocate players. And while we're at it, let's add some new ideas to our specification.

'''Players shouldː'''
* Have stats that tell us about their abilities. ''DONE''
* Be able to interact with each other (i.e. Talking, Fighting)
* Be able to move from one location to another.
* Be able to carry items.
* Have classes (Warrior, Mage, Ranger, Accountant) ''NEW''
** Classes have unique stats when they are created. Exampleː Warriors have high health, mages have low health. ''NEW''

''dynamicPlayers.c''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

// Classes are enumerated. WARRIOR = 0; RANGER = 1, etc.
typedef enum ClassEnum  {
  WARRIOR,
  RANGER,
  MAGE,
  ACCOUNTANT
} class;

typedef struct playerStructure {
  char name[50];
  class class;
  int health;
  int mana;
} player;

// Function Prototypes
void DisplayStats(player *target);
int SetName(player *target, char name[50]);
player* NewPlayer(class class, char name[50]);    // Creates player and sets class.

int main() {
  player *Hero = NewPlayer(WARRIOR, &quot;Sir Leeroy&quot;);
  player *Villain = NewPlayer(RANGER, &quot;Sir Jenkins&quot;);

  DisplayStats(Hero);
  DisplayStats(Villain);
  return(0);
}

// Creates player and sets class.
player* NewPlayer(class class, char name[50]) {
  // Allocate memory to player pointer.
  player *tempPlayer = malloc(sizeof(player));
  SetName(tempPlayer, name);

  // Assign stats based on the given class.
  switch(class) {
  case WARRIOR:
    tempPlayer-&gt;health = 60;
    tempPlayer-&gt;mana = 0;
    class = WARRIOR;
    break;
  case RANGER:
    tempPlayer-&gt;health = 35;
    tempPlayer-&gt;mana = 0;
    class = RANGER;
    break;
  case MAGE:
    tempPlayer-&gt;health = 20;
    tempPlayer-&gt;mana = 60;
    class = MAGE;
    break;
  case ACCOUNTANT:
    tempPlayer-&gt;health = 100;
    tempPlayer-&gt;mana = 100;
    class = ACCOUNTANT;
    break;
  default:
    tempPlayer-&gt;health = 10;
    tempPlayer-&gt;mana = 0;
    break;
  }

  return(tempPlayer); // Return memory address of player.
}

void DisplayStats(player *target)  {
  printf(&quot;%s\nHealth: %d\nMana: %d\n\n&quot;, target-&gt;name, target-&gt;health, target-&gt;mana);
}

int SetName(player *target, char name[50]) {
  strcpy(target-&gt;name, name);
  return(0);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Before we move on to the next major development, you'll want to modularize what you've written. Start by making two header files, one named &quot;gameProperties.h&quot; and another called &quot;players.h&quot;. In the game properties file, place your playerStructure and classEnum typedefs. The datatypes defined here will have the possibility of appearing in any other headers we may create. Therefore, this will always be the first header we call. Next, all functions related to creating and modifying players, as well as their prototypes, will go in our players header file.

===Fight System===

Rome wasn't built in a day and neither are good fight systems, but we'll try our best. Now that we have an enemy we are obligated to engage him in a friendly bout of fisticuffs. For our players to fight, we'll need to include two additional stats in our player structure, Attack and Defense. In our specification, all that our Fight function entailed was an argument of two players, but with further thought, lets do damage based on an EffectiveAttack, which is Attack minus Defense.

In the gameProperties header, modify playerStructure for two more integer variables, &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;defense&quot;.

''gameProperties.h''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Classes are enumerated. WARRIOR = 0; RANGER = 1, etc.
typedef enum ClassEnum  {
    WARRIOR,
    RANGER,
    MAGE,
    ACCOUNTANT
} class;

// Player Structure
typedef struct playerStructure {
    char name[50];
    class class;
    int health;
    int mana;
    int attack;    // NEWː Attack power.
    int defense;   // NEWː Resistance to attack.
} player;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In the players header file, modify the case statements to assign values to the attack and defense attributes.

''players.h''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Creates player and sets class.
player* NewPlayer(class class, char name[50]) {
    // Allocate memory to player pointer.
    player *tempPlayer = malloc(sizeof(player));
    SetName(tempPlayer, name);

    // Assign stats based on the given class.
    switch(class) {
    case WARRIOR:
        tempPlayer-&gt;health = 60;

  strcpy(target-&gt;name, name);
  return(0);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Finally, include your header files in your main program. Instead of sharp brackets &lt;&gt; we use quotation marks instead. If the headers are located in the same file as the executable, you only need to provide the name. If your header file is in a folder somewhere else, you'll need to provide the full path of the file location.

Let's also develop a rudimentary fight system to make use the attack and defense attributes.

''player3.c''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &quot;gameProperties.h&quot;
#include &quot;players.h&quot;

// Function Prototype
int Fight (player *Attacker, player ̈*Target);
 
int main () {
    player *Hero = NewPlayer(WARRIOR, &quot;Sir Leeroy&quot;);
    player *Villain = NewPlayer(RANGER, &quot;Sir Jenkins&quot;);

    DisplayStats(Villain);   // Before the fight.
    Fight(Hero, Villain);    // FIGHTǃ
    DisplayStats(Villain);   // After the fight.
    return(0);
}

int Fight (player *Attacker, player *Target) {
    int EffectiveAttack; // How much damage we can deal is the difference between the attack of the attacker
                         // And the defense of the target. In this case 5 - 1 = 4 = EffectiveAttack.
 
    EffectiveAttack = Attacker-&gt;attack - Target-&gt;defense;
    Target-&gt;health = Target-&gt;health - EffectiveAttack;
    return(0);
} 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

If we run compile and run this we get this outputː

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
Name: Sir Jenkins
Health: 35
Mana: 0
Name: Sir Jenkins
Health: 34         // An impressive 1 damage dealt. 
Mana: 0
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''TODOː Adjust class stats to something more diverse.'''

Now that we've figured out how to deal damage, lets expand on our earlier specificationː

'''Fight() shouldː'''
* Loop until someones' health reaches zero, retreats, or surrenders.
* Display a menu of options to the user before getting input.
** Attack, Defend, Use Item, and Run should be basic choices.
* Tell us if we gave the wrong input.
* Give both sides a chance to act. Possibly by swapping the memory address of the Attacker and Target.
** This means that we'll need to distinguish between the User's player and non-user players.  
** We may need to revise the swapping idea later if fights involve more than two characters. Then we might use some kind of list rotation.
*** Games that use speed as a factor (Agility), probably build lists based on stats before the fight to determine who goes first.

I'll refrain from posting the whole program when possible but I encourage you to continue making incremental changes and compiling/running the main program as we go along. For the battle sequence, we will modify the Fight function to loop until the Target's health reaches 0, whereupon a winner is named. A user interface will be provided by a &quot;Fight Menu&quot; which will pair a number with an action. It is our responsibility to modify this menu as new actions are added and make sure each individual action works when called. 

When the User chooses an action, the associated number is handed to a '''Switch''', which compares a given variable to a series of '''Cases'''. Each case has a number or character (strings aren't allowed) that is used for the aforementioned comparison. If Switch finds a match, it evaluates all the statements in that Case. We must use the keyword '''break''' to tell the switch to stop evaluating commands, or else it will move the to next case and execute those statements (sometimes that's useful, but not for our purpose). If Switch cannot match a variable to a case, then it looks for a special case called '''default''' and evalutes it instead. We'll always want to have a default present to handle unexpected input.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int Fight(player *Attacker, player *Target) {
    int EffectiveAttack = Attacker-&gt;attack - Target-&gt;defense;
 
    while (Target-&gt;health &gt; 0) {
        DisplayFightMenu();
        
        // Get input.
        int choice;
        printf(&quot;&gt;&gt; &quot;); // Indication the user should type something.
        fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);
        sscanf(line, &quot;%d&quot;, &amp;choice);
 
        switch (choice) {
        case 1:
            Target-&gt;health = Target-&gt;health - EffectiveAttack;
            printf(&quot;%s inflicted %d damage to %s.\n&quot;, Attacker-&gt;name, EffectiveAttack, Target-&gt;name);
            DisplayStats(Target);
            break;
        case 2:
            printf(&quot;Running away!\n&quot;);
            return(0);
        default:
            printf(&quot;Bad input. Try again.\n&quot;);
            break;
        }
    }
   
   // Victoryǃ
   if (Target-&gt;health &lt;= 0) {
     printf(&quot;%s has bested %s in combat.\n&quot;, Attacker-&gt;name, Target-&gt;name) ;
   }
 
      return(0);
}
 
void DisplayFightMenu () {
printf(&quot;1) Attack\n2) Run\n&quot;);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Testing the integrity of the program requires running it a few times after compilation. First we can see that if we enter random input like &quot;123&quot; or &quot;Fish&quot; we invoke the default case and are forced to pick another answer. Second, entering 2 will cause us to run away from the fight. Third, if we continue to enter 1, eventually Sir Leeroy will widdle down all of Sir Jenkin's health and be declared winner. Modifying the attack value on Sir Leeroy can help if you're impatient ː)

However, Sir Jenkins is still unable to defend himself, which makes for a very unsporting match. Even if Sir Jenkins was given a turn, the user would still be prompted to act on his behalf. The turn-based problem is solved by the idea proposed in the specification, that we swap the memory addresses of the Attacker and Target pointers on each loop. The solution to the problem of autonomy is to add a new property to our player structure, namely, a bool. A bool has a binary value, true or false, and, for us, it answers the simple question &quot;To Autopilot or not to autopilot?&quot;. With the autopilot bool set to true, the Fight function, when modified by us to check for it, will know that they must automate the actions of these characters. To use bool datatypes, we need to include a new header called '''&lt;stdbool.h&gt;'''. Bools are declared with the '''bool''' keyword and can only be assigned true or false values.

Add the following line underneath ''int defense'' in your playerStructure from the &quot;gameProperties.h&quot;.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; bool autoPilot; &lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Next, add this snippet of code to the NewPlayer function from the &quot;Players.h&quot; below the call to SetName.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
static int PlayersCreated = 0; // Keep track of players created.
if (PlayersCreated &gt; 0) {
    tempPlayer-&gt;autoPilot = true;
} else {
    tempPlayer-&gt;autoPilot = false;
}
++PlayersCreated;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The above code creates a persistent variable using the keyword '''static'''. Normally, once a function is called, the local variables disappear. By contrast, static variables maintain their value beyond the life of the function, and when a function starts again, it's value isn't reset. Autopilot is only turned on for players created after the first, main character.

That done, consider the following program. We've added our bools and IF statements to determine whether the player needs automating or prompting. The victory IF is moved inside the while loop, and declares victory if the condition is met, else, it swaps players for the next loop.

Now that we've created a very rudimentary system for fighting, it is time once again to modularize. Take the Fight and DisplayFightMenu functions and put them in a new header file called &quot;fightSys.h&quot;. This new header will contain all functions related to fighting and will be included in the next iteration of our Main program.

===Inventory System===

There is nothing quite so satisfying as equipping one's character. Most of the time, you start out at level 1, wearing rags and shackles. After being released from the local dungeon for one reason or another, you meet a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haberdasher Haberdasher] with a heart of gold. He gives you some odd jobs so you can earn enough copper to eat. After weeks of punching things, fetching things, running from things, and still without two copper pieces to scratch together, you at last come across the &quot;Unremarkable Sword of Rusty Might&quot;. Huzzahǃ It nothing compared to what the City Guard is using, but now those sewer rats shall feel your wrath. So let's get to itǃ

'''An Inventory Shouldː'''
* Contain a list of items.
* We should be able to ADD and REMOVE items from the list, as well as FIND items.
* Similar items should be aggregated. When a similar item is added, quantity is increased, not list size.
* Players should have their own inventory, as should chests and other containers.

'''An Item Shouldː'''
* Have a name and description.
* Health and mana.
** These are the restorative properties of potions. 20 Health heals 20 health points if consumed.
* Similar items should be aggregated. When a similar item is added, quantity is increased, not list size.
* Have the option of multiple uses.
* Have an ID that uniquely identifies it.

Putting the above specification into practice, we start by defining the kinds of items available, via an enumeration. In the future, we may want to import a list of items from a file, rather than keeping all of them with our source code. However, it's best to keep things small for testing purposes.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// 0 based.
enum itemNumber {
   HEALTH_POTION,
   MANA_POTION
};

typedef struct ItemStructure {
   char name[50];
   char description [100];
   int health;
   int mana;
   int quantity;
   int usesLeft;
   int id;
} item;

// Doubly linked list for items.
typedef struct itemNodeStructure {
   item *current;	                 // Pointer to current item.
   struct itemNodeStructure *previous;   // Pointer to previous item in the list.
   struct itemNodeStructure *next;	 // Pointer to the next item in the list.
} itemNode;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


Each item that we create will be embedded in an item [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_%28computer_science%29 node]. A node is a single unit which can be linked to other nodes in order to form a data structures such as lists and trees. In this case, the data structure is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list doubly linked list]. As you can see, the itemNodeStructure points forwards, backwards, and to its own item. When defining the itemNodeStructure, it is necessary to use &quot;struct itemNodeStructure&quot; to declare the pointers because the itemNode typedef is not yet in effect and the compiler will not understand.


Going back to ye olde playerStructure datatype, we add a new value to it.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; itemNode *inventory; &lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Because the functions required for a basic inventory setup are somewhat involved, it cannot be broken up into more digestible pieces. My code is very likely not the most elegant solution to the problem, so there is room for improving the clarity. For now, if you want to understand how the functions for the inventory work, you'll need to read through the comments until you can identify what each piece of code is doing.

This references many things that were never introduced up to this point. It needs to be rewritten and/or more intro to some of these concepts added or orders changed.

:It is fast-paced for sure, but a hands-on tutorial like this one shouldn't be slowed down too much. The hope is that readers who find the explanations complicated can hop over to the tutorial, get it working and have an insight. That will probably make more sense once Understanding Arrows is fixed, as then it will actually helpful to read both chapters in parallel.--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 08:50, 16 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

==养不教　父之过　教不严　师之惰==

To feed without teaching,

is the father's fault.

==为人子　方少时　亲师友　习礼仪==

He who is the son of a man,

== 100% modules ==

Hi Benjamin,

Thank you for your work on A-level computing, you've really moved the Unit 3 modules along.  I'm afraid I've had to revert your 100% completion summaries. On the AQA A-Level Computing wikibook we are looking for a few things before we can say a module is signed off:

* Theory
* Definitions
* Diagrams
* example worked questions
* questions for students
* extension topics
* proof reading

Without the whole list we can't really sign something off as complete, even though it might be fully usable as a revision resource

All the best, and please get in contact if you have any questions

{{displaytitle|title=Problem Solving: Backus-Naur Form}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;
'''Backus-Naur Form''' (also known as '''Backus Normal Form (BNF)''' or '''BNF''' for short) is a notation technique to express syntax of languages in computing. The expression is put in lists and can be used to see if syntax that is written is valid. Backus-Naur means &quot;not in normal form compared to convention&quot;.

==Structure and Layout==
===Symbols===
BNF is represented using the following symbols:
  ::=   'is defined as'
  |     'or'
  &lt;&gt;    category names

The way that these symbols are laid out are as such:
  &lt;Parent Expression&gt; ::= &lt;Child Expression 1&gt; | &lt;Child Expression 2&gt;
In plain English, the expression above means &quot;The parent expression is defined as the child expression 1 or the child expression 2&quot;. This means that to make up the parent expression, it must have a child expression and a child expression is made up of other things.
==Example==
In this example, The BNF structure is breaking down the syntax to create 
{{CPTExample|title=Backus-Naur Form Breakdown of a Home Address}}
  &lt;Address&gt; ::= &lt;House Number&gt; &lt;Street Name&gt; &lt;Town Name&gt; &lt;City Name&gt; &lt;Country&gt; &lt;Postcode&gt; | &lt;House Number&gt; &lt;Street Name&gt; &lt;City Name&gt; &lt;Country&gt; &lt;Post Code&gt;

  &lt;Postcode&gt; ::= &lt;Area Code&gt; &lt;Street Code&gt;
  &lt;Area Code&gt; ::= &lt;City Prefix&gt; &lt;digit&gt; | &lt;City Prefix&gt; &lt;digit&gt; &lt;digit&gt;
  &lt;Street Name&gt; ::= &lt;Name&gt; &lt;Street Type&gt;
  &lt;Flat Number&gt; ::= &lt;character&gt; | &lt;digit&gt;
  &lt;House Number&gt; ::= &lt;number&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; &lt;number&gt;
  &lt;number&gt;::= &lt;digit&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; &lt;number&gt;
  &lt;Street Type&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt;
  &lt;City Prefix&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt;
  &lt;Street Code&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt;
  &lt;Town Name&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt;
  &lt;City Name&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt;
  &lt;Country&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a book about A-Level Graphic Products. It aims to fit in with the [http://www.edexcel.com/migrationdocuments/GCE%20New%20GCE/UA035224_GCE_Lin_DTProDes_Issue_3.pdf Edexcel GCE A-Level Product Design] syllabus but is not endorsed by Edexcel. It should be useful as a revision guide or to find alternative explanations to the ones in your textbook. If you haven't heard of an A-Level then this book probably won't be of much interest to you but you can find out about them at [[w:A-Level|Wikipedia]].

If any part of this book ''is'' unclear or even wrong then please post a comment on the discussion page or simply fix it yourself! In particular, please say if the book assumes any knowledge or skills which not all A-Level Product Design students have.

Finite State Machines in unit 3 are exactly alike as you have learnt from unit 1. They are just slightly more complex with a few more states. To recap your memory, visit the unit 1 page [[A-level Computing/AQA/Problem Solving, Programming, Data Representation and Practical Exercise/Problem Solving/Finite state machines|here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cardiovascular Structure and Function==
As all the cell in the human body could not exchange with nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and the waste products of metabolism, energy and momentum, the high way network in the physiological system transport the mass between the cell in order to hold all the body. This high way network, called cardiovascular system, includes a pumping station, the heart; a working fluid, blood; a complex branching configuration of distributing and collecting pipes and channels, blood vessels; and a complicated means for intrinsic (inherent) and extrinsic (autonomic and endocrine) control.
===The blood===
[[File:Blausen 0425 Formed Elements.png|250px|thumbnail|left|Blood cell]]

The blood supplies oxygen and nutrients including constitutional elements to tissues and remove waste products. Blood also transport hormones and other substances to tissues and organs. 

Blood consists of plasma(55% of blood volume) and blood cell or hematocytes (approximately, %8±1 of body weight). Hematocytes are suspended in continus plasma fluid and could divided into red blood cells (erythrocytes, totalling nearly 95% of the formed elements), white blood cells(leukocytes, averaging &lt;0.15% of all hematocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes, on the order of 5% of all blood cells). Hematocytes are derived in the active (“red”) bone marrow from undifferentiated stem cells (called hemocytoblasts) and matured through hematocytopoiesis.

===The Heart===
The human heart occupies about 0.47% of the body weight and it rests on the diaphragm, between the lower part of the two lungs. This small important organ protected by the third and sixth ribs in the central portion of the thoracic cavity of the body. The heart is divided by a tough muscular wall- the interatrial-interventricular septum.The left side of the heart drives oxygen-rich blood through the aortic semilunar outlet valve into the systemic circulation, which carries the fluid to the whole body. The right side of the heart drives this oxygen-poor blood through the pulmonary semilunar (pulmonic) outlet valve into the pulmonary circulation, which carries the fluid to the lungs. Through breathing, the oxygen is supplied and the carbon dioxide is purged.After that, the blood goes to the heart and the cycles begin all over again.

===The blood vessel===
[[File:Blood vessels.svg|400px|thumb|Blood vessels]]

Blood vessels are the ‘road’ of the blood that is distributed inside the body through human circulatory system. Through these vessels, the blood is sent to the whole body and help optimizing the organ’s function. There are three main types of blood vessels: the arteries, which transport the blood away from the heart; the capillaries, which can the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart.

The arteries and veins have three layers
* '''''Tunica intima'' (the innermost and thinnest layer)''': It is made up of single layer of simple squamous endothelial cells and is supported by an internal elastic lamina.
* '''''Tunica media'' (the thickest layer in arteries)'''made up of smooth muscle cells and elastic tissue. The tunica media may (especially in arteries) be rich in vascular smooth muscle, which controls the level of the vessel.
* '''''Tunica adventitia''(the thickest layer in veins)''' entirely made of connective tissue. It contains nerves that supply the vessel as well as nutrient capillaries.

==Endocrine System==
'See also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system Wikipedia,endocrine system] and [[Human Physiology/The endocrine system]]
[[Image:Illu endocrine system.png|right|thumb|227px|Major endocrine glands. (Male left, female on the right.) '''1.''' Pineal gland '''2.''' Pituitary gland '''3.''' Thyroid gland '''4.''' Thymus '''5.''' Adrenal gland '''6.''' Pancreas '''7.''' Ovary '''8.''' Testis]]

The endocrine system means the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones(in other words, produce messengers like small molecules) directly into the circulatory system to be carried toward a distant target organ. In order to grow, maintain a constant temperature, produce offspring, or perform the basic actions and functions, essentially, hormones like small chemicals(in other words, messengers) should  enter the blood stream. So, the endocrine system could provides an electrochemical connection from the hypothalamus of the brain to all the organs for controling the body metabolism, growth and development, and reproduction.

The endocrinology is a relatively long history. But In the late 1960s as sensitive and relatively specific analytical methods introduced,the measurement of low concentrations of circulating hormones is easier and cheaper. Since then, it is easier to understand endocrine physiology and mechanisms of regulation and control. Competitive protein binding and radioimmunoassays brought progress of the study about the physiology of individual endocrine glands and of the neural control of the pituitary gland and the overall feedback control of the endocrine system. Cellular and molecular biology and recombinant DNA technology helped the endocrine system research, too.

At the same time, the interactive researches between mathematical modeling and experimental studies make it possible to understand endocrine dynamics.

===Hormones and signal, interaction between the tissue and the cell===
[[File:1802 Examples of Amine Peptide Protein and Steroid Hormone Structure.jpg|300 px|thumb|1802 Examples of Amine Peptide Protein and Steroid Hormone Structure]]
Hormones can be classified into four groups according to the molecular structure and characteristics: (1) steroid hormones, (2) peptide and protein hormones, (3) amino acids derivatives, principally the aromatic amino acid tyrosine, and (4) the eicosanoids (fatty acid derivatives).

1. Steroids are lipids, more specifically, derivatives of cholesterol produced by chemical modification.

2. Peptide and protein hormones are synthesized in the cellular endoplasmic reticulum and then transferred to the Golgi apparatus where they are packaged into secretory vesicles for export.

3. Amino acid derivatives: There are two groups of hormones derived from the amino acid tyrosine;thyroid hormones and catecholamines.
Thyroid hormones are basically a “double” tyrosine ring incorporating three or four iodine atoms. Catecholamines include epinephrine and norepinephrine that have the capability of functioning as both hormones and neurotransmitters.

4.Eicosanoids are large groups of polyunsaturated fatty acids derivatives like the prostaglandins, prostacyclins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes.

The nervous system can be defined as the network of nerve cells and fibers that sends messages for controlling movement and feeling between the brain and the other parts of the body. This nervous system is divided into two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). 
The three basic functions of the nervous system:

# '''Motor output''': Respond via muscle or glandular action
# '''Sensory input''': Receive sensations from inside and outside the body
# '''Integration''': Process and interpret sensations and make decisions

====The Central Nervous System====
The '''CNS''' consists of the brain and spinal cord. It is integrative and control centers. 
====The Peripheral Nervous System====
The '''peripheral nervous system'''  is the part of the nervous system that is composed of the nerves and ganglia outside of the brain and spinal cord. The main function of the PNS is to make communication lines between CNS and the rest of body. The peripheral nervous system is divided into '''sensory (afferent) division''' and '''motor (efferent) division'''. The main function of '''the sensory (afferent) division''' is to conduct impulses from receptors to the CNS. The sensory division consist of somatic (skin, muscle, joints) and visceral (organs) sensory neurons. The '''motor (efferent) division''' is composed of motor neurons. It conducts impulses from the CNS to effectors (muscles and gland). The motor division could be divided into the somatic nervous system and '''the autonomic nervous system(ANS)''' whether it is voluntary or not. The somatic nervous system provide voluntary control and conducts impulses from CNS to skeletal muscles. The autonomic nervous systems are involuntary but they can often work in conjunction with the somatic nervous system as ,within both systems, there are inhibitory and excitatory synapses between neurons. The main function of ANS is to conduct impulses from CNS to cardiac muscles, smooth muscles, and glands. The ANS is divided into three main sub-systems: the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS), sympathetic nervous system (SNS),&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorlands&quot;&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/000950637|autonomic nervous system}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;urleMedicine/Stedman Medical Dictionary Lookup!&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/asp/dictionary.asp?keyword=autonomic+division+of+nervous+system |title=eMedicine/Stedman Medical Dictionary Lookup! |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-11-30}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the enteric nervous system (ENS)&lt;ref name=&quot;MacArthur&quot;&gt;[http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/research/allostatic/parasym.php Allostatic load notebook: Parasympathetic Function] - 1999, MacArthur research network, UCSF&lt;/ref&gt;. Depending on the circumstances, these sub-systems may work independently or co-operatively. ENS is composed of a mesh-like system of neurons that controls the function of the gastrointestinal system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Furness2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John Barton Furness|title=The Enteric Nervous System|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pvkpdNHhI6cC|accessdate=16 January 2013|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-7344-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''parasympathetic system''' is responsible for stimulation of &quot;rest-and-digest&quot; or &quot;feed and breed&quot;. The '''sympathetic nervous system''' is related to stimulate activities associated with the fight-or-flight response(also called the fight, flight, freeze, or fawn response [in PTSD], hyperarousal, or the acute stress response).
{{clear}}

===Nervous Tissue===
The '''nervous tissue''' is the main component of the central nervous system and the branching peripheral nerves of the peripheral nervous system. It is densely packed and intertwined and composed of neurons and neuroglial(supporting) cells. 
====Neuroglial cells====
[[File:Blausen 0870 TypesofNeuroglia.png|left|350 px|thumb|Types of Neuroglia]] 
'''Neuroglia cells'''(also called glial cells) are non-neuronal cells that maintain homeostasis, form myelin, and support and protect neurons in the brain and peripheral nervous system&lt;ref&gt;Jessen, Kristjan R. &amp; Mirsky, Rhona Glial cells in the enteric nervous system contain glial fibrillary acidic protein Nature 286, 736–737 (14 August 1980); {{doi|10.1038/286736a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In PNS, neuroglial cells consist of '''Schwann cells''','''satellite cells''' and '''enteric glial cells'''. The '''Schwann cells''' form myelin sheath around large nerve fibers in PNS and is also have phagocytotic activity and clear cellular debris that allows for regrowth of PNS neurons&lt;ref&gt;Jessen, K. R. &amp; Mirsky, R. (2005), &quot;The origin and development of glial cells in peripheral nerves&quot;, Nature Reviews Neuroscience 6 (9): 671–682&lt;/ref&gt;. The '''Satellite cells''' are small cells that surround neurons in sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic ganglia&lt;ref&gt;Hanani, M. Satellite glial cells in sensory ganglia: from form to function. Brain Res. Rev. 48:457–476, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;. It may aid in controlling chemical environment of neurons. The '''enteric glial cells''' could be found in the intrinsic ganglia of the digestive system. They may have many roles in the enteric system, some related to homeostasis and muscular digestive processes.&lt;ref&gt;Bassotti, G. et al, Laboratory Investigation (2007) 87, 628–632&lt;/ref&gt; 

In CNS, there are Astrocytes, Microglia, Ependymal Cells and '''Oligodendrocytes''' as supporting cells. '''Astrocytes''' occupy half of neural volume and project with bulbous ends that cling to neurons and capillaries (therefore connecting neurons to blood/nutrient supply). It controls chemical environment around neurons (buffer K+ in extracellular space and/or recapture neurotransmitters released). '''Microglia'''  are the resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord and act as the first and main form of active immune defense in the CNS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lawson L J, Perry V H, Gordon S | year = 1992 | title = Turnover of resident microglia in the normal adult mouse brain | url = | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 405–415 | doi=10.1016/0306-4522(92)90500-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Gehrmann 1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gehrmann J, Matsumoto Y, Kreutzberg GW | title = Microglia: intrinsic immuneffector cell of the brain | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 20 | pages = 269–287 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7550361 | doi = 10.1016/0165-0173(94)00015-H | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Oligodendrocytes''' provide support and insulation to axons in the central nervous system of some vertebrates, equivalent to the function of Schwann cells in the '''PNS'''. Oligodendrocytes do this by creating the myelin sheath, which is 80% lipid and 20% protein&lt;ref name=&quot;CarlsonPhysiology&quot;&gt;Carlson, Physiology of Behavior, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.
'''Ependymal cells''' is the thin epithelium-like lining the spinal cord and the ventricular system of the brain. They creates a barrier between CNS cavities and tissues surrounding cavities. Their cilia circulates the cerebrospinal fluid and protect the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9989494 | volume=96 | issue=1 | title=Identification of a neural stem cell in the adult mammalian central nervous system |date=January 1999 | journal=Cell | pages=25–34 | author=Johansson CB, Momma S, Clarke DL, Risling M, Lendahl U, Frisén J | doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80956-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neurons====
[[File:Complete neuron cell diagram en.svg|thumb|left|550px|Complete neuron cell diagram]]The '''neurons''' is an electrically excitable cell that send messages through electrochemical processes.The human brain has approximately 100 billion neurons. These neurons are amitotic and have a high metabolic rate. Neurons are structurally composed of '''cell body(soma)''' and '''one or more process'''. 
*The soma is the body of the neuron. As it contains the nucleus,  most protein synthesis occurs here. The nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;Most neuron cell bodies located within CNS.Clusters of cell bodies in CNS are called '''nuclei'''. Few/clusters of cell bodies in PNS are called '''ganglia'''
*Processes are called either '''tracts (in CNS)''' or '''nerves (in PNS)'''. Neurons have specialize cell parts called '''dendrites''' and '''axons.'''
**Dendrites  are cellular extensions with many branches. Dendrites receive chemical signals as well as conduct electrical signals (graded potentials).
**Axons transmit graded potential away from cell body to axonal terminal. Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may keep extensive branching, helping communication with many target cells. The part of the axon from the soma is called the axon hillock. The axon hillock is the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon: in electrophysiological terms it has the most negative action potential threshold.
*Some neurons can be repaired through the processes of fragmentation, proliferation. elongation.
*Electrochemical signals transmitted with the help of myelin sheath (protein-lipoid) which insulates nerve fibers (long axons) and enhance the transmission. Nodes of Ranvier also help the transmission of nerve impulses. Myelinated processes form the '''white matter''' of nervous tissue and unmyelinated processes form the '''gray matter''' of nervous tissue.
*The axon terminal includes synapses where neurotransmitter chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons. 
*Fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Classification of Neurons====

=====Structural Classification=====
*'''Anaxonic''':Axons can be indistinguishable from dendrite. They can be found in brain. Their functions are poorly understood.
*'''Multipolar neurons''':They possesses a single (usually long) axon and many dendrite. Three or more processes (usually with a single axons) are needed. They are common type, major neurons in CNS. 
**Golgi I: neurons with a long axon that begins in the grey matter of CNS and may extend from there&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| year = 2008
| url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Golgi+type+I+neuron
| accessdate = 2008-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Examples are pyramidal cells, Purkinje cells, and anterior horn cells.
**Golgi II:Neurons have either no axon or else a short axon that does not send branches out of the gray matter of CNS. The best example is the granule cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*'''Bipolar neurons''' :Axon and single dendrite on opposite ends of the soma.They are rare in adult but may be found in retina and olfactory mucosa.
*'''Unipolar neurons''' or '''pseudounipolar''':Only one protoplasmic process (neurite) extends from the cell body and forms CNS and PNS. Most neurons are multipolar. But,many types of primary sensory neurons are pseudounipolar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Functional Classification===== 
*'''Sensory (afferent) neurons''':They carry nerve impulses from receptors or sense organs toward CNS. 
*'''Motor (efferent) neurons''': receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to cause muscle contractions and affect glandular outputs/
*'''Association neurons (interneurons)''':Neurons that forms a connection between other neurons.

====Nerve Fibre and Connective Tissue====

A nerve contains two types of tissue: nerve fiber and connective tissue. Nerve fibre is the organ that make up peripheral connective tissue(PNS). It consists of an axon or long dendrite, myelin sheath (if existent) and their Schwann cells. They serve as an information pipelines that let the brain and the spinal cord communicate with the other tissues and organs.

==Vision System==
'See also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system, Wikipedia,Visual System]

The visual system is composed of three things: the central nervous system, eyes and light.  It detects and interprets the information about the visual objects from visible light and guide body movements in relation to visual objects.

[[File:Eyesection.svg|300 px|thumb|left|Eyesection]]
===Eye===
The light reflects off the visual image and comes back to your eye. Light then enters through the outer part of the eye, called the cornea. The cornea is clear like a window. The cornea helps the eye to focus. “To focus” means to make things look sharp and clear as the film and the electronic sensor in the camera does. After then, the light rays go through an opening called the pupil which is the dark round circle in the middle of the colored part of your eye . The colored part is called the iris. When the light is bright, the iris loses the pupil until the right amount of light gets in. When the light is dim, the iris is reverse to let in more light. The function of iris in eyes is the same to the iris in camera. The eye has a lens to focus the rays of light. The lens of the eye is behind the iris. Light passes through the lens on its way to the back of the eye.

===Retina===
[[File:1414 Rods and Cones.jpg|300 px|thumb|left| Functional parts of the opsins in photosensitive cells of the retina]]
In the back of eyes, lining the inside of the eye is the retina.The retina includes 130 million tiny  photoreceptor cells which contain particular protein molecules called opsins. An opsin absorbs a photon (a particle of light) and transmits a signal to the cell through a signal transduction pathway. In human opsin, two types of opsins participate in conscious vision: rod opsins and cone opsins.
Rod opsins (rhodopsins, usually denoted Rh),employed in night vision, are thermally stable, and are found in the rod photoreceptor cells. Cone opsins, used in color vision, are less-stable opsins in the cone photoreceptor cells. Cone opsins could be subdivided according to their absorption maxima (λmax), the wavelength at which the highest light absorption is observed. So, humans have four opsins as follows&lt;ref&gt;Mathpages http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath579/kmath579.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;opsin1&quot;&gt;[http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3/theory_of_color.html University of California excerpts from &quot;Theory of Color&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;:

**'''Long Wavelength Sensitive (OPN1LW) Opsin'''  &amp;ndash; ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

** '''Short Wavelength Sensitive (OPN1SW) Opsin''' &amp;ndash; ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum

In the retina, the photo-receptors synapse directly onto bipolar cells, which in turn synapse onto ganglion cells of the outermost layer, which will then conduct action potentials to the brain. 
Based on their projections and functions, there are five different populations of ganglion cells that send visual (image-forming and non-image-forming) information to the brain:
# '''Midget cells with small recepter field(Parvocellular, or P pathway; P cells)''':About 80% of all retinal ganglion cells are midget cells in the parvocellular pathway. They receive inputs from relatively few rods and cones. In many cases, they are connected to midget bipolars, which are linked to one cone each.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;eye, human.&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. &lt;/ref&gt; They have slow conduction velocity.They can respond to the changes in color but less sensitive to contrast&lt;ref name=&quot;kandel&quot;&gt;Principles of Neural Science 4th Ed. Kandel et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Parasol cell (Magnocellular, or M pathway; M cells)''':About 10% of all retinal ganglion cells are parasol cells, and these cells are part of the magnocellular pathway. They receive inputs from relatively many rods and cones. They have fast conduction velocity, and can respond to low-contrast stimuli, but are not very sensitive to changes in color &lt;ref name=&quot;kandel&quot; /&gt;
# '''K cells,''' with very large center-only receptive fields that are sensitive to color and indifferent to shape or depth;
# '''Photosensitive ganglion cells'''
# '''Other ganglion cells projecting to the superior colliculus for eye movements''' (saccades)&lt;ref name=&quot;kandel&quot; /&gt;

==Auditory System==
===The Peripheral Auditory System===
[[File:NIDCD-Fact-Sheet-Otosclerosis-111413-Ear.jpg|300px|thumb|Auditory System]]
====Outer ear====
The sounds are collected by the pinna, the visible part of the external ear and guided to the middle ear by the external auditory canal, a deceptively simple tube. The ear canal amplifies sounds between 3 and 12 kHz. At the far end of the ear canal is the tympanic membrane, which marks the beginning of the middle ear.
====Middle ear====
The middle ear is composed of the ear drum (tympanic membrane), attached to the inner ear through a delicate bone structure (malleus, incus and stapes). The middle ear bones (ossicles) and the muscles which keeps them in place are the smallest in the human body. One of the main functions of the middle ear is to transfer the sound from the air to the fluids in the inner ear efficiently. If the sound were to have an impact directly on the inner ear, most of it would simply be reflected back because acoustical impedance of the air is different from that of the fluids. 

The middle ear behaves as an impedance-matching device that improves sound transmission, reduces the amount of reflect sound and protects the inner ear from excessive sound pressure. This protection is controlled by the brain through the middle ear’s muscles to tense and untense the bone structure with a reaction speed as fast as 10 milliseconds. The middle ear’s connection to the inner ear is the smallest bone in the human body: the stapes (or stirrup bone). It is about 3 mm long and weighs about 3 mg.

====Inner ear====
The inner ear consists of the cochlea and the auditory nerve for hearing and vestibular system for balance. The cochlea, snail-shaped, bony structure, converts sound pressure patterns from the outer ear into electrochemical impulses which are passed on to the brain via the auditory nerve. The vestibular system consists of a series of fluid-filled compartments (three semi-circular canals and two larger divisions) that contain the sense organs for balance and movement. The vestibular sensors detect angular movements, direction and velocity of the head. This information about equilibrium is sent to the brain by the vestibular nerves.

===The Central Auditory System===
[[File:Aud pathway.png|300px|right|thumb|Auditory pathway]]
The encoded sound information enter the vestibulocochlear nerve, through intermediate stations such as the cochlear nuclei and superior olivary complex of the brainstem and the inferior colliculus of the midbrain and it is further processed at each waypoint. Finally, the information reaches the thalamus, and from there it is relayed to the cortex. In the human brain, the primary auditory cortex is placed in the temporal lobe.

==Gastrointestinal System==
[[File:Gastrointestinal system.gif|450 px|left|thumb|Gastrointestinal system and the functions]]
The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is composed of a hollow muscular tube from the oral cavity, where food enters the mouth, continuing through the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and intestines to the rectum and anus, where food is expelled. There are a variety of accessory organs that help the tract by secreting enzymes to enhance breaking down food into its component nutrients. Thus the salivary glands, liver, pancreas and gall bladder have  functions in the digestive system. Food is propelled along the length of the GIT by peristaltic movements of the muscular walls.

Mastication indicates the mechanical breakdown of food by chewing and chopping actions of the teeth. The tongue, a strong muscular organ, let the food bolus to come in contact with the teeth. It is also the sensing organ of the mouth for touch, temperature and taste using its specialised sensors known as papillae.

Human saliva is 99.5% water, while the other 0.5% consists of electrolytes, mucus, glycoproteins, enzymes, and antiseptic compounds such as secretory IgA and lysozyme.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080318102122/http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section6/6ch4/s6ch4_6.htm  Physiology at Medical College of George Section 6 Chapter4 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oral cavity plays a limited role in the digestion of carbohydrates. The enzyme serum amylase, a component of saliva, starts the process of digestion of complex carbohydrates. The final function of the oral cavity is to absorb small molecules such as glucose and water, across the mucosa. From the mouth, food passes through the pharynx and oesophagus via the action of swallowing.

===Salivary glands===
[[File:Blausen 0780 SalivaryGlands.png|thumb|Salivary Glands]]
Three pairs of salivary glands work with the oral cavity. Each is a complex gland with a lot of acini lined by secretory epithelium. The acini secrete their contents into specialized ducts. Each gland is divided into smaller lobes. Salivation occurs because of the taste, smell or even watching food. This occurs in response to nerve signals that indicate the salivary glands to secrete saliva to prepare and moisten the mouth. Each pair of salivary glands secretes saliva with slightly different compositions. They also secrete amylase, an enzyme that degrades starch into maltose.
====Parotids====
The '''parotid gland''' is a major salivary gland in humans. The '''parotid''' glands are largest(in saliva gland), bilateral and irregular shaped glands located  inferior and anterior to the external acoustic meatus draining their secretions into the vestibule of oral cavity through Stensen duct or parotid duct&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Human Anatomy, Jacobs, Elsevier, 2008, page 193&lt;/ref&gt;. They provides 25% of the total salivary volume. They are situated below the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) and cover part of the mandible (lower jaw bone). An enlarged parotid gland can be easier felt when one clenches their teeth. The parotids secretes salivary alpha-amylase (sAA). Immunoglobins are secreted help to fight microorganisms and a-amylase proteins start to break down complex carbohydrates&lt;ref&gt;Arhakis A, et al, Salivary Alpha-Amylase Activity and Salivary Flow Rate in Young Adults, ''The Open Dentistry Journal'', 2013, 7, 7-15 at http://benthamscience.com/open/todentj/articles/V007/7TODENTJ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
====Submandibular ====
The paired '''submandibular glands''' or submaxillary glands are major salivary glands located beneath the lower jaws, superior to the digastric muscles&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;. They secrete around 60–67% of the total volume of saliva although they are much smaller than the parotid glands. These glands produce a more viscostic(thick) secretion, rich in mucin and with a little bit protein. Mucin is a glycoprotein which act as the lubrication of the food bolus as it travels through the esophagus. &lt;ref&gt;Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 137&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Sublingual ==== 
The sublinguals are the smallest salivary glands, covered by a thin layer of tissue at the floor of the mouth&lt;ref name=IAotHaH&gt;Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;. They produce only about 5% of the saliva volume. Their secretions produced are very sticky due to the large amount of mucin. They aid in buffering and lubrication.

===Upper gastrointestinal tract===
The upper gastrointestinal tract is composed of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2011/MB_cgi?mode=&amp;term=Upper+Gastrointestinal+Tract Upper Gastrointestinal Tract] at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)&lt;/ref&gt;
====Esophagus====
It is known as the '''foodpipe''' or '''gullet'''. The Esophagus is a fibromuscular tube of about 25cm in length and 2cm in diameter&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010&gt;{{cite book|first=the editors Nicki R. Colledge, Brian R. Walker, Stuart H.

It extends generally from around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra (C6) behind the cricoid cartilage, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra (T10), and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra (T11)&lt;ref name=GRAYS2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake|first=Richard L.|title=Gray's anatomy for students|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8089-2306-0|author2=Vogl, Wayne; Tibbitts, Adam W.M. Mitchell ; illustrations by Richard; Richardson, Paul|pages=192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The wall of the oesophagus from the lumen outwards is made up of mucosa, sub-mucosa (connective tissue), layers of muscle fibers between layers of fibrous tissue, and an outer layer of connective tissue.This muscle are supplied by the oesophageal nerve plexus. This nerve plexus surrounds the lower portion of the oesophagus. The oesophagus functions primarily as a transport medium between compartments.The esophagus has a rich blood supply and vascular drainage. It is clinically investigated through X-rays using barium, endoscopy, and CT scans.

====Stomach====
[[Image:Regions of stomach.svg|thumb|left|300px|Sections of the stomach]] The '''stomach''' is a J shaped expanded bag, located just left of the midline between the oesophagus and the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). It secretes protein-digesting enzymes called proteases and strong acids to help food digestion through segmentation before sending partially digested food (chyme) to the small intestines. 

It is divided into four main regions and has two borders called the greater and lesser curvatures. 
*The first section is the '''cardia''' which surrounds the cardial orifice where the oesophagus enters the stomach,the point at which the epithelium changes from stratified squamous epithelia to columnar. 
*The '''fundus''' is formed by the upper curvature of the organ and the superior, dilated portion of the stomach that has contact with the left dome of the diaphragm.
*The '''body''' is the largest center section between the fundus and the curved portion of the J. This is where most gastric glands are located and most mixing of the food occurs. 
*The '''pylorus''' is the curved base of the stomach. Gastric contents are expelled into the proximal duodenum via the pyloric sphincter. The inner surface of the stomach is contracted into numerous longitudinal folds called rugae. These allow the stomach to stretch and expand when food enters. In adult humans, the stomach has a relaxed, near empty volume of about 45 to 75 milliliters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7274820.stm  BBC news article]&lt;/ref&gt; When it expands, it normally does to hold about one litre of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sherwood, Lauralee |title=Human physiology: from cells to systems |publisher=Wadsworth Pub.

The functions of the stomach is as follows:
* The short-term storage of ingested food.
* Breakdown of food by churning and mixing.
* Chemical digestion of proteins by acids and enzymes.
* Stomach acid kills bugs and germs.
* Some absorption of food such as alcohol.

====Liver====
[[Image:Anatomy of liver and gall bladder.png|thumb|350px|The biliary tree]]

The liver is a large, reddish-brown organ located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. It is covered by a strong capsule and divided into four lobes namely the right, left, caudate and quadrate lobes.The liver function is various by the liver cells or hepatocytes.  Currently, there is no artificial organ or device conducting all the functions of the liver. Some functions can be carried out by liver dialysis, an experimental treatment for liver failure. 

But,the liver is the only human internal organ could naturally regenerate from lost tissue; as little as 25% of a liver can regenerate into a whole liver.&lt;ref name=regen&gt;{{cite book|title=Liver Regeneration|year=2011|publisher=De Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110250794|page=1|url=http://books.google.co.za/books?id=RJEg-p-9iqsC&amp;pg=PA1|editor=Dieter Häussinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration is very speedy. The liver would return to a normal size within two weeks although the removal is greater than 50% of the liver by mass.This is due to the hepatocytes which go from the quiescent G0 phase to the G1 phase and undergo mitosis. This process is activated by the p75 receptors.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18515089&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Suzuki K, Tanaka M, Watanabe N, Saito S, Nonaka H, Miyajima A |title=p75 Neurotrophin receptor is a marker for precursors of stellate cells and portal fibroblasts in mouse fetal liver |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=270–281.e3 |year=2008 |pmid=18515089 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2008.03.075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The liver is thought to have over 500 separate functions, usually working with other systems and organs.

====Gall bladder====
The '''gallbladder''' is a small organ where bile is stored, before it is released into the small intestine. It is a hollow, pear shaped organ that sits in a depression on the posterior surface of the liver’s right lobe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/where-is-the-gallbladder-located-in-the-body.html |title=Where is the Gallbladder Located in the Body |publisher=Buzzle.com |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.In adults, the gallbladder is 8cm(3.1 in) in length and 4cm(1.6 in) in diameter when fully extended.&lt;ref name=&quot;meilstrup&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Jon W.

Mitchell  |author4=illustrations by Richard |author5= Richardson, Paul |page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; . It empties via the cystic duct into the biliary duct system. The main functions of the gall bladder are storage and concentration of bile produced by liver. Bile is released from the gall bladder by contraction of its muscular walls in response to hormone signals from the duodenum because of food.

The Gallbladder bile is composed of 92% water, 6% bile salts, 0.3% bilirubin, 0.9-2.4% fats (Cholesterol, fatty acids and lecithin), and 200 mEq/L inorganic salts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guyton and Hall|title=Textbook of Medical Physiology|date=2011|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=U.S.|isbn=978-1-4160-4574-8|page=784}} Bile acts to some extent as a surfactant, helping to emulsify the fats in food. Bile salt anions are hydrophilic on one side and hydrophobic on the other side&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pancreas====
The pancreas is a lobular, pinkish-grey organ located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. Its head communicates with the duodenum and its tail extends to the spleen. The organ is about 5.75-9.5&amp;nbsp;cm &lt;ref name=MEDSCAPE&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Ali Nawaz|title=Chronic Pancreatitis Imaging|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/371772-overview|work=Medscape|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in length with a long, slender body connecting the head and tail segments. The pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions. 

Endocrine indicates production of hormones which occurs in about a million cell clusters called islets of Langerhans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hellman B, Gylfe E, Grapengiesser E, Dansk H, Salehi A |title=[Insulin oscillations--clinically important rhythm.

Four main cell types exist in the islets and can be classified by their secretion: α cells secrete glucagon (increase glucose in blood), β  cells secrete insulin (decrease glucose in blood), Δ cells secrete somatostatin (regulates/stops α and β cells) and PP cells, or γ (gamma) cells, secrete pancreatic polypeptide.&lt;ref&gt;BRS physiology 4th edition ,page 255-256, Linda S. Constanzo, Lippincott publishing&lt;/ref&gt;
. The exocrine (secretrory) portion occupies 80-85% of the pancreas.

It is composed of numerous acini (small glands) that secrete fluid into ducts which eventually lead to the duodenum. The fluid contains digestive enzymes that pass to the small intestine. These enzymes enhance breaking down the carbohydrates, proteins and lipids (fats) in the chyme.

===Lower gastrointestinal tract===

====Small Intestine====
The small intestine starts from the duodenum, which receives food from the stomach&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/275485/human-body&lt;/ref&gt;. It averages 5.5~6m in length, extending from the pyloric sphincter of the stomach to the ileo-caecal valve separating the ileum from the caecum. The small intestine is compressed into a lot of folds and occupies a large portion of the abdominal cavity.

# '''Duodenum''': The duodenum is the proximal C-shaped hollow jointed tube(about 25–38 cm long) that curves around the head of the pancreas&lt;ref name=GRAYS2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake|first=Richard L.|title=Gray's anatomy for students|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8089-2306-0|author2=Vogl, Wayne |author3=Tibbitts, Adam W.M. Mitchell  |author4=illustrations by Richard |author5= Richardson, Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; . It receives gastric chyme from the stomach, together with digestive liquids from the pancreas (digestive enzymes) and the gall bladder (bile). The digestive enzymes break down proteins and bile and emulsify fats into micelles.
# '''Jejunum''':The jejunum is  about 2.5 m long and located between the distal end of duodenum and the proximal part of ileum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Gijn J |title=Treitz and his ligament. |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. |volume=155 |issue=8 |year=2011 |pmid=21557825 |author-separator=, |author2=Gijselhart JP |display-authors=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;The Gale Group, Inc. (2008). Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt;. It contains the plicae circulares (also called circular folds or valves of Kerckring), and villi that increase the surface area of the GI Tract. Products of digestion (sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids) are absorbed into the bloodstream. It is in the jejunum where the majority of digestion and absorption occurs.  
# '''Ileum''':The ileum is the longest segment and contains villi similar to the jejunum. Its function is to absorb vitamin B12 and bile salts.For fat-soluble vitamin(Vitamin A, D, E and K) absorption, bile acids are necessary.

====Large Intestine====
The large intestine is horse-shoe shaped and extends around the small intestine like a frame. Its function is to absorb body water from the matter, and then to pass useless waste material from the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCILargeIntestineDef&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=45097 | title=large intestine | publisher=National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health | work=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms | accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is subdivided into the appendix, caecum, ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon, and the rectum.

===Layers of Gastrointestinal Tract(GI)===
[[File:2402 Layers of the Gastrointestinal Tract.jpg|thumb|450px|Layers of the Gastrointestinal Tract]]
The gastrointestinal tract is a muscular tube lined by epithelium, a special layer of cells. The contents of the tube are considered external to the body and are continuous with the outside at the mouth and the anus. The GI tract can be divided into four concentric layers as follows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Abraham L. Kierszenbaum | title = Histology and cell biology: an introduction to pathology | publisher = Mosby | location = St. Louis | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-323-01639-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; : 
* Mucosa
* Submucosa
* ''Muscularis externa'' (the external muscular layer)
* Adventitia or serosa
====Mucosa====
The innermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract is surrounding the lumen, or open space within the tube. This layer contacts with digested food (chyme). The mucosa cosists of:
*'''Epithelium''': It is supported by an underlying connective tissue layer called the lamina propria. Areas like the mouth and oesophagus are covered by a stratified squamous (flat) epithelium so they can survive the wear and tear of passing food. Simple columnar (tall) or glandular epithelium lines the stomach and intestines to help secretion and absorption. 
*'''Lamina propria''': A layer of connective tissue. It contains blood vessels, nerves, lymphoid tissue and glands that support the mucosa. 
*'''Muscularis mucosae''': Beneath the lamina propria is a thin layer of smooth muscle called the muscularis mucosa which helps passing material and aids the interaction between the epithelial layer and the contents of the lumen by agitation and peristalsis.

====Submucosa====
The '''submucosa''' surrounds the muscularis mucosa and consists of fat,dense, irregular fibrous connective tissue and larger vessels , lymphatics, and nerves branching into the mucosa. At its outer margin there is a specialized nerve plexus(enteric nervous plexus) called the '''submucosal plexus''' or '''Meissner plexus'''. This supplies the '''mucosa''' and '''submucosa'''.

====Muscularis externa====
This smooth muscle layer consists of inner circular and outer longitudinal layers of muscle fibres separated by the myenteric plexus or Auerbach plexus. Neural innervations control the contraction of these muscles. The coordinated contractions of these layers is called peristalsis and moves the food down through the tract. From the mouth down to the stomach, Food is called a bolus(ball of food). After the stomach,the food is partially digested and semi-liquid, and is called as chyme. In the large intestine the remaining semi-solid substance is referred to as faeces.

====Adventitia or serosa====
'''Adventitia''' is the outermost connective tissue covering of an organ, vessel, or other structure&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=13489 eMedicineDictionary], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also called the tunica adventitia or the tunica externa.
In GI tract, the muscularis externa is covered mostly by serosa. But, at the oral cavity, thoracic esophagus, ascending colon, descending colon and the rectum, the muscularis externa is bounded by adventitia. (The muscularis externa of the duodenum is covered by both tissue types.) Generally, if it belong to the digestive tract that is free to move, it is bounded by serosa, but if it is relatively rigidly fixed, it is covered by adventitia.

==Respiratory System==
[[File:Respiratory system complete en.svg|450 px|thumb|left|A complete view of human respiratory system with their parts and functions]]
The Respiratory System is indispensable to every human. Through the respiratory system, oxygen enters our bodies and carbon dioxide leaves our bodies. The respiratory system is composed of the air pathways,the lungs, alveoli, pulmonary vasculature, respiratory muscles, and surrounding tissues and structures.
===Respiratory System===
# '''Lungs''':There are two lungs in the human chest; the right lung is made up of three incomplete divisions called lobes, and the left lung has two, the space for the heart.
# '''Conducting Air pathway''': Before gas exchange and respiration, Air should be moved, filtered, warmed and humidified.
# '''Alveoli''':The gas change occurs.For efficiency, the alveolar walls is very thin.
# '''Pulmonary circulation''': the part of the cardiovascular system which carries oxygen-poor blood away from the heart, to the lungs, and returns oxygen-rich blood back to the heart.
# '''Respiratory muscles''': the various muscles of respiration participate in both inspiration and expiration. The main muscles are the diaphragm, the external intercostal and the interchondral part of the internal intercostal muscles. Both the external intercostal muscles and the intercondral elevate the ribs, so increasing the width of the thoracic cavity, while the diaphragm contracts to increase the vertical dimensions of the thoracic cavity, and also helps in the elevation of the lower ribs. Accessory muscles are usually used when the body needs to process energy quickly.

It is important to both understand the mechanisms that cause swarming, and the differences between swarm prevention and control.

== Swarming ==

Swarming is a natural reproductive urge, which causes an increase in the number of colonies.  While beekeepers try to minimise the swarming instinct, it can never be completely removed, as this would lead to a demise of colonies outside of a managed environment.

Swarms generally leave the colony the day after queen cells are capped, which happens around 8-9 days.  This means that, during swarm season, beekeepers must inspect colonies every 8-9 days to avoid losing swarms.

There are a variety of factors involved in causing swarming, including:

* Colony numbers (both brood and adult bees)
* Queen Age
* Presence of Drones
* Time of year
* Available space in the hive - both for brood, stores and adult bee movement.

However, the prime factor is the level of queen pheromone being received by adult worker bees during trophallaxis and interaction with the queen and other workers in the colony.  A drop in the level of pheromone causes swarming tendencies - this being triggered by many of the factors listed above (e.g. an old queen produces less pheromone, a high level of workers 'dilutes' the available pheromone across the hive, etc).

== Swarm Prevention ==

Swarm prevention involves taking steps to reduce or remove the swarming instinct.  Some methods of swarm prevention are as follows:

=== Increase colony space ===

Adding more brood boxes or supers to a hive allows freer movement of bees, and increases the available space for laying brood, storing honey, and eases adult bee movement in the hive.

It is common for beekeepers to refer to the &quot;Rule of 7's&quot; when inspecting a hive - that is if there are 7 or more frames covered in bees, or filled with brood or stores, it is time to add more boxes as appropriate.

A variant of this technique is to swap around frames or boxes in a hive.  For example, if in a double brood box, the top box is congested while the bottom box is empty, they can be swapped around - or some full frames can be exchanged with empty frames between boxes.

=== Removal of Queen Cells ===

In some circumstances, the removal of 'dry' (no brood present) queen cells or very young queen cells can delay the urge to swarm.  However, this operation should not be performed more than 2-3 times in a colony, since a colony may eventually swarm anyway, leaving the original hive lacking a replacement queen.  It is also important to inspect all frames very carefully, as a single queen cell is enough to trigger swarming.

=== Queen Clipping ===

Queen clipping involves clipping the tip off one of the queen's wings, making her unable to fly (or at least unable to fly great distances).  This means that should a colony swarm, the queen will be unable to join the swarm, and eventually the swarm will return to the hive.  This allows beekeepers to switch from a 9-day inspection cycle to a 14-day cycle, since action only needs to be taken before the new queen cells hatch (at which point either the queens will fight, or the virgin queen will swarm).

A clipped queen can still be lost, since having left the hive, she may be unable to return to it.  However in many cases the loss of a queen is preferred to the loss of a queen *and* accompanying swarm.

== Swarm Control ==

Swarm control refers to methods which prevent the swarming urge completely - usually by simulating some of the conditions of a swarm.

There are many methods of swarm control available, but they each derive from one of three 'original' swarm control methods.

=== Pagden Method ===

The Pagden method is one of the oldest and most commonly used swarm control methods.

# Roof, supers, etc. are removed from the hive.
# The brood box and floor are moved to a new site within the same apiary.
# A new brood box, containing empty frames is placed on the original site.
# The queen is found in the original hive, and moved to the new brood box.
# Any supers are placed onto the new brood box on the original site.
# Flying bees leave the old brood box, but return to the original site to join the queen.

The end result is as follows:

* The original brood box is now queenless and contains no flying bees, so will not swarm and will go on to develop new queens.
* The new brood box contains empty frames, the queen and flying bees.  This simulates the completion of a swarm, due to the absence of brood.

The main variant of the Pagden Method is the Heddon Method.

==== Heddon Method ====

This variant aims to maintain the number of flying bees in the queen-right hive by 'bleeding' them into the original hive.  This helps to support the honey harvest during a flow. The same procedure is followed as above, but with a minor change.

# The original brood box is placed to the side of the original site, rotated by 90 degrees.
# Flying bees leaving this box will return to the original site.
# After 2-3 days, the box is placed on the other side of the original site, rotated 180 degrees.
# Flying bees will return to the 'wrong' site, and instead find the entrance of the original site.
# Finally, the hive is moved elsewhere in the apiary.
# Again, flying bees will return to the original site.


=== Demaree Method ===

The Demaree method was originally designed to remove the need to split a colony in 2 when swarming, allowing all the bees to continue to work in one hive, improving yields.

Unlike the Pagden method, the Demaree method increases the height of a single hive, rather than adding a second hive to an apiary.  This can be useful in terms of saving on buying new equipment, and in cases of limited space.

The Demaree method is more successful when performed before the first signs of swarming are seen - i.e. before queen cells are being built.  However it will still work provided the queen cells are not too far developed.

# The roof, supers, etc. are removed from the hive.
# A new brood box with empty frames is prepared.
# The queen is located, transferred to the new brood box, which is placed on the original floor.
# A queen excluder is fitted, and 2 (or more) supers are added.
# The original brood box is placed on top and the hive closed up.

Nurse bees will move up to the top box to care for the brood, while flying bees will move to the bottom box to continue foraging.

The absence of a laying queen will cause the top box to slowly empty as brood hatches. Brood will gradually build up in the bottom box.

The absence of queen pheromones in the top box (due to reduced trophallaxis, and lack of footprint pheromone) will cause the bees in the top box to begin to develop queen cells. The beekeeper now has several options:

# Return after 5 days and destroy all queen cells - the lack of fresh larvae will prevent more queen cells being built.
# Allow the queen cells to develop, taking them for use in other colonies.
# Place a solid floor with it's own entrance (rotated 180 degrees) under the top brood box, treating it as a separate colony.

Care must be taken in all cases not to allow queen cells in the top box to hatch, or the presence of a virgin queen may cause the colony to swarm.  However, there are some techniques which can be used to manage a 2-queen colony.  In this case, a top entrance and second queen excluder would be needed under the top brood box to prevent the new queen laying in the supers.

When the bottom box begins to become crowded, the now empty top box can be substituted for the bottom box, repeating the procedure.  It is not usually necessary to repeat this more than twice in a season.

The beekeeper should visit the hive every 5-7 days to remove the roof and release any drones which have emerged in the top box, since they will be unable to leave through the bottom entrance due to the presence of the queen excluder.


=== Snelgrove Method ===

The Snelgrove method is similar to the Demaree method in that it maintains a single 'tower' hive on one location - however it uses a special Snelgrove Board fitted with a series of doors to control the population in each part of the split.

The Snelgrove board is a double-sided crown board with bee-space above and below a central rim.  Pairs of doors are placed on 3 sides of the board, with each pair giving access to the upper and lower parts of the hive.

The Snelgrove is similar to the Demaree, but with one extra step in the initial setup:

# The roof, supers, etc. are removed from the hive.
# A new brood box with empty frames is prepared.
# The queen is located, transferred to the new brood box, which is placed on the original floor.
# A queen excluder is fitted, and 2 (or more) supers are added.
# ''A Snelgrove board is placed on top of the supers, entrances pointing to the sides and rear.''
# The original brood box is placed on top, and the hive closed up.

The following sequence of door manipulation is used to 'bleed' foraging bees from the top box into the bottom box, starting with all doors closed:

# On the day of the split, open the top door on the left side of the hive.  Previously oriented foraging bees will return to the original hive main door.
# 4-5 days later, the top-left door is closed, and the bottom-left and top-right are opened.
# Previously oriented bees leaving the upper box (through the open top-right door) will return to the left side, and enter the bottom box. New foraging bees will orient to the top-right door.
# 4-5 days later the bottom-left and top-right doors are closed, and the bottom-right top-rear doors are opened.
# Previously oriented bees, leaving the upper box (through the open top-rear door) will return to right side, and enter the bottom box.  New foraging bees will orient to the top-rear door.
# A few days later, the bottom-right door is closed.

The hive now consists of 2 colonies - the lower colony (with the original queen) using the front door, and the upper colony (queenless) using the rear door.

The beekeeper can either allow queen cells to develop and emerge in the top box, and treat this as a second hive, or remove any queen cells and the Snelgrove board, and manage the upper box as in the Demaree system (on top of supers), or add it back directly on top of the lower box as a double-brood hive. In these cases, due to the period of separation due to the Snelgrove board, the use of newspaper for merging is advised.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just started a brain-dump of swarm prevention/control information, since I've not found one good site with all the information in one place.

Please add other swarm techniques if you know them - either as 'main' methods, or as variants.  Please also add alternative names for these, as they vary around the world.

It's currently hard to find good images in the public domain for most of these methods, and for the specialist equipment they use, so if anyone can contribute those, please do!

I'll also probably try to draw some of the methods, as textual descriptions can be hard to follow!  That, or photograph them as and when I can.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Email ==
Email is a great way to allow data communications from within a company, or to other companies that might be on the other side of the earth. Email can be used to message, but it's the ability to attach a document to an email which makes it so useful for companies. Companies can attach [[#Computer-aided_design_.28CAD.29|computer-aid design (CAD)]] documents to their emails to allow multiple people to work on a project (providing that recipient has the correct software to open the CAD document).
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
| It's quick and easy to use and communicate with anyone around the world. || In-boxes can be overrun by spam from unwanted emails.
|-
| Anyone that has an internet device can use it. || Email can seem impersonal compared to human interaction or even [[#Video_conferencing|video conferencing]].
|-
| Documents can be attached so that other people can receive them. || Documents that are attached are limited in size.

|}

== Electronic data interchange (EDI) ==
EDI is a way for businesses to exchange information in a paperless way that is formatted to a standard over a computer network, rather than using the postal service. EDI is a fast, inexpensive and secure way for businesses to send data like purchase orders, invoices, design and manufacturing data to other businesses that they're linked with, like their product vendors. EDI can also be used to exchange payment and financial information in an electric form. EDI relies on the businesses that they're communicating and sharing their information to agree upon a standard for the structure of the file information&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVFI3I8LlRI&lt;/ref&gt;.

The data from the first buisness will need to be translated into the standard form that's agreed upon. The data is then sent to the other companies' inbox. At that end, the data is then re-interpreted into a form that can be used&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange#Interpreting_data&lt;/ref&gt;. When the data is obtained from one company, it can be automatically sent through this process. When it's received at the other end, this information can automatically go into that companies' database&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1woSaNSnZc&lt;/ref&gt;.

Advantages:
* Saves companies money as it's more efficient
* No size limit on documents
* Secure method of data transfer
* Data is translated in a common format between comapnies
* More reliable than email
* Limits the amount of human interaction
* Creates a paperless company
* Information handling is greatly reduced.

== Integrated services Digital Networks (ISDN) and Broadband ==
The purpose of ISDN is to provide a fast internet connection which allows for voice, data, text, graphics, music and video to be transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Services_Digital_Network&lt;/ref&gt; ISDN allows for a constant digital data transfer from one end of the connection to the other that uses the traditional telephone line, while the telephone line uses analogue data to send the speech, to do this the data is split up, one part for broadband, the other part for the telephone line. Previously without ISDN that data will need to be converted from analogue to digital many times; ISDN fixes this by keeping it a constant digital signal.&lt;ref&gt;From a Youtube video by user: 00bit11, rough time 1:10 to 2:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYl5rDr88UA&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) ===
ADSL is the most popular type of broadband connection in the UK, it allows you to send data down your existing telephone line.
ADSL gets your telephone line and splits in into two parts, one for the telephone, the other for an internet connection.
[[File:ADSLFilterSplitter gobeirne.jpg|thumb|centre|An example of digital subscriber line (DSL) splitting ]]
* Easy to install
* Downloading data is much faster than sending.&lt;ref&gt;You can clearly see this if you run a simple speed test (providing that you're currently using ADSL). You can do this from a website called http://www.speedtest.net/&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Fibre cable ===
Fibre is a new form of internet access which uses light down fibre-optic cable which means that the data is travelling at the speed of light. This is why this is the fastest possible form of connection to the internet as nothing can go faster than light. However, data transfer speeds could be improved by either using more cables, making less people use your cable, or to make the change from 0 to 1 in the cable faster.
* It's easy to install
* It's the fastest possible option for connection
* It only available in built up areas like towns and cities, but overtime it will spread to more rural areas.

=== Wireless/WiFi® ===
Wireless, or Wifi® is a way of relaying the information given by the transmitter (usually a router) and outputting that signal as a radio wave for other devices to connect to it through the radio waves. This creates a local-area network (LAN). Anyone within a certain range can pick-up the signal; the further away you go, the worse the signal will become until it become non-existent to you when you loose connection altogether.
* Fast connection for downloading and uploading data.
* Requires an expert to set-up the connection and maintain the network.
* Interference can occur around built up areas, or areas with a lot of metal which cause the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage Faraday cage] effect.
* Wifi® isn't restricted to the local internet/telephone exchange.

=== 3G and 4G technology ===
3G internet connections are usually used by phones and sometimes tablets, but they potentially can be used for any device. 3G relies on you linking to the nearest transmitter that you mobile phone carrier is providing, meaning that if you were to switch provider, you might get a better connection is some areas than others. The further that your device gets from the 3G transmitter, the worse your internet connection will be. 4G technology is coming and will soon be replacing 3G, currently it's only available in certain cities.&lt;ref&gt;http://gadgetynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ee-uk-4g-city-coverage.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;
* It's a way for you to get internet on the move.
* If you're in a rural area, then you might not get very good reception.

=== Satellite ===
Satellite connections allow you to get your internet from a satellite in space. At your data goes up to space, and then back down again, this form of connection isn't terribly fast.
* Available anywhere.
* Quite expensive.
* Can be interrupted by bad weather.

Satellite broadband comes in two forms, one-way connections and two-way connections.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access&lt;/ref&gt;
==== One-way Satellite ====
One-way satellite broadband connections are faster than two-way broadband connections however they can only download information, not upload. If you wish to upload data then another form of connection is still needed like dial-up.
* Download only
* Faster than two-way
==== Two-way Satellite ====
Two-way connections allows for both download and upload, however the speed in which is does so is much slower than one-way. As this can do both download and upload, there strictly isn't a need for another form of internet connection, however as satellite connections can suffer from bad interference from weather, another form of connection could be useful.
* Download and upload
* Slower than one-way.

== Video conferencing ==
Increases in broadband speed has enable the ability for two or more people to send video and audio data live to the other people while receiving the other person's video and audio at the same time. This is known as video conferencing. Video conferencing offers companies to a way to communicate in more personal way than text or the telephone; this means that ideas can be communicated in a better way to give a greater understanding of the information that they're telling to one another. This has an added ability compared to a phone to be able to show them the images or progress in the project via the use of the webcam. 

When three or more people are in the video conference, this is known as multipoint video conferencing&lt;ref&gt;multipoint video conferencing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videoconferencing#Multipoint_videoconferencing&lt;/ref&gt;. These three or more points connect using a multipoint control unit (MCU) as a bridge for the connections between each other. This simulates a virtual conference as if they were sitting next to each other.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
| More personal that text or telephone || Connection can sometimes fail
|-
| Visual information like progress on a project can be shown through the webcam || There can be problems with the time zones of each person in the video conference.
|-
| Eliminates the need for travel to other locations that might have otherwise been a long journey; this saves time and money for the company.|| People can be camera shy, especially as the call can be recorded without them knowing.
|-
| Training of staff can be done to many staff at the same time || A lack of eye contact can hide the intent of the call
|-
| Calls can be recorded to allow people to review what was mentioned || 
|-
| Advantages to deaf people as they can use sign language&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videoconferencing#Impact_on_sign_language_communications&lt;/ref&gt; ||

There are two forms of video conferencing, '''dedicated systems''' and '''desktop systems'''&lt;ref&gt;The two types of video conferencing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videoconferencing#Technology&lt;/ref&gt;.
=== Dedicated systems ===
A dedicated system is a video conferencing device where all of the components of the device are packaged into one console.
[[File:TANDBERG E20 (Jimmy Wales).jpg|thumb|centre|An example of a dedicated video conferencing device]]
=== Desktop systems ===
A desktop systems are an adaptation of a normal desktop computer. This involves adding on a microphone and a webcam to the computer; this will 'transform' it into a video conferencing device. Examples of software for desktop systems would be Skype© and Google Hangouts©; although, in an exam you wouldn't get any marks for mentioning brand names.

== Computer-aided design (CAD) ==
{{multiple image
| footer = 2D CAD (Left), 3D CAD (Right)
| image1 = Schneckengetriebe.png
| width1 = {{#expr: (285 * 790 / 892) round 0}}
| image2 = Cad crank.jpg
| width2 = {{#expr: (260 * 707 / 892) round 0}}
}}
Computer-aided design (CAD) is a act of using a computer to do virtual modelling. This virtual modelling can be done in either 2D or in 3D. Modelling can be done as either a 'mock-up' or as the real design which can be used in conjunction with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing computer-aided manufacture (CAM)]. 

'''Benefits of computer-aided design:'''
* There are undo tools available so mistakes can be easily resolved
* It's a faster way to create a model than traditional methods; if it's saving time, then it's saving money.
* Clients can see a virtual representation of what the final object is going to look like
* Measuring tools can be used to make sure that there is extreme accuracy.
* If linked with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing computer-aided manufacture (CAM)] then manufacturing can be really quick, as they can link it to machines like 3D printers and laser cutters. This is assisted by the fact that the model is accuracy, and the machine is accurate so that the final product is exactly how they wanted. If more than one is produced, then each product is exactly the same, meaning that the customers will be happy.

=== Digital Mock-up (DMU) ===
A digital mock-up (DMU) is where the software is used a quick mock-up of what the final thing will look like. DMUs are used to give a better description of the product and can outline certain details of the object that might have otherwise been difficult to communicate with words.
They have two main uses:
* Showing to clients to see if they agree or not.
* To better communicate the the task to the designers of what they're going to create.

=== Computer-aided engineering (CAE) ===
Computer-aided engineering (CAE) is the broad usage of computer software to aid in engineering analysis tasks&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Plasticity.jpg|thumb|centre| ]]

=== Virtual modelling and testing ===
This is the ability to create a 3D component/model in a computer within a virtual world rather than making a physical model; this saves development times. An advantage of virtual modelling is that changes can easily be made. 

Bi-directional parametric modelling is the concept of when you edit one part of the model, other parts can adapt depending on that change, this speeds up development. An example of this would be mirrored modelling where changing one side, will be mirrored on the other side and make changes there too&lt;ref&gt;Bi-directional parametric modelling example at 2:18 to 2:33 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRZIMnUf3gA#t=138&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Rapid prototyping ==
[[File:Stereolithography apparatus.jpg|thumb|right|Example of Stereolithography]]
Rapid prototyping is where you can just convert your CAD designs into a complicated 3D object at the click of a button. Examples of this are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography Stereolithography] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3d_printing 3D Printing]. This allows designers to to review the function, ease of manufacture and marketability of a product within a few days of being being designed. This means that the product gets to market quicker, thus beating competition with other companies. 

Rapid prototyping machines create objects with a high degree of accuracy meaning that every product is the same, meaning that customers are happy as all the product are the same. In-comparison with traditional methods, rapid prototyping has many advantages. There is no waste materials from the product and there aren't lots of machinery needed, only just one machine, in comparison to some other product which would potentially take many machines. Rapid prototyping eliminates the need for paying to have engineers as the machine does it all for you; this is better for the company, but it means that there are less jobs.

=== Process of stereolithography ===
* It's designed using CAD
* Information is then sent to the machine
* Lasers used
* Built up in layers
* Liquid polymer granules used.
* Material is then hardened
* Where the beams intersect
* Lower after each pass
* Arm moves across top surface after each layer to ensure top surface is flat.

== Marketing, distribution and retail ==
=== Electronic point of sale ===
EPOS systems allow businesses to be able to supply and deliver its products and services quicker due to reducing the time between the placing of an order and the delivery of a product. EPOS, essentially enables efficient recording of the sale of goods or services to the customer.

In EPOS systems, each product will have a unique barcode, allowing it to be electronically identified. This barcode is read via a barcode reader or scanner, which is passed over the barcode. The black bars reflect less light than the background, allowing the reader to detect them via the use of a laser.
[[File:UPC-A-036000291452.png|thumb|centre|A standard barcode]]
The barcode itself doesn't hold any data, instead the information is held within the EPOS system located within a shop. Typically, the checkout will scan the product, transmit the product code number to the in-store computer system which then transmits the products information back to the checkout. The in-store computer will then deduct the scanned item from the stock list to keep an up-to-date record of the stores stock; allowing the store to know when stock is running low and when to order more.

'''Advantages of EPOS and associated software:'''
* A full and immediate account of the financial transactions involving the company's products.
* Data can be input into spreadsheets for sale/profit margin analysis.
* Allows the performance of all product lines to be monitored, allowing the manufacture to be able to react to demand.
* Allows accurate information for identifying consumer buying trends.
* Full and responsive stock control system with real-time stock updates.
* Ensures sufficient stock is available to meet customer needs without over-stocking.

=== Internet marketing and sales ===
The internet is a great place for businesses to do marketing and advertisement. This allows companies to reach a larger audience (a global audience) when they do marketing. Additionally, they can then use the internet and websites to sell the products online with the use of delivery. This means that they can work online and don't need a physical shop, these are known as virtual companies.

==== Advantages and Disadvantages to the manufacturers and retailers ====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
| They can have a wider audience (global audience) || If a customers banking information is 'taken', then they will be responsible.
|-
| They can use marketing techniques online through the use of social media to market the product and increase the company's profile. || If people have difficult using a computer, or navigating their website, then they could lose out on customers.
|-
| They can process orders and transactions automatically online, this means that it's faster and that there is no need to pay someone to do it.|| 
|-
| They can obtain user statistics of marketing and user trends so they can market and produce their product according to that information. || 
|-
| It's less expensive as they don't need a real 'walk-in' store. || 
|-
| Less expensive marketing online compared to traditional methods like magazines and TV. || 
|}

==== Advantages and Disadvantages to the customer ====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
| Access to a wide range of products and services. || Security concerns about bank details and personal information.
|-
| Availability of product information will help they decide whether or not they want to buy it. || Slower internet connection can cause problems
|-
| They can get online discounts and saving through the use of comparison websites. || Some users might have difficult navigating the website.
|-
| It's convenient as they can shop from home. || Doesn't allow customers to have a hands on experience.
|-
| || Spread of 'junk' mail is a concern to users.

'''Big O Notation''' (also known as '''Big-O Notation''') is a mathematical way of describing the limiting behaviours of a function. In other words, it is a way of defining how efficient an algorithm is by how &quot;fast&quot; it will run.
==Timing==
You can work out the time that an algorithm takes to run by timing it:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Dim timer As New Stopwatch()
timer.Start()
For x = 1 to 1000000000
   'count to one billion!
Next
timer.Stop()
' Get the elapsed time as a TimeSpan value. 
Dim el As TimeSpan = stopWatch.Elapsed

' Format and display the TimeSpan value. 
Dim formattedTime As String = String.Format(&quot;{0}:{1}:{2}.{3}&quot;, el.Hours, el.Minutes, el.Seconds, el.Milliseconds / 10)
Console.WriteLine( &quot;Time Elapsed: &quot; + formattedTime)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

{{CPTCmd|Time Elapsed: 0:0:21:3249}}

However, this isn't always suitable. What happens if you run some code on a 33MHz processor, and some code on a 3.4GHz processor.  Timing a function tells you a lot about the speed of a computer and very little about the speed of an algorithm.

==Refining algorithms==

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
dim N as integer = 7483647
dim sum as double= 0
for i = 1 to N
   sum = sum + i
loop
console.writeline(sum)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

optimised version
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
dim N as integer = 7483647
dim sum as double =  N * (1 + N) / 2
console.writeline(sum)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

|desc=[[Cookbook:Annatto|'''Annatto''']], also ''achiote'', is a spice made from the seeds of the [[W:Achiote|achiote]] tree.  The orange to red pigment in annatto is very readily absorbed by oils and fats, making it a quite useful, all-natural food coloring, for a variety of foods, especially for foods that might otherwise be pale in color, such as rice, cheese, poultry and fish.

I think I should get reviewer status so that I can use my copyediting skills and check them against writing. [[User:StudiesWorld|StudiesWorld]] ([[User talk:StudiesWorld|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StudiesWorld|contribs]]) 12:29, 13 April 2014 (UTC)
: What is it you want the reviewer bit for?  I'm unclear what you mean.  I see you've basically edited here on two occasions, both this year, total of twenty-four mainspace edits, none on Wikijunior (which is basically the only place where the review bit has direclty visible consequences).  The criteria for autopromotion are meant to let people get experience with Wikibooks first.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:48, 13 April 2014 (UTC)
::For fact checking and copyediting in all spaces. [[User:StudiesWorld|StudiesWorld]] ([[User talk:StudiesWorld|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StudiesWorld|contribs]]) 20:49, 13 April 2014 (UTC)
::: These do not sound to me like activities that require the review bit.  Perhaps I'm not understanding this description the way you're intending it.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:00, 13 April 2014 (UTC)
:::: As Pi Zero has said, the only use for Reviewer permissions is for those actively reviewing edits especially those related to Wikijunior (and a small number of other youth-targeted books) as these books will only show reviewed edits by default.  All users become Reviewers once they have met the criteria as mentioned on [[Wikibooks:Reviewers]].--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:28, 13 April 2014 (UTC)

A study has shown that high level of maternal vitamin D during pregnancy strengthens baby's [[w:Grip strength|grip strength]] at the age of four.  The study has shown that vitamin D intake during late stage of pregnancy improves muscle strength.  Evidence has shown that [[W:Hypovitaminosis D|vitamin D deficiency]] decreases the amount of [[w:Skeletal striated muscle#Muscle fibers|fast muscle fibers]] and increases the amount of fat in muscle.  Muscle strength peaks in young adulthood before declining in older age.  Low grip strength at adulthood is associated with problems such as diabetes, falls and fractures.  It is likely that high vitamin D during pregnancy has benefit to a child that continue until old age and reduces the burden of illness associated with [[w:Muscle atrophy|loss of muscle mass]] in old age.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How to access a Microsoft Access database using the SQL library

Use the sql:get connection() function
Use the sun JDBC/ODBC driver string &quot;sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver&quot;
Specify a jdbc-style URL
Specify the path name to the mdb file

Example program
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;3.0&quot;;

let $conn := sql:get-connection(&quot;sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver&quot;, &quot;jdbc:ucanaccess://e:/db1.mdb;memory=false&quot;)

return sql:execute($conn, &quot;SELECT * FROM tbl1&quot;, false())
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that this library converts Access' quirky UTF-16 to UTF-8. Other libraries do not do this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], specifically in the field of [[finite group theory]], the '''Sylow theorems''' are a collection of [[theorem]]s named after the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] [[Peter Ludwig Mejdell Sylow|Ludwig Sylow]] ([[#{{harvid|Sylow|1872}}|1872]]) that give detailed information about the number of [[subgroup]]s of fixed [[order of a group|order]] that a given [[finite group]] contains. The Sylow theorems form a fundamental part of finite group theory and have very important applications in the [[classification of finite simple groups]].

For a [[prime number]] ''p'', a '''Sylow ''p''-subgroup''' (sometimes '''''p''-Sylow subgroup''') of a group ''G'' is a maximal ''p''-subgroup of ''G'', i.e., a subgroup of ''G'' that is a [[p-group|''p''-group]] (so that the [[order of a group element|order]] of any group element is a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of ''p''), and that is not a proper subgroup of any other ''p''-subgroup of ''G''. The set of all Sylow ''p''-subgroups for a given prime ''p'' is sometimes written Syl&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'').

The Sylow theorems assert a partial converse to [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]]. While Lagrange's theorem states that for any finite group ''G'' the order (number of elements) of every subgroup of ''G'' divides the order of ''G'', the Sylow theorems state that for any [[prime factor]] ''p'' of the order of a finite group ''G'', there exists a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G''. The order of a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of a finite group ''G'' is ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''n'' is the [[multiplicity of a prime factor|multiplicity]] of ''p'' in the order of ''G'', and any subgroup of order ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G''.  The Sylow ''p''-subgroups of a group (for a given prime ''p'') are [[Conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other. The number of Sylow ''p''-subgroups of a group for a given prime ''p'' is congruent to {{nowrap|1 mod ''p''.}}

== Theorems ==

Collections of subgroups that are each maximal in one sense or another are common in group theory. The surprising result here is that in the case of Syl&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''G''), all members are actually [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to each other and have the largest possible order: if |''G''| = ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;m'' with ''n'' &gt; 0 where ''p'' does not divide ''m'', then any Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P'' has order |''P''| = ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. That is, ''P'' is a ''p''-group and gcd(|''G'' : ''P''|, ''p'') = 1. These properties can be exploited to further analyze the structure of ''G''.

The following theorems were first proposed and proven by Ludwig Sylow in 1872, and published in ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]''.

'''Theorem 1''': For any [[prime factor]] ''p'' with [[multiplicity of a prime factor|multiplicity]] ''n'' of the order of a finite group ''G'', there exists a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'', of order ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.

The following weaker version of theorem 1 was first proved by [[Augustin Cauchy|Cauchy]], and is known as [[Cauchy's theorem (group theory)|Cauchy's theorem]].

'''Corollary''': Given a finite group ''G'' and a prime number ''p'' dividing the order of ''G'', then there exists an element (and hence a subgroup) of order ''p'' in ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;Fraleigh, Victor J. Katz. A First Course In Abstract Algebra. p. 322. ISBN 9788178089973&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem 2''': Given a finite group ''G'' and a prime number ''p'', all Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G'' are [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other, i.e. if ''H'' and ''K'' are Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G'', then there exists an element ''g'' in ''G'' with ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Hg'' = ''K''.

'''Theorem 3''': Let ''p'' be a prime factor with multiplicity ''n'' of the order of a finite group ''G'', so that the order of ''G'' can be written as {{nowrap|''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;m''}}, where {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 0}} and ''p'' does not divide ''m''. Let ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the number of Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G''. Then the following hold:
* ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' divides ''m'', which is the [[index of a subgroup|index]] of the Sylow ''p''-subgroup in ''G''.
* ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ 1 mod ''p''.
* ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = |''G'' : ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''P'')|, where ''P'' is any Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'' and ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the [[normalizer]].

=== Consequences ===

The Sylow theorems imply that for a prime number ''p'' every Sylow ''p''-subgroup is of the same order, ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. Conversely, if a subgroup has order ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', then it is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup, and so is isomorphic to every other Sylow ''p''-subgroup. Due to the maximality condition, if ''H'' is any ''p''-subgroup of ''G'', then ''H'' is a subgroup of a ''p''-subgroup of order ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.

A very important consequence of Theorem 3 is that the condition ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1 is equivalent to saying that the Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'' is a [[normal subgroup]]
(there are groups that have normal subgroups but no normal Sylow subgroups, such as ''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Sylow theorems for infinite groups ===

There is an analogue of the Sylow theorems for infinite groups.  We define a Sylow ''p''-subgroup in an infinite group to be a ''p''-subgroup (that is, every element in it has ''p''-power order) that is maximal for inclusion among all ''p''-subgroups in the group.  Such subgroups exist by [[Zorn's lemma]].

'''Theorem''': If ''K'' is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'', and ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = |Cl(''K'')| is finite, then every Sylow ''p''-subgroup is conjugate to ''K'', and ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ 1 mod ''p'', where Cl(''K'') denotes the conjugacy class of ''K''.

== Examples ==
[[File:Labeled Triangle Reflections.svg|thumb|In ''D''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; all reflections are conjugate, as reflections correspond to Sylow 2-subgroups.]]

A simple illustration of Sylow subgroups and the Sylow theorems are the [[dihedral group]] of the ''n''-gon, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. For ''n'' odd, 2 = 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the highest power of 2 dividing the order, and thus subgroups of order 2 are Sylow subgroups. These are the groups generated by a reflection, of which there are ''n,'' and they are all conjugate under rotations; geometrically the axes of symmetry pass through a vertex and a side. 

[[File:Hexagon Reflections.png|thumb|left|In ''D''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; reflections no longer correspond to Sylow 2-subgroups, and fall into two conjugacy classes.]]
By contrast, if ''n'' is even, then 4 divides the order of the group, and the subgroups of order 2 are no longer Sylow subgroups, and in fact they fall into two conjugacy classes, geometrically according to whether they pass through two vertices or two faces. These are related by an [[outer automorphism]], which can be represented by rotation through π/''n'', half the minimal rotation in the dihedral group.

==Example applications==
Since Sylows theorem ensures the existence of p-subgroups of a finite group, its worthwhile to study groups of prime power order more closely. Most of the examples use Sylows theorem to prove that a group of a particular order is not [[Simple group|simple]]. For groups of small order, the congruence condition of Sylow's theorem is often sufficient to force the existence of a [[normal subgroup]]. 
Example-1: Groups of order pq, p and q primes with p&lt;q. 
Example-2 Group of order 30, groups of order 20, groups of order p2q, p and q distinct primes are some of the applications. 
Example-3 (Groups of order 60): If o(G)=60 and G has more than one Sylow 5-subgroups, then G is simple.

=== Cyclic group orders ===
Some numbers ''n'' are such that every group of order ''n'' is cyclic.  One can show that ''n'' = 15 is such a number using the Sylow theorems:  Let ''G'' be a group of order 15 = 3 · 5 and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. Then ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; | 5 and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only value satisfying these constraints is 1; therefore, there is only one subgroup of order 3, and it must be [[normal subgroup|normal]] (since it has no distinct conjugates). Similarly, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; must divide 3, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; must equal 1 (mod 5); thus it must also have a single normal subgroup of order 5. Since 3 and 5 are [[coprime]], the intersection of these two subgroups is trivial, and so ''G'' must be the [[internal direct product]] of groups of order ''3'' and ''5'', that is the [[cyclic group]] of order 15. Thus, there is only one group of order 15 ([[up to]] isomorphism).

=== Small groups are not simple ===
A more complex example involves the order of the smallest [[simple group]] that is not [[cyclic group|cyclic]]. [[Burnside's theorem|Burnside's ''p&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; q&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;'' theorem]] states that if the order of a group is the product of one or two [[prime power]]s, then it is [[solvable group|solvable]], and so the group is not simple, or is of prime order and is cyclic. This rules out every group up to order 30 {{nowrap|({{=}} 2 · 3 · 5)}}.

If ''G'' is simple, and |''G''| = 30, then ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; must divide 10 ( = 2 · 5), and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; must equal 1 (mod 3). Therefore ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 10, since neither 4 nor 7 divides 10, and if ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 then, as above, ''G'' would have a normal subgroup of order 3, and could not be simple. ''G'' then has 10 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 3, each of which has 2 elements of order 3 (plus the identity). This means ''G'' has at least 20 distinct elements of order 3. 

As well, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 6, since ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; must divide 6 ( = 2 · 3), and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; must equal 1 (mod 5). So ''G'' also has 24 distinct elements of order 5. But the order of ''G'' is only 30, so a simple group of order 30 cannot exist.

Next, suppose |''G''| = 42 = 2 · 3 · 7. Here ''n''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; must divide 6 ( =  2 · 3) and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; must equal 1 (mod 7), so ''n''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. So, as before, ''G'' can not be simple.

On the other hand for |''G''| = 60 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; · 3 · 5, then ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 6 is perfectly possible. And in fact, the smallest simple non-cyclic group is A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[alternating group]] over 5 elements. It has order 60, and has 24 [[cyclic permutation]]s of order 5, and 20 of order 3.

=== Wilson's theorem ===
Part of [[Wilson's theorem]] states that

:&lt;math&gt;(p-1)!\ \equiv\ -1 \pmod p&lt;/math&gt;

for every prime ''p''. One may easily prove this theorem by Sylow's third theorem. Indeed,  
observe that the number ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' of Sylow's ''p''-subgroups  
in the symmetric group ''S&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is (p-2)!. On the other hand,  
n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ 1 mod p. Hence, (p-2)! ≡ 1 mod p. So, (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p.

=== Fusion results ===
[[Frattini's argument]] shows that a Sylow subgroup of a normal subgroup provides a factorization of a finite group.  A slight generalization known as '''Burnside's fusion theorem''' states that if ''G'' is a finite group with Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P'' and two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' normalized by ''P'', then ''A'' and ''B'' are ''G''-conjugate if and only if they are ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''P'')-conjugate.  The proof is a simple application of Sylow's theorem: If ''B''=''A&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'', then the normalizer of ''B'' contains not only ''P'' but also ''P&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' (since ''P&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' is contained in the normalizer of ''A&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'').  By Sylow's theorem ''P'' and ''P&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' are conjugate not only in ''G'', but in the normalizer of ''B''.  Hence ''gh''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; normalizes ''P'' for some ''h'' that normalizes ''B'', and then ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''gh''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B'', so that ''A'' and ''B'' are ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''P'')-conjugate.  Burnside's fusion theorem can be used to give a more powerful factorization called a [[semidirect product]]: if ''G'' is a finite group whose Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P'' is contained in the center of its normalizer, then ''G'' has a normal subgroup ''K'' of order coprime to ''P'', ''G'' = ''PK'' and ''P''∩''K'' = 1, that is, ''G'' is [[p-nilpotent group|''p''-nilpotent]].

Less trivial applications of the Sylow theorems include the [[focal subgroup theorem]], which studies the control a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of the [[derived subgroup]] has on the structure of the entire group.  This control is exploited at several stages of the [[classification of finite simple groups]], and for instance defines the case divisions used in the [[Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem]] classifying finite [[simple group]]s whose Sylow 2-subgroup is a [[quasi-dihedral group]].  These rely on [[J. L. Alperin]]'s strengthening of the conjugacy portion of Sylow's theorem to control what sorts of elements are used in the conjugation.

==Proof of the Sylow theorems==

The Sylow theorems have been proved in a number of ways, and the history of the proofs themselves are the subject of many papers including {{harv|Waterhouse|1980}}, {{harv|Scharlau|1988}}, {{harv|Casadio|Zappa|1990}}, {{harv|Gow|1994}}, and to some extent {{harv|Meo|2004}}.

One proof of the Sylow theorems exploits the notion of [[group action]] in various creative ways. The group ''G'' acts on itself or on the set of its ''p''-subgroups in various ways, and each such action can be exploited to prove one of the Sylow theorems.  The following proofs are based on combinatorial arguments of {{harv|Wielandt|1959}}. In the following, we use ''a'' | ''b'' as notation for &quot;a divides b&quot; and ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\nmid&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' for the negation of this statement.

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Theorem 1''':  A finite group ''G'' whose order |''G''| is divisible by a prime power ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' has a subgroup of order ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proof: Let |''G''| = ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;m = p&lt;sup&gt;k+r&lt;/sup&gt;u'' such that ''p'' does not divide ''u'', and let Ω denote the set of subsets of ''G'' of size ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''. ''G'' [[Group action|acts]] on Ω by left multiplication. The [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|orbits]] ''G''ω = {''g''ω | ''g'' ∈ ''G''} of the ω ∈ Ω are the [[equivalence class]]es under the action of ''G''.

For any ω ∈ Ω consider its [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer subgroup]]  ''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; = {''g'' ∈ ''G'' | ''g''ω = ω}. For any fixed element α ∈ ω the function [''g'' ↦ ''g''α] maps ''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; to ω injectively: for any two ''g'', ''h'' ∈ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; we have that ''g''α = ''h''α implies ''g'' = ''h'', because α ∈ ω ⊆ ''G'' means that one may cancel on the right. Therefore  '' p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' = |ω| ≥ |''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;|.

:&lt;math&gt;|\Omega | ={p^km \choose p^k} = m \prod_{j=1}^{p^k - 1} \frac{p^k m - j}{p^k - j} = m \prod_{j=1}^{p^{k} - 1} \frac{p^{k - \nu_p(j)} m - j/p^{\nu_p(j)}}{p^{k - \nu_p(j)} - j/p^{\nu_p(j)}} &lt;/math&gt;

and no power of ''p'' remains in any of the factors inside the product on the right. Hence [[Additive p-adic valuation|''ν&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'']](|Ω|) = ''ν&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''m'') = ''r''.
Let ''R'' ⊆ Ω be a complete representation of all the equivalence classes under the action of ''G''. Then,
:&lt;math&gt;|\Omega | =\sum_{\omega\in R}|G\omega|\mathrm{.}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, there exists an element ω ∈ ''R'' such that ''s'' := ''ν&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(|''G''ω|) ≤ ''ν&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(|Ω|) = ''r''. Hence |''G''ω| = ''p&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;v'' where ''p'' does not divide ''v''. By the [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer-orbit-theorem]] we have |''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;| = |''G''| / |''G''ω| = ''p&lt;sup&gt;k+r-s&lt;/sup&gt;u/v''. Therefore ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' | |''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;|, so ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' ≤ |''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;| and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the desired subgroup.

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Lemma''': Let ''G'' be a finite ''p''-group, let ''G'' act on a finite set Ω, and let Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; denote the set of points of Ω that are fixed under the action of ''G''.  Then |Ω| ≡ |Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| mod ''p''. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proof: Write Ω as a disjoint sum of its orbits under ''G''.  Any element ''x'' ∈ Ω not fixed by ''G'' will lie in an orbit of order |''G''|/|''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''| (where ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer]]), which is a multiple of ''p'' by assumption.  The result follows immediately.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem 2''': If ''H'' is a ''p''-subgroup of ''G'' and ''P'' is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'', then there exists an element ''g'' in ''G'' such that ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Hg'' ≤ ''P''. In particular, all Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G'' are [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other (and therefore [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]), i.e. if ''H'' and ''K'' are Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G'', then there exists an element ''g'' in ''G'' with ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Hg'' = ''K''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proof: Let Ω be the set of left [[coset]]s of ''P'' in ''G'' and let ''H'' act on Ω by left multiplication. Applying the Lemma to ''H'' on Ω, we see that |Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| ≡ |Ω| = [''G'' : ''P''] mod ''p''.  Now ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\nmid&lt;/math&gt; [''G'' : ''P''] by definition so ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\nmid&lt;/math&gt; |Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|, hence in particular |Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| ≠ 0 so there exists some ''gP'' ∈ Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  It follows that for some ''g'' ∈ ''G'' and ∀ ''h'' ∈ ''H'' we have ''hgP'' = ''gP'' so ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''HgP'' = ''P'' and therefore ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Hg'' ≤ ''P''. Now if ''H'' is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup, |''H''| = |''P''| = |''gPg''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;| so that ''H'' = ''gPg''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''g'' ∈ ''G''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem 3''': Let ''q'' denote the order of any Sylow ''p''-subgroup of a finite group ''G''.  Then ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' | |''G''|/''q'' and ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ 1 mod ''p''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proof: By Theorem 2, ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [''G'' : ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''P'')], where ''P'' is any such subgroup, and ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''P'') denotes the [[normalizer]] of ''P'' in ''G'', so this number is a divisor of |''G''|/''q''. Let Ω be the set of all Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G'', and let ''P'' act on Ω by conjugation. Let ''Q'' ∈ Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and observe that then ''Q'' = ''xQx''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''x'' ∈ ''P'' so that ''P'' ≤ ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''Q'').  By Theorem 2, ''P'' and ''Q'' are conjugate in ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''Q'') in particular, and ''Q'' is normal in ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''Q''), so then ''P'' = ''Q''.  It follows that Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {''P''} so that, by the Lemma, |Ω| ≡ |Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| = 1 mod ''p''.

== Algorithms ==
The problem of finding a Sylow subgroup of a given group is an important problem in [[computational group theory]].

One proof of the existence of Sylow ''p''-subgroups is constructive: if ''H'' is a ''p''-subgroup of ''G'' and the index [''G'':''H''] is divisible by ''p'', then the normalizer ''N'' = ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''H'') of ''H'' in ''G'' is also such that [''N'' : ''H''] is divisible by ''p''.  In other words, a polycyclic generating system of a Sylow ''p''-subgroup can be found by starting from any ''p''-subgroup ''H'' (including the identity) and taking elements of ''p''-power order contained in the normalizer of ''H'' but not in ''H'' itself.  The algorithmic version of this (and many improvements) is described in textbook form in {{harv|Butler|1991|loc=Chapter 16}}, including the algorithm described in {{harv|Cannon|1971}}.  These versions are still used in the [[GAP computer algebra system]].

In [[permutation group]]s, it has been proven in ({{harvs|nb|last=Kantor|year1=1985a|year2=1985b|year3=1990}}; {{harvnb|Kantor|Taylor|1988}}) that a Sylow ''p''-subgroup and its normalizer can be found in [[polynomial time]] of the input (the degree of the group times the number of generators).  These algorithms are described in textbook form in {{harv|Seress|2003}}, and are now becoming practical as the constructive recognition of finite simple groups becomes a reality.  In particular, versions of this algorithm are used in the [[Magma computer algebra system]].

In [[abstract algebra]], an '''abelian group''', also called a '''commutative group''', is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in which the result of applying the group [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] to two group elements does not depend on their order (the axiom of [[commutativity]]). Abelian groups [[generalization|generalize]] the [[arithmetic]] of addition of [[integer]]s. They are named after [[Niels Henrik Abel]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in undergraduate abstract algebra, with many other basic objects, such as a [[module (mathematics)|module]] and a [[vector space]], being its refinements. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their [[nonabelian group|non-abelian]] counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood. On the other hand, the theory of infinite abelian groups is an area of current research.

{{Algebraic structures |Group}}

== Definition ==
An abelian group is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], ''A'', together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] &quot;•&quot; that combines any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] ''a'' and ''b'' to form another element denoted {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}}. The symbol &quot;•&quot; is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation. To qualify as an abelian group, the set and operation, {{nowrap|(''A'', •)}}, must satisfy five requirements known as the ''abelian group axioms'':

;Closure: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A'', the result of the operation ''a'' • ''b'' is also in ''A''.
;Associativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''A'', the equation (''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'') holds.
;Identity element: There exists an element ''e'' in ''A'', such that for all elements ''a'' in ''A'', the equation {{nowrap|''e'' • ''a'' {{=}} ''a'' • ''e'' {{=}} ''a''}} holds.
;Inverse element: For each ''a'' in ''A'', there exists an element ''b'' in ''A'' such that ''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a'' = ''e'', where ''e'' is the identity element.
;Commutativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A'', ''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a''.

More compactly, an abelian group is a [[commutative]] [[group (mathematics)|group]]. A group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a &quot;non-abelian group&quot; or &quot;non-commutative group&quot;.

== Facts ==

=== Notation ===
{{see also|Additive group|Multiplicative group}}
There are two main notational conventions for abelian groups – additive and multiplicative.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|-
! Convention
! Operation
! Identity
! Powers
! Inverse
|-
! Addition
| ''x'' + ''y'' || 0 || ''nx'' || −''x''
|-
! Multiplication
| ''x'' ⋅ ''y'' or ''xy'' || ''e'' or 1
| ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
| ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

Generally, the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for [[module (mathematics)|module]]s and [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s. The additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered.

=== Multiplication table ===
To verify that a [[finite group]] is abelian, a table (matrix) – known as a [[Cayley table]] – can be constructed in a similar fashion to a [[multiplication table]]. If the group is ''G'' = {''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''e'', ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} under the operation ⋅, the (''i'', ''j'')'th entry of this table contains the product ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. The group is abelian [[if and only if]] this table is symmetric about the main diagonal.

This is true since if the group is abelian, then ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. This implies that the (''i'', ''j'')'th entry of the table equals the (''j'', ''i'')'th entry, thus the table is symmetric about the main diagonal.

== Examples ==
* For the [[integer]]s and the operation [[addition]] &quot;+&quot;, denoted ('''Z''',+), the operation + combines any two integers to form a third integer, addition is associative, zero is the [[additive identity]], every integer ''n'' has an [[additive inverse]], −''n'', and the addition operation is commutative since &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;''m'' + ''n'' = ''n'' + ''m''&lt;/span&gt; for any two integers ''m'' and ''n''.

* Every [[cyclic group]] ''G'' is abelian, because if ''x'', ''y'' are in ''G'', then ''xy'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m'' + ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''yx''. Thus the [[integer]]s, '''Z''', form an abelian group under addition, as do the [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''n'']], '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''.

* Every [[Ring theory|ring]] is an abelian group with respect to its addition operation. In a [[commutative ring]] the invertible elements, or [[unit (ring theory)|units]], form an abelian [[multiplicative group]]. In particular, the [[real number]]s are an abelian group under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an abelian group under multiplication.

* Every [[subgroup]] of an abelian group is [[normal subgroup|normal]], so each subgroup gives rise to a [[quotient group]]. Subgroups, quotients, and [[Direct sum of groups|direct sums]] of abelian groups are again abelian.

In general, [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], even invertible matrices, do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. However, some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication – one example is the group of 2×2 [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]].

== Historical remarks ==
&lt;!-- This particular statement seems to be suspect, but the direction is right. Note: updated and corrected on Sept. 2, 2012 --&gt;
Abelian groups were named for [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] [[Niels Henrik Abel]] by [[Camille Jordan]] because Abel found that the commutativity of the group of a [[polynomial]] implies that the  roots of the polynomial can be [[solvability by radicals|calculated by using radicals]]. See Section 6.5 of Cox (2004) for more information on the historical background.

== Properties ==
If ''n'' is a [[natural number]] and ''x'' is an element of an abelian group ''G'' written additively, then ''nx'' can be defined as ''x'' + ''x'' + ... + ''x'' (''n'' summands) and (−''n'')''x'' = −(''nx''). In this way, ''G'' becomes a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] '''Z''' of integers. In fact, the modules over '''Z''' can be identified with the abelian groups.

Theorems about abelian groups (i.e. [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over the [[principal ideal domain]] '''Z''') can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of [[finitely generated abelian group]]s which is a specialization of the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form '''Z'''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'''Z''' for ''p'' prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of '''Z'''.

If ''f'', ''g'' : ''G'' &amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp; ''H'' are two [[group homomorphism]]s between abelian groups, then their sum ''f'' + ''g'', defined by (''f'' + ''g'') (''x'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x''), is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if ''H'' is a non-abelian group.) The set Hom (''G'', ''H'') of all group homomorphisms from ''G'' to ''H'' thus turns into an abelian group in its own right.

Somewhat akin to the [[dimension]] of [[vector space]]s, every abelian group has a ''[[rank of an abelian group|rank]]''. It is defined as the [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of the largest set of [[linearly independent]] elements of the group. The integers and the [[rational number]]s have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals.

== Finite abelian groups ==
Cyclic groups of [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''n'']], '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''', were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The [[automorphism group]] of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of [[Georg Frobenius]] and [[Ludwig Stickelberger]] and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of [[linear algebra]].

=== Classification ===
The '''fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups''' states that every finite abelian group ''G'' can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of [[prime number|prime]]-power order. This is a special case of the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]] when ''G'' has zero [[rank of an abelian group|rank]].

The cyclic group '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''mn''&lt;/sub&gt; of order ''mn'' is isomorphic to the direct sum of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''m'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]]. It follows that any finite abelian group ''G'' is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_{k_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbf{Z}_{k_u}&lt;/math&gt;

in either of the following canonical ways:
* the numbers ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''k''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; are powers of primes
* ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [[divisor|divides]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which divides ''k''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and so on up to ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example, '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5: '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ {0, 5, 10} ⊕ {0, 3, 6, 9, 12}. The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].

For another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8), '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

See also [[list of small groups]] for finite abelian groups of order 16 or less.

=== Automorphisms ===
One can apply the [[#Classification|fundamental theorem]] to count (and sometimes determine) the [[Group isomorphism#Automorphisms|automorphisms]] of a given finite abelian group ''G''. To do this, one uses the fact (which will not be proved here) that if ''G'' splits as a direct sum ''H'' ⊕ ''K'' of subgroups of [[coprime]] order, then Aut(''H'' ⊕ ''K'') ≅ Aut(''H'') ⊕ Aut(''K'').

Given this, the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of ''G'' it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the [[Sylow theorems|Sylow]] ''p''-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of ''p''). Fix a prime ''p'' and suppose the exponents ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of the cyclic factors of the Sylow ''p''-subgroup are arranged in increasing order:

:&lt;math&gt;e_1\leq e_2 \leq\cdots\leq e_n&lt;/math&gt;

for some ''n'' &amp;gt; 0. One needs to find the automorphisms of

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_1}} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_n}}.&lt;/math&gt;

One special case is when ''n'' = 1, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P''. In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite [[cyclic group]] can be used. Another special case is when ''n'' is arbitrary but ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''. Here, one is considering ''P'' to be of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_p \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbf{Z}_p,&lt;/math&gt;

so elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension ''n'' over the finite field of ''p'' elements '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(P)\cong\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbf{F}_p),&lt;/math&gt;

where GL is the appropriate [[general linear group]]. This is easily shown to have order

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathrm{Aut}(P)|=(p^n-1)\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

In the most general case, where the ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n'' are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines

:&lt;math&gt;d_k=\mathrm{max}\{r|e_r = e_k^{\,}\}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;c_k=\mathrm{min}\{r|e_r=e_k^{\,}\}&lt;/math&gt;

then one has in particular ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''k'', ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''k'', and

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathrm{Aut}(P)| = \left(\prod_{k=1}^n{p^{d_k} - p^{k-1}}\right)\left(\prod_{j=1}^n{(p^{e_j})^{n-d_j}}\right)\left(\prod_{i=1}^n{(p^{e_i-1})^{n-c_i+1}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

One can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see [Hillar,Rhea]).

== Infinite abelian groups ==
Тhe simplest infinite abelian group is the [[infinite cyclic group]] '''Z'''. Any [[finitely generated abelian group]] ''A'' is isomorphic to the direct sum of ''r'' copies of '''Z''' and a finite abelian group, which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many [[cyclic group]]s of primary orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number ''r'', called the '''[[Rank of an abelian group|rank]]''' of ''A'', and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.

By contrast, classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete. [[Divisible group]]s, i.e. abelian groups ''A'' in which the equation ''nx'' = ''a'' admits a solution ''x'' ∈ ''A'' for any natural number ''n'' and element ''a'' of ''A'', constitute one important class of infinite abelian groups that can be completely characterized. Every divisible group is isomorphic to a direct sum, with summands isomorphic to '''Q''' and [[Prüfer group]]s '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; for various prime numbers ''p'', and the cardinality of the set of summands of each type is uniquely determined.&lt;ref&gt;For example, '''Q'''/'''Z''' ≅ ∑&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if a divisible group ''A'' is a subgroup of an abelian group ''G'' then ''A'' admits a direct complement: a subgroup ''C'' of ''G'' such that ''G'' = ''A'' ⊕ ''C''. Thus divisible groups are [[injective module]]s in the category of abelian groups, and conversely, every injective abelian group is divisible ([[Baer's criterion]]). An abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called '''reduced'''. 

Two important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are ''torsion groups'' and ''torsion-free groups'', exemplified by the groups '''Q'''/'''Z''' (periodic) and '''Q''' (torsion-free).

=== Torsion groups ===

An abelian group is called '''[[periodic group|periodic]]''' or '''[[torsion (algebra)|torsion]]''' if every element has finite [[order (group theory)|order]]. A direct sum of finite cyclic groups is periodic. Although the converse statement is not true in general, some special cases are known. The first and second [[Prüfer theorems]] state that if ''A'' is a periodic group and either it has '''bounded exponent''', i.e. ''nA'' = 0 for some natural number ''n'', or if ''A'' is countable and the [[height (abelian group)|''p''-heights]] of the elements of ''A'' are finite for each ''p'', then ''A'' is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Countability assumption in the second Prüfer theorem cannot be removed: the torsion subgroup of the [[direct product]] of the cyclic groups '''Z'''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;'''Z''' for all natural ''m'' is not a direct sum of cyclic groups.&lt;/ref&gt; The cardinality of the set of direct summands isomorphic to '''Z'''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;'''Z''' in such a decomposition is an invariant of ''A''. These theorems were later subsumed in the '''Kulikov criterion'''. In a different direction, [[Helmut Ulm]] found an extension of the second Prüfer theorem to countable abelian ''p''-groups with elements of infinite height: those groups are completely classified by means of their [[Ulm invariant]]s.

=== Torsion-free and mixed groups ===

An abelian group is called '''torsion-free''' if every non-zero element has infinite order. Several classes of [[torsion-free abelian group]]s have been studied extensively:

* [[Free abelian group]]s, i.e. arbitrary direct sums of '''Z'''
* [[Cotorsion group|Cotorsion]] and [[algebraically compact module|algebraically compact]] torsion-free groups such as the [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]]
* [[Slender group]]s

An abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called '''mixed'''. If ''A'' is an abelian group and ''T''(''A'') is its [[torsion subgroup]] then the factor group ''A''/''T''(''A'') is torsion-free. However, in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of ''A'', so  ''A'' is ''not'' isomorphic to ''T''(''A'') ⊕ ''A''/''T''(''A''). Thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups.

=== Invariants and classification ===
One of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group ''A'' is its [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]: the cardinality of the maximal [[linearly independent]] subset of ''A''. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1]] are necessarily subgroups of '''Q''' and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank ''r'' is a subgroup of '''Q'''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, the group of [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite '''Z'''-rank and the groups '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with different ''n'' are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups. 

The classification theorems for finitely generated, divisible, countable periodic, and rank 1 torsion-free abelian groups explained above were all obtained before 1950 and form a foundation of the classification of more general infinite abelian groups. Important technical tools used in classification of infinite abelian groups are [[pure subgroup|pure]] and [[basic subgroup|basic]] subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by [[Irving Kaplansky]], László Fuchs, [[Phillip Griffith]], and David Arnold, as well as the proceedings of the conferences on Abelian Group Theory published in Lecture Notes in Mathematics for more recent results.

=== Additive groups of rings ===
The additive group of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings (with nontrivial multiplication). Some important topics in this area of study are:

* [[Tensor product]]
* Corner's results on countable torsion-free groups
* Shelah's work to remove cardinality restrictions

== Relation to other mathematical topics ==
Many large abelian groups possess a natural [[topology]], which turns them into [[topological group]]s.

The collection of all abelian groups, together with the [[Group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] between them, forms the [[category of abelian groups|category]] '''Ab''', the prototype of an [[abelian category]].

Nearly all well-known [[algebraic structure]]s other than [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]] are [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]]. Hence it is surprising that Tarski's student Szmielew (1955) proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research:
*Amongst torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank, only the finitely generated case and the [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1|rank 1]] case are well understood;
*There are many unsolved problems in the theory of infinite-rank torsion-free abelian groups;
*While countable torsion abelian groups are well understood through simple presentations and Ulm invariants, the case of countable mixed groups is much less mature.
*Many mild extensions of the first order theory of abelian groups are known to be undecidable.
*Finite abelian groups remain a topic of research in computational group theory.

Moreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the [[set theory]] commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics. Take the [[Whitehead problem]]: are all Whitehead groups of infinite order also [[free abelian group]]s? In the 1970s, [[Saharon Shelah]] proved that the Whitehead problem is:
* [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC|Undecidable in ZFC]] ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]]), the conventional [[axiomatic set theory]] from which nearly all of present day mathematics can be derived. The Whitehead problem is also the first question in ordinary mathematics proved undecidable in ZFC;
* Undecidable even if [[ZFC]] is augmented by taking the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] as an axiom;
* Positively answered if ZFC is augmented with the axiom of [[Constructible universe|constructibility]] (see [[statements true in L]]).

== A note on the typography ==

'''Burnside's lemma''', sometimes also called '''Burnside's counting theorem''', the '''Cauchy-Frobenius lemma''' or the '''orbit-counting theorem''', is a result in [[group theory]] which is often  useful in taking account of [[symmetry]] when counting mathematical objects.  Its various eponyms include [[William Burnside]], [[George Pólya]], [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]], and [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]]. The result is not due to Burnside himself, who merely quotes it in his book 'On the Theory of Groups of Finite Order', attributing it instead to {{harvtxt|Frobenius|1887}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnside|1897|loc=§119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following, let ''G'' be a [[finite set|finite]] [[group (mathematics)|group]] that [[Group action|acts]] on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X''. For each ''g'' in ''G'' let ''X&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' denote the set of [[element (mathematics)|elements]] in ''X'' that are [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed by]] ''g''. Burnside's lemma asserts the following formula for the number of [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]s, denoted |''X''/''G''|:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rotman|1995|loc=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|X/G| = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G}|X^g|.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the number of orbits (a [[natural number]] or [[Extended real number line|+∞]]) is equal to the [[mean|average]] number of points [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed]] by an element of ''G'' (which is also a natural number or infinity). If ''G'' is infinite, the division by |''G''| may not be well-defined; in this case the following statement in [[cardinal arithmetic]] holds:

:&lt;math&gt;|G| |X/G| = \sum_{g \in G}|X^g|.&lt;/math&gt;

== Example application ==
The number of rotationally distinct colourings of the faces of a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]] using three colours can be determined from this formula as follows.

Let ''X'' be the set of 3&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; possible face colour combinations that can be applied to a cube in one particular orientation, and let the rotation group ''G'' of the cube act on ''X'' in the natural manner. Then two elements of ''X'' belong to the same orbit precisely when one is simply a rotation of the other. The number of rotationally distinct colourings is thus the same as the number of orbits and can be found by counting the sizes of the [[fixed set]]s for the 24 elements of ''G''.

[[Image:Face colored cube.png|thumb|Cube with coloured faces]]
* one  identity element which leaves all 3&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; elements of ''X'' unchanged
* six  90-degree face rotations, each of which leaves 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of the elements of ''X'' unchanged
* three  180-degree face rotations, each of which leaves 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; of the elements of ''X'' unchanged
* eight  120-degree vertex rotations, each of which leaves 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the elements of ''X'' unchanged
* six  180-degree edge rotations, each of which leaves 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of the elements of ''X'' unchanged

A detailed examination of these automorphisms may be found
[[Cycle_index#The_cycle_index_of_the_face_permutations_of_a_cube|here]].

The average fix size is thus

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{24}\left(3^6+6\cdot 3^3 + 3 \cdot 3^4 + 8 \cdot 3^2 + 6 \cdot 3^3 \right) = 57. &lt;/math&gt;

Hence there are 57 rotationally distinct colourings of the faces of a cube in three colours. In general, the number of rotationally distinct colorings of the faces of a cube in ''n'' colors is given by

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{24}\left(n^6+3n^4 + 12n^3 + 8n^2\right). &lt;/math&gt;

== Proof ==

The first step in the proof is to re-express the sum over the group elements ''g''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''G'' as an equivalent sum over the set elements ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'':

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{g \in G}|X^g| = |\{(g,x)\in G\times X \mid g.x = x\}| = \sum_{x \in X} |G_x|.&lt;/math&gt;

(Here ''X&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''g.x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''} is the subset of all points of ''X'' fixed by ''g''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''G'', whereas ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''g''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''g.x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''} is the [[Orbit-stabilizer theorem#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer subgroup]] of G that fixes the point ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''.)

The [[Orbit-stabilizer theorem#Orbits and stabilizers|orbit-stabilizer theorem]] says that there is a natural [[bijection]] for each ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' between the orbit of ''x'', ''G.x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''g.x''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''g''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''G''}&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''X'', and the set of left cosets ''G/G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' of its stabalizer subgroup ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. With [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] this implies

:&lt;math&gt;|G.x| = [G\,:\,G_x] = |G| / |G_x|.&lt;/math&gt;

Our sum over the set ''X'' may therefore be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x \in X} |G_x| = \sum_{x \in X} \frac{|G|}{|G. x|} = |G| \sum_{x \in X}\frac{1}{|G. x|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, notice that ''X'' is the disjoint union of all its orbits in ''X/G'', which means the sum over ''X'' may be broken up into separate sums over each individual orbit.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x \in X}\frac{1}{|G. x|} = \sum_{A\in X/G} \sum_{x\in A} \frac{1}{|A|} = \sum_{A\in X/G} 1 = |X/G|.&lt;/math&gt;

Putting everything together gives the desired result:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{g \in G}|X^g| = |G| \cdot |X/G|.&lt;/math&gt;

==History: the lemma that is not Burnside's==
[[William Burnside]] stated and proved this lemma, attributing it to {{harvnb|Frobenius|1887}} in his 1897 book on finite groups.  But even prior to Frobenius, the formula was known to [[Cauchy]] in 1845. In fact, the lemma was apparently so well known that Burnside simply omitted to attribute it to Cauchy. Consequently, this lemma is sometimes referred to as '''the lemma that is not Burnside's'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neumann|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Stigler's law of eponymy]]) This is less ambiguous than it may seem: Burnside contributed many lemmas to this field.

      <text xml:space="preserve">HI I'm Sylvia Krizsan
I would like to introduce myself in saying HI how is everyone today.
I'm a life-long Student and I really like to be in school. It's very important to learn.
If anyone out there who is thinking of quitting don't. You won't get ahead in life. I feel that I'm way ahead in my life-long learning than I was when I was in school. Education is my passion, every time I open a a brand new textbook I'm feel joy in my heart. Knowing that I'm a very important student who is going to graduate again from college. 
So that is all I have to say about staying in school.
Bye for now

This book presents a range of techniques that self-motivated learners can use to connect with each other and develop stronger communities and collaborations. The book is addressed to everyone who is interested in how learning works, whether you’re an educator, a hobbyist, an artist, a home-school student, an employee, a parent, an activist, an archivist, a mathematician, or a tennis player. The book was written by a bunch of people who think learning is cool.

Over the course of working on the book, we practiced peeragogy — another word for “peer learning” — and we learned a lot.

Our experience within this project has been that flattened hierarchies do not necessarily mean decisions go by consensus — people often take the ball and run with it. The handbook includes co-edited pages as well as single-author works: often the lines and voices are blurred. One constant throughout the book is our interest in making something useful. To this end, the book is available under non-restrictive legal terms, which allow you to reuse portions of it however you see fit it. Among other things, we include instructions on how to join us in further developing this resource.

Sincerely,
[http://peeragogy.org The Peeragogy Team]

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.70}}

You will often need to use reference photos to guide your modelling. It is possible to bring images into Blender for use only as a guide in the 3D view, not to appear in the final render. Furthermore these images will only be visible when the view is ''orthographic'' and exactly aligned to one of the X, Y or Z axes (or the camera view). This way, they can be used as a precise reference for positioning elements of the model.

[[File:Blender270BackgroundImagesDefault.png|thumb]]
In the 3D view, make sure the Properties Shelf {{B3D:N2P/Do|N}} is visible. Look for the Background Images panel; it will most likely be collapsed, so expand it. Initially it will look like at right, with no background images in your view.
{{Clear}}

[[File:Blender270BackgroundImages1Image.png|thumb]]
Check the box at the top. Click the “Add Image” button once, and this will add one entry to the list of background images, as at right. Initially there is no image opened in this entry; you will need to click the “Open” button and select an image file.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender270BackgroundImages1ImageLoaded.png|thumb]]
Once you have chosen an image file, the list entry expands with additional options.

Clicking on the eye icon lets you temporarily hide a reference image, without actually removing it from the document. Or you can uncheck the box at the top of the Background Images panel to temporarily hide all reference images; just check it to make them visible again. Click the X to delete an entry from the list of background images.

If you have multiple scenes in your document, the document’s background image settings apply to all of them.
{{Clear}}

[[File:Nibelungendrache.jpg|thumb]]
If you don’t have an image handy to experiment with, how about downloading this simple 2D one from Wikimedia Commons. Flat images with no perspective work best for use as a precise modelling reference.
{{Clear}}

Having loaded your image, it might not immediately appear in the 3D view. For it to show, you must be in a ''perfect'' (axis-aligned) view (i.e. one of {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|NUM1}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|NUM3}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|NUM7}}) which is in orthographic, not perspective, mode (use {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM5}} to toggle between these), or alternatively it will show in {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM0}} the camera view.

[[File:Blender270BackgroundImagesAxisMenu.png|thumb]]
You may not want the same reference image visible in all views. For example, you might have one reference image for top view, another for a side view, and so on. The Axis menu lets you choose which view this image is visible in.
{{Clear}}

== Other Ways To Bring In Reference Images ==
Maybe you don’t want to use a reference image for precise, axis-aligned modelling, but only as a rough guide. There is a standard Blender addon called “[http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Add_Mesh/Planes_from_Images Import Images As Planes]”, which will create a plane object and apply an imported image to it as a texture. This can then be aligned whichever way you want in the scene.

'''Camotes enmielados''', also known as '''camotes con pilocilo''', or '''camotes enmielados al horno''', '''camotes con piloncilo al horno''', is a baked, or stovetop, dessert-style Mexican yam/sweet potato dish. It is a traditionally home cooked food, not typical restaurant fare.

==Ingredients==
*Yams, or sweet potatoes (White fleshed varieties are definitely in use) (peeling is optional)
*Piloncilo - unrefined Mexican sugar, sold in cones. Any dark, unrefined sugar product may be reasonably substituted, including turbinado sugar, brown sugar, brown sugar with added molasses, muscovado, even East Indian jaggery
*Cinnamon
*Water
**Proportions: 1 lg yam/1 lg piloncilo cone/4 sticks cinnamon/.5 cups water works to give a minimum of sweetness and caramelization. 
[[File:Camotes y Platanos machos asados.JPG|thumb|left|Camotes for sale, along with cooked bananas, Barrio de la Merced, Mexico]]
Place whole or thickly sliced yams in a large baking dish. place piloncilo cones atop the yams, and add water and cinnamon (sticks give a more delicate flavor than powder). cover dish, and bake for about 60 minutes, braising the yams with the now sweetened cooking liquid as needed. The finished product should have a strong caramel flavor, with a typical hint of bitterness from the molasses component of the sugar used. The sauce should be syrupy, very dark in color. Cinnamon flavor should be an accent, and not dominating. The dish is similar to US baked yams, but with a more pronounced caramel flavor. The dish is served as a dessert, and can also be found at Mexican food stands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ravi Ranjan asked: What is the difference between natural ally and strategic partner?

S. Kalyanaraman replies: Natural allies are normally 'birds of the same feather', while strategic partners are often ‘strange bedfellows’. Natural allies (think of America and Britain during the Second World War) share common political and cultural values—they may believe in democracy or authoritarianism; they may uphold liberal capitalism or socialism or state corporatism; they may share common historical and cultural traditions; their societal values may be more or less similar; they may practice the same religion; and so on.

Strategic partners (think of America and the Soviet Union during the Second World War) may share none of these similarities. Notwithstanding this difference, what makes two countries either natural allies or strategic partners is the common security challenge that they both face at a particular juncture in history and more importantly their decision to come together and pool their resources to deal with this challenge (think of America, Britain and the Soviet Union coming together to deal with the Fascist challenge during the Second World War).


S. Samuel C. Rajiv replies: India and Israel are ‘strategic partners’ rather than ‘natural allies’, though the former term is conspicuously absent in official pronouncements, especially that of India. The term one hears more often is that of ‘valuable’ partner. Strategic complementarities bring the two countries together. These include Israel’s world-class arms industry dependent on exports for maintaining its commercial and technological edge, Israeli expertise in such niche technology areas like radars and UAV’s and India's requirements for such surveillance technology. India’s defence modernisation needs coupled with short-comings in its domestic defence industrial base (inability to develop AWACS for instance led it to source Israeli Phalcons), as well as Israel’s willingness to supply sophisticated equipments, are equally pertinent.

People-to-people contacts are no doubt robust, as evident in growing numbers of tourists visiting either country. Historically, there have been no significant instances of anti-Semitism in India. Some of the threats both the countries face are similar in nature (Islamic extremism), though from different sources. Despite such similarities, however, some significant structural and policy differences do exist. While Israel is a Jewish democratic state, India is a secular democratic republic. Both countries have significant policy differences over issues like the Palestinians and the Iranian nuclear imbroglio.</text>

== Airplane Vs Aeroplane ==
I was just looking at this wikibook page: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior:Object_Alphabet/A

And the only thing that I was thinking was that there are two different spellings for Airplane/Aeroplane. Airplane in US and Canada, Areoplane everywhere else. So I was thinking maybe get a different example? It's up to you.

Design and technology have improved the lives of millions of people around the world. However these changes have resulted in social consequences.

== Mass production and the consumer society ==
The invention of the steam engine by James Watt in 1765 marked the start of the 'industrial revolution', which was a major changing point on a global basis. 
[[File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|centre|Jame Watt's Steam Engine.]]
Industrialization and specialization led to changes in the production, work force, transportation and infrastructure. This then sparked many new fields of design to accommodate the effects of industrialization. Population explosions occurred in towns and cities where production was centred and a new urban way of life was created. An increasing amount of people needed more and more products, this is when mass production responded to this need. Expensive, laborious and time consuming work can now be replaced by machine work. Products that were exclusively for the rich could now be made at an affordable price for ordinary working people.

The modern mass-consumer society is a feature of the developed world where peoples 'wants' are fulfilled by a constant range of new products. It is also refereed to as 'throw away' culture with an increasing demands for convenience products such as fast food and over-packed goods.
[[File:SnackfoodRackDF.JPG|thumb|centre|A range of convenience food products.]]

Mass consumerism developed during the 1930's from pop culture, lifestyle and fashion. Innovative new products and materials were introduced, especially in electrical consumer goods such as radios, refrigerators and washing machines&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing_machine#Washing_by_machine&lt;/ref&gt;. As peoples standard of living improved, their demand for new products increased. Advertising and marketing became and important new industry, using market research, packaging and product styling to sell new products.

After the second world war (1939-1945), for many, there was a period of hardship with very few luxuries as countries struggled to recover from the disasters caused by the war. However by the mid-1950's a new consumer society was developing. It started in America and soon spread to Europe, here is where the 'teenager' was born. Up until this point young men and women wore the same type of clothes as their parents and listened to the same type of music. The advent of Rock 'n' Roll music was to change all that and soon teenagers were rebelling against their parents' values and began carving out a style of their own. Design evolved rapidly to meet the expanding needs of the teenage market, incorporating high fashion and customer goods such as portable transistor radios for the beach and cars, motorbike sand scooter for increasingly mobile and independent youth culture.

== Targeting children as new consumers. ==

== Built-in obsolescence ==

=== Table showing the different types of built-in obsolescence ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Form of obsolescence !! Description !! Example
|-
| Technological || Problems due to technological advances. || A better newer phone come out with more features.
|-
| Postponed || When a company released old technology. || Apple revealing the iPhone 5C when they could make a better product (5S).
|-
| Physical || Wear and tear on a product, making it become broken over time. || Light bulbs/Ink cartridges.
|-
| Style || When a product become not trendy and not fashionable. || Clothes: Old football shirt/Spring-Summer-Autumn-Winder fashion.
|}

== Mass production and it's effects on employment ==

== The 'new' industrial age of high-technology production ==

== Computers in development and manufacturing of products ==

== Miniaturisation of products and components ==

== Use of smart materials and products for innovative applications ==


=== Table of smart materials and their applications ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Smart material !! What is it? !! Applications !! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
| Smart Glass || When a voltage is applied the colour changes to white for privacy. || Used in windows for skylights ||
* Controls the amount of heat passing through the window/glass
* Gives privacy
* Gives protection from UV rays
|| 
* Expensive installation
* Speed of control
* Requires a constant supply of electricity.
* Degree of transparency
|-
| Shape memory alloys (SMAs) || This is a metal alloy that can be deformed at one state, but then go back to it's default state once there is a big enough increase in temperature. An example can be seen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rrPv5AlVXg here] || Used in spectacle frames to shape around a person's head when they wear it. ||
* Super flexible
* Immediately recovers shape
* Lightweight durable
|| 
* Not breakable
* Expensive
|-
| Thermochromic pigments || This is ink that changes colour at certain temperatures. Note in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I--O1dxEKKw this example] they are using electricity to heat it up, but any form of heat would do. || Used in kettles to show when the water has boiled ||
* Works immediately
* Can be used for safety
* Nice aesthetic novelty
|| 
* Limited colour range
* Not possible to engineer specific temperatures to change at
|-
| Smart fluid/oils/grease|| A fluid who's viscosity can be altered when a magnetic field is applied. || Car suspension system. ||
* Improves handling for cars when used for suspension.
* Better faster control for cars when used for suspension.
|| 
* Expensive

== The global market place ==

== Offshore manufacturing of multinationals ==

== Local and Global production ==
There are concerns on global production on multinational economies, the quality of life, employment and the environment.

=== Advantages and Disadvantages of global manufacturing in developing countries ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
| Increased employment. || Increased pollution and waste production as a result of manufacturing activities.
|-
| Improved living standards and staff are then trained to be multi-skilled. || Destruction of local environment.
|-
| Helps the infrastructure of the local environment develop. || Lower wages than workers in developed countries.
|-
| Allows foreign currencies to be bought in these countries. || Promotion restrictions.
|-
| Advancement of technology like internet banking. || No unions for equal rights.
|-
|  || Low safety standards.
|-
|  || Re-valuing tradition craft skills, being swapped with tedious tasks.
|-
|  || Local community become dependant upon everyone else.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Compositing using blue screen and green screen / Chroma key ==
This is a way for actors to be imposed onto a separate piece of film. This can be used if the real event would have been too dangerous, or would need a large budget.

This effect is created by having two separated pieces of film. One where there is an actor in the foreground standing in front of a green/blue back ground, the other piece of film will be filmed or computer generated. Software then removes the green/blue background from the foreground image, reveling the background behind.

It consists of four layers:
* Background
* Foreground
* White silhouette
* Black silhouette

The white and black silhouettes act as a layer mask for the foreground, one colour will represent the area of the foreground to keep, the other colour will represent the area of the foreground to delete.

One problem with green screen is that you can't have green on the actor, similarly, actors can't wear blue in front of blue screen. This is why there are two main colours of back drop, but it does mean people can't wear blue and green without getting another backdrop colour. 

== Computer-generated graphics (CGI) ==
Computer-generated graphics are now common in most films; they are used to create effect that would have otherwise been impossible. CGI can be combined with film footage (most likely through the use of a Chroma key) to create extreme special effects which makes for an excellent piece of final footage. 

Computer-generated graphic animation are created through the following steps:
* A [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire-frame_model wire-frame] of model is created; this is a series of lines that connect up the points/corners of a model.
* Faces are then added that lie in-between the connected points of the wire-frame.
* Colour and textures are then added to the faces of the model.
* A skeleton can then be added inside the model, this will warp the points of the geometry making for easier animation.
* Lighting is then added to the scene which affects the look of the geometry/model.
* A camera is then added to the scene as a way to view the scene from.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame Key-framing] is then used; this where you place things in the scene and you save the state and time, you then move the object and the time and save again, the computer will then add a smooth transition from the first state to the last state over the given time.

! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
| The direct of the footage can chose the angle in which it is shot from, where as in reality, there would be certain angles that would be difficult. || Costs a lot of money to buy good enough hardware for the computer that will be good enough to render and process the data.
|-
| Many possibilities come from the fact that objects can be rotated. || Requires highly skilled staff that know how to use the software and create a good animation.
|-
| Can eliminate the need for green-screen in certain cases which would save a lot of time. || The software and hardware will become out of date quickly, which requires you the company to spend more money.
|-
| Features of a person can be changed digitally: costumes, make-up, body size and age. || 
|-
| People can blend into the background || 
|-
| Lighting can be added to the scene ||

=== Motion Capture ===
{{multiple image

}}
Motion capture is when people where camera can track their location as they move; this is achieved by them standing in a room full of sensors that pick up tracking nodes in their suit. This is useful for obtaining a digital accurate representation of reality in an animation. Sportsmen and women have found this useful for tracking their movements in their sport and observing their technique to look for problem in their technique&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture#Methods_and_systems&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Rotoscoping ===
Rotoscoping is where film is recorded, and then it is then traced over, frame by frame to create a pictorial representation of the footage. Previously, this would have been done by hand, but more recently computer graphics have replace the tedious task&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscoping&lt;/ref&gt;. Rotoscoping can be used to give the newly created footage a distinct look to it.

==Data Transmission==
{{Dbox|[[wiktionary:Data Transmission|Data Transmission]]|Movement of data from one place to another}}
===Serial Data Transmission===
{{Dbox|[[wiktionary:Serial Data Transmission|Serial Data Transmission]]|Single bits are sent one after another along a single data channel}}
Data is created by changes in a voltage in a circuit which is then sent down one wire. For one-way communication a single signal wire is needed but additional wires may be needed for grounding. For two-way communication two signal wires are required, one for each direction. This method is usually used long distance, for example, transatlantic data transmission. The idea being that the setup would be cheaper as there would only be one wire to set up that handles the data. As the data is on one channel, and data is lost over the distance it travels, it is easier to recover the original signal.

===Parallel Data Transmission===
{{Dbox|Parallel Data Transmission|Bits are sent down several data channels simultaneously}}
Parallel data is preferred for short distance data transmission because the amount of data that can be sent is greater than serial data transmission. However in long range transmission, the data along a wire could get distorted by the voltages from the other wires '''parallel''' to the wire. This problem is known as skew. Another reason it is not used over long distances is that the cost of cabling is very high as many wires are required.

==Baud rate, bit rate, bandwidth, latency==
===Baud Rate===
{{Dbox|Baud rate|The rate at which signals on a wire may change}}

Baud Rate is the rate at which signals on a wire may change. This means that in a second, a signal could change a number of times which is recorded as the baud rate. AQA define the baud rate as '''the number of signal changes per second'''. Therefore, '''1 baud''' is defined as '''one signal change per second'''. Units for baud rate are '''per second''' ('''/s''')

===Bit Rate===
{{Dbox|Bit Rate|The number of bits transmitted per second. }}

Bit rate is measured in '''bits per second''' (also written as '''bps''' or '''bits/second'''. It measures the number of bits that are sent down a channel per second. Baud and bit rate can be different but when the bit rate is equal to the baud rate, one bit is sent between consecutive signal changes. For example, if you had a dripping water tap, the bit rate and baud rate would be equal for that tap because there is a consecutive change between the tap dripping and water not dripping assuming that the tap would only drip one drop at a time.

  To calculate bit rate, use the equation:
  
    '''Bit rate = Bits per signal × baud rate'''
  
  This can be proven by looking at the units. 
  
    '''bits/second = bits × 1/second'''

===Bandwidth===
{{Dbox|Bandwidth|The range of signal frequencies that a transmission medium may transmit}}
There is a '''direct relationship between bit rate and bandwidth''' that you must know . They are directly proportional. '''The greater the bandwidth, the higher the bit rate'''. The bandwidth is usually double the bit rate so the relationship can be seen as '''2:1''' as a ratio.

===Latency===
{{Dbox|Latency| Time delay between the moment something is initiated and the moment its effect begins.}}

In the context of data communications and electronics, latency is the time that is taken for data to be transmitted from the sender to the receiver. For example, when you're surfing the internet and you make a request, the time that it takes for your request to reach the server is the latency.

==Asynchronous data transmission==
{{Dbox|Asynchronous data transmission| The sender and receiver are not permanently synchronised. Instead, start bits and stop bits are used to temporarily synchronise the sender and receiver. }}
=== Start and stop bits ===
====Start Bit====
A start bit is used to signal the arrival of data and to temporarily synchronise the transmitter and receiver.

====Stop Bit====
A stop bit is a character in asynchronous data transmission that lets a receiver know that the byte being sent has ended. Stop bits are very important because this is the way most of our information is sent across the internet. Without a stop bit is possible that a receiving computer will likely prompt an error as it may take in unintended data if the end of the intended data is not given.

Example:

data being sent - 001100

the receiving computer gets this information but does not receive any information to know when to stop reading incoming data and so it will keep reading incoming signals until the program crashes

data received - 00110010101001011001......

== Odd and even parity ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;float: right; text-align: center; margin: 1em;&quot;
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | 7 bits of data&lt;br /&gt;(number of 1s)

|-
| 1101001 (4) || '''0'''1101001 || '''1'''1101001
|-
| 1111111 (7) || '''1'''1111111 || '''0'''1111111
|}
A ''parity bit'' is a bit that is added to ensure that the number of bits with the value 1 in a set of bits is odd or even. Parity bits are used in the simplest form of error detecting.  For example, if a signal starts of with 3 occurrences of 1 it is in odd parity, once it arrives at its destination and only has 2 occurrences of 1 then the receiver knows there is a problem and will ask for the data to be re-sent

There are two variants of the parity bit, '''odd''' and '''even'''. 

When using ''even parity'', the parity bit is set to 1 if the number of 1s in a set of bits (not including the parity bit) is odd, making the entire set of bits (including the parity bit) even.  For example 1001 0110 (4 bits = even)

When using ''odd parity'', the parity bit is set to 1 if the number of 1s in a set of bits (not including the parity bit) is even, making the entire set of bits (including the parity bit) odd. For example 1000 0110 (3 bits = odd)

In other words, an even parity bit will be set to &quot;1&quot; if the number of 1s + 1 is even, and an odd parity bit will be set to &quot;1&quot; if the number of 1s +1 is odd.

=== Error detection ===

If an odd number of bits (including the parity bit) are transmitted incorrectly, the parity bit will be incorrect and therefore shows an error occurred during transmission. Parity bits can only be used to detect errors, they cannot correct any errors as there is no way to determine which specific bit has been corrupted. The data must be scrapped and re-transmitted.

== Handshaking ==
{{Dbox|Handshaking| An exchange of signals between two devices.}}

It is usually a process that takes place when a computer is about to communicate with a foreign device to establish rules for communication. When a computer communicates with another device like a modem or a printer it needs to handshake with it to establish a connection. Much like humans greet each other by a handshake to establish a connection. 

Handshaking may be used to negotiate parameters that are acceptable to equipment and systems at both ends of the communication channel, including, but not limited to, information transfer rate, coding alphabet, parity, interrupt procedure and other protocol or hardware features.

Handshaking makes it possible to connect relatively heterogeneous systems or equipment over a communication channel without the need for human intervention to set parameters. One classic example of handshaking is that of '''modems''', which typically negotiate communication parameters for a brief period when connection is first established, and thereafter use those parameters to provide optimal information transfer over the channel as a function of its quality and capacity.

A typical handshaking process follows the following steps:
# Sending device checks if receiving device is connected and ready to receive
# Sending device informs the receiving device it is sending
# Receiving device confirms that it has received
# Receiver indicates that it is ready to receive again

{{Dbox|Protocol|a set of agreed signals, codes and rules which is used for communication across a network consisting of computers and peripherals}}

== Baseband ==
Baseband is a transmission medium used for a network over short distances. Usually, a network is used between several computers so data is sent simultaneously. However, a baseband system only allows one station to be sent at a time. It offers high performance for low cost.

{{Dbox|Baseband|Single data signal sent at a time over the full bandwidth of the cable}}

== Broadband ==
Broadband is also a transmission medium used for a network but it is a multichannel system which combines several data channels into one so that the bandwidth of the transmission can be shared between several channels. It is mainly used for long distance communication because long-distance wires are difficult to maintain and therefore it would be wasteful to use single channel wires.

HI, I CHANGED THE PIC BUT YOU DEAR REVERED WHY? --[[User:Alborzagros|Alborzagros]] ([[User talk:Alborzagros|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Alborzagros|contribs]]) 13:56, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:It appears the contributor felt &quot;eraser&quot; would not be understood outside of the US. This is incorrect (it is used in the UK) and also is not an appropriate reason to revert or place or {{tlx|Query}} tag. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 15:39, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
::Actually, at times, it is not that easy to make understand for small kids what an eraser is, as if I am not wrong, in my country, all of the little kids do not know what an eraser is, but they do know &quot;Rubber&quot;. So, it is quite possible for many other kids in the way the Query was raised. Danke.

:I was the contributor.  I tend to overuse the Query template because it's often the only one I remember without having to search through all the templates for a more suitable one.  I just felt that eraser is an Americanism.  I'm sure most British adults understand it but I'm not so sure about kids plus rubber is more universal even if a few people here and there might know eraser.  I placed the Query tag on the page but I didn't revert anything??--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:39, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:OK, now I understand after having looked at the page history.  I only wanted to suggest that there might be more appropriate objects - there was no requirement to change.  The author of the book can choose whatever words he/she wishes. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:43, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:Actually, I reverted in error I believe.
I had checked, but the page somehow was not showing the new pic. I just was thinking of adding my comments.
Apologies for the erroneous reversion. Danke. [[User:Harrybrowne1986|Vishal]][[User Talk:Harrybrowne1986| Bakhai]] - [[Special:Contributions/Harrybrowne1986|Works]][[Image:Flag_of_India.svg|15px]] 19:29, 19 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Genetically Modified (GM) Wood ==
Genetically modified trees are trees where the genes of the tree have been manipulated to yield high amount of wood pulp. This process involves inserting good characteristics from one plant, in the form of a gene, to another plant. This results in:
* Quicker growth of trees to keep up with the high demand.
* Better resistance to disease and insect attacks, allowing for a better quality final product&lt;ref&gt;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1007408811726#page-1&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Reducing the strength of ligning fibres, allowing for the pulping process to be easier.
* Trees can be grown with a specific pigment or colour.

== Biodegradable polymers ==
Biodegradable polymers are plastics that are made from renewable raw materials meaning that they will decompose over time in a natural environment. What's breaking down the polymers? Mirco-organisms break down the molecular structure of the polymers, making it better for the environment. There are two types of biodegradable polymers, fully-biodegradable and semi-biodegradable&lt;ref name=&quot;BioPolyVideo&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lMaAQwyV-M&lt;/ref&gt;. An example of a fully-biodegradable polymer is: Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), goes by the trade name Biopol. Examples of semi-biodegradable polymers are: Polycaprolactones (PCLs), Polylactide (PLA) and Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHBs). Note: you don't need to remember the names of those biodegradable polymers for the exam.

=== Biopol ===
Biopol is a trade name of a British company for Polyhydroxybutyrate, a type of Polyhydroxyalkanoates.

Biopol is made from carbohydrates and sugar, these are then left to ferment over time. From that, there will be a useful polymer extracted; that is then sent to the factory to be shaped into a product shape like a bottle. After the product is at the end of its life, it's thrown to decompose in a compost heap; this compost is then used to fertilize the new carbohydrates to allow the cycle to repeat&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icbp.com.my/images/lifecycle2.bmp&lt;/ref&gt;.

Decomposition will only occur when the polymer is exposed to the natural micro-organisms found within soil, sewage, rivers and other environments similar to that.The rate of degradation is dependant on how thick the material is and the amount of micro-organisms that are present. This material is useful as it will decompose in a landfill site, making it not take up space for a long period of time.

=== Innocent eco-bottle ===
Iccocent bottles are known for being environmentally friendly. Their bottles are made from polylactic acid (PLA) which are made from corn starch.
Advantages of PLA over PET/HDPE:
* This is made from a renewable resource, rather than non-renewable resources like oil.
* No greenhouse gases are produced in the making of the bottle, a totally-carbon neutral process.
* PLA is biodegradable meaning that it will break down easily and relatively quickly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Communication Model and Network ==
=== Abstract ===
In this chapter, we lay the basics in communication model and network, so that readers have a big picture in mind when we go on to study the components of communication. First we introduce the Shannon-Weaver model of communication. Secondly, we introduce a network, including relevant concepts and definitions, performance measure, etc.

=== Abbreviations and Acronyms ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

Communication is a very broad subject. It involves the information to be shared, the means to do so (such as talking, composing a melody, texting), the mechanism of error correction, and so on so forth. In this book, we refer to communication in an engineering sense: communication is the process of transmitting information. To study communication, it is essential to simplify the process of communication to an easily understandable model, and quantify the components. In [2], Shannon and Weaver developed a very well-known model of communication that has since taken after their names. This model contains six major components:

# Information source, which produce a message;
# Transmitter, which converts the message into forms that are suitable for transmission: an e-mail, for instance, translate a message into a digital stream of ‘1’s and ‘0’s that can be sent via internet;
# Channel, through which the message is conveyed. It could be a physical connection, like a landline, or a logical one, like one you establish when you call someone and they pick up;
# Receiver, which reconstruct the original message from the transmitted data;
# Destination, where the message arrives; 
# Noise source, a dysfunctional, yet important element of communication: it interferes with the data during transmission and makes it difficult to reconstruct the original message.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As readers may already noticed, there are one or two sentences under each chapter's title. It briefly summarize the content of said chapter, so readers have a general idea of what they are getting into when click in.

The background section, as the name indicates, is a supplementary section for look-ups. There's no need to finish the section before entering the main body of this textbook. Rather, when you get stuck on a new term or find a concept blurry in memory, then open this chapter and look up for a definition, example or explanation. An alternative way is to seek explanation from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The articles will be longer, sure, but more elaborate and rigorous due to mass review and edition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Random Variable ==
In [[w:probability and statistics|probability and statistics]], a '''random variable''', '''aleatory variable''' or '''stochastic variable''' is a [[w:Variable (mathematics)|variable]] whose value is subject to variations due to chance (i.e. [[w:randomness|randomness]], in a mathematical sense).

== Mutual Independence ==
In probability theory, to say that two events are independent means that the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Similarly, two random variables are independent if the realization of one does not affect the probability distribution of the other.

      <comment>/* Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) */ Turned into headings</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) ==
AMT describes the impact of computer and technology on manufacturing. This is where a computer is used at every stage of the manufacture process, meaning that it's fast, efficient and accurate.

== Quick response manufacturing (QRM) ==
QRM is where the company is one that listens to company customer demand, rather than planning on expectation that might or not happen. 

QRM uses a certain techniques to achieve the goal, such as: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_quality_management total quality management (TQM)], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_in_time_(business) just-in-time (JIT)] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_cells manufacturing cells]. The main overall goal of all of this is to increase the flexibility and responsiveness of a company&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_response_manufacturing#Supply_Chain&lt;/ref&gt;.

Cellular manufacturing (manufacturing cells) is where production teams are in cells which are dedicated to certain production lines. These teams can be quickly reallocated if user/product requirements change. This means that no access products are manufactured, only the amount that's needed&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_cells&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ideal QRM situation would be that when a product is ordered, then it is manufactured, this means the correct amount of products are manufactured.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
| Less money needed to run the factory as there aren't many raw materials and finished goods.|| Large variation in demand will cause problems if the manufacturer can't react to the high production of volume quick enough.
|-
| It's easier for them to get a good position in the market share as quick response times will attract customers. || Managing the QRM process can be difficult (managing the responsibilities of staff).
|-
| High turnover of stock levels as production systems are created on demand. || A lack of supply will make the manufacturer can problems when trying to meet customer demand.
|-
| Smaller batches are made; this means that there are lower storage costs. || Highly dependent on suppliers to react to demand.
|-
| Reducing the cost of quality by minimising waste and by giving more responsibility to production teams.|| 
|}

== Concurrent manufacturing (CM)==
Concurrent manufacturing is where one stage of a manufacturing process change be changed without altering the other stages, the other stages won't be affected. The main aim of this is to allow for changes that won't slow down other manufacturing processes. Else, these delays might cause problems such as making the product less competitive/desired. Another way to look at concurrent manufacture is that development stages overlap in certain areas, rather than the traditional stage by stage method.

Computers should be used for efficient communication between the individual teams. Computer should also be used for integrated projects and shared product development; this makes it time effective.

=== Quality function deployment (QFD) ===
[[File:A1 House of Quality.png|thumb|right|QFD House of Quality for Enterprise Product Development Processes]]
This where the customer satisfaction is incorporated into the development process before it's manufactured.

The main focus of QFD is:
* Focus on customer requirements
* Use of multi-discoplinary teamwork
::Multidisciplinary teams consist of staff from several different professional backgrounds who have different areas of expertise&lt;ref&gt;http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2008/06/19/multidisciplinary-teams/&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Comprehensive &quot;House of quality&quot; matrix
::This is used by the team to translate the user requirements into a number of targets&lt;ref&gt;http://www.impacture.com/thehouse.htm step 9&lt;/ref&gt;.

The main advantages of QFD are:
* Reduced in the time taken for the product to get to market
* Reduction in design modifications
* Reduction in cost for design and manufacturing.
* Improved product quality
* Enhanced customer satisfaction.

== Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) ==
[[File:FMS1 small.JPG|thumb|right|Training FMS with learning robot SCORBOT-ER 4u, workbench CNC Mill and CNC Lathe]]
This is where multiple machines are linked together, this saves the process of a human moving them from one to another. This is different to a normal production line as it has the ability to move a variety of objects.

To achieve this, it can use:
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control computer numerical control (CNC)]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics Robotics]
[[File:CNC Plasma Cutting.ogv|thumb|centre|Plasma Cutting, CNC]]

There are two categories of FMS&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_manufacturing_system&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Machine flexibility
::The system's ability to adapt to new products, and the system's ability to change the order of operations.
* Routing flexibility
::The system's ability to perform many task at the same time, as well as the system's ability to adapt the amount of products needed (volume/order size).

FMS can vary in complexity and size, here are two examples:
* It can be highly flexible and produce large amounts of different parts, but only in small batches
* It can produce one single complete product in large batches.

=== Advantages of FMS&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_manufacturing_systems#Advantages&lt;/ref&gt; ===
* Increased production due to automation.
* Shorter lead times (The time taken for a product to get to market).
* Lower labour costs due to automation.
* Higher production quality as it's done my machines rather than humans (avoid human error).

=== Disadvantages of FMS&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_manufacturing_systems#Disadvantages&lt;/ref&gt; ===
* High cost to implement
* Requirement of skilled labour.

==&quot;With Norm&quot;==

&quot;With Norm&quot;. Time: 2000s. Place: Montreal, Canada. 

&quot;With Norm&quot; text at ?

At his apartment, Norman, a 30-year-old mentally handicapped man subject to seizures, receives the visit from Frank, in charge from social services of following his progress. Norm informs him he has a new friend, whom has calls &quot;Batman&quot; while he is &quot;Robin&quot;. In turn, Frank informs him that he is on the short list of obtaining a supervised apartment, at which Norm makes no comment. When Frank asks him whether he has taken his medication and has received rent-money from his sister, Nancy, he is too distracted to answer. Despite his handicaps, he is in the habit of helping out a neighbor in the apartment building, Tonie, a 60-year-old woman afflicted with right-sided hemiplegia. Nevertheless, he angers her one day by bringing over French fries instead of the mashed potatoes that are easier for her to digest. They receive the happy news that Nancy is pregnant. She insists on informing their parents of this by telephone during day-time hours although more expensive than during the evening. But now she has second thoughts on paying for her brother's apartment. She would like him to move to a smaller one. Norm does not agree, preferring, as he tells Frank, to remain in the present one because he has no place to put the extra furniture that belongs to him. He has bought with Batman's help a present for his father's birthday: a pin-up calendar of naked women. Frank is dubious about this choice, but Norm merely giggles. To reduce expenses, Batman has agreed to move in with him and pay half the rent, but this does not satisfy Nancy. At Christmas-time, Frank and Norm help Tonie out by carrying her groceries, mostly canned foods such as baked beans. Norm points out that beans make people fart and that his father is a good farter. He adds that he, too, enjoys farting. Frank gives Norm a shirt and sweater as a Christmas-gift and to Tonie he gives assorted body lotions. When alone with Norm, Frank discovers that Batman is in the habit of asking him to take out his penis and masturbate while watching pornographic films. Although Frank is concerned about this sort of behavior, Norm merely giggles. He is also concerned about his hygiene. Nancy is soon about to marry. She promises Norm and Tonie that she will wave to them while driving by on the way to the wedding. When the supervised apartment becomes available, Frank tries to convince Norm he should accept the offer, especially after discovering he has left stinking meat inside a refrigerator that no longer works, but he does not want to. His father has sworn he would never visit him again, because he likes to sit on his son's balcony to watch the Olympic Stadium at a distance, and so does he, especially at night. Norm is so upset that he falls into convulsions. Soon he discovers that his roomate has left. Often short on cash, Norm quarrels with Nancy about her wanting to enter his room to look for some. Frustrated because of money matters, she punches him. In response, he throws a chair at her. At the neighbor's apartment, to while way the time as they listen to music, Tonie proposes to show her breasts while he shows his penis. He agrees but they are interrupted by a knock on the door: Batman has returned. Despite his arrival, Norm gets into deeper financial trouble when one day he misunderstands an offer to call for personal advice over a long distance telephone call, and is now forced to pay a large sum for it. After explaining this to Frank, Norm, still easily distracted, looks for a newspaper item on another subject, but Frank, despairing that his situation will ever improve, goes away without a word.

&quot;Laurier-Station: 1,000 replies to say I love you&quot; text at ?

With two children to raise, Nathalie and Martin decide not to have any more. As they prepare to go to the clinic for Martin's vasectomy, he changes his mind. Incensed at this about-face, she decides without informing him to visit her aunt along with her younger sister, Anne-Sophie. Because of a major snow-storm, they are forced to stop on their way to Toronto at a motel in Laurier-Station, where they are welcomed by the owner, Carolanne, and her 15-year old daughter, Cassidy, in charge of the care-taking. Carolanne informs her clients that in one of the rooms there is a party attended by a group of hockey players. With great difficulty, Nathalie convinces Anne-Sophie to go with her. Alone in her room and against her sister's wishes, Anne-Sophie calls up Martin to inform him of where they are. The two sisters soon return to their room, because Anne-Sophie is sick. Nathalie is surprised on learning from Carolanne that Cassidy is pregnant. Cassidy tells them that the hockey players want the women back to play &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot;. After mother and daughter leave the room, Anne-Sophie shows her sister their mother's letters throughout the years, mostly recriminations based on half-truths against diverse companies. Nathalie is upset on learning that only Anne-Sophie, her favorite, received a letter from her before she died. She is even more upset on learning from Martin on the telephone that her sister told him where they are. She joins the party but returns with a panic-stricken Cassidy whose face is covered with blood, struck several times by her mother after being told she got an abortion. A contrite and sorrowful Carolanne pleads with Cassidy to come home. Cassidy accepts. After borrowing a vehicle from a friend, Martin arrives to take his wife and her sister back home. Nathalie's pain is considerably lessened on discovering that her mother left her a box filled with objects of sentimental value. As Carolanne prepares to head for home, Cassidy secretly calls up her father to take her away.</text>

=== Is HCI really the most visible part of computer science?===

*Paradigm of windows, menus, icons, and mouse pointing
*New mobile and virtual trends
*Early work on office contexts
*HCI pervades every field/discipline from daily interfaces like an online banking system to highly specialized like cockpits and surgery
*Methods: experimental  quant through context-sensitive qualitative
*HCI has become a primary test- bed for two broad innovations in design methods, participatory design and ethnographically driven design.
*HCI is young
*Needs to be multidisciplinary—ergo renaissance oriented

====GOLDEN AGE?====
*originally a joining of software engineering and human-factors engineering.
*Waterfall development crisis in 70s- linear model of dev
*PC came about crash with design methodology not suitable for systems development that was user oriented .  maybe in the past this had not been as necessary because systems were not as widespread and only used by elites who had the time and ability to cope with systems shortfalls.
*Cognitive science and theory of mind?XXX
*Card moran and newell GOMS model-from thoughts to behavior, prior human factors models did not seek to integrate and/or explain the human micro components—mind, thoughts, behavior
====Cognitive science foundation====
*1985 newells’ chi address provoked 
*I would argue even before that you could sense the boiling over of a need for a unified concern in this multidisciplinary science…  from cybernetics wiener’s, systems theory to [ADDRESS ABOUT FUTURE OF COMPUTERS] in the mid 20th century there was already a sense that computers were going to be important and widespread enough that there needed to be a concern with the future and how to effectively integrate them in human society
*Newell’s vision implicitly marginalized this work, motivating the emergence of alternative cognitive-science paradigms.
*Situatedness - Suchman’s (1987) study of photocopier use de- scribed a variety of usability problems with advanced photocopier-user inter- faces. She considered the interaction between the person and the machine as a sort of conversation that frequently fails because the participants do not under- stand one another.
*Study as critique – roots on derrida’s desconstructionism?
*Uchman brought field-study concepts, techniques, and sensibilities from anthropology, ethnomethodology, and sociology, and she applied them to a real problematic situation of human-computer interaction.
*Internationalization of hci thanks to International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) conferences held in Europe, and by initiatives within major computer companies.
*Bødker’s (1991) application of activity theory to HCI. Russian vigotsky beginnings, Marxist foundations, culture, tools, cooperation
*Historical Factors (source of ideas) in development of theory in HCI:
#differentiation within the original cognitive-science community of HCI. (distancing from GOMS)
#growing multidisciplinary constituency of cognitive science itself.
#Internationalization
#technology
#pc, networks
	
*future unsuspected, current challenges, multidisciplinarity has brought about 
#fragmentation, making up of camps
#tension between depth and breadth in scientific expertise
#researchers and practitioners
#it has been supplanted by a more interactive view in which practice plays a more central role in articulating requirements for theory and technology and in evaluating their efficacy in application

*my sense is we are ever more driven toward producing practical/applied knowledge
#the mediocrization of the field--- external factors such as schedule, budget, and compatibility with standard solutions often prevail, no understanding of underlying theoretical aspects and not following exigencies of methodologies to address validity and veracity questions
#Carroll indicates the need for synthesizing a comprehensive and coherent methodological framework
#need to remain educated, lifelong learner model

*A 1988 Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) task force enumerated HCI as one of nine core areas of the computer-science discipline (Denning et al., 1989). And a joint curriculum task force of the ACM and the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) recommended the inclusion of HCI as a common requirement in computer-science programs (Tucker &amp; Turner, 1991).  While this was recommended, even now we only see it made a requirement for a subset of Computer Science tracks in undergraduate education.  For example, at the University of Iowa the Informatics track has a Human Computer Interaction course requirement but the Computer Science track does not.  (University of Iowa Computer Science Department, accessed 2014).  This recommendation did not migrate to computer engineering curriculums which can cause a disconnect between professionals on what is necessary to overall software development.  (University of Iowa Electrical and Computer Engineering Undergradate tracks, accessed 2014.)
*inaccessibility of advanced-level ma- terials on HCI science and theory.  This could be mitigated if there were a more centralized sphere to the research-meaning if HCI could publish in it's own journal and conferences, that a professional organization maintained and put effort into combining the works of various researchers and practioners.  In mathematics, two main professional associations are the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) and the American Mathematical Society (AMS).  While these two organizations do not necessarily capture all mathematical research, they do capture large segments (the MAA is considered by some for the more pure and the AMS for the more applied) of mathematical research and teaching.  If HCI were to follow this example, even as fragmented and multidisciplinary as the field is, we could see increased access to knowledge and materials on HCI science and theory.

===What's a Model (Sivabalan Umapathy)===
====A step before the Models====

Computing has spread rapidly into everyday life. Even before personal computing was pushed to the forefront by smart personal devices, people had been interacting with machines in a micro scale. Systems such ATM machines, ticket vending machines, printers with displays were providing micro interactions. Those interactions were smaller, sparsely used and task focused. Due to these reasons it was either easy to design or the users did not care to complain.

Carroll notes that the traditional waterfall method prevented a user oriented design approach, resulting in ill designed software interfaces. And the actors involved in the waterfall method overlooked the importance of the HCI. This oversight cannot be attributed to the project owners, rather should be attributed to the methodology. A careful look at the companies who employed human oriented design (such as Xerox) will help us to understand where root cause of the issue.  

Companies which were selling mass consumer machines adhered to the basic principle of &quot;Making it Simple&quot;. They had clear driving factors to make it simple. For instances Xerox doesn’t want a loaded customer support or a fleet of technicians servicing the machines. Something made simple had a direct effect on the business, hence a visible ROI existed. Thus people had a direct business case to justify the user based research.

But not all software systems had such a driving business case. For instance, an e-commerce site's business model (such as lack of support, after sales service etc) lacked the strength to impose a compelling business case. This problem is very similar to that of an ATM machine or ticket vending machine. In both the cases, unsatisfied customer's had no sway on the business.

This highlights the need to have &quot;Cases&quot; for HCI. A case is a high level goal and should be measurable. For instance measurable outcomes such as efficiency, reduction of support apparatus etc. form a good case. Qualitative outcomes such as user satisfaction or reduction of cognitive load can only serve as a starting point for the case. For example reducing the cognitive load to enable all spectrum of users is measurable case.

Clearly defining these cases helps one to draw up the boundaries on the breadth of the focus required.

====Model as a guiding force====

Once the cases are defined, a designer needs a way to translate those goals to deliverable. 
 
So, how were they normally approached in the past? Most of the past interfaces were defined on &quot;engineering hunches&quot;, while some were designed by artists. The translating principles applied by the engineers were totally different from the ones created my media designers. Both lacked the perfection.
The situation can be best summarized as blind folded people left to find a path in a forest. 

The first help here comes in the form of Human factor principles. It can be said that the human factor principles were the founding fathers of the HCI principles. However they were too abstract to convert them into practice. Only leading practitioners (Such as Alan Cooper, Don Norman) could successfully translate them into implementation. While principle is one thing, applying these principles in context is another. 

Cult of skeuomorphism in iOS and the later shakeup to tear it apart is an excellent example to demonstrate the principle-context gap. Skeuomorphism is supposed to evoke a positive emotion and help to recall a familiar mental model.  Applying them in a modern context or design interactions (such as rolodex) does not deliver the right solution for the applied context.  

This gap between principles and applied context resulted in non standard methodologies.

A model fills this gap. It guides the designer to translate the goals to design. It provides a uniform way to apply principles to context. Model can be used as a communication tool for reviewing and validating the design. HCI Researchers (not usability evaluations) can use a model to define the factors of the system they are studying.

===Inclusive multidisciplinary of HCI is a strength, not a weakness (Amara Poolswasdi)===

Because of the expansion of human-computer interaction and its scientific foundations, it is challenging to attain the breadth of working knowledge but certainly not impossible. The scope of HCI is quite broad, but as a multidisciplinary field that is to be expected. When this type of scope is applied with great multiplicity to all of the fields of study it touches, it may seem particularly overwhelming the volume of theories, methods, application domains, and systems. However, these are all tools and perspectives by which to interpret and analyze the value of HCI across disciplines. It is not meant to be limiting in scope, overwhelming by volume, or paralyzing by nature -- these theories and models are all different ways to interpret and understand the same problem. 

As HCI continues maturing as an academic field of study, the scientific foundations will continue expanding. The concept of fragmentation should not be embraced by current academics and practitioners of HCI. It is in our nature to understand and synthesize this information, and the practical fragmentation of this field achieves the opposite intended effect. 

At the practitioner level and the academic level, there will naturally be quite a bit of fragmentation. That is a necessary byproduct of specialization. It is the responsibility of the individual practitioners and academics, in collaboration with those in leadership roles, to provide an environment by which a holistic HCI perspective still permeates the underpinnings of our field while allowing for differentiation and specialization. This is a practical application of Gestalt theory, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 

===Is the framework “Computer as Human, Human as Computer” able to explain all our behaviors in everyday tasks? (Wei-Ting Yen)===

====Everyday tasks VS. Non-everyday tasks====

Most tasks we do in daily life are routine and only require little thought and planning, such as brushing teeth, taking shower, and watching TV.  They are usually done relatively quickly, often simultaneously with other activities because neither time nor mental resources may be available.  Thus, in most cases the everyday activities are actually done ''subconsciously''.  On the other hand, non-everyday activities, such as computing income tax, learning new software, and making complex online shopping, are done ''consciously'' and usually require considerable mental processing efforts. Therefore, it can be found that the tasks most frequently studied by HCI researchers are non-everyday tasks.

====Conscious behavior VS. Subconscious behavior====

The exact relationship between conscious and subconscious thought is still under great debate.  The resulting scientific puzzles are complex and not easily solved.  Norman (2002) explained the differences between the two.  He believed subconscious thought matches patterns because it operates by finding the best possible match of one’s past experience to the current one.  It proceeds rapidly and automatically without efforts, so it is good at detecting general trends, at recognizing the relationship between what we now experience and what has happened in the past.  People can make predictions about the general trend based on few examples.  However, Norman also found that subconscious thought could be biased toward regularity and structure.  It may not be capable of symbolic manipulation and of careful reasoning through a sequence of steps.

Conscious thought is quite different.  Norman believed that the conscious thought tends to be slow and labored.  People use conscious thought to ponder decisions, compare choices, rationalize decisions, and find explanations.  Accordingly, formal logic, mathematics, decision theory are the tools of conscious thought.  However, Norman pointed out that conscious thought is severely limited by the small capacity of short-term memory.

Conscious and subconscious modes of thought are not against each other.  Instead, Norman believed that they are both powerful and essential aspects of human life.  Both can provide insightful leaps and creative moments.  And both are subject to errors, misconceptions, and failures.

===Similarities and Differences between Models and Theories (Daniel Giranda)===
Both &quot;Model&quot; and &quot;Theory&quot; are common terms when discussing HCI (Human Computer Interaction) and while both are used in similar ways, they are not the same. In order to more accurately communicate an idea, these terms should not be used interchangeably. I agree with the assessment outlined in session 2.

====Similarities====
Both Models and theories are used to get a better understanding of observable phenomena. While the methods might be different in the process and in scale, models and theories can be tested, expounded, improved and debunked. Both can be used in multiple fields. More often than not models and theories have practical uses or can be translated into a practical use. The two are also predictive tools that can allow one to have an idea of an outcome before it has been observed.

====Differences====
In HCI design, models are used to guide the creation of an interface, this guide is often less technical than a theory is. One common model outside of HCI would be the blueprint used in the construction of a house. While there is certainly a technical and scientific approach to a model there are other aspects used in its creation. A model will take into account certain human factors such as psychological, socio-technical, and collaboration more than most theories will. Models are often more limited in scope than a theory will be.

Theories are different in that they need to be tested repeatedly, they are bound by science and scientific theory to explain phenomena. The amount of human elements included are limited. They are less concerned with graphical models and more with raw data to prove a point. All theories considered credible in the scientific world are peer reviewed and tested multiple times to produce the same results. This causes theories to be harder than models to change or modify since there is a rigorous process involved in proving a theory.

===Technology's Affect on Model Development (Zack Stout)===
The history of HCI presented by the chapter discusses the growth of HCI theories from the 1970s to the 1990s. In the 1970s, Carroll states that software development had stagnated under the waterfall model, with human factors also facing difficulties. This led directly to the initial golden age of HCI studies. 

Carroll attributes this golden age to the idea that computing was in trouble, and needed the multidisciplinary approach to overcome this crisis. This initial approach had the main goal of bringing cognitive science to computer software development. 

Carroll goes on to list the developments of the 1980s, listing four major areas increasing the knowledge of HCI. The first was the increased usage of cognitive science to explain abductive reasoning, learning by exploration, and development of mental models. The second area mentioned was the multidisciplinary focus of HCI research. The third was increased internationalization. The last area is actually the most interesting. The fourth area is the increase in technology, both in capability and proliferation. 

====Increase of Technology Leads to Increase in Models====
Carroll doesn’t get into the details of what brought the multidisciplinary approach to HCI about. Perhaps instead of the increase of technology being relegated to the sidelines, it should be thought of as the catalyst of the involvement of other disciplines. As technology proliferated, it became easier for other disciplines to become involved with computer interaction. This is evidenced by the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, and then the Internet in the 1990s. At the same time, the cost of computers decreased, allowing for more people to purchase them. This led to the involvement of people outside the direct area of computer science (CS).   As more non-CS computer users got involved with computers, the difficulties became more apparent. This led to the increased development and incentive to develop models for HCI.

===Fragmentations Benefits Outweigh any Negatives (Tyler Liechty)===
The Fragmentation of HCI (Human Computer Interface) is attributable to the growth of knowledge and theories as noted by Carroll. As noted, with the over-abundance of theories comes difficulty in maintaining a comprehensive knowledge of HCI. It is noted as a downside in the growth of the field. For a comprehensive knowledge of any field to be feasible the field has to be static and discrete. With a young field such as HCI this is an unreasonable expectation. Carroll notes specifically in the last paragraph of section 1.3 that ‘fragmentation is a threat to future development’. It would seem that any efforts to prevent this fragmentation would be more harmful than the fragmentation. 

With each new group of ‘immigrants’ to HCI comes another set of use cases and practitioners to expand the scope of HCI and to further test the theories. To see this as a detriment to the field would undermine the new users as a source of further refinement of the theories. This may lead to many ‘quick and dirty’ ethnographies, but provides a large source of data to analyze the theories that are being applied. This fragmentation can enable the other broad principle of HCI, participatory design. Without this fragmented and sometimes insulated development of similar theories, practitioners may not be able to apply as readily the theories of HCI, and will not produce the data to confirm the quality of the theories.

===Real Costs of HCI Fragmentation (Richard Lee)===
Carroll’s material on the scientific fragmentation of HCI in the 80’s, 90’s, and 00’s was informative, but it would be a mistake to view the trend in the past tense. The fragmentation has in no way diminished, and has instead become further institutionalized and must be met with ever more passionate evangelism. 

The hard fact is that fervor without facts has little impact on the annual budget, yet the evidence one might present to justify the effort, time and expense of both HCI research and implementation of subsequent product improvements is itself time consuming and expensive to produce.  

I would argue that modern advances in both real user monitoring and in behavioral metrics through both the gathering of applicable user-driven data and its analysis should be heavily leveraged in driving forward the justification for the continued application and evolution of HCI models and theories. 

The argument is often made that ‘good enough’ is sufficient when bringing a product to market, yet regardless of the scope of use (not every example is a downed plane or a raging nuclear reactor) the improvement of the users’ experience via the human/computer interface is guaranteed to have a positive net impact for the organizations who choose to invest in such efforts.  

Direct revenue is of course a primary driver and metric in determining the feasibility of HCI research and application, but other factors are in play. Consumer confidence in both specific products and in companies as a whole is at stake.  

WIth the proliferation of software and hardware choices and their integration into our daily lives becoming more complete every day, a user’s interaction with a small, seemingly insignificant member of a much larger family of products can determine the likelihood of further adoption. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias Negativity bias] combined with the one-to-many aspects of social media and broadcast entertainment on-air and online can lead to instances where one user’s [http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=6335 negative experience] literally determines the success of a product or company in the marketplace.  

Of course, it’s important to remember that [http://www.nomensa.com/blog/2012/positive-ux-optimal-user-experience-is-more-than-the-absence-of-usability-issues/ there’s more to improving interaction than simply addressing usability issues], but those of us willing to take on the challenge of advancing the state of humanity’s relationship with technology are those best positioned to continue combating the fragmentation in our multifaceted field of science.</text>

Hi, good job so far with the book.  Here at Wikibooks we add categories to the main page of the book (e.g. A German language book will be filed under ''Languages'').  Individual pages of the book don't have categories except that we add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{bookcat}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the bottom of every page.  This puts the page into a ''category'' for that book.  You will have noticed that I have added this to the bottom of pages you recently created.  It's really helpful if you add them to the bottom of any pages you create.  If you have any questions just ask or leave a message in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:30, 22 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

: Why do you think people make and use these sort of templates? [[WB:BITE|Newcomers]] who make an [[WB:FAITH|honest mistake]] are more likely to stick around when treated with kindness and patience, and from learning about what they can do over an approach that can cause anxiety about making future mistakes. People here to joke around probably aren't going to be convinced to stop by any warning. Something to think about. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:47, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

::Frankly the only reason I believe these kind of templates need to be made are due to the reason of the recent vandal increase. I have been seeing that in Wiki also lots of vandals are there. And many have started to do the same here. Agreed that Newcomers should be dealt in good manner, and that is why I made a Template called [[Template:Thank You|Thank You]] (Which I see, you have fixed for me. Thanks for that mate). The template is good for newcomers, who are doing nice things. But you just cant cope with vandals, and spammers. So there is need to be strict with them. I myself have committed mistakes, and try not to do the same thing. If one understands and does not repeat, or at least even tries to amend those wrong things done, than it is good, else, what is the use of being good with those people. Danke.

::: In the case of tests, a person may have accidentally clicked one of the edit buttons or meant to click the show preview button and accidentally clicked save instead, or they didn't know they could preview their edit. The point of being good at first is to allow for the possibility they might not repeat it when it is a mistake and informed of things like that. More often then not vandalism comes from IP addresses which means any good person who also happens to be sharing the same IP address and hasn't registered may also see any messages placed on the user discussion page. We should strive to give a good impression even when we don't understand or agree with specific actions. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:33, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

::I understand your point and agree too. However, when I stated that vandals and etc, I meant for those people who are used to doing wrong then right. Only when I see if a user or IP has done some spam, that I go ahead and issue any notice of this kind. At times it is required to be strict. Danke.

::: I think asking/telling someone to [[w:WP:BEANS|stop doing the wrong thing]] when that is all they know and are use to doing is ineffective. They may also benefit from being told about good/accepted practices, because then they know about alternatives. Do you perhaps mean people who know right from wrong, and make the choice to do wrong? By the time a person's intentions to do wrong is recognized a block is often called for, not a warning. Also, what do you mean by strict? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:38, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

::Strict as in what you just stated to go for blocking the user or IP.

::True, I meant people who know what they are doing and still doing so. Say for e.g., there was a file which was uploaded, or for even that, there was a book edited with inappropriate words, and the person or IP did that knowingly. What can be done, is I can revert the edit, but also at least warn the user (since, I do not have the access to block, like those of admins, and hence have to warn the IP or user), so that till the time an admin gets to block him/her/it, the user or IP knows that there are people watching him doing nonsense, and would try to heed off. There have been instances, where IP edits stop for say a few days, post warning, till the time the IP thinks that the air has not cooled down on it. Danke.

:Just saw the Beans stuff, and I can relate to it with my nephew who just left yesterday, and had caused god knows what not troubles for us, especially my mother. Broke the water tap, literally broke few other things, and would do all those things which are told '''not to be done'''. I do not issue warning till the time I can see that the edit or contribution, has not gone beyond control levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Engineering geology is the application of the geologic sciences to engineering practice for the purpose of assuring that the geologic factors affecting the location, design, construction, operation and maintenance of engineering works are recognized and adequately provided for. Engineering geologists investigate and provide geologic and geotechnical recommendations, analysis, and design associated with human development. The realm of the engineering geologist is essentially in the area of earth-structure interactions, or investigation of how the earth or earth processes impact human made structures and human activities.

Engineering geologic studies may be performed during the planning, environmental impact analysis, civil or structural engineering design, value engineering and construction phases of public and private works projects, and during post-construction and forensic phases of projects. Works completed by engineering geologists include; 
* Geologic hazards
* Geotechnical Investigations
* Material properties
* Landslide and slope stability
* Erosion, flooding
* Dewatering
* Seismic investigations

Engineering geologic studies are performed by a geologist or engineering geologist that is educated, trained and has obtained experience related to the recognition and interpretation of natural processes, the understanding of how these processes impact man-made structures (and vice versa), and knowledge of methods by which to mitigate for hazards resulting from adverse natural or man-made conditions. The principal objective of the engineering geologist is the protection of life and property against damage caused by geologic conditions.

Engineering geologic practice is also closely related to the practice of geological engineering, geotechnical engineering, soils engineering, environmental geology and economic geology. If there is a difference in the content of the disciplines described, it mainly lies in the training or experience of the practitioner.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We can find many things about environmental problems in greater libraries, the media, or on the Internet. Those works are generally created by professional environmentalists who know much, so we can usually get to know many facts from them, usually with references. In contrast, we base on our present knowledge instead, remind, popularize, and most importantly, search for solutions to the problems. Firstly, we should understand that the solution should be searched for in society instead of the sciences or technology, as until now, mankind lacked not the power, but the willingness, will, unity and cooperation to solve the environmental problems. The essence can be understood by all healthy people: human activities changed the planet Earth so much that it has become less and less fit for supporting life. If it continues this way, it could cause the extinction of many plant and animal species, and perhaps even of mankind, and the possible survivor people will have to live in an unpleasant environment for a long time. The opinions are different about the degree of danger and the extent of problems, so to understand these things, the works of professional environmentalists are handy.

When we understand what problems are facing us, it is worth solving them together. Science and technology could not and cannot provide solutions for all problems. They only give tools, but the tools in themselves are not sufficient to solve the environmental problems, if the will for it is not present. Could a newer technology save Earth from the usage of the weapons of mass destruction? Could a newer technology itself save us from a mad scientist? Or could technology save the endangered species from extinction in the time of great famines? Something more is needed here. It is necessary that most of the people do what is good for both the living creatures and the whole of mankind. Education about worldview and ethics can help, but the modification of the economic and political system can help even more, as most people care for environmentalism little until other ways seem to be more competitive. The environmental movement is connected to politics closely, and is trying to influence and decision-makers by votes, ideas, facts, and expert help.

There are areas where conservation and the cause of human survival help each other and there are areas where they inhibit each other. If there were no humankind, the world would probably be more natural and predictable than it is now. Humankind, however, might be able to save Earthly life from a threat from space, and they might be able to transport a part of the living world to another planet. Thus we do not know if mankind does good or wrong to the living world in the long term. We know, however, that the natural living world does good to mankind, as it provides food, knowledge and energy. Thus a part of Nature is worth saving anyway. It is sad that the natural living world loses areas more and more in the beginning of the 21st century due to human irresponsibility, and the state of the lifeless environment also differs more and more from that which proved to be sustainable through millions of years. Afterwards, the survival of mankind might be at stake. People should sometimes cooperate with and sometimes compete against each other in order to survive. Environmental agreements are examples of cooperation. There are times when it is difficult to find the form of good cooperation. In these times it may be helpful to share some environmentalist ideas that can cause evolutionary success to their implementors and are compulsive thereby.

Global climate change is probably the most famous environmental problem. It was even taught in schools and there was great news coverage about it. Politicians and environmentalists often met for attempts to solve it, and a lay person cannot add much to its science. For the completeness of this book, though, it is necessary to write something about it. If the Sun did not shine, the Earth would be cooling and cold. But the Sun is there and thanks to that, the Earth's average temperature is about at equilibrium. Sunlight heats the Earth in such a way that the Earth's energy emission and energy absorption are about equal, and this can only happen on a greater temperature of the planet than it would be if the Sun were not there. Because the Earth has an atmosphere, some heat is captured in the air instead of going back to space, and is reemitted in many directions, raising the planet's temperature needed for the equilibrium mentioned. This effect of the atmosphere is called the greenhouse effect. Now the environmental problem is that various human activities, like burning fossil fuels or clear-cutting forests, change the composition of Earth's atmosphere, for example, change the oxigene (O2) in the air to carbon dioxide (CO2), and this leads to an increased greenhouse effect and global warming (other gases go into the air too, which raise global warming in different scales, depending on the wavelengths of light they let through).

Mankind and animals use the plant material in our days much more efficiently than in the ancient times, because agriculture plants crops that have greater harvests relative to their mass. This means that a similar mass of plant material can sustain more people and animals than in the old times. More people and animals breathe more, and exhale more carbon dioxide into the air. Apart from this, people process the plant material of the past too - coal, crude oil and natural gas - and this way fossil fuels are diminishing instead of being produced. This great efficiency of mankind in processing plants leads to more people, and thereby more carbon dioxide in the air, which causes global warming through the greenhouse effect. Global warming has many threats, like that of the inland ice melting, and their water flowing into the oceans, and this raising the sea levels, and the sea flooding the areas at shore. The size of plant biomass should perhaps be increased in comparison to the animal or human biomass. So mankind should keep plants which are less and less eaten or burnt by people or animals, but at the same time, mankind should eat less meat too.

It is taught that carbon dioxide levels have increased in the atmosphere since the 19th century, and one of the noblest ways to counterweight humankind's carbon emissions is to support green areas: nature reserves, national parks, botanical gardens, urban parks, private gardens, single trees, flowers, houseplants and organic farming, and to support all the other plant-related parts of environmentalism, like vegetarianism, veganism, GMO-free food, etc. Humankind's amount of carbon dioxide emissions, however, should not only be counterweighted, but it should be decreased, too. Carbon emissions are particularly worth decreasing in those cases when the carbon emissions are unnecessary and decreasing them does not harm the environment in other ways. It is not always clear whether wastage does wrong to the environment, but it is almost sure that fuel wastage does wrong, so it would be noble to decrease it. It is also not trivial that the sparing lifestyle of one person leads to the sparing lifestyle of humankind, as it is not trivial either that a more advanced technology is more economical (Jevons Paradox). These are some reasons why it is important that we should have an advanced environmentalist theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Human activity has harmed Nature even in the antiquity, for example, many trees have been cut down and the elephants have disappeared from North Africa. But since the Industrial Revolution, the development of mankind has become so much quicker that it endangers not only Nature, but humankind itself too. In the Cold War, the opposing forces hoarded so many weapons of mass destruction that could have destroyed mankind in case of another world war. Since then, there are more and more countries which are able to create such weapons, so the danger has not ended in the beginning of the 21st century either. Afterwards, as technology advanced, newer sources of danger have appeared, for example, if someone created a virus deadly for mankind with the use of artifical intelligence and gene technology. But not only the extinction of mankind should be feared, but the rise of human suffering too. In the beginning of the 21st century we entered an age when the detrimental effects of global warming appear, the cheaper energy sources of mankind run out, the soil and freshwater run down more and more, the natural life of the oceans and primeval forests is going to lose areas more and more, human population would continue to rise and the rich get even more technological power. In human society, the mentioned problems could cause famines, maybe wars, and an economic crisis bigger than the previous ones. It is possible that the international environmentalist agreements will not be observed in the crisis, and this could make the problems more serious. Thus humankind who have gone far from Nature will probably suffer much, and even cannibalism can happen, but there is a great chance for the survival of the species. If mankind does not go extinct in the short term, small pests could cause problems in agriculture in the long term. What can we do in this situation?

We can start living more friendly to the environment, we can join to the environmental movement, and we can even be activists in order to reduce the future suffering in some degree. This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should deactivate them. It is obvious enough that the world has changed much because of mankind's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and mandkind's extravagant lifestyle. Mankind should realize sooner or later that population size should be limited, otherwise it will be limited by something worse, which comes with greater suffering. Sooner or later the irresponsible wastage, like the wastage of one-time use packaging material should be lessened to the minimum too, because it is not sustainable. For the sake of environmentalism, it would be better to lessen them sooner, and we too can make smaller steps in order to diminish them. By the way, the most important goal now is survival, and for this purpose it should be made sure that the countries which can create nuclear weapons do not use them, and people do not use other fatal technologies either, if possible. It is not enough to just disarm nuclear weapons, because people could quickly recreate them again in case of a war. Instead, such an educational and political situation should be created where the production and usage of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction becomes difficult and meaningless. Humankind should learn to forget what is worth forgetting, and it should deal with the people of Earth's different nations more and more justly.

The environmental consciousness is present in humankind, but it is a sad experience that both the private economy and the democratic politics served short-term interests, because buyers and voters have chosen the better standard of living instead of sustainability. If it goes on this way, we will probably not be able to prevent the expected crisis, and we have to take care of our own survival. We should understand what dangers are waiting for us, and how we can avoid them in our own lives. There are people who tend to prepare for a sudden, complete collapse, and their movement is called survivalism in English. They learn about emergencies much, store food and learn to use guns. There are also people who tend to prepare for a great economic crisis instead, and learn such a profession that will be needed in the crisis too. There are poorer ones who might better not beget children. There are richer people too, and they have more opportunities to prepare for the crisis. It is worth for a rich person of being surrounded by such allies whom the rich person supported before, they being grateful to the rich person. The rich person might do it well if he/she prepares to be self-sufficient and self-defensive with these people. Besides self-sufficiency, producing means of sustenance might be a way to go too. Concerning this issue, it is interesting that if someone prepares for his/her own survival, by that he/she probably helps the survival of mankind too. Because if someone prepares for the collapse, then he/she would like to reduce his/her dependent situation, and if dependence on trade lessens in the world, then the consumption which harms the environment probably lessens too.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We can find many things on Earth with which we are not satisfied. We are not satisfied that we should kill animals for food, and we are not satisfied either that we should take care of removing our defecation. We are not satisfied that society obliges us for many things, and we are not satisfied either if criminals attack us. We are not satisfied with the morality of the people, nor are we satisfied with religions that make the morality of the people better, if those religions are false. But even if we were satisfied with the Earthly world, we would not be satisfied with the consciousness that we have to die. If we are harmed by these and other imperfections of our Earthly life, and we dislike it, that means that we go closer to a life which we wish. If we want to go even closer to the happy life, the place of which may be called Heaven, then it is worth of thinking on how probable is its existence, and what can we do for making it more probable to get there.

The first world religions of history tried to answer these questions too, and it may be the cause of their success. These religions were usually built around a person who was considered infallible and possessing supernatural powers, and who taught in a new way, and whose authority has grown with the spread of the religion - and afterwards, the statements attributed to the founder were proven by authority. Such an authoritarian religion was Christianity, for example. By time, it turned out that some of its statements contradict mankind's scientific advancements. Afterwards, many people ceased to be Christian, but did not cease to like the principles which they considered good in Christianity: the humanists still liked ethics, and the deists still had faith in God. In a similar manner, we may believe that wonders are possible and we can go to Heaven. However, we can approach God by understanding, and not by blind faith. The discipline which studies the arguments for the existence of God, God's attributes and God's will, is called Natural Theology. It is called so because the source of its knowledge is Nature which existed before humankind, and not sacred texts which could have been authored by wise men too.

Here we can observe that Natural Theology and environmentalism do good to each other, because the source of the knowledge about God should be protected. We may conjecture that it is also God's will that we should protect the environment, to keep his creation as beautiful as before. If we improve this world, it would be justice for us to get to a better world. Thus protecting the environment can be one aspect of the faith in God or Heaven, and because of this, protecting the true faith in God can be one aspect of environmentalism. That is why Natural Theology deserves some space here. Natural Theology is compatible not only with environmentalism, but with other religions and science, too. Other religions can have Natural Theology as a supplementary source of faith, a subject in school, a protocol between religions, or even a spiritual movement. Science is not complete either without the study of God's possible existence. Unlike the sacred texts, the teachings of Natural Theology can grow and become more and more perfect. So Natural Theology is like science, and it can be real science if it uses the methodology of real science - which is not less, but more strict than 20th century science.

If we believe in Natural Theology but not in religions, one question may arise in us: if God exists, why did he allow and probably support so many false religions? There can be different answers to this question, for example, that the religions God supported were better than those religions beside them, or that God wanted to teach us how weak we are. It is also possible that exactly those religions lived for a long time which had the support for survival of that specific religion among their inner values, and God did support them not specifically for their ethical values. Therefore we can imagine humankind's knowledge about God as a convergent series, and the successful religions as points on that series, which help us in our personal convergence towards a proper relationship with God. If not, and we do not believe in God, Natural Theology is still good to show the progress from tradition and authority to reason and better foundations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A part of the world's wrongs derives from the immorality of people. In order to make this world better, people should be more ethical and environmentally conscious. However, the ethical and environmentally conscious people may encounter inconveniences as a result of their lifestyle, which does not make it attractive. In order to make the ethical lifestyle more attractive, many solutions have been found during the history of mankind: such are, for example, respect in society, religions, or laws which punish severely. In order to be effective, the religions' moral-forming strength may need faith, or at least deeming it probable or possible that statements of the religion are true. That is why it would probably do good to everyone if those people who do not like religions got ethical tuition.

There is a competition for survival, power and reproduction between creatures, which we could call the mover of evolution. We might think that the race of evolution is such a race which has no rules, so the theory of evolution has a detrimental effect on the morals of the people. However, even evolution is against some harmful deeds to the self: for example, smoking, drugs, or suicide. Here we should not consider smoking as if it were a crime that is not forgiven automatically, but as something which makes a person worsen more and more, and as a consequence, falls behind his/her rivals more and more.

From the beginning of our written history, humankind uses domesticated plants and tamed animals for its own goals. Humankind cares for the defense and reproduction of these plants and animals, so these creatures need not take part in the race of evolution, except for the extent that they need to win the grace of people. Thus domesticated plants and tamed animals drive their energy into the usefulness for people instead of struggle against their rivals, and this way they can survive. Around many domesticated plants, humans weed out, because the domesticated plants are that yield harvest. Many tamed animals are protected from predators by humans because tamed animals give meat, milk or eggs. Humans probably tame not only animals, but also each other, so the evolutionary race between humans is not only about struggle against one another, but about usefulness to one another as well. The community may help the individual who is more useful to it.

Humankind lives in communities, so the evolution of humans is not only about a competition between individuals but about a competition between communities, too. Inside a community, people are similar to each other, and thus helping a member of the community to reproduction is nearly as important for a human as his/her own reproduction. Evolution is about passing on the genes, the parts of the program which is responsible for the build-up of our bodies. Inside a community, the same genes are found more frequently than outside of it. People may do more for the passing on their own genes by doing something great for their community, than by begetting more children. Thus it becomes understandable that it is evolutionarily sound if a person sacrifices his/her life or his/her reproduction for the community. In the society of ants it works in such an advanced way that there are ants who never reproduce, but help the community in survival. If the community of ants came into being by evolution, then possibly there was a time when every ant could reproduce and during community life the present state evolved gradually, probably because helping the teammates was evolutionary helpful for ants even then.

Apart from the interest of a group of living creatures, there is an interest that life should survive on Earth. This started to be endangered as a result of the presence of humankind's weapons of mass destruction and humankind's extravagant lifestyle, but it has been in danger for a long time as well because of the risk of the hit of a greater asteroid coming from space. The inclination to save the entire living world presupposes intelligence, and its motivation is similar to the motivation for making a human community survive, and therefore humans are almost fit for solving their environmental problems. The desire for survival is an instinct, and intelligence deems it probable that the survival of our genes as a goal depends on the survival of some other parts of Earthly life. That is why it seems to be logical that humans make such decisions that increase the probability of life on Earth persisting longer. We can call it ethical environmentalism if someone chooses to protect the environment by decisions in his/her own power. We can call it political environmentalism if a group makes an environmental agreement which influences the rules of evolutionary struggle. We can call it educational environmentalism if someone offers knowledge that urges to protect the environment.

Some people might think that ethics is all about goodness and love, either unconditionally or to earn respect. Ethics, however, as a science has selfish goals originally, and its primary goal is not gaining respect, but survival and happiness, health and power. Thus an ethical teaching should consist of good advice and the related arguments in order to achieve the noble goals. This ethical system gives ten pieces of good advice which can be useful to people and Nature, as people are part of Nature.

'''1. Rest enough, if you can.'''
If a person doesn't rest enough, then his/her mental abilities might decrease. If people worked too much, then the world would be less natural.

'''2. Try not to be a servant of those who are less perfect than yourself.'''
If a person is not independent enough and he/she is not free, then he/she is not happy. Living creatures are more free than robots, and the independent economy is more environmentally friendly than the modern. It is more difficult for the poor to observe the law.

'''3. Don't rule out the possibility of what can possibly be proven true, and do not believe what can possibly be disproven.'''
If a person rules out the possibility of wonders, then he/she might err. No one has proven that there are no wonders. Wonders and Nature do not come from humans, but can help humans. If a person learns primarily from books then the words do not take a strong enough root in him/her. There are misleading teachings in the world. If we want to learn based on direct experience, then we shall keep the original source, Nature.

'''4. Do not read, write, listen, or watch too much fictional works created by people.'''
Too much fictional works might drive you away from the better knowing of the reality.

'''5. If people do good to you, return it, if possible.'''
If others know that someone follows this policy, they might help him/her more. Revenge and gratitude are natural laws, which do not need administration and can complement the other laws. People's deeds have consequences in Nature.

'''6. Protect the natural life.'''
Natural life has already helped humankind in many ways, and it will probably return the good in the long term. Natural life is more trustworthy than genetically modified creatures. If people protect natural life, the results are visible.

'''7. Limit the extravagant consumer wastage.'''
If a person wastes much, he/she might get accustomed to it and he/she might get more dependent. The practice to limit the wastage can make someone more clever. Some environmental problems came into being because of wastage and overconsumption.

'''8. Limit overpopulation.'''
If people get overpopulated then one person gets a lesser share. Natural areas are lessening because of overpopulation. The rate of overpopulation increases the environmental problems.

'''9. Limit technology.'''
A person cannot trust technology, because it might serve others. The more advanced technology is, the more wrong evil people can do. Technological development is one of the causes of environmental problems and dangers.

'''10. Try to live long.'''
We do not know how death is, but life is usually bearable. Healthy lifestyle, buying healthy food and physical activity do good to the environment, too. If someone prepares for his/her own survival before the collapse, then he/she wants to lessen his/her dependence, and if dependence from trade lessens in the world, that will probably protect the environment more.

      <comment>Public domain change merged from the FEcoWebS project version, because the corrections should be made</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Human society works according to the rules of politics. If these rules are bad, it can cause too much suffering to the people. That is why it is worth of making politics more perfect, in which the role of ethics multiplies. Freedom, justice, prosperity and sustainability should belong to the most important goals of politics. In order to achieve this, the democratically elected will and the wise will should correspond more and more to each other, and that is why the basic knowledge about worldview, ethics and politics should be taught in public education, at least briefly. Environmental problems shall cause changes in politics, too. Meanwhile, the hereby mentioned political values should be taken care of, because it is possible that while the weight and role of one value gets stronger, the weight and role of the other weakens.

In hard times, power often gets centralized and falls into the hands of rulers, and it cares about liberal laws less, or at least history shows such examples in wars. In these circumstances, the maintenance of order and the distribution of goods is often done better by intelligent people than by outdated laws. This insight might have been known by the Ancient Roman Republic too, because they allowed official dictators in emergency. Thus, environmental problems mean a theat to the freedom of people, because it is difficult to remove a ruling class once it is not wanted. In many cases, liberal parties are in alliance with green parties, perhaps partly due to the before-mentioned threat but not only because of that, but because freedom and sustainability are good concepts, and these people support good concepts. Perhaps that is why these parties used to ally with the socialists, too, as socialism means social justice, which is a good idea. It is another question whether these parties do what is included in their names.

But how to protect freedom in a world which is less and less free and advances towards a future which may need strong rule? The answer is not by radical or conceptual liberalism that loses the support of the majority by maintaining controversy. If a liberal party keeps choosing the way it deems good, e.g. it supports the marriage of homosexuals, then it can lose a lot of healthy voters, and it is possible that it will not get the support to govern because of this reason. A liberal party should represent the liberal 80% of the population instead of the liberal 20%, but it is better if it represents the 100% of the population. Thus the parties of wise politicians should be similar to each other, as the will of the people is similar to itself, and wisdom is similar to wisdom too. Instead, liberalism shall show itself where it helps in life, for example, in general, due punishing taxes or incentives should be set instead of prohibitive or coercive laws.

It is not sure that changing the political system would prove to be detrimental, provided that it corresponds to the afore-mentioned four values more: freedom, justice, prosperity and sustainability. It is possible that ideal political systems differ very much from what people have had so far. For example, it is probable that more equality of chances can be provided to people if real estates and debts - and even shares and the like - were not inheritable, but every person would start his/her adult life with real estates of approximately equal value, and without debts and public debts. Achieving this goal is, however, not easy, and it needs longer studies in the area of political philosophy, so this is outside of the borders of this book. This was only mentioned as an example to show that probably there would be a more just way to divide land than by inheritance. For dividing money and moveables, however, probably there is no better solution than inheritance, because the parents can give these as gifts to their children, and it might not even be possible to create a good law which restricts the inheritance of these things. As far as there is equality of chances in the area of real estates, it is not very bad that there are wealthier people, because this way people feel motivation for success, and part of them can be happy enough, and the rich can even improve this Earth in some ways a community would not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Politics could change the world much, but accordingly, politics is not without risks. Many interests collide there and people are competing there with all their talents, which is not always ethical. Politicians can make people believe that other politicians are worse than they are in reality, so the people would hate politicians more, which would make things worse. Politicians can also mislead or trick people to win support, which would make the way of a righteous politician harder. Generally, politicians are just as good as human nature is, that is why it is not advantegous for an enlightened person to compete with them. If an enlightened person wants to change politics, it may be enough for him/her to share thoughts and ideas, and if those thoughts and ideas are proper, probably there will be people who use them anyway. It is better for a politician to consider a philosopher's idea than to make a biased decision, and it is better for philosophers, too, if their ideas are double-filtered by politicians.

In a democracy, political power is just for 4-5 years, which is not as secure as the power of a wealthy person. That's why it seems to be more noble to seek economic power instead of political one. A wealthy person can hide more easily than either a politician or a celebrity, which may be important in the age of technology. The life of the wealthy is desired, because they do not have to work if they do not want to, and they can satisfy their desires easily. The life of politicians, on the other hand, is many times about struggle and danger, at least in those ages when mankind is not meek enough.

If a politician makes an error, then many people will hate him for it, but if a wealthy person makes an error, he/she usually loses only money. To be unsuccessful, however, is not always the same as to make errors, so it is possible that the people will hate a politician even if that politician is good, e.g. if it is a necessity that the living standards fall, and politicians cannot do anything to prevent it from falling.

A politician usually has to follow the philosophy of a party, but a rich person can choose his/her own philosophy. This, however, does not need to be the case in an ideal political system where
it would be a civil right to enter into and remain in any party, and the elections inside parties would be democratic
. However, we do not live in such an ideal political system, so it is probably better for a free mind to be rich than to be a politician.

Politicians should usually make an oath, and the text of the oath may be imperfect or it may demand too much from a righteous person. This, however, does not need to be the case in an ideal political system, where no oath should be made, only obligations shall be formulated. However, we do not live in such an ideal political system, so it is probably better for a righteous person to be rich than to be a politician.

In a small country, the power of the politicians is bounded by international agreements just like the power of the rich is bounded by laws. If people have to act according to fix rules anyway, then it is more worth in a small country of being rich than to be a politician because a rich person can affect not only one country, but other countries, too.

The rich can decide freely whether to invest their capital into environmentalism. Countries, however, are obligated to do what is the will of the people anyway, and they cannot differ from it much...

      <text xml:space="preserve">If we try to solve the environmental problems, we can come to the conclusion that overpopulation should be radically limited, and even reduced in the 21st century CE (Christian Era). There are already too many people, much more than the number that could be sustained by an independent agricultural system. In an independent agricultural system farmers are much less dependent on the other parts of civilization, for instance, on companies which produce seeds, chemical fertilizers, insecticides, spraying chemicals, or on nations which sell oil, soy bean or other kinds of fodder. If our agricultural system is not independent, and similar to permaculture, it could easily collapse by the depletion of oil, the loss of electricity, the desiccation of the land (falling water tables), a new economic crisis, a war, or the revenge of Nature.

Another reason for limiting overpopulation is to protect the natural forests and the biodiversity of Earth. There were many petitions concerning this topic on petition websites, and it might seem to us that some new leaders tend to allow the clear cutting or the selling of forests that were once protected by former leaders. The reason behind this is that there is more and more pressure on the leaders due to the economic situation, which is getting worse as there will be less and less land available per person due to the increasing overpopulation. Thus the root of most environmental problems is overpopulation, so it should be radically limited, and even reduced. If we do not reduce it, Nature will probably do it sooner or later, but if it happens later, that will probably be worse, because much of the biodiversity will be gone.

Besides agricultural instability and the loss of biodiversity, there are many more drawbacks of overpopulation, e.g. it increases global warming, it increases the danger of war, especially nuclear war, it pushes people into poverty to depend on loans, and it decreases general sustainability. Increasing overpopulation diminishes the liberty of individuals more and more because they have to adapt to one globalized system where the competition is strong. Thus it can be argued that it would even be a liberal decision to create laws against overpopulation, as it would increase the practical liberty of individuals by improving their economic situation, and by increasing the importance of an individual in making common decisions.

In theory, there is a population size which means danger to the people, and let us name it the danger zone. There is also a population size till which the human population would naturally increase, and let us call it the maximum population zone. Any argument which urges people to limit population size or reduce overpopulation should give arguments for the strong conjecture that the danger zone is lower than the maximum population zone. For example, the dependent state of agriculture and the loss of biodiversity are two such arguments, not to mention the poor African children who have died of hunger in large numbers. Thus to keep out of the danger zone, we should take some measures, otherwise the population size will continue to grow until it reaches the maximum population zone, but that time may be too late to stop a huge catastrophe. This means that there shouldn't be too many children even if mankind could afford it, because we do not know when a food crisis sets in. It would be difficult to show that our species is in danger of extinction due to overpopulation, but we can show it more easily that the growing size of population lowers the standard of living for many subsequent generations, and causes more people to suffer in the future, or even die in unpleasant ways.

The difficulty of the problem of overpopulation comes from the general belief that it is better for any individual to have more offsprings, even if this is detrimental for the entire community when pursued by everyone. In contemporary philosophy, similar problems are called &quot;Prisoners' Dilemma&quot; (by Albert W. Tucker) and &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; (by Garrett Hardin). This means that the natural course of events may be harmful to us, unless we make agreements to do something against its harmful effects. Moreover, if population size is already high, it may not be economical to lessen it in the short term by birth control, because the average age of the population would grow, and it would cost more to pay the pensioners. This means that the earlier humankind starts to lessen its population size, the easier this task will be, but still, it will not be easy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The liberal way of limiting overpopulation does not prohibit begetting children. Instead, it builds on the supposition that overpopulation can be limited by other means. Such means are, for example, the freely available contraceptive methods or even financial support to those who choose not to have children, compulsory education, or liability for military service. The first two examples work by encouraging decisions by monetary incentives, and the other two examples work by increasing the average age of begetting the first child to make people have less time for begetting too many children. These seem to be good practices (except some that may be against religion), and may reduce overpopulation in some countries, but so far they have not stopped population growth in general.

This means that those who want to reduce overpopulation the liberal way should contemplate on how their solution can be enhanced. A trivial way of enhancement would be to implement the known methods in more areas, in better quality. This may need more money or more political will. It is a good question whether the money spent on this issue helps to reduce overpopulation in a like manner, or this way of limiting overpopulation cannot work in the long term. After all, there may be cultures where people always choose to have more children if they are able to. This sparks two debates. The first is whether the economic situation of poor people and poor countries should be augmented, or diminished to reduce overpopulation. The second debate is whether mass immigration into countries with decreasing population should be allowed or prohibited. Let us examine these two debates here.

Some centuries ago, when corn production was a very important indicator of the economic situation, Thomas Malthus wrote an essay on the principle of population. From this essay, we can learn that population size would increase more if there were more corn available to the population, and the people in general would rather like to be parents than rich. In modern times, however, we can see that the population of some developed countries (which could easily afford buying more corn) does not grow, while the population of some poor countries (where people are starving) grows. How can it be? The rational and the empirical knowledge seems to differ here. The most probable cause of the difference is that corn is not the only indicator to the economic situation in our times. To bring up a child, people need not only food, but they also need to sustain a house. In developed countries, houses are very expensive, and people are not allowed to build houses on their own, and the living standard demands very much money for the maintenance as well. In poor countries, they can build enough houses but do not have enough food, whereas in rich countries, they can have enough food but sometimes they have not enough money to sustain the new houses. This means that in a sense, Malthus is right, just houses matter more than food in population control nowadays. This is rational, beause an ethical couple may consider begetting a child only if they are living together.

Some people argue that poor countries should be made richer, in order to convert them to a system which is similar to those in developed countries and which discourages the begetting of many children. Some people, however, might argue that making the poor countries richer would make things worse, because they would use the money for begetting even more children. The real solution is probably to find the causes why people in developed countries beget less children, and to introduce this feature into the cultures of poor countries, too. It is possible that this is not about money, but about the elements of culture, technology, laws, etc. It is a conjecture of this essay that the price of houses and their upkeep are what matter. However, the rich countries are not perfect either, because their houses (use of electricity, water, heating) harm the environment. That is why it might be more important to convey spiritual wealth instead of material one, and if the competition in poor countries needs more education, then they may be older when begetting their first child. But until this point, the population control ideas are still weak; a crisis seems unavoidable.

In the beginning of the 21st century, it is difficult to reduce human population on Earth, because many countries have a growing population size, and those which have not, allow immigrants into their countries to fill the space. If the population of a country decreases slightly in a way that is not due to emigration, it is not worth allowing a lot of immigrants yet, because immigrants make it more difficult for the original members of the country to succeed and beget children. As a result, the original population can decrease even more. In exceptional circumstances, for example, in the crisis situations at the first onset of the environmental problems mass movements of populations can be allowed, but this is not suggested in the long term, in normal circumstances. Otherwise this would be like using up the life-belt while it is not really needed, and remaining without life-belt in real emergency.

There may be people who say that there is no overpopulation, and there may be people who say that there is overpopulation but we should not do anything against it. This essay builds on the faith that there is overpopulation and we should do something against it, but this essay is not about proving this faith. For that, it may be enough to mention that before 1800 CE, the population size of mankind has probably not yet reached 1 billion (1 000 000 000), but by 2012 CE, it has probably exceeded 7 billion (7 000 000 000). Instead, this essay searches for the answer to the following question: how to limit population size in the ideal way if we want to? Here are some thoughts about it, you can join us to try to make it more perfect. Note that the ideal way is not only for the short-term but the long-term future, too.

In Nature, animal population is limited by death. In case of humans, this would mean, for example, war, duel, famine or disease. As we do not want this in the long term, we can choose to limit the number of births. If God exists, God may achieve this, for example, by decreasing human fertility. However, it is possible that God or Nature will choose another way, to cause more suffering, so it is probable that we had better take care of limiting birth rates in our own community, in case the population size were increasing without taking care. The question is how we could limit the number of births in a sustainable, liberal and ethical manner. If some people voluntarily chose not to have children, or to have less children, out of environmental thinking, then it is probable that in evolutionary time those would proliferate who do not care for the environment as much and cannot control their instincts. Thus this solution would not be sustainable in evolutionary time, and it would not be just either. We have to compete for the rights of reproduction, because this is the law of natural selection. Natural selection should be working otherwise the genetic material of mankind would probably worsen due to bad mutations and bad selection.

There are some laws which control the way how we compete for reproduction, for example, the law which says &quot;Do not kill&quot; or the one which says &quot;Do not steal&quot;. Inside a community, other laws may be created to limit birth rates, like the one-child-policy in China, which is roughly about allowing one child for everyone, and more children for some people. These laws should be liberal, which means that in theory, everyone should be allowed to bring about any number of children if they can serve for it. However, there is one problem with the one-child-policy: it does not seem to be sustainable in evolutionary time, because it is likely that those would proliferate who bring about twins and triplets. Well, this could possibly be prevented by technological means, but hereby we search for an ideal, natural way to limit overpopulation (even without contraceptives). We have come to the conclusion which we may call the principle of birth control: The more able, the more useful and the more fit for life somebody is, the more children he/she should bring about, but the less able, the less useful and the less fit for life should not reproduce. Implementations of this principle may differ in time and place, e.g. whether ableness and usefulness should be measured by money or something else, or whether the punishment for not observing these laws should be excommunication only or something more. After all, the principle remains the same, unless some wonder happens. This principle would make the lives of the children better, because they would get the wealth they need. This principle would also help to reduce the monetary differences between people, because the money inherited would be distributed between the children.

Let us hope that there are humans who are able to voluntarily comply with these ideal laws, who can peacefully accept if they lose in a competition, who do not depend on technology, who act more and more rationally, and who can live really environmentally friendly. Let us hope that such a community would survive and prevail, making mankind better and happier. Let us call their system the urged monks of environmentalism. Until then, it is suggested to limit and reduce human population in many different ways, whatever is acceptable to the different communities and friendly to the environment. In the 21st century CE, when overpopulation and the environmental problems are still considered new, stricter actions may be needed to save mankind and natural life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There may be people who say that population size should not be limited in a coercive way, and there may be people why say it should. This essay is not about solving this debate, but to tell how to limit overpopulation in a coercive way if we want to or if it becomes an immediate necessity. It seems obvious that the ideal way to limit overpopulation, the system of urged monks of environmentalism would cause too much discontent if applied coercively. On the other hand, the system of urged monks of environmentalism should be made possible as an option for those who believe in Darwinism. The challenge is to invent such coercive laws that come with the least discontent, but that are still compatible with the ideal way to limit overpopulation.

Against overpopulation, many kinds of laws can be created, including the one-child-policy or the two-child-policy, and they differ in liberality and the suggested rate of competition for reproduction. Deciding by competition is liberal in theory, because it allows the rich to beget any number of children. Some people, however, may want more liberty in practice. The less talented may want less competition, the more talented may want more competition, both wanting liberty. Being liberal in practice and giving the right not to compete would stop much of the competition, because all the less talented would quit the competition letting the more talented compete with each other. It is a good question whether a country should be liberal in practice, or natural in competition.

Anyway, the coercive way to limit overpopulation should not allow begetting more than two children for the less fit. This, however, might not be sufficient to reduce overpopulation, although it would be a good starting point. If mankind still needs to limit overpopulation after this measure, those laws should be compatible with the system of urged monks of environmentalism, the one-child-policy, the two-child-policy and maybe other laws too. This is only possible if people get autonomy in choosing their specific way to limit overpopulation, but conform to meta-laws which ensure that human population will not rise further. The simplest such meta-law would be that the population of a country should not rise, and the countries should create the laws best for themselves. A country, however, might be too vast to make everyone satisfied with the same overpopulation laws, so it might be better to formulate the meta-laws on the level of individuals. Here follow the most liberal meta-laws we could deduct from logical necessity:

'''(1).''' The biosphere of Earth is a global alliance.
At the time when these laws should be in effect, this tells humans that they should limit their overpopulation. Different alliances of humans can do it in different ways, but there are things in common.

'''(2).''' A child and its parents belong to the same legally bounding alliance until they die. The parents can form a marriage, a companionship or a polygamy, for example (if the laws of their countries allow it), but they can live separately, of course.

'''(3).''' Those who do not have any child, can make their testaments to tell which alliance they belong to, or how to determine which alliance should get their rights of begetting children (they can also choose competition). Only one alliance may get this right, and this way the childless person virtually belongs to that alliance.

'''(4).''' If an alliance has more children than the parents of those children plus those people in the alliance who were allowed to have children but did not have and died, then the extra children should be made unable to reproduce. The parents of the extra children should be made unable to reproduce as well, unless a multiple birth happened where one of the children is still allowed. (Remark: no one should renounce his/her begetting right voluntarily until he/she died, because the monks might realize that they were cheated.)

'''(5).''' If no one claims to be the father or the mother of a child, then the child should be made unable to reproduce, unless there is an alliance that shows grace (e.g. because they do not have enough children).

'''(6).''' It is not necessary to make those parents and children unable to reproduce who only broke these laws before their ratification.

* For about ten or more years of their life, people are children and like to spend their free time with games and toys. That is why it is important to make games and toys more environmentally friendly. A game or toy can be more environmentally friendly by using less resources, providing a greater educational value or engaging the children for more time in an environmentally friendly way. Books explaining the rules of such games are probably friendly to the environment. However, it is very important to make the game or toy very popular as well, because otherwise children would not really want to play with it. Children usually follow fashion, and people could support a game so that it can be fashionable by a popular story or something else. For this, the creation of a new game might be needed, and a rich person or alliance could support the creation of such popular eco games and toys, setting a competition between game developers with alike material resources, and rewarding them according to their success. For example, there is the idea to create a computer game which would be about saving the life on Earth in the 21st century, by cooperation. In this case, the term for game campaign would coincide with the term for environmentalist/political campaign. For the environment, it seems to be better if the computer game is turn-based and multi-player at one computer, or hot-seat. For the environment, it also seems to be better if there are parts of the game which can be played without a computer too, promoting new games which are more environmentally friendly. It is just a matter of money and creativity to create such a game.

* The people who believe in God and the philosophers might not regard every game as good as others. It is a right question to ask which are the games that are the most ethical to play. To decide this question, many criteria should be considered. Such criteria are the following: it should use environmentally friendly accessories, it should teach what is good, it should help to form a community, it should not help the development of artifical intelligence too much, it should be interesting and fashionable, it should be accessible by the poor people too, it should cause joy to the less talented too, it should do good to the bodily and mental health, and it should be apt to earn money from it, as a sport, or as a creator of puzzles. Apart from these, there may be other criteria. The game can be more interesting if its rules are not too complicated, but at the same time, human creativity can be manifested in it. It is quite hard to create a game which complies with all the mentioned criteria, although that would be the ideal. The lesson to learn from this is that we should not only be environmentally friendly, but ethical in other aspects, too.

* Environmentalism is a serious issue, and it is about important problems, but one does not always like to fight a war in which one is likely to lose. That is why those who have suffered much because of the world, and made many sacrifices in order to make the world better, deserve to play, in order not to think about the world, and get more success and sources of joy. Even the hypothesis can come to our mind that a happy person can probably diet, care for his/her body, exercise, and have temperance more easily, because it is more difficult for the sad people to make sacrifices. A professional player could even earn money by skill games, or by writing about games, or by taking part in creating new games. The therapeutic and community-making effects of games are not negligible either. It is not always easy, however, to find a proper playmate. Whoever wins many times, might feel the game more dull, and whoever loses many times, probably does not enjoy the game as much. These times a voluntary handicap by the stronger player may help at the starting of the game, for example, when a grandmaster of chess plays without rooks against a child. This way any of them wins, may enjoy the game. So if we create a game, it is worth taking care of opportunities for voluntary handicaps, or for different skill levels for one-team games. If we play so much that it gives us happiness, and if we can win from our handicapped situation, why should not we try again to solve our problems in real life?

      <comment>Porting the changes that were done to FEcoWebS (the original, public domain version) yesterday (so these changes are in the public domain).</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">* There are some trivial advice for eco-friendly and economical life: usage of renewable energy sources and other eco-friendly products, spending less on other things, gathering waste selectively and selling some kinds of it, investing in environmentalism. These advice, however, might still not be enough to make our lifestyle more eco-friendly than that of the people living in Nature. New advice that is eco-friendly and economical at the same time, is always welcome. On the other hand, if we want to protect the environment even more, then we might go into a worse economic state - but this is not necessarily a problem.

* There is something we can learn from gambling: the more money we want to win, the higher the risk is. Can we possibly choose a life strategy where luck is on our side? Yes, if our goal is right. If our goal is not too big, then we can usually reduce the risks, and thus we can reach our goals more easily. Therefore it is important to think about the most important goals in our lives, and if it is possible, concentrate on reaching those goals. In our age, the 21st century, perfect environmentalism counts as a very large goal, so here too, it can be worth selecting what parts of Nature are more important to save than the others.

* Even if long-term projects do not give us enough joy, we can probably improve our real-life situation by little steps which do. Such little steps can be, for example, games which improve our mental or physical powers (like scientifically tested memory games, archery, or table tennis), or collecting free things, especially downloading free documents from the Internet which can help in our lives (for example, books about health and wealth, or about environmentalism and economy). Apart from owning an electronic library, for the less busy people it is probably a good idea to own some houseplants, too (like Aloe Vera), and make them proliferate freely, creating value. The mould may cost some money, but the pot can be from a reused PET bottle too.

* If we sort and get rid of our objects from time to time, we can win some empty space, we can be more mobile, and we can even take advantage of these objects by exchanging them for something else, or by giving them away and collect gratitude. Apart from that, getting rid of things has spiritual and secret-keeping significance too. During sorting, our memories come back once again, we evaluate them, we rediscover the valuable, and get rid of the useless, to make our spirit more easily get rid of it, too. If we forget about something in our lives, it is better if it is hidden from others as well. It is possible that the process of forgetting is like getting younger. It is worth of doing a similar cleanup to our files stored on the computer and messages stored on the Internet, with a special regard to those which are wrong. This way we can more easily find the important data, too, if necessary. Sorting and getting rid of things does good to the environment because there is less need for mining due to the recycled material.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Some scientists conduct such research that probably does more harm to the ecosystem than good, for example, those who are genetically modifying creatures, who want to simulate the human brain in a machine, who do experiments with the smallest particles of matter, who ease the production of the weapons of mass destruction, or who increase the efficiency of the people in exploiting the planet. These scientists should not be supported from the money of the state. The scientists' salary should depend on how much good they do.

* Foreign currency loans are like gambling. Even if we do not speak about the alleged tricks of the banks with the rates of exchange at the end of months, we should mention the ethical issues about the availability of this service to the people. Those who get these loans may not possess enough mental capabilities to judge whether these loans will be good to them or not. That is why it should be regulated more who can get such loans, and on what conditions. This is important not only for the persons who would get these loans, but for the persons' competitors and for the persons' families too. The competitors would have less chance to win in a sustainable (loan-free) way, and there would be more burden on the children than on the their parents with loans. Paternalism, sustainable competition, family matters and population control can all be reasons for regulating foreign currency loans, not to mention the Islamic or the early Christian laws that prohibit all loans with interest. In short, people should not owe more money than a specified amount, and this amount of money, or the maximal value of the loans should be specified by the state, and not by the banks. This would imply that loans should not be foreign currency loans.

* If every kind of laptops used the same kind of recharger, then it would be easier to reuse these rechargers for laptops. This would, in one hand, diminish the harm to the environment, and in the other hand, it would make it easier for a firm producing solar cells to produce laptop-rechargers with solar cells. Apart from laptops, it can be worth standardizing the recharger equipments for other electronic gadgets too, and maybe even the accumulators belonging to them as well. This way the mass usage of cheap solar cells would become possible. If we go further, it might be worth standardizing some parts of computers and other electronic gadgets too, to make more use of the older or not functioning machines. If we go even further, we can extend this principle to many other machines, moreover, even for such things as the packaging of yoghurt. It is possible that it is not in the interest of the vendors. If the vendors do not agree to do this, then the realization of the plan is the task of politicians. However, we should take care of not restricting the people's liberty unnecessarily because of this: it is only worth standardizing if it's really reasonable, and a significant improvement can be achieved along with an insignificant amount of inconvenience; so if we do more good than harm.

      <comment>Showing that these are separate ideas</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">* The majority of the people do not care much for the environment in their free time, that is why it may be important to remind them about environmentalism from time to time. Holidays or festivities like &quot;Earth Day&quot; can help reaching the masses, and can turn their spiritual development towards environmentalism. Religion used the same kind of trick long ago. The rich could support many environmental holidays or festivities. By the way, it would be good if an environmental holiday became as widespread as Christmas, or maybe more. In order to achieve this goal, the rich could do a campaign or a lobby. Note that &quot;Earth Day&quot; might be called &quot;International Mother Earth Day&quot; incorrectly, as Earth is not an animal, so it has no gender. We can even deem it possible that the life on Earth has more decision power than the stars on the Sky.

* There are farmers who would like to produce ingredients of food on the land in an environmentally friendly way, but it is difficult for them to sell those ingredients of food. There are also restaurants that would like to have a trustworthy source of those ingredients, from which they could produce the food they offer. However, there can be traders who stand in-between, taking away some of the profit. That is why an alternative construction might be more sustainable, where the farmer and the restaurant would form one company. This way they could produce not only conventional food, but special food based on rare plants too. Also, they could produce the seeds for their own plants to make sure they are all right. This would be a great opportunity to create environmentally friendly restaurants (GMO-free food, ethically treated animals, no hybrid plants, not much chemicals, more vegetables). The rich could accelerate this process by taking part in the business.

* The next idea comes from the example of FreeRice.com. In 2012, that website hosts a free quiz game, for example, about synonyms of English words, and for each correct answer, some grains of rice is donated to the hungry people in a poor country. The rice is paid by those whose advertisements are there on the website. Well, an improvement of this idea might be implemented by almost any good web programmer, and in 2012, there are already websites similar to FreeRice.com, but the rich could improve this idea more. The basic idea is that more customers could be attracted to some services by telling that a part of their profit goes for philantropic purposes, and in our case, for environmentalism. Different rates of giving away to philantropy might suit the different kinds of services, maybe zero, maybe 50%, maybe 100%. The rate can be higher for those services which do not need material goods or extra workforce. For example, works under copyright protection, social networking websites, concerts or tourist attractions can be made more popular and more profitable this way. This idea is worthy of a try instead of organizing prize games, too.

* We can give our unneeded things away, exchange them for something else, or even sell them one by one. However, this might not be the thing that we want. Some of our things may be too valuable for giving away, but at the same time, too cheap for spending time with the selling. In many cases, we could earn more money by working than by spending the same time taking photos of our stuff, uploading them to auction websites, writing messages to the buyers, and arranging the details of shipments. Exchange or barter may also need too much time. That is why it would be handy if there were a trader who would buy all of our old (either usable or repairable - in short, sellable) stuff in bulk, and sell them in a shop. Actually, this is not a new idea, so there may be examples of it in the world, but not yet in every city and town. There may be shops which buy and sell used books, used clothes, used gadgets, or things from the previous centuries, but shops are rare that buy or sell every kind of cheap and sellable object. However, people might consider buying used prams, bicycles, toys, tools, collections, musical instruments, furniture, or anything else which endures and can be bought in other shops. The rich could open shops which would buy and sell every sellable thing, and this could lessen the need for new things and the pressure on the environment.

      <comment>Porting the changes that were done to FEcoWebS (the original source) yesterday</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">* To spare more ink in the world, it would be better if mankind used better fonts. In current word processor programs, there are quite good fonts which can save more paper, for example, &quot;Liberation Sans Narrow&quot;. However, we want to save more ink as well, and we could possibly do that by omitting some parts of the glyphs, for example, we could omit the upper straight part of the letter P, making the glyph something like a hook. In fashion and branding, there are already similar solutions for other letters, and they are popular. The creation of a public domain font which would change all or most of the letter glyphs in a similar manner, could cause a considerable saving of ink for mankind, if it becomes fashionable. This font could differ so much from the conventional latin letters that we could use another name for it. Arpad Fekete found a public domain font on the Internet, and changed it with the open-source program FontForge, spending much of his free time on it for many days, and it turned out that the font would consume more paper than others. That is why more time and expertise is needed here.

* Some environmentalist organizations offer translation work to some activists, but a translator activist can translate environmentalist materials even without cooperation. Books that are already in the public domain are a good choice for this. The text of the CIA World Factbook, for example, which can be found on the website of CIA, is in the public domain and it contains very much information relevant to environmentalism, so it would be welcome to read it in other languages. There are also some classic works which are relevant to environmentalism, for example, &quot;The Coal Question&quot; by William Stanley Jevons, or &quot;An essay on the Principle of Population&quot; by Thomas Malthus. As there are lots of new and free, but not public domain environmentalist materials issued by organizations like the UNEP and others, a translator activist could also have the idea of translating a specific publication, and try to ask permission for it. However, it is really worth of translating only those publications which were successful in their original language, and will be read by many, because there are many choices in free environmentalist works, and quality matters very much.

* On the Internet, there are lots of free documents in connection with environmentalism. An activist who has a computer and an Internet-connection, could create one or more collections of documents from these, to fit on one CD or DVD, like the 2008/9 Wikipedia Selection for schools, or the Project Gutenberg's CD and DVD project. (Note that the licenses should be read carefully before doing this.) This CD or DVD could even be shared with other activists. This way the activists would depend less on the Internet service, and this can be handy in case of a crisis. However, it can be useful not only in a crisis, but when suggesting reading ideas to other activists, or in case when it is feared that there is a surveillance on the Internet about what a person reads. However, if an activist creates a collection of documents, the trustworthiness of that activist is really important. It is better if there are more activists working on this, preferably associated with an environmentalist organization, and check their work multiple times.

* In the time of the writing of this, many petitions can be found on the Internet connected to environmentalism, which can be signed by anyone. By signing these, we may contribute to the success of the petitions, which means environmentalist success. Here it is important to note that it is not worth signing all of the petitions, because the texts of many petitions are not perfect. Petitions which are sent to their recipients in a different language than the signers' known languages are not perfect. Petition websites that do not show exactly what is signed by the signer and what is got by the recipient, are imperfect. Petitions that tell anything about the future as a certainty, or present uncommon knowledge as certainly known by the signers, are imperfect. Anyway, the petition is only worth signing if we deem it probable that the petition is beneficial, and the statements written in the petition are true, and this holds more often if the petition was made by a famous organization. In addition to that, for our own sake it is probably not worth signing those petitions either that need our home addresses to sign them, or which are only hosted on a website that has too strict or risky conditions of use, or that send separate emails to the recipient in the name of each signer. Those petitions, however, in which we do not find any error, are worth signing for the sake of our environment, and it is worth sharing them with some of our acquaintances.

      <comment>Porting the changes that were done to FEcoWebS (the original, public domain version) yesterday, so these changes are in the public domain.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">* Although environmentalism appeared only in the modern times, humankind changed the environment even in the ancient times, for example, many kinds of animals and plants disappeared then. A professional historian, for example, who can read many original ancient texts, could write a book about the history of the degradation of the environment, with regard to the ancient ages. If he/she uses many citations and proofs for his/her statements, the book will be better. Another historian could write another book about the history of the degradation of the environment from the industrial revolution until today (optionally, mentioning some of the efforts taken against the problems).

* Keeping the pilot flame on might be necessary for convenience's sake or to prevent an explosion due to a broken boiler. However, pilot flames consume very much gas, so it would probably be good to solve the question of security and of convenience in other ways. This is a noble task for inventors. Also, there is the question what happens if the gas runs out, the flame dies, and the gas comes back afterwards? This could happen, for example, in the times of energy crisis, or if the authorities let the gas to be used only in the nights. Making an environmentally friendly invention as secure as the pilot flame is the real challenge, as each part of an advanced technology can go wrong. If it doesn't work in any other way, convenience can be sacrifized for economy and environmentalism (e.g. by having to turn an extra switch while using the gas).

* We can find much data about the extent of environmental problems. We know little, however, about the human resources available for solving these problems. The plan which aims to save civilization should consider what part of the population consists of people harmful to the environment, and passive people who live in an environmentally friendly way, and active people who even spend time on environmentalism. This research could be done, for example, by a questionnaire, where the categorization into the formerly mentioned obscure groups could be done from answers to factual questions. Apart from that, the inclination of people towards environmentalism is worth studying by scientific methods, too, as well as their inclination towards the goal of limiting overpopulation. The aim of these studies is, of course, to make more and more people environmentally friendly and environmentalist, but if it does not succeed, the environmental movement should still work. We can also improve the environmentalist activity of humankind by improving the efficiency of the good deeds of passive environmentally friendly and active environmentalist people.

* There are many freely accessible environmentalist books, and there are many public domain books, too, that are on a topic somewhat related to the environment, for example, on economy. An activist could read some important books among these, the essence of which he/she could write on one page, to which he/she could add short commentaries. This writing could be like the works that contain the shortened versions of compulsory readings at school. This way some time may be spared for some environmentalists, and in addition, it could help them decide which book to read. Writing a book about the essence of other books may need more time than writing something else, but it can be done by any intellectual, with little sacrifice from a person who likes to read these books anyway, and the product would probably be interesting, given that the books in it were famous books already.

* As David Hilbert's speech about a list of mathematical problems shaped mathematics for a century, a professional collection of environmentally friendly research tasks could shape environmentalism for a century, too.

== [[Environmental theory and collection of ideas]] ==

Hi, I noticed the work you have been doing on this book and your message in the Reading room.  You may have noticed that I have added a template on some of the pages which you created.  A few of the pages have no content so these were tagged with a ''Query''.  Most editors feel that it is best for pages with no content not to be created because on the main page the link will be red and this may encourage people to create the page with real content.  On some other pages I added a ''Cleanup'' tag.  This was done because a few of these pages were difficult to read.  There were a few grammatically-confusing sentences.  I am going to look at one of those pages, make some edits and then I will give you the link so you can see the changes I have made.  I hope this makes sense.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:50, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

== Thanks for improving! ==

Feel free to edit [[Environmental theory and collection of ideas]] as you like... I put it to WikiBooks because I have not got enough resources (i.e. time) to continue. Also, you can freely remove every mention of my name from the chapters or essays, it only makes sense to remain at the main page to show the origins. Also, if you find anything objectionable for the criteria of WikiBooks, you can remove those parts as well. Just it was quicker for me to copy-paste than to edit everything. Also, the contents of the second part are actually not essays, but collections of paragraphs, with different ideas in each paragraph... in WikiBooks, these could be numbered or annotated in some other way.

I see that you added a Speedy Delete template to this page saying that you didn't feel it was suitable for Wikibooks.  I have removed the tag because it seems fine.  As you created the page and are the only person who has edited it then if you really think it should be deleted feel free to leave me a message or add the Speedy Delete template again and we can delete it.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_the_Isle_of_Mann.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:50, 6 June 2014 (UTC)

== Re: [[Environmental theory and collection of ideas/On the coercive way to limit overpopulation]] ==

Actually, I like this essay (and the other one, about &quot;ideal way&quot;) to remain, but I feared that WikiBooks might not accept it as purely educational material, but of original research as well. So, if you can represent WikiBooks in that this essay can remain here, I would gladly accept it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I, Arpad Fekete, am a male, and born in 1982 in Kiskunfélegyháza, Hungary. In my childhood, I was a good learning pupil, but I was less experienced in human relationships. I was especially good in mathematics. Thus I've been learning the Programme Designer Mathematican profession in the University of Szeged. Meanwhile, I began to believe in Christianity, but this has caused me spiritual problems too. I was in Baptist and Catholic communities too, but I had to disappoint in both. Afterwards, I have based my religious beliefs on philosophical arguments, and I have break with Christianity. However, it still influenced my thoughts, e.g. environmentalism and philosophy.

Since about 2013, my thoughts turned towards business and the quality of my own life, including Mathematics as a hobby, so I'm going to continue my life where Christianity has interrupted it. That is one of the reasons why I let others finish my little book ([[Environmental theory and collection of ideas]]) instead of myself.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Traffic Information and Condition Analysis System (TICAS) is a powerful traffic data collection and simulation software developed by the Northland Advanced Transportation Systems Research Laboratory (NATARL) at University of Minnesota Duluth. The data source of TICAS comes from the Minnesota freeway detectors which provide traffic flow rates, speed and density data every 30 seconds. The major advantage for using TICAS is it enables user to access corridor-based traffic information, such as travel time and vehicle miles traveled. Those traffic metrics are derived or estimated basing on the traffic raw data archived at Minnesota Traffic Management Center. Data from TICAS can be exported into EXCEL directly, which is convenient for large data collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here are some graphs and data for an 6-lane urban freeway (I-43/I-894 near Milwaukee) and 4-lane interregional (I-94 west of Eau Claire).  I realize the corridor lengths are much different, but the options were limited for non-urban interstates which had more than just a couple TMC points and the urban corridors tend to be shorter.  In this case, we actually have more data for I-94.  The reliability indices follow what we’d expect with the more rural freeway performing better.  I had to use the 70th percentile travel time for the free flow travel time on the urban freeway because using the speed limit would have led to a mean speed less than the free flow.  Let me know your thoughts.

* Notice 'p=' has precedence over &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; so will display as the link instead. (Generally true for Trainz linking templates)
* Notice 'p2' gates a logical if-then-else asuffixed parenthesized term if defined.
* Default displayed link type is the TBS tags/containers formal name (which is the page section header titles), but the template converts short common use names like mesh-table or thumbnails into the default ''mesh-table container'' and ''thumbnails container'' '''unless 'p' is defined, for it always has the last word on the displayed phrase.
* Last but far from least, the template used sans arguments {{tlx|TBS}} links the {{TR|R|TrainzBaseSpec}} page so can be used inline as a self-linking reference.

      <text xml:space="preserve">TICAS is a powerful data collection tool for corridor-based traffic study. Travel time and vehicle miles traveled data can be downloaded for the routes created by the users. The database of corridors contains the majority of freeways, trunk highways, and US highways in Minnesota central area, and their directions are specified. 






The interface of the tool is user-friendly and straightforward.The procedures for creating routs are stated below.


1. Open TICAS tool, and go to &quot;Data/Performance&quot; tab;

2. Click the button &quot;Edit Route&quot; in the &quot;Route and Times&quot; region;

3. Click &quot; Create Route&quot; tab when a new window named &quot;Route Editor&quot; shows up;

4. Drag down the corridor list, and select a corridor that contains the segment(s) interested;

5. A route will be specified in the right window box if a corridor is selected. For the pins showing on the routes, red pins are actual main lane stations of loop detectors, and pins of other colors represent the exit and enter ramp stations. Find the '''main lane station''' that closed to the starting location of the interested segment, right click the pin and select &quot;Section start from here&quot;. This helps to specify the starting location of the route;

6. Find the '''main lane station''' that closed to the ending location of the interested segment, right click the pin and select &quot;Section end to here&quot;. This helps to specify the ending location of the route;

7. Click &quot;Save location&quot; button. Then the new edited route will be listed in the &quot;Route Lists&quot; tab. This route can be extracted directly for data collection use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=INRIX Speed Data Types=
INRIX speed data includes a code with each speed observation.  This code represents the type of speed: reference, historical or real-time.  

'''Reference''' speed: based on the typical free flow speed for the segment - related to the speed limit

'''Historical''' speed: based on the historical speed data for that particular segment during the same time of day

'''Real-time''' speed: based on real-time speed measurements from probe, gps or other real-time measurements

The reference speed is constant across all times and varies only by TMC segment.  The historical speed is time dependent and may capture recurring congestion along a segment.  INRIX uses reference and historical speeds to fill in gaps in the real-time data.  INRIX does not reveal the threshold necessary to provide real-time data, nor does INRIX reveal when reference data is used instead of historical data for filling gaps in real-time data.  It appears, however, that reference data is used during the night and other off peak times in order to reduce processing when speeds are likely constant, whereas, historical data is likely used during hours when speeds may vary but no real-time data is available.

===Data Type by Year===
Below are graphs representing the distribution of data types for freeways and arterials in Wisconsin by year.  The data does not include all INRIX freeway and arterial coverage in Wisconsin, but a subset.  The graphs reveal an increase in the availability of real-time data with time.  It is expected that this trend has continued with 2013 and 2014 data.

===Data Type by Hour===
The graph below shows the distribution of real-time data along a 4-lane inter-regional freeway in Wisconsin by hour of the day.  Real-time data is most prevalent during daytime hours when more vehicles are present on the roadway.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Different types of flow chart ==
[[File:FlowChartSymbols.jpg|thumb|left|A diagram showing the symbols used in a flowchart.]]
* '''Start and Stop''' symbols are used as a starting point for the diagram and exit point(s).
* '''Process''' symbols are used for to indicate that a process is happening.
* '''Decision''' symbols are used for when there are multiple out comes, two or more arrows should come out of the diagram and redirect you to another part of the diagram. Next to each arrow there should be a note saying what the out come is, e.g. 'Yes' near one arrow and 'No' near another.
* '''Arrow''' symbols are used to indicate the flow of where you're meant to go next.







There are two types of control systems used for flow charts, Open-loop and Closed-loop&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory#Classical_control_theory&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Open-Loop ===
An open loop system is a system is a flow chart that is does not loop back to a previous part of the diagram, it can still have decision symbols as long as they do not go back to a stage that you've already been to.

=== Closed-loop ===
A closed-loop system is the opposite to an open-loop system; the flow chart contains a decision that leads back to a previous part in the diagram.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Can anything be easily done about the names of all these templates?  How do you guys remember them all without visiting the Template category every time?  What do the letters in this template's name mean?  Another annoying thing is that the template names are case sensitive and some template names are written as one word, others as two words and some are hyphenated.  Others start with a capital letter while others are all lower case.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:10, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

: Maybe we need a template naming policy. I prefer all lower case, each word separated with a space, and things spelled out myself to avoid mistakes, and to make finding relevant templates easier. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:21, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=NPMRDS Data Format=
NPMRDS data comes in two formats. The first is the static file containing the TMC information for all states.  This file may be updated from time to time, but is typically static. The remaining files contain the travel time information for each state in the form of comma separated files (CSV).  The files are usually between 500MB and 4GB depending on the region, with the Northeast being the largest data set.

A sample Google Earth (.kml) file mapping out the TMCs in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin is available [https://srfconsulting.filetransfers.net/downloadFileFromPass.php?filePassId=b9ac8d849bed6cea1be28de64f833306&amp;downloadReceiptId= here] or on Google Maps [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=https://srfconsulting.filetransfers.net/downloadFileFromPass.php?filePassId=b9ac8d849bed6cea1be28de64f833306&amp;downloadReceiptId= here] .

      <text xml:space="preserve">=NPMRDS Real-Time Data Availability=

The charts below outline the availability of NPMRDS real-time data on two freeway corridors in January 2012.

The following two graphs show the availability of real-time data by hour of day in January 2012 for the 6-lane urban freeway and the 4-lane inter-regional freeway.  The availability of real-time data is higher during daytime hours when vehicle volumes are higher and lower overnight.  Overall, the 4-lane inter-regional corridor reported more real-time measurements.  Although the urban freeway experiences higher vehicle volumes, the inter-regional freeway likely experiences higher commercial truck volumes, which are often a source of probe data.  Another possible factor is the shorter TMC lengths along the urban freeway.  The inter-regional freeway is 20 miles long with 4 TMC segments, while the urban freeway is 4 miles long with 6 TMC segments.  It's unknown whether there is a correlation between TMC length and availability of real-time data.


[[File:Availability of data on 6-lane Freeway in January.pdf|750px|Availability of data on 6-lane Freeway in January]]
[[File:Data Availability on 4-lane Inter-regional Freeway in January.pdf|750px|Data Availability on 4-lane Inter-regional Freeway in January]]

The two charts below show the frequency at which varying amounts of real-time data were available along the corridors during January 2012.  For example, 100% availability corresponds to all TMCs reporting (4/4 or 6/6 for these two corridors) real-time data during a given time interval, 50% availability to half of TMC segments (2/4 or 3/6) reporting real-time data etc.  The frequency at which eac of these occur is plotted along the y-axis.  The inter-regional freeway consists of 4 TMCs making up 20.18 miles, the urban freeway 6 TMCs totaling 4.35 miles.  The greater number of TMC segments along the urban corridor is one factor leading to the smaller frequencies of availability.  However, with fewer real-time data points (as shown in the graphs above), it is expected that the frequencies will also be lower on the urban corridor than the inter-regional.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP II)=

[[File:SHRP II.jpg|thumb|SHRP II]]

&quot;Congress authorized the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2) in 2005 to investigate the underlying causes of highway crashes and congestion in a short-term program of focused research. To carry out that investigation, SHRP 2 targets goals in four interrelated focus areas:
Safety: Significantly improve highway safety by understanding driving behavior in a study of unprecedented scale.
Renewal: Develop design and construction methods that cause minimal disruption and produce long-lived facilities to renew the aging highway infrastructure.
Reliability: Reduce congestion and improve travel time reliability through incident management, response, and mitigation.
Capacity: Integrate mobility, economic, environmental, and community needs into the planning and design of new transportation capacity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot;/&gt;

&quot;SHRP 2 is being conducted under a memorandum of understanding among the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the Federal Highway Administration, and the National Research Council.  The multiyear program (five years of funding, nine years to complete) began work in March 2006.  SHRP 2 is guided by an oversight committee and four technical coordinating committees, one in each of the four focus areas.  More targeted task groups provide assistance in areas requiring specific technical expertise, including preparation of requests for proposals and review of proposals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Constructing a Segment for Analysis=
TMCs are segments of the roadway, often between interchanges or major intersections on arterials.  The travel time data is reported at the TMC level.  These segments range in length from less than a mile to several miles long.  In order to build a corridor and calculate the travel time, TMCs must be connected.  Each TMC is assigned a location code.  Details can be found at [[Travel_Time_Reliability_Reference_Manual/Data_Format_and_Size|Next Page → Data Format]].  

A Google Earth (.kml) file mapping out the TMCs in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin is available [https://srfconsulting.filetransfers.net/downloadFileFromPass.php?filePassId=b9ac8d849bed6cea1be28de64f833306&amp;downloadReceiptId= here] or on Google Maps [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=https://srfconsulting.filetransfers.net/downloadFileFromPass.php?filePassId=b9ac8d849bed6cea1be28de64f833306&amp;downloadReceiptId= here] .

Typically, a corridor can be constructed by connecting successive TMCs in the positive or negative direction.  The TMC numbers increase with the direction of travel along the positive direction and decrease along the negative direction.  For example, a corridor in the positive direction might consiste of 107P04585, followed by 107P04586, 107P04587 and 107P04588 etc.  In the negative direction, 107N04588 would be the first TMC, followed by 107N04587, 107N04586, and 107N04585 etc.

[[File:TMC Map.png|thumb|TMC Map Example]]

Longer corridors, however, can be constructed by simply connecting successive TMCs.  When roadways intersect other roadways, the TMC sequence may change.  Therefore, viewing TMC points in GIS or other mapping software allows one to see the sequence of TMCs along the desired corridor.  The static file containing TMC information, includes the roadway name, direction and latitude and longitude coordinates, allowing the points to be plotted in various programs.  The NPMRDS data set also includes a shapefile which can be used to construct corridors in GIS.

One difference in the TMC data provided by INRIX, is that TMC points are defined by a beginning and ending latitude and longitude which typically allows a corridor to be constructed by connecting the ending latitude/longitude of one TMC to the beginning latitude/longitude of another.

Once the order and sequence of TMC points along the corridor is defined, travel times and other metrics can be calculated.

Dialogo:
---------------
Mama: Jorge, necesito ayuda preparando para los visitantes que vienen este fin de semana.&lt;br&gt;

Jorge: Bueno, pero, tengo la fiesta de cumpleaños de mi amigo Sam hoy.&lt;br&gt;

Mama: Por eso, debemos limpiar ahora mismo.  Ven, '''ten''' la escoba y '''vete''' a la cocina.&lt;br&gt;

Jorge: Pero mama!  No hay tiempo, tenemos que envolver el regalo de Sam!&lt;br&gt;

Mama: La fiesta empieza a la una, y apenas son las nueva de la manaña.  No '''me lo dicutas.'''   A limpiar! &lt;br&gt;

Jorge: Vale, pues.  '''Prestame''' la cinta  para envolver el regalo. &lt;br&gt;

Mama: '''Ten.''' '''Hazlo''' rapido mi amor!&lt;br&gt;

Jorge: Muy bien. Graciás mama!&lt;br&gt;

Mama: Y a tí.  Bueno.  Ahora '''agarra''' el regalo y '''ponlo''' en tu cuarto.  Mientras que estas allá, '''limpia''' tu cuarto también!&lt;br&gt;

Jorge: Ya, terminé de limpiar el cuarto.  Y ya tenemos que ir a la fiesta.&lt;br&gt;

Mama:  Es casi tiempo de irnos, sí.  Pero '''cepillate''' los dientes y '''lavate''' la cara primero. No te puedo permitirte ir fuera de la casa asi.&lt;br&gt;

Jorge:  Puedo traer mi juegete a la fiesta también?&lt;br&gt;

Mama: '''No traigas''' el juegete.  No queiro que lo pierdas.&lt;br&gt;

Jorge: Tengo hambre.  Podemos comer algo antes de irnos.&lt;br&gt;

Mama: Pero acabaste de cepillarte los dientes!  Pues, a ver, te prepare un sandwich.&lt;br&gt; 

Jorge: Gracias mama, pero '''no le pongas''' mayonesa.  No me gusta la mayonesa.&lt;br&gt;

Mama:  Desde cuando no te gusta mayonesa?  Mientras estoy preparando el sandwich, '''asegurate''' que estes listo de ir a la fiesta.

      <comment>Going to remove some uncommon ideas</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Further Readings sections are not necessary, just put here in order to avoid the suspicion of plagiarism, however, many of them were not even read by the original author. In case, however, when the Further Readings sections add new arguments to support the theory described in this book - or in other words, proof by authority - they can be very useful, so adding more of them is encouraged too.

Today I've corrected some errors I've found inappropriate for WikiBooks, if you find more, you can notify me or correct it directly.

The other error in my writings (noticed by WikiPedians) is too formal language... I did not know that my language is formal, but it's probably because my native language is not English, and although I learned English as a Second Language (ESL), it was British English, not American English. So, it would be the best to correct those errors yourself which you find objectionable, I can only correct those which are pointed as wrong.

Anyway, this book is not designed for WikiBooks, so please forgive if some parts of it do not seem to comply with the [[Wikibooks:WIW|criteria]] yet, however, you can help (correct) that by deleting the objectionable parts, and I'll either leave them as they are (deleted), or look after a better (and encyclopedic) way to express them.

By the way, someone has edited: &quot;to be more comprehensive by explaining modern environmental protection issues&quot;... shouldn't it be &quot;to be more comprehensive in explaining modern environmental protection issues&quot;...? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Fekarp|Fekarp]] ([[User talk:Fekarp|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fekarp|contribs]]) 11:22, 22 May 2014‎&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

: Books are encouraged to develop their own style guidelines to help contributors to use a consistent style, which can include the use of formal language and British English. I wouldn't worry about trying to express things like an encyclopedia because books should aim to instruct/teach people about a topic, and Wikibooks is not an encyclopedia. Books can teach people about existing and planned research topics that have been documented by reliable sources, but people's original ideas for protecting the environment is appropriate at Wikiversity rather then at Wikibooks.
: You can change the wording in the forward, if you like, as you have already done in other ways. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:38, 22 May 2014 (UTC)

Okay, maybe it is safer to entirely remove some parts of this book, in order to make the place of the other parts more secure. As for style, I do not care much, but my sister said that it is better to use &quot;It is&quot; than &quot;It's&quot; in written English. So I think I'll quickly do some improvements fit for WikiBooks, but actually, I thought that WikiBooks is a place to upload the first version of my book, and the community will do the rest. By the way, it is me who might have the most ideas to improve this book, just I have no time for it as I do not want to suffer while the others enjoy life.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unlike INRIX, the NPMRDS data set does not include non real-time travel times or speeds.  If real-time measurements do not exist for a given TMC during a given time period, the data point is left blank.  In some cases, it may be desirable to impute some of the missing data points based on surrounding real-time data.  

The figure below gives an example of imputing a missing data point based on surrounding spatial and temporal data.

[[File:Imputation.jpg|500px|Imputation]]&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot;/&gt;

Using a sample NPMRDS data set, an imputation was conducted in which missing data points were imputed only if the surrounding spatial and temporal points were all populated with real-time data.  The percentage of missing data points which fit this criteria was around 3 percent.  More often than not, the missing data points are not anomalies, but are accompanied by other missing points.  This makes sense, since missing real-time data is usually the result of a lack of probe vehicles.  A lack of real-time data in one TMC segment will likely result in neighboring TMCs to also lack real-time data.  Similarly, surrounding temporal points are likely to lack real-time observations when vehicle volumes are low.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Calculating speeds or travel times along a corridor is straightforward given that one has [[Travel Time Reliability Reference Manual/Building Corridors|constructed the TMC segments]] which make up the corridor and that one has a tool by which to access the [[Travel Time Reliability Reference Manual/Data Storage|data]].  One open source tool for writing the necessary code is [https://www.python.org/ Python].  Python extensions, such as [http://initd.org/psycopg/ Psycopg], allow one to access SQL databases which are storing the speed/travel time data. 

INRIX and NPMRDS provide either speed or travel time measurements for each TMC for every time interval (1 or 5 minutes).  TMC lengths are also reported which allows for easy conversion between speed and travel time.  Calculating speeds or travel times along a corridor only requires that these values be aggregated.  Python scripting can be used to read from the databases for the necessary TMC segments and desired time periods and loop over the values in order to construct speeds/travel times.  These speeds/travel times can then be written to a Comma Value Separated (CSV) file, or inserted into a database table.   

Additional add-ons are available for Python which allow 3D graphing capabilities.  Below are sample graphs created using the NPMRDS data set and the [http://matplotlib.org/ Matplotlib] python library.  Blank areas represent points where real-time data did not exist along the entire corridor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Data Storage=
Due to the large size of the NPMRDS data sets, it is not possible to open the CSV files containing travel time data in Microsoft Excel.  While Microsoft Access provides the ability to handle slightly larger data sets, MS Access is also limited in the amount of data it can hold (typically around 2 GB).  With each month of data containing between 500 MB and 4 GB, depending on the region, it is recommended to use a non file-based relational database.  [http://www.mysql.com/ MySQL] and [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL] are examples of open source databases which can handle these large data sets.

The data is often stored as two tables, one which holds the static TMC information and the other which holds the speed/travel time data.  The two tables can be joined by the TMC id/name which is parameter in both data sets.  Details of each data set can be found on the [[Travel_Time_Reliability_Reference_Manual/Data_Format_and_Size|NPMRDS data format page]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Reliability Indices=
'''Travel Time Index (TTI)''' - The ratio of a measured travel time during congestion to the time required to make the same trip at free-flow speeds. For example, a TTI of 1.3 indicates a 20-minute free-flow trip required 26 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;TTI = \frac{TT_{Mean}}{TT_{Free Flow}}&lt;/math&gt;


'''Buffer Index (BI)''' - &quot;The buffer index represents the extra buffer time (or time cushion) that most travelers add to their average travel time when planning trips to ensure on-time arrival. This extra time is added to account for any unexpected delay. The buffer index is expressed as a percentage and its value increases as reliability gets worse. For example, a buffer index of 40 percent means that, for a 20-minute average travel time, a traveler should budget an additional 8 minutes (20 minutes × 40 percent = 8 minutes) to ensure on-time arrival most of the time. In this example, the 8 extra minutes is called the buffer time. The buffer index is computed as the difference between the 95th percentile travel time and average travel time, divided by the average travel time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot;/&gt;

&quot;This formulation of the buffer index uses a 95th percentile travel time to represent a near-worst case travel time. Whether expressed as a percentage or in minutes, it represents the extra time a traveler should allow to arrive on-time for 95 percent of all trips. A simple analogy is that a commuter or driver who uses a 95 percent reliability indicator would be late only one weekday per month.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;BI = \frac{TT_{95%} - TT_{Mean}}{TT_{Free Flow}}&lt;/math&gt;


'''Planning Time Index''' - &quot;The planning time index represents the total travel time that should be planned when an adequate buffer time is included. The planning time index differs from the buffer index in that it includes typical delay as well as unexpected delay. Thus, the planning time index compares near-worst case travel time to a travel time in light or free-flow traffic. For example, a planning time index of 1.60 means that, for a 15-minute trip in light traffic, the total time that should be planned for the trip is 24 minutes (15 minutes × 1.60 = 24 minutes). The planning time index is useful because it can be directly compared to the travel time index (a measure of average congestion) on similar numeric scales. The planning time index is computed as the 95th percentile travel time divided by the free-flow travel time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;PTI = \frac{TT_{95%}}{TT_{Mean}}&lt;/math&gt;


'''XXth % Travel Time Index''' - The XXth-percentile travel time index is the ratio of the XXth % travel time to the mean travel time.  The XXth-percentile travel time is the travel time at which XX % of travel times are less than or equal to it.

:&lt;math&gt;TTI_{XX%} = \frac{TT_{XX%}}{TT_{Free Flow}}&lt;/math&gt;


'''Misery Index (MI)''' - The misery index measures the amount of delay of the worst trips. For example, the MI may compare the 97.5th percentile travel time to the mean travel time.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;MI = \frac{TT_{97.5%}}{TT_{Free Flow}}&lt;/math&gt;


'''On-Time Performance''' - The percentage of trips which are less than or equal to XX x free-flow travel time, where XX is usually around 1.1-1.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot;/&gt;

=== Usage ===
* This template provides the [[Help:Editnotices|editnotice]] for all book pages.

=== Hiding the message ===
This template is marked with the CSS id &lt;tt&gt;&quot;main-namespace-editnotice&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, so that editors can apply their own CSS customization if they wish, in particular to hide it. To hide the message, add

:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#main-namespace-editnotice{display:none;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

into [[Special:MyPage/skin.css]], which redirects to your current skin's CSS file (open in new tab/window to see).

In algebra, a '''cyclic group''' is a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] that is [[Generating set of a group|generated]] by a single element.&lt;ref name=&quot;eom&quot;&gt;{{springer|title=Cyclic group|id=p/c027510}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it consists of a set of elements with a single invertible [[associative operation]], and it contains an element&amp;nbsp;''g'' such that every other element of the group may be obtained by repeatedly applying the group operation or its inverse to&amp;nbsp;''g''. Each element can be written as a power of ''g'' in multiplicative notation, or as a multiple of ''g'' in additive notation.  This element ''g'' is called a ''[[Generating set of a group|generator]]'' of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;eom&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Cyclic group.svg|right|thumb|200px|The six 6th complex roots of unity form a cyclic group under multiplication. ''z'' is a primitive element, but ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not, because the odd powers of ''z'' are not a power of ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
Every infinite cyclic group is [[isomorphic]] to the [[additive group]] of '''Z''', the integers. Every finite cyclic group of [[Order (group theory)|order]] ''n'' is isomorphic to the additive group of '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''', the integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n''. Every cyclic group is an [[abelian group]] (meaning that its group operation is [[commutative property|commutative]]), and every finitely generated abelian group is a [[direct product]] of cyclic groups.

==Definition==
A group ''G'' is called cyclic if there exists an element ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ⟨''g''⟩ = { ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{!}} ''n'' is an integer }.}} Since any group generated by an element in a group is a subgroup of that group, showing that the only [[subgroup]] of a group ''G'' that contains ''g'' is ''G'' itself suffices to show that ''G'' is cyclic.

For example, if ''G'' = { ''g''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, ''g''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''g''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''g''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''g''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, ''g''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; } is a group, then ''g''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''G'' is cyclic.  In fact, ''G'' is essentially the same as (that is, [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to) the set {{nowrap|{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} with addition [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 6. For example, {{nowrap|1 + 2 ≡ 3 (mod 6)}} corresponds to {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; · ''g''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{nowrap|2 + 5 ≡ 1 (mod 6)}} corresponds to {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; · ''g''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and so on. One can use the isomorphism χ defined by {{nowrap|1=χ(''g''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''i''}}.

The name &quot;cyclic&quot; may be misleading:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lajoie |first=Caroline |last2=Mura |first2=Roberta |date=November 2000 |title=What's in a name? A learning difficulty in connection with cyclic groups |journal=For the Learning of Mathematics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=29–33 |jstor=40248334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible to generate infinitely many elements and not form any literal cycles; that is, every ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is distinct. (It can be said that it has one infinitely long cycle.) A group generated in this way (for example, the first [[Frieze_group#Descriptions_of_the_seven_frieze_groups|frieze group]], p1) is called an '''infinite cyclic group''', and is isomorphic to the additive group of [[integer]]s {{nowrap|('''Z''', +)}}.

===Integer and modular addition===
The set of [[integer]]s, with the operation of addition, forms a group.&lt;ref name=&quot;eom&quot;/&gt; It is an infinite cyclic group, because all integers can be written as a finite sum or difference of copies of the number 1. In this group, 1 and &amp;minus;1 are the only generators. Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to this group.

For every positive integer ''n'', the set of integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]&amp;nbsp;''n'', again with the operation of addition, forms a finite cyclic group, the group '''Z'''/''n''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eom&quot;/&gt;
An element ''g'' is a generator of this group if ''g'' is [[relatively prime]] to ''n''.
Thus, the number of different generators is φ(''n''), where φ is the [[Euler totient function]], the function that counts the number of numbers modulo&amp;nbsp;''n'' that are relatively prime to ''n''.
Every finite cyclic group is isomorphic to a group '''Z'''/''n'', where ''n'' is the order of the group.

The integer and modular addition operations, used to define the cyclic groups, are both the addition operations of [[commutative ring]]s, also denoted '''Z''' and '''Z'''/''n''. If ''p'' is a prime, then '''Z'''/''p'' is a [[finite field]], and is usually instead written as '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; or '''GF'''(''p''). Every field with ''p'' elements is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to this one.

===Modular multiplication===
{{main|Multiplicative group of integers modulo n}}
For every positive integer ''n'', the subset of the integers modulo&amp;nbsp;''n'' that are relatively prime to&amp;nbsp;''n'', with the operation of multiplication, forms a finite group that for many values of ''n'' is again cyclic.
It is the [[Multiplicative group of integers modulo n|group under multiplication modulo ''n'']], and it is cyclic whenever ''n'' is 1, 2, 4, a [[prime power|power of an odd prime]], or twice a power of an odd prime.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Randomized Algorithms|first1=Rajeev|last1=Motwani|author1-link=Rajeev Motwani|first2=Prabhakar|last2=Raghavan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780521474658|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QKVY4mDivBEC&amp;pg=PA401|at=Theorem&amp;nbsp;14.14, p.&amp;nbsp;401}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Its elements are the [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] of the ring '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''; there are φ(''n'') of them, where again φ is the totient function. This group is written as ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;. For example,  ('''Z'''/6'''Z''')&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; has as its elements {1,5}; 6 is twice a prime, so this is a cyclic group. In contrast,  ('''Z'''/8'''Z''')&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; (with elements {1,3,5,7}) is the [[Klein group]] and is not cyclic. When ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; is cyclic, every generator of ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; is called a [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root modulo ''n'']]. 

The cyclic group ('''Z'''/''p'''''Z''')&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; for a prime number ''p'', is also written ('''Z'''/''p'''''Z''')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; because it consists of the non-zero elements of the [[finite field]] of order ''p''. More generally, every finite [[subgroup]] of the multiplicative group of any [[field (mathematics)|field]] is cyclic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Galois Theory|series=Universitext|first=Joseph J.|last=Rotman|publisher=Springer|year=1998|isbn=9780387985411|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M32GNlFkmHgC&amp;pg=PA65|at=Theorem&amp;nbsp;62, p.&amp;nbsp;65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotational symmetries===
{{main|Rotational symmetry}}
The set of [[rotational symmetry|rotational symmetries]] of a [[polygon]] forms a finite cyclic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Fearful Symmetry: Is God a Geometer?|first1=Ian|last1=Stewart|first2=Martin|last2=Golubitsky|author2-link=Marty Golubitsky|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2010|isbn=9780486477589|pages=47–48|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7x_MF83tTKQC&amp;pg=PA47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If there are ''n'' different ways of mapping the polygon to itself by a rotation (including the null rotation) then this group is isomorphic to Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. In three or higher dimensions there can exist other [[Point groups in three dimensions#Cyclic 3D symmetry groups|finite symmetry groups that are cyclic]], but that do not form the set of rotations around a single axis.

The group ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of all rotations of a [[circle]] (the [[circle group]]) is ''not'' cyclic. Unlike the infinite cyclic group, it is not even [[countable]]. There also exist other infinite rotation groups (such as the set of rotations by rational angles) that are countable but not cyclic.

===Galois theory===
An ''n''th [[root of unity]] may be thought of as a [[complex number]] whose ''n''th power is&amp;nbsp;1. That is, it is a [[root of a polynomial|root]] of the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.
The ''n''th roots of unity form a cyclic group of order ''n'' under multiplication.&lt;ref name=&quot;eom&quot;/&gt; For example, the polynomial {{nowrap|1=0 = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} factors as {{nowrap|1=(''z'' − ''s''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)(''z'' − ''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)(''z'' − ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, where {{nowrap|1=''s'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2π''i''/3&lt;/sup&gt;}}; the set {''s''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, ''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;} forms a cyclic group under multiplication. The [[Galois group]] of the [[field extension]] of the [[rational number]]s generated by the ''n''th roots of unity forms a different group. It is isomorphic to the multiplicative group modulo&amp;nbsp;''n'', which has order φ(''n'') and is cyclic for some but not all&amp;nbsp;''n''.

A field extension is called a [[cyclic extension]] if its Galois group is a cyclic group. The Galois group of every finite extension of a [[finite field]] is finite and cyclic, with an iterate of the [[Frobenius endomorphism]] as its generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Subgroups and notation==
{{main|Fundamental theorem of cyclic groups}}
All [[subgroup]]s and [[quotient group]]s of cyclic groups are cyclic. Specifically, all subgroups of '''Z''' are of the form ''m'''''Z''', with ''m'' an integer ≥0. All of these subgroups are distinct from each other, and apart from the trivial group (for {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 0}}) all are [[isomorphic]] to '''Z'''. The [[lattice of subgroups]] of '''Z''' is isomorphic to the [[Duality (order theory)|dual]] of the lattice of natural numbers ordered by [[divisibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algebra, Chapter 0|volume=104|series=Graduate Studies in Mathematics|first=Paolo|last=Aluffi|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2009|isbn=9780821847817|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=deWkZWYbyHQC&amp;pg=PA82|pages=82–84|contribution=6.4 Example: Subgroups of Cyclic Groups}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, because the prime numbers are the numbers with no nontrivial divisors,  a cyclic group is [[simple group|simple]] if and only if its order (the number of its elements) is prime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Gannon |first1=Terry |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |title=Moonshine beyond the monster: the bridge connecting algebra, modular forms and physics |url= |edition= |series=Cambridge monographs on mathematical physics |volume= |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-521-83531-2|page=18|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ehrUt21SnsoC&amp;pg=PA18|quotation='''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is simple iff ''n'' is prime.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the cyclic groups are [[Abelian group|abelian]], they are often written additively and denoted Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with the identity written 0.  However, this notation can be problematic for [[number theory|number theorists]] because it conflicts with the usual notation for [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number]] rings or [[localization of a ring|localization]] at a [[prime ideal]]. The [[quotient group|quotient]] notations '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''', '''Z'''/''n'', and '''Z'''/(''n'') are standard alternatives.
One may instead write the group  multiplicatively, and denote it by C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n'' is the order for finite groups and by C for the infinite cyclic group.&lt;ref&gt;The infinite cyclic group written multiplicatively may be written C (most common), C&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; (the subscript being interpreted as the order of the group), or even C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (to fit the statement {{nowrap|C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''', ''n'' ≥ 0}}, as given [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cyclic%20group here]).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''g''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} in C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas {{nowrap|1=2 + 4 = 1}} in '''Z'''/5'''Z'''.

All quotient groups of '''Z''' are finite, except for the trivial exception {{nowrap|1='''Z'''/{0} = '''Z'''/0'''Z'''}}. For every positive divisor ''d'' of ''n'', the quotient group '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' has precisely one subgroup of order ''d'', the one generated by the residue class of ''n''/''d''. There are no other subgroups.
Using the quotient group formalism, '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' is a standard notation for the additive cyclic group with ''n'' elements.  In [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] terminology, the subgroup ''n'''''Z''' is also the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] (''n''), so the quotient can also be written '''Z'''/(''n'') or '''Z'''/''n'' without abuse of notation.  These alternatives do not conflict with the notation for the ''p''-adic integers.  The last form is very common in informal calculations; it has the additional advantage that it reads the same way that the group or ring is often described verbally in English, &quot;Zee mod en&quot;.

==Additional properties==
Every cyclic group is [[abelian group|abelian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eom&quot;/&gt; That is, its group operation is [[Commutative property|commutative]]: {{nowrap|1=''gh'' = ''hg''}} (for all ''g'' and ''h'' in ''G''). This is clear for the groups of integer and modular addition since {{nowrap|''r'' + ''s'' ≡ ''s'' + ''r'' (mod ''n'')}}, and it follows for all cyclic groups since they are all isomorphic to a group generated by an addition operation.
For a finite cyclic group of order ''n'', and every element ''e'' of the group, ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the identity element of the group. This again follows by using the isomorphism to modular addition, since {{nowrap|''kn'' ≡ 0 (mod ''n'')}} for every integer ''k''.

If ''d'' is a [[divisor]] of ''n'', then the number of elements in '''Z'''/''n'' which have order ''d'' is φ(''d''), and the number of elements whose order divides ''d'' is exactly ''d''.
If ''G'' is a finite group in which, for each {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 0}}, ''G'' contains at most ''n'' elements of order dividing ''n'', then ''G'' must be cyclic.&lt;ref&gt;This implication remains true even if only prime values of ''n'' are considered. See  {{citation | last1=Gallian | first1=Joseph | title=Contemporary Abstract Algebra | publisher=Cengage Learning | edition=7th | isbn= 9780547165097 | year=2010 | at = Exercise&amp;nbsp;43, p.&amp;nbsp;84|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CnH3mlOKpsMC&amp;pg=PA84}}. (And observe that when ''n'' is prime, there is exactly one element whose order is a proper divisor of ''n'', namely the identity.)&lt;/ref&gt;
The order of an element ''m'' of the group is ''n''/[[greatest common divisor|gcd]](''n'',''m'').

The [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of two cyclic groups '''Z'''/''n'' and '''Z'''/''m'' is cyclic if and only if ''n'' and ''m'' are [[coprime]]. Thus e.g. '''Z'''/12 is the direct product of '''Z'''/3 and '''Z'''/4, but not the direct product of '''Z'''/6 and '''Z'''/2.
If ''p'' is a [[prime number]], then the only group ([[up to]] [[group isomorphism|isomorphism]]) with ''p'' elements is '''Z'''/''p''.
it is called a [[primary cyclic group]]. The [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups|fundamental theorem of abelian groups]] states that every [[finitely generated abelian group]] is the direct product of finitely many finite primary cyclic and infinite cyclic groups.
A number ''n''  is called a [[cyclic number (group theory)|cyclic number]] if it has the property that '''Z'''/''n'' is the only group of order ''n'', which is true exactly when gcd(''n'',φ(''n''))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Representations===
The [[Representation theory of finite groups|representation theory]] of the cyclic group is a critical base case for the representation theory of more general finite groups.  In the [[character theory|complex case]], a representation of a cyclic group decomposes into a direct sum of linear characters, making the connection between character theory and representation theory transparent.  In the [[modular representation theory|positive characteristic case]], the indecomposable representations of the cyclic group form a model and inductive basis for the representation theory of groups with cyclic [[Sylow subgroup]]s and more generally the representation theory of blocks of cyclic defect.

===Cayley graph===
{{main|Circulant graph}}
[[File:Paley13.svg|thumb|240px|The [[Paley graph]] of order 13, a circulant graph formed as the Cayley graph of '''Z'''/13 with generator set {1,3,4}]]
A [[Cayley graph]] is a graph defined from a pair (''G'',''S'') where ''G'' is a group and ''S'' is a set of generators for the group; it has a vertex for each group element, and an edge for each product of an element with a generator. In the case of a finite cyclic group, with its single generator, the Cayley graph is a [[cycle graph]], and for an infinite cyclic group with its generator the Cayley graph is a doubly-infinite [[path graph]]. However, Cayley graphs can be defined from other sets of generators as well. The Cayley graphs of cyclic groups with arbitrary generator sets are called [[circulant graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Endomorphisms===
The [[endomorphism ring]] of the abelian group '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' is [[ring homomorphism|isomorphic]] to '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' itself as a [[ring (algebra)|ring]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ks&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=The Theory of Finite Groups: An Introduction|series=Universitext|first1=Hans|last1=Kurzweil|first2=Bernd|last2=Stellmacher|publisher=Springer|year=2004|isbn=9780387405100|page=50|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6foucBXceC4C&amp;pg=PA50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this isomorphism, the number ''r'' corresponds to the endomorphism of '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' that maps each element to the sum of ''r'' copies of it. This is a bijection if and only if ''r'' is coprime with ''n'', so the [[automorphism group]] of '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' is isomorphic to the unit group ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ks&quot;/&gt;

Similarly, the endomorphism ring of the additive group '''Z''' is isomorphic to the ring '''Z'''.  Its automorphism group is isomorphic to the group of units of the ring '''Z''', i.e. to {{nowrap|{−1, +1} ≅ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

==Related classes of groups==
Several other classes of groups have been defined by their relation to the cyclic groups:

===Virtually cyclic groups===
A group is called '''virtually cyclic''' if it contains a cyclic subgroup of finite [[index (group theory)|index]] (the number of [[coset]]s that the subgroup has). In other words, any element in a virtually cyclic group can be arrived at by applying a member of the cyclic subgroup to a member in a certain finite set. Every cyclic group is virtually cyclic, as is every finite group. An infinite group is virtually cyclic if and only if it is [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] and has exactly two [[End (graph theory)|ends]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Locally cyclic groups===
{{main|Locally cyclic group}}
A [[locally cyclic group]] is a group in which each [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] subgroup is cyclic.
An example is the additive group of the [[rational number]]s: every finite set of rational numbers is a set of integer multiples of a single [[unit fraction]], the inverse of their [[lowest common denominator]], and generates as a subgroup a cyclic group of integer multiples of this unit fraction.
A group is locally cyclic if and only if its [[lattice of subgroups]] is a [[distributive lattice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Cyclically ordered groups===
{{main|Cyclically ordered group}}
A [[cyclically ordered group]] is a group together with a [[cyclic order]] preserved by the group structure.
Every cyclic group can be given a structure as a cyclically ordered group, consistent with the ordering of the integers (or the integers modulo the order of the group).
Every finite subgroup of a cyclically ordered group is cyclic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Partially Ordered Algebraic Systems|volume=28|series=International series of monographs in pure and applied mathematics|first=László|last=Fuchs|authorlink=László Fuchs|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2011|isbn=9780486483870|page=63|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V_k79sVPcqYC&amp;pg=PA63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metacyclic and polycyclic groups===
A [[metacyclic group]] is a group containing a cyclic [[normal subgroup]] whose quotient is also cyclic.&lt;ref&gt;{{springer|id=M/m063550|title=Metacyclic group|author=A. L. Shmel'kin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These groups include the cyclic groups, the [[dicyclic group]]s, and the [[direct product]]s of two cyclic groups.
The [[polycyclic group]]s generalize metacyclic groups by allowing more than one level of group extension. A group is polycyclic if it has a finite descending sequence of subgroups, each of which is normal in the previous subgroup with a cyclic quotient, ending in the trivial group. Every finitely generated [[abelian group]] or [[nilpotent group]] is polycyclic.&lt;ref&gt;{{SpringerEOM|id=p/p073560|title=Polycyclic group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Snowflake8.png|thumb|A snowflake has Dih&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; dihedral symmetry, the same as a regular hexagon.]]

A '''dihedral group''' is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon, including both rotations and reflections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Dummit | first1=David S. | last2=Foote | first2=Richard M. | title=Abstract Algebra | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | year=2004 | edition=3rd | isbn=0-471-43334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry. It is well-known and easy to prove that a group generated by two involutions on a finite domain is a dihedral group.

{{See also|Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions}}

==Notation==

There are two competing notations for the dihedral group associated to a polygon with ''n'' sides.  In geometry the group is denoted D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, while in algebra the same group is denoted by D&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to indicate the number of elements. Coxeter notation is another notation, denoting the reflectional dihedral symmetry as [n], order 2n, and rotational dihedral symmetry as [n]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, order n. Orbifold notation gives the reflective symmetry as *''n''&amp;bull; and rotational symmetry as ''n''&amp;bull;.

In this article, D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (and sometimes Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) refers to the symmetries of a regular polygon with ''n'' sides.

==Definition==

===Elements===
[[File:Hexagon Reflections.png|thumb|The six [[reflection symmetry|reflection symmetries]] of a regular hexagon]]
A regular polygon with ''n'' sides has 2''n'' different symmetries: ''n'' [[rotational symmetry|rotational symmetries]] and ''n'' [[reflection symmetry|reflection symmetries]]. The associated [[rotation]]s and [[reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] make up the dihedral group D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. If ''n'' is odd each axis of symmetry connects the midpoint of one side to the opposite vertex. If ''n'' is even there are ''n''/2 axes of symmetry connecting the midpoints of opposite sides and ''n''/2 axes of symmetry connecting opposite vertices. In either case, there are ''n'' axes of symmetry altogether and 2''n'' elements in the symmetry group. Reflecting in one axis of symmetry followed by reflecting in another axis of symmetry produces a rotation through twice the angle between the axes. The following picture shows the effect of the sixteen elements of D&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; on a [[stop sign]]:

[[File:Dihedral8.png|550px]]

The first row shows the effect of the eight rotations, and the second row shows the effect of the eight reflections.

===Group structure===
As with any geometric object, the [[composition of functions|composition]] of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry.  This operation gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a [[group (mathematics)|finite group]].

[[File:Labeled Triangle Reflections.svg|thumb]]
[[File:Two Reflection Rotation.svg|thumb|The composition of these two reflections is a rotation.]]
The following [[Cayley table]] shows the effect of composition in the group [[Dihedral group of order 6|D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] (the symmetries of an [[equilateral triangle]]).  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the identity; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denote counterclockwise rotations by 120 and 240 degrees;  and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denote reflections across the three lines shown in the picture to the right.

|}

For example, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because the reflection ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; followed by the reflection ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; results in a 120-degree rotation.  (This is the normal backwards order for [[composition of functions|composition]].)  Note that the composition operation is not [[commutativity|commutative]].

In general, the group D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has elements ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, with composition given by the following formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;R_i\,R_j = R_{i+j},\;\;\;\;R_i\,S_j = S_{i+j},\;\;\;\;S_i\,R_j = S_{i-j},\;\;\;\;S_i\,S_j = R_{i-j}.&lt;/math&gt;

In all cases, addition and subtraction of subscripts should be performed using [[modular arithmetic]]  with modulus ''n''.

===Matrix representation===
[[File:Pentagon Linear.png|thumb|The symmetries of this pentagon are [[linear transformation]]s.]]
If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as [[linear map|linear transformations]] of the [[Cartesian coordinate system|plane]].  This lets us represent elements of D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], with composition being [[matrix multiplication]].
This is an example of a (2-dimensional) [[group representation]].

For example, the elements of the group [[Dihedral group of order 8|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] can be represented by the following eight matrices:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
R_0=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}1&amp;0\\[0.2em]0&amp;1\end{smallmatrix}\bigr), &amp;
R_1=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;-1\\[0.2em]1&amp;0\end{smallmatrix}\bigr), &amp;
R_2=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}-1&amp;0\\[0.2em]0&amp;-1\end{smallmatrix}\bigr), &amp;
R_3=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;1\\[0.2em]-1&amp;0\end{smallmatrix}\bigr), \\[1em]
S_0=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}1&amp;0\\[0.2em]0&amp;-1\end{smallmatrix}\bigr), &amp;
S_1=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;1\\[0.2em]1&amp;0\end{smallmatrix}\bigr), &amp;
S_2=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}-1&amp;0\\[0.2em]0&amp;1\end{smallmatrix}\bigr), &amp;
S_3=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;-1\\[0.2em]-1&amp;0\end{smallmatrix}\bigr).
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the matrices for elements of D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; have the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;  \begin{align}
           R_k &amp; = \begin{pmatrix}
                       \cos \frac{2\pi k}{n} &amp; -\sin \frac{2\pi k}{n} \\
                       \sin \frac{2\pi k}{n} &amp; \cos \frac{2\pi k}{n}                   \end{pmatrix}
                   \ \ \text{and} \\
           S_k &amp; =  \begin{pmatrix}
                       \cos \frac{2\pi k}{n}  &amp; \sin \frac{2\pi k}{n} \\
                       \sin \frac{2\pi k}{n} &amp; -\cos \frac{2\pi k}{n}                    \end{pmatrix}
                    .
          \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

''R&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[rotation matrix]], expressing a counterclockwise rotation through an angle of  {{nowrap| 2''&amp;pi;k'' &amp;frasl; ''n''}}.  ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a reflection across a line that makes an angle of {{nowrap| ''&amp;pi;k'' &amp;frasl; ''n''}} with the ''x''-axis.

==Small dihedral groups==
[[File:Regular hexagon symmetries.png|thumb|Example subgroups from a hexagonal dihedral symmetry]]
For ''n'' = 1  we have Dih&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This notation is rarely used except in the framework of the series, because it is equal to Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For ''n'' = 2  we have Dih&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Klein four-group]]. Both are exceptional within the series:
*They are [[abelian group|abelian]]; for all other values of ''n'' the group  Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''not'' abelian.
*They are ''not'' [[subgroup]]s of the [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, corresponding to the fact that 2''n'' &gt; ''n'' ! for these ''n''.

The [[cycle graph (group)|cycle graphs]] of dihedral groups consist of an ''n''-element cycle and ''n'' 2-element cycles. The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups stand for the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group. A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the [[identity element]].

==The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D==
An example of abstract group Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and a common way to visualize it, is the group ''D&lt;sub&gt;n''&lt;/sub&gt; of [[Euclidean plane isometry|Euclidean plane isometries]] which keep the origin fixed. These groups form one of the two series of discrete [[point groups in two dimensions]]. ''D&lt;sub&gt;n''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of ''n'' [[rotation]]s of multiples of 360°/''n'' about the origin, and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s across ''n'' lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of 180°/''n'' with each other. This is the [[symmetry group]] of a [[regular polygon]] with ''n'' sides (for n&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3; this extends to the cases ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the &quot;center&quot; of the &quot;1-gon&quot; and a &quot;2-gon&quot; or line segment).

Dihedral group ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[generating set of a group|generated]] by a rotation ''r'' of [[order (group theory)|order]] ''n'' and a reflection ''s'' of order 2 such that

:&lt;math&gt;srs = r^{-1} \, &lt;/math&gt;

In geometric terms: in the mirror a rotation looks like an inverse rotation.

In terms of [[complex numbers]]: multiplication by &lt;math&gt;e^{2\pi i \over n}&lt;/math&gt; and [[complex conjugation]].

In matrix form, by setting

:&lt;math&gt;r_1 = \begin{bmatrix}\cos{2\pi \over n} &amp; -\sin{2\pi \over n} \\[8pt] \sin{2\pi \over n} &amp; \cos{2\pi \over n}\end{bmatrix} \qquad s_0 = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and defining &lt;math&gt;r_j = r_1^j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_j = r_j \, s_0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j \in \{1,\ldots,n-1\}&lt;/math&gt; we can write the product rules for &amp;nbsp;''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;r_j \, r_k = r_{(j+k) \text{ mod }n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_j \, s_k = s_{(j+k) \text{ mod }n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_j \, r_k =s_{(j-k) \text{ mod }n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_j \, s_k = r_{(j-k) \text{ mod }n}.&lt;/math&gt;

(Compare [[coordinate rotations and reflections]].)

The dihedral group ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is generated by the rotation ''r'' of 180 degrees, and the reflection ''s'' across the ''x''-axis. The elements of ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can then be represented as {''e'',&amp;nbsp;''r'',&amp;nbsp;''s'',&amp;nbsp;''rs''}, where ''e'' is the identity or null transformation and ''rs'' is the reflection across the ''y''-axis.

[[File:Dihedral4.png|thumb|500px|The four elements of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (x-axis is vertical here)]]

''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Klein four-group]].

For n&gt;2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not [[commutative|commute]] and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is not [[abelian group|abelian]]; for example, in [[Dihedral group of order 8|''D''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.

[[File:d8isNonAbelian.png|thumb|500px|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is nonabelian (x-axis is vertical here).]]

Thus, beyond their obvious application to problems of [[symmetry]] in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.

The 2''n'' elements of D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be written as ''e'', ''r'', ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''s'', ''r s'', ''r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s'',&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''s''. The first ''n'' listed elements are rotations and the remaining ''n'' elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order&amp;nbsp;2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.

So far, we have considered ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to be a [[subgroup]] of [[orthogonal group|O(2)]], i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is also used for a subgroup of [[SO(3)]] which is also of abstract group type Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: the [[symmetry group|proper symmetry group]] of a ''regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space'' (if ''n'' ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore it is also called a ''dihedron'' (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name ''dihedral group'' (in analogy to ''tetrahedral'', ''octahedral'' and ''icosahedral group'', referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular [[tetrahedron]], [[octahedron]], and [[icosahedron]] respectively).

===Examples of 2D dihedral symmetry===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Equivalent definitions==
Further equivalent definitions of Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are:

* The [[automorphism group]] of the [[graph theory|graph]] consisting only of a cycle with ''n'' vertices (if ''n'' ≥ 3).
* The group with [[presentation of a group|presentation]]
::&lt;math&gt;D_{n}=\langle r, s \mid r^n = 1, s^2 = 1, s^{-1}rs = r^{-1} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:or
::&lt;math&gt;D_n=\langle x, y \mid x^n = y^2 = (xy)^2 = 1 \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

 
:From the second presentation follows that Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; belongs to the class of [[Coxeter group]]s.
* The [[semidirect product]] of [[cyclic group]]s Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acting on Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; by [[Inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]] (thus, Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; always has a [[normal subgroup]] isomorphic to the group Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n \rtimes_\varphi \mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\varphi(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the identity and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1)&lt;/math&gt; is  inversion.

==Properties==

The properties of the dihedral groups Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''n'' ≥ 3 depend on whether ''n'' is even or odd. For example, the [[center of a group|center]] of Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consists only of the identity if ''n'' is odd, but if ''n'' is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; (with D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as a subgroup of O(2), this is [[Inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]]; since it is [[scalar multiplication]] by &amp;minus;1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).

For odd ''n'', the abstract group Dih&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic with the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.

If ''m'' [[divisor|divides]] ''n'', then Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has ''n / m'' [[subgroup]]s of type Dih&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, and one subgroup Z&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore the total number of subgroups of Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1), is equal to ''d''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;σ(''n''), where ''d''(''n'') is the number of positive [[divisor]]s of ''n'' and σ(''n'') is the sum of the positive divisors of&amp;nbsp;''n''.  See [[list of small groups]] for the cases&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;8.

===Conjugacy classes of reflections===
All the reflections are [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other in case ''n'' is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if ''n'' is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular ''n''-gon: for odd ''n'' there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even ''n'' only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.

Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate [[Sylow theorem]] (for ''n'' odd): for ''n'' odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a [[Sylow subgroup|Sylow 2-subgroup]] (&lt;math&gt;2=2^1&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum power of 2 dividing &lt;math&gt;2n=2(2k+1)&lt;/math&gt;), while for ''n'' even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.

For ''n'' even there is instead an [[outer automorphism]] interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).

==Automorphism group==
The automorphism group of Dih&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to the [[Holomorph (mathematics)|holomorph]] of Z/nZ, i.e. to Hol(Z/nZ) &lt;math&gt;=\{ax + b \mid (a,n) = 1\}&lt;/math&gt; and has order &lt;math&gt;n\phi(n),&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is Euler's [[totient]] function, the number of ''k'' in &lt;math&gt;1,\dots,n-1&lt;/math&gt; coprime to ''n''.

It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by &lt;math&gt;k(2\pi/n)&lt;/math&gt;, for ''k'' [[coprime]] to ''n''); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of ''n''.
* For ''n'' odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for ''n'' even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.
* Thus for ''n'' odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2''n,'' and for ''n'' even the inner automorphism group has order ''n.''
* For ''n'' odd, all reflections are conjugate; for ''n'' even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by &lt;math&gt;\pi/n&lt;/math&gt; (half the minimal rotation).
* The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by ''k'' (coprime to ''n'') are outer unless &lt;math&gt;k=\pm 1.&lt;/math&gt;

===Examples of automorphism groups===
Dih&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; has 18 [[inner automorphism]]s. As 2D isometry group ''D''&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 [[outer automorphism]]s, e.g. multiplying angles of rotation by 2.

Dih&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group ''D''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms, e.g. multiplying rotations by 3.

Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler's totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo n for ''n'' = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).

==Generalizations==
There are several important generalizations of the dihedral groups:
* The infinite dihedral group is an infinite group with algebraic structure similar to the finite dihedral groups.  It can be viewed as the group of symmetries of the integers.
* The orthogonal group ''O''(2), i.e. the symmetry group of the circle, also has similar properties to the dihedral groups.
* The family of generalized dihedral groups includes both of the examples above, as well as many other groups.
* The quasidihedral groups are family of finite groups with similar properties to the dihedral groups.

{{Group theory sidebar |Finite}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''alternating group''' is the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of [[even permutation]]s of a [[finite set]]. The alternating group on the set {1,...,''n''} is called the '''alternating group of degree ''n''''', or the '''alternating group on ''n'' letters''' and denoted by ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or Alt(''n'').

== Basic properties ==

For {{nowrap|1=''n'' &gt; 1}}, the group ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[commutator subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 and has therefore [[factorial|''n''!]]/2 elements. It is the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the signature [[group homomorphism]] {{nowrap|sgn : ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → {1, −1} }} explained under [[symmetric group]].

The group ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[abelian group|abelian]] [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ 3}} and [[simple group|simple]] if and only if {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} or {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}}.&lt;!-- Note A3 is in fact a simple group of order 3. A1 and A2 are groups of order 1, so not usually called simple, and A4 has a non-identity proper normal subgroup so is not simple. --&gt;  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the smallest non-abelian [[simple group]], having order 60, and the smallest non-[[solvable group]].

The group ''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has a [[Klein four-group]] V as a proper [[normal subgroup]], namely the double transpositions {{nowrap|{ (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23) },}} and maps to {{nowrap|1=''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, from the sequence {{nowrap|1=V → ''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In [[Galois theory]], this map, or rather the corresponding map {{nowrap|''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, corresponds to associating the [[Lagrange resolvent]] cubic to a quartic, which allows the [[quartic polynomial]] to be solved by radicals, as established by [[Lodovico Ferrari]].

== Conjugacy classes ==

As in the [[symmetric group]], the [[conjugacy class]]es in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consist of elements with the same [[cycle decomposition (group theory)|cycle shape]]. However, if the cycle shape consists only of cycles of odd length with no two cycles the same length, where cycles of length one are included in the cycle type, then there are exactly two conjugacy classes for this cycle shape {{harv|Scott|1987|loc=&amp;sect;11.1, p299}}.

Examples:
*the two [[permutation]]s (123) and (132) are not conjugates in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, although they have the same cycle shape, and are therefore conjugate in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
*the permutation (123)(45678) is not conjugate to its inverse (132)(48765) in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, although the two permutations have the same cycle shape, so they are conjugate in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Automorphism group ==

| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{C}_2 \times \mathrm{C}_2&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 3}}, except for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}, the  [[automorphism group]] of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, with [[inner automorphism group]] ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and [[outer automorphism group]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; the outer automorphism comes from conjugation by an odd permutation.

For ''n'' = 1 and 2, the automorphism group is trivial. For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} the automorphism group is '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with trivial inner automorphism group and outer automorphism group '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The outer automorphism group of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Klein four-group|the Klein four-group]] {{nowrap|1=V = '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and is related to [[Symmetric group#Automorphism group|the outer automorphism of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The extra outer automorphism in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; swaps the 3-cycles (like (123)) with elements of shape 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (like (123)(456)).

== Exceptional isomorphisms ==

There are some [[exceptional isomorphism]]s between some of the small alternating groups and small [[groups of Lie type]], particularly [[projective special linear group]]s. These are:
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to PSL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3)&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson-p78&quot;&gt;Robinson (1996), {{Google books quote|id=lqyCjUFY6WAC|page=78|text=PSL|p. 78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[symmetry group]] of chiral [[tetrahedral symmetry]].
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to PSL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(4), PSL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5), and the symmetry group of chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. (See &lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson-p78&quot;/&gt; for an indirect isomorphism of {{nowrap|PSL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) → ''A''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} using a classification of simple groups of order 60, and [[Projective linear group#Action on p points|here]] for a direct proof).
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to PSL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(9) and PSp&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2)'
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to PSL&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2)

More obviously, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to the [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are isomorphic to the [[trivial group]] (which is also {{nowrap|1=SL&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') = PSL&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'')}} for any ''q'').

&lt;!-- This part has a few errors, comment out until they are fixed. A4 is not perfect, SL(4,2)=PSL(4,2)=A8 is not the Schur cover of A8 --&gt;

&lt;!--
The associated extensions &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SL}_n(q) \to \operatorname{PSL}_n(q)&lt;/math&gt; are [[universal perfect central extension]]s for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_4,\mathrm{A}_5,\mathrm{A}_8&lt;/math&gt;, by uniqueness of the universal perfect central extension;
for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(9) \cong \mathrm{A}_6&lt;/math&gt;, the associated extension is a perfect central extension, but not universal: there is a 3-fold [[Schur multiplier|covering group]].

|}

==Subgroups==
''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the smallest group demonstrating that the converse of [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] is not true in general: given a finite group ''G'' and a divisor ''d'' of |''G''|, there does not necessarily exist a subgroup of ''G'' with order ''d'': the group {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, of order 12, has no subgroup of order 6. A subgroup of three elements (generated by a cyclic rotation of three objects) with any additional element generates the whole group.

==Group homology==
{{see also|Symmetric group#Homology}}
The [[group homology]] of the alternating groups exhibits stabilization, as in [[stable homotopy theory]]: for sufficiently large ''n'', it is constant. However, there are some low-dimensional exceptional homology. Note that the [[Symmetric group#Homology|homology of the symmetric group]] exhibits similar stabilization, but without the low-dimensional exceptions (additional homology elements).

=== H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: Abelianization ===
The first [[homology group]] coincides with [[abelianization]], and (since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_n&lt;/math&gt; is [[perfect group|perfect]], except for the cited exceptions) is thus:
:&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{A}_n,\mathbf{Z})=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n=0,1,2&lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{A}_3,\mathbf{Z})=\mathrm{A}_3^{\text{ab}} = \mathrm{A}_3 = \mathbf{Z}/3&lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{A}_4,\mathbf{Z})=\mathrm{A}_4^{\text{ab}} = \mathbf{Z}/3&lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{A}_n,\mathbf{Z})=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 5&lt;/math&gt;.

This is easily seen directly, as follows. &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_n&lt;/math&gt; is generated by 3-cycles – so the only non-trivial abelianization maps are &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_n \to \mathrm{C}_3,&lt;/math&gt; since order 3 elements must map to order 3 elements – and for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 5&lt;/math&gt; all 3-cycles are conjugate, so they must map to the same element in the abelianization, since conjugation is trivial in abelian groups. Thus a 3-cycle like (123) must map to the same element as its inverse (321), but thus must map to the identity, as it must then have order dividing 2 and 3, so the abelianization is trivial.

For &lt;math&gt;n &lt; 3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_n&lt;/math&gt; is trivial, and thus has trivial abelianization. For &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_4&lt;/math&gt; one can compute the abelianization directly, noting that the 3-cycles form two conjugacy classes (rather than all being conjugate) and there are non-trivial maps &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_3 \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{C}_3&lt;/math&gt; (in fact an isomorphism) and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_4 \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{C}_3.&lt;/math&gt;

=== H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: Schur multipliers ===
{{main|Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups}}
The [[Schur multiplier]]s of the alternating groups ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (in the case where ''n'' is at least 5) are the cyclic groups of order 2, except in the case where ''n'' is either 6 or 7, in which case there is also a triple cover. In these cases, then, the Schur multiplier is (the cyclic group) of order 6.&lt;ref name=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;{{citation

{{distinguish|Cosette}}

[[File:Left cosets of Z 2 in Z 8.svg|thumb|G is the group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Integers_modulo_n|integers mod 8]] under addition. The subgroup H contains only 0 and 4, and is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. There are four left cosets of H: H itself, 1+H, 2+H, and 3+H (written using additive notation since this is the [[Ring (mathematics)#Definition and illustration|additive group]]). Together they partition the entire group G into equal-size, non-overlapping sets. The index [G : H] is 4.]]

In [[mathematics]], if ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]], and ''H'' is a [[subgroup]] of ''G'', and ''g'' is an element of ''G'', then
:''gH'' = {''gh'' : ''h'' an element of ''H''&amp;thinsp;} is a '''left coset of ''H''''' in ''G'', and
:''Hg'' = {''hg'' : ''h'' an element of ''H''&amp;thinsp;} is a '''right coset of ''H''''' in ''G''.
Only when ''H'' is [[normal subgroup|normal]] will the right and left cosets of ''H'' coincide, which is one definition of normality of a [[subgroup]]. Although derived from a subgroup, cosets are not usually themselves subgroups of ''G'', only subsets.

A '''coset''' is a left or right coset of ''some'' [[subgroup]] in ''G''. Since ''Hg'' = ''g''&amp;thinsp;(&amp;thinsp;''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Hg''&amp;thinsp;), the right coset ''Hg'' (of ''H'',&amp;thinsp; with respect to ''g'') and the left coset ''g''&amp;thinsp;(&amp;thinsp;''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Hg''&amp;thinsp;) (of the [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] subgroup ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Hg''&amp;thinsp;) are the same. Hence it is not meaningful to speak of a coset as being left or right unless one first specifies the underlying [[subgroup]].  In other words: a right coset of one subgroup equals a left coset of a different (conjugate) subgroup.  If the left cosets and right cosets are the same then H is a [[normal subgroup]] and the cosets form a group called the [[quotient group|''quotient'' or ''factor'' group]].

The map
''gH''→(''gH'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;=''Hg''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; defines a [[bijection]] between the left cosets and the right cosets of H, so the number of left cosets is equal to the number of right cosets. The common value is called the [[Index of a subgroup|index]] of ''H'' in ''G''.

For [[abelian group]]s, left cosets and right cosets are always the same. If the group operation is written additively then the notation used changes to ''g''+''H'' or ''H''+''g''.

Cosets are a basic tool in the study of groups; for example they play a central role in [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]].

==Examples==
==={-1,1}===
Let ''G'' be the multiplicative group of {-1,1}, and ''H'' the trivial subgroup {1}. Then {-1} = (-1)''H'' = ''H''(-1) and {1} = 1''H'' = ''H''1 are the only cosets of ''H'' in ''G''. Because {1} is a normal subgroup of ''G'', the left and right cosets coincide and therefore do not need to be distinguished in this example.

===Integers===
Let ''G'' be the additive group of integers '''Z''' = {..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...} and ''H'' the subgroup ''m'''''Z''' = {..., −2''m'', −''m'', 0, ''m'', 2''m'', ...} where ''m'' is a positive integer. Then the cosets of ''H'' in ''G'' are the ''m'' sets ''m'''''Z''', ''m'''''Z'''+1, ... ''m'''''Z'''+(''m''−1), where ''m'''''Z'''+''a''={..., −2''m''+''a'', −''m''+''a'', ''a'', ''m''+''a'', 2''m''+''a'', ...}. There are no more than ''m'' cosets, because ''m'''''Z'''+''m''=''m''('''Z'''+1)=''m'''''Z'''. The coset ''m'''''Z'''+''a'' is the [[Modular arithmetic|congruence class]] of ''a'' modulo ''m''.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vectors===
Another example of a coset comes from the theory of [[vector space]]s. The elements (vectors) of a vector space form an [[abelian group]] under [[vector addition]]. It is not hard to show that [[linear subspace|subspaces]] of a vector space are [[subgroups]] of this group.  For a vector space ''V'', a subspace ''W'', and a fixed vector ''a'' in ''V'', the sets&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in V \colon x = a + n, n \in W\}&lt;/math&gt;
are called [[affine subspace]]s, and are cosets (both left and right, since the group is abelian).  In terms of [[Euclidean space|geometric]] vectors, these affine subspaces are all the &quot;lines&quot; or &quot;planes&quot; [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the subspace, which is a line or plane going through the origin.

==Definition using equivalence classes==
Some authors&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Zassenhaus&lt;/ref&gt; define the left cosets of H in G to be the [[equivalence class]]es under the [[equivalence relation]] on ''G'' given by ''x''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''y'' if and only if ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''y'' ∈ ''H''. The relation can also be defined by ''x''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''y'' if and only if ''xh''=''y'' for some ''h'' in ''H''. It can be shown that the relation given is, in fact, an [[equivalence relation]] and that the two definitions are equivalent. It follows that any two left cosets of ''H'' in ''G'' are either identical or [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]]. In other words every element of ''G'' belongs to one and only one left coset and so the left cosets form a [[partition of a set|partition]] of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi Corrolary 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding statements are true for right cosets.

==Double cosets==
{{main|Double coset}}
Given two subgroups, ''H'' and ''K'' of a group ''G'', the '''double coset''' of ''H'' and ''K'' in ''G'' are sets of the form ''HgK'' = {''hgk'' : ''h'' an element of ''H '', ''k'' an element of ''K'' }. These are the left cosets of ''K'' and right cosets of ''H'' when ''H''=1 and ''K''=1 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Scott p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==

Let ''G'' be a group with subgroups ''H'' and ''K.''
#&lt;math&gt; G/H &lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of left cosets &lt;math&gt;\{gH: g \in G\}&lt;/math&gt; of ''H'' in ''G.''
#&lt;math&gt; H\backslash G &lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of right cosets &lt;math&gt;\{Hg: g \in G\}&lt;/math&gt; of ''H'' in ''G.''
#&lt;math&gt; K\backslash G/H &lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of double cosets &lt;math&gt;\{KgH: g \in G\}&lt;/math&gt; of ''H'' and ''K'' in ''G.''

==General properties==
The identity is in precisely one left or right coset, namely ''H'' itself. Thus ''H'' is both a left and right coset of itself.

A '''coset representative''' is a representative in the equivalence class sense. A set of representatives of all the cosets is called a [[Transversal (combinatorics)|transversal]].  There are other types of equivalence relations in a group, such as conjugacy, that form different classes which do not have the properties discussed here.

===Index of a subgroup===
{{Main|Index of a subgroup}}
All left cosets and all right cosets have the same [[order (group theory)|order]] (number of elements, or [[cardinality]] in the case of an [[Infinity|infinite]] ''H''), equal to the order of ''H'' (because ''H'' is itself a coset). Furthermore, the number of left cosets is equal to the number of right cosets and is known as the '''index''' of ''H'' in ''G'', written as [''G'' : ''H''&amp;thinsp;]. [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] allows us to compute the index in the case where ''G'' and ''H'' are finite, as per the formula:
:|''G''&amp;thinsp;| = [''G'' : ''H''&amp;thinsp;] · |''H''&amp;thinsp;|.
This equation also holds in the case where the groups are infinite, although the meaning may be less clear.

===Cosets and normality===
If ''H'' is not [[normal subgroup|normal]] in ''G'', then its left cosets are different from its right cosets. That is, there is an ''a'' in ''G'' such that no element ''b'' satisfies ''aH'' = ''Hb''. This means that the partition of ''G'' into the left cosets of ''H'' is a different partition than the partition of ''G'' into right cosets of ''H''. (It is important to note that ''some'' cosets may coincide. For example, if ''a'' is in the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G'', then ''aH'' = ''Ha''.)

On the other hand, the subgroup ''N'' is normal if and only if ''gN'' = ''Ng'' for all ''g'' in ''G''. In this case, the set of all cosets form a group called the [[quotient group]] ''G''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''N'' with the operation ∗ defined by (''aN''&amp;thinsp;)∗(''bN''&amp;thinsp;) = ''abN''. Since every right coset is a left coset, there is no need to differentiate &quot;left cosets&quot; from &quot;right cosets&quot;.

==Applications==
*Cosets of '''Q''' in '''R''' are used in the construction of [[Vitali set]]s, a type of [[non-measurable set]].
*Cosets are central in the definition of the [[Transfer (group theory)|transfer]].
*Cosets are important in computational group theory. For example [[Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube#Thistlethwaite's algorithm|Thistlethwaite's algorithm]] for solving [[Rubik's Cube]] relies heavily on cosets.
*[[Coset leader]]s are used in decoding received data in [[Linear code|linear error-correcting codes]].

{{Technical|date=March 2014}}
In [[mathematics]], specifically [[group theory]], a '''quotient group''' (or '''factor group''') is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] obtained by aggregating similar elements of a larger group using an [[equivalence relation]].  For example, the [[cyclic group]] of [[modular arithmetic|addition modulo ''n'']] can be obtained from the [[integer]]s by identifying elements that differ by a multiple of ''n'' and defining a group structure that operates on each such class (known as a [[congruence class]]) as a single entity.

In a quotient of a group, the [[equivalence class]] of the [[identity element]] is always a [[normal subgroup]] of the original group, and the other equivalence classes are precisely the [[coset]]s of that normal subgroup.  The resulting quotient is written '''{{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}}''', where ''G'' is the original group and ''N'' is the normal subgroup.  (This is pronounced &quot;''G'' mod ''N'',&quot; where &quot;mod&quot; is short for [[modular arithmetic|modulo]].)

Much of the importance of quotient groups is derived from their relation to [[group homomorphism|homomorphisms]].  The [[isomorphism theorem#First isomorphism theorem|first isomorphism theorem]] states that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of any group ''G'' under a homomorphism is always [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a quotient of ''G''.  Specifically, the image of ''G'' under a homomorphism {{nowrap|''φ'': ''G'' → ''H''}} is isomorphic to {{nowrap|''G'' / ker(''φ'')}} where ker(''φ'') denotes the [[kernel (algebra)#Group homomorphisms|kernel]] of ''φ''.

The [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] notion of a quotient group is a [[subgroup]], these being the two primary ways of forming a smaller group from a larger one. Any normal subgroup has a corresponding quotient group, formed from the larger group by eliminating the distinction between elements of the subgroup. In [[category theory]], quotient groups are examples of [[quotient object]]s, which are [[dual (category theory)|dual]] to [[subobject]]s.  For other examples of quotient objects, see [[quotient ring]], [[quotient space (linear algebra)]], [[quotient space|quotient space (topology)]], and [[quotient set]].

==Product of subsets of a group==
{{main|Product of group subsets}}
In the following discussion, we will use a binary operation on the ''subsets'' of ''G'': if two subsets ''S'' and ''T'' of ''G'' are given, we define their product as {{nowrap|1=''ST'' = {''st'' : ''s'' ∈ ''S'' ∧ ''t'' ∈ ''T''} }}.  This operation is [[associative]] and has as [[identity element]] the [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {''e''}, where ''e'' is the identity element of ''G''. Thus, the set of all subsets of ''G'' forms a [[monoid]] under this operation.

In terms of this operation we can first explain what a quotient group is, and then explain what a normal subgroup is:

:''A quotient group of a group ''G'' is a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of ''G'' which is itself a group under this operation''.

It is fully determined by the subset containing ''e''. A [[normal subgroup]] of ''G'' is the set containing ''e'' in any such partition. The subsets in the partition are the [[coset]]s of this normal subgroup.

A subgroup ''N'' of a group ''G'' is normal [[if and only if]] the coset equality ''aN'' = ''Na'' holds for all ''a'' in ''G''. In terms of the binary operation on subsets defined above, a normal subgroup of ''G'' is a subgroup that commutes with every subset of ''G'' and is denoted {{nowrap|''N'' ◁ ''G''}}.  A subgroup that permutes with every subgroup of ''G'' is called a [[permutable subgroup]].

==Definition==
Let ''N'' be a [[normal subgroup]] of a group ''G''. We define the set ''G''/''N'' to be the set of all left [[coset]]s of ''N'' in ''G'', i.e., {{nowrap|1=''G''/''N'' = { ''aN'' : ''a'' in ''G'' } }}.  The group operation on ''G''/''N'' is the product of subsets defined above. In other words, for each ''aN'' and ''bN'' in ''G''/''N'', the product of ''aN'' and ''bN'' is (''aN'')(''bN''). This operation is closed, because (''aN'')(''bN'') really is a left coset:

:(''aN'')(''bN'') = ''a''(''Nb'')''N'' = ''a''(''bN'')''N'' = (''ab'')''NN'' = (''ab'')''N''.

The normality of ''N'' is used in this equation.  Because of the normality of ''N'', the left cosets and right cosets of ''N'' in ''G'' are equal, and so ''G''/''N'' could be defined as the set of right cosets of ''N'' in ''G''.  Because the operation is derived from the product of subsets of ''G'', the operation is [[well-defined]] (does not depend on the particular choice of representatives), associative, and has identity element ''N''.  The inverse of an element ''aN'' of ''G''/''N'' is ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''N''.

For example, consider the group with addition modulo 6:

: ''G'' = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

Let

: ''N'' = {0, 3}.

The quotient group is:

: ''G''/''N'' = { ''aN'' : ''a'' &amp;isin; G } = { ''a''{0, 3} : ''a'' &amp;isin; {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} } =
:: { 0{0, 3}, 1{0, 3}, 2{0, 3}, 3{0, 3}, 4{0, 3}, 5{0, 3} } =
:: { {(0+0) mod 6, (0+3) mod 6}, {(1+0) mod 6, (1+3) mod 6},
::: {(2+0) mod 6, (2+3) mod 6}, {(3+0) mod 6, (3+3) mod 6},
::: {(4+0) mod 6, (4+3) mod 6}, {(5+0) mod 6, (5+3) mod 6} } =
:: { {0, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 5}, {3, 0}, {4, 1}, {5, 2} } =
:: { {0, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 5}, {0, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 5} } =
:: { {0, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 5} }.

The basic argument above is still valid if ''G''/''N'' is defined to be the set of all right [[coset]]s.

==Motivation for the name &quot;quotient&quot;==
The reason ''G''/''N'' is called a quotient group comes from [[division (mathematics)|division]] of [[integer]]s.  When dividing 12 by 3 one obtains the answer 4 because one can regroup 12 objects into 4 subcollections of 3 objects.  The quotient group is the same idea, however we end up with a group for a final answer instead of a number because groups have more structure than an arbitrary collection of objects.

To elaborate, when looking at ''G''/''N'' with ''N'' a normal subgroup of ''G'', the group structure is used to form a natural &quot;regrouping&quot;.  These are the cosets of ''N'' in ''G''.  Because we started with a group and normal subgroup, the final quotient contains more information than just the number of cosets (which is what regular division yields), but instead has a group structure itself.

==Examples==
[[File:Normal subgroup illustration.png|right|thumb|The cosets of the fourth [[roots of unity]] ''N'' in the twelfth roots of unity ''G''.]]

Consider the group of [[integer]]s '''Z''' (under addition) and the subgroup 2'''Z''' consisting of all even integers. This is a normal subgroup, because '''Z''' is [[abelian group|abelian]]. There are only two cosets: the set of even integers and the set of odd integers; therefore, the quotient group '''Z'''/2'''Z''' is the cyclic group with two elements.  This quotient group is isomorphic with the set {{nowrap|{ 0, 1 } }} with addition modulo 2; informally, it is sometimes said that '''Z'''/2'''Z''' ''equals'' the set {{nowrap|{ 0, 1 } }} with addition modulo 2.

A slight generalization of the last example. Once again consider the group of integers '''Z''' under addition.  Let ''n'' be any positive integer. We will consider the subgroup ''n'''''Z''' of '''Z''' consisting of all multiples of ''n''. Once again ''n'''''Z''' is normal in '''Z''' because '''Z''' is abelian. The cosets are the collection {''n'''''Z''', 1+''n'''''Z''', ..., (''n''−2)+''n'''''Z''', (''n''−1)+''n'''''Z'''}. An integer ''k'' belongs to the coset ''r''+''n'''''Z''', where ''r'' is the remainder when dividing ''k'' by ''n''. The quotient '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' can be thought of as the group of &quot;remainders&quot; modulo ''n''. This is a [[cyclic group]] of order ''n''.

The twelfth [[roots of unity]], which are points on the [[unit circle]], form a multiplicative abelian group ''G'', shown on the picture on the right as colored balls with the number at each point giving its complex argument. Consider its subgroup ''N'' made of the fourth roots of unity, shown as red balls. This normal subgroup splits the group into three cosets, shown in red, green and blue. One can check that the cosets form a group of three elements (the product of a red element with a blue element is blue, the inverse of a blue element is green, etc.). Thus, the quotient group ''G''/''N'' is the group of three colors, which turns out to be the cyclic group with three elements.

Consider the group of [[real number]]s '''R''' under addition, and the subgroup '''Z''' of integers. The cosets of '''Z''' in '''R''' are all sets of the form ''a''+'''Z''', with {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''a'' &lt; 1}} a real number. Adding such cosets is done by adding the corresponding real numbers, and subtracting 1 if the result is greater than or equal to 1. The quotient group '''R'''/'''Z''' is isomorphic to the [[circle group]] S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the group of [[complex number]]s of [[absolute value]] 1 under multiplication, or correspondingly, the group of [[rotation]]s in 2D about the origin, i.e., the special [[orthogonal group]] SO(2). An isomorphism is given by {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a''+'''Z''') = exp(2''πia'')}} (see [[Euler's identity]]).

If ''G'' is the group of invertible 3 × 3 real [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], and ''N'' is the subgroup of 3 × 3 real matrices with [[determinant]] 1, then ''N'' is normal in ''G'' (since it is the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the determinant [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]]). The cosets of ''N'' are the sets of matrices with a given determinant, and hence ''G''/''N'' is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of non-zero real numbers.

Consider the abelian group {{nowrap|1='''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = '''Z'''/4'''Z'''}} (that is, the set {{nowrap|{ 0, 1, 2, 3 } }} with addition [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 4), and its subgroup {{nowrap|{ 0, 2 } }}. The quotient group {{nowrap|'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/{ 0, 2 } }} is {{nowrap|{ { 0, 2 }, { 1, 3 } } }}.  This is a group with identity element {{nowrap|{ 0, 2 } }}, and group operations such as {{nowrap|1={ 0, 2 } + { 1, 3 } = { 1, 3 }}}.  Both the subgroup {{nowrap|{ 0, 2 } }} and the quotient group {{nowrap|{ { 0, 2 }, { 1, 3 } } }} are isomorphic with '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Consider the multiplicative group &lt;math&gt;G=\mathbf{Z}^*_{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The set ''N'' of ''n''th residues is a multiplicative subgroup isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}^*_{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''N'' is normal in ''G'' and the factor group ''G''/''N'' has the cosets ''N'', (1+''n'')''N'', (1+''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;N, ..., (1+''n'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;N. The [[Pallier cryptosystem]] is based on the [[conjecture]] that it is difficult to determine the coset of a random element of ''G'' without knowing the factorization of ''n''.

==Properties==
The quotient group {{nowrap|''G'' / ''G''}} is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial group]] (the group with one element), and {{nowrap|''G'' / {''e''} }} is isomorphic to ''G''.

The [[group order|order]] of {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}}, by definition the number of elements, is equal to {{nowrap|{{!}}''G'' : ''N''{{!}}}}, the [[index of a subgroup|index]] of ''N'' in ''G''. If ''G'' is finite, the index is also equal to the order of ''G'' divided by the order of ''N''. Note that {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}} may be finite, although both ''G'' and ''N'' are infinite (e.g. {{nowrap|'''Z''' / 2'''Z'''}}).

There is a &quot;natural&quot; [[surjective]] [[group homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''π'' : ''G'' → ''G'' / ''N''}}, sending each element ''g'' of ''G'' to the coset of ''N'' to which ''g'' belongs, that is: {{nowrap|1=''π''(''g'') = ''gN''}}. The mapping ''π'' is sometimes called the ''canonical projection of G onto {{nowrap|G / N}}''. Its [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is ''N''.

There is a bijective correspondence between the subgroups of ''G'' that contain ''N'' and the subgroups of {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}}; if ''H'' is a subgroup of ''G'' containing ''N'', then the corresponding subgroup of {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}} is ''π''(''H''). This correspondence holds for normal subgroups of ''G'' and {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}} as well, and is formalized in the [[lattice theorem]].

Several important properties of quotient groups are recorded in the [[fundamental theorem on homomorphisms]] and the [[isomorphism theorem]]s.

If ''G'' is [[abelian group|abelian]], [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] or [[solvable group|solvable]], then so is {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}}.

If ''G'' is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] or [[generating set of a group|finitely generated]], then so is {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}}.

If ''N'' is contained in the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G'', then ''G'' is called the [[Group extension%23Central extension|central extension]] of the quotient group.

If ''H'' is a subgroup in a finite group ''G'', and the order of ''H'' is one half of the order of ''G'', then ''H'' is guaranteed to be a normal subgroup, so {{nowrap|''G'' / ''H''}} exists and is isomorphic to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This result can also be stated as &quot;any subgroup of index 2 is normal&quot;, and in this form it applies also to infinite groups.

To extend the above, if ''p'' is the smallest prime number dividing the order of a finite group, ''G'', then if {{nowrap|''G'' / ''H''}} has order ''p'', ''H'' must be a normal subgroup of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dummit|Foote|2003|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Every finitely generated group is isomorphic to a quotient of a [[free group]].

Sometimes, but not necessarily, a group ''G'' can be reconstructed from {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}} and ''N'', as a [[direct product of groups|direct product]] or [[semidirect product]]. The problem of determining when this is the case is known as the [[extension problem]].  An example where it is ''not'' possible is as follows. {{nowrap|'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; / { 0, 2 } }} is isomorphic to '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and {{nowrap|{ 0, 2 } }} also, but the only semidirect product is the direct product, because '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has only the trivial [[automorphism]].  Therefore '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is different from {{nowrap|'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, cannot be reconstructed.

==Quotients of Lie groups==
If ''G'' is a [[Lie group]] and ''N'' is a normal [[Lie subgroup]] of ''G'', the quotient {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}} is also a Lie group.  In this case, the original group ''G'' has the structure of a [[fiber bundle]] (specifically, a [[principal bundle|principal ''N''-bundle]]), with base space {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}} and fiber ''N''.

For a non-normal Lie subgroup ''N'', the space {{nowrap|''G'' / ''N''}} of left cosets is not a group, but simply a [[differentiable manifold]] on which ''G'' acts.  The result is known as a [[homogeneous space]].

      <comment>/* Using prime factorizations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''greatest common divisor (gcd)''', also known as the '''greatest common denominator''', '''greatest common factor (gcf)''', or '''highest common factor (hcf)''', of two or more non-zero [[integer]]s, is the largest positive integer that [[divisor|divides]] the numbers without a [[remainder]]. 
For example, ''the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.''

This notion can be extended to polynomials, see [[greatest common divisor of two polynomials]].

== Overview ==
The greatest common divisor is useful for reducing [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s to be [[Irreducible fraction|in lowest terms]]. For example, gcd(42,&amp;nbsp;56)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;14, therefore, 

:&lt;math&gt;{42 \over 56}={3 \cdot 14 \over 4 \cdot 14}={3 \over 4}.&lt;/math&gt;

The greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'' is written as gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''), or sometimes simply as (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''). For example, gcd(12,&amp;nbsp;18)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6, gcd(&amp;minus;4,&amp;nbsp;14)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. Two numbers are called ''[[coprime]]'' or ''relatively prime'' if their greatest common divisor equals 1. For example, 9 and 28 are relatively prime.

== Calculating the gcd ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] --&gt;

=== Using Euclid's algorithm ===
A much more efficient method is the [[Euclidean algorithm]], which uses the [[division algorithm]] in combination with the observation that the gcd of two numbers also divides their difference: divide 48 by 18 to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 12. Then divide 18 by 12 to get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 6. Then divide 12 by 6 to get a remainder of 0, which means that 6 is the gcd.  Formally, it can be described as:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gcd}(a,0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gcd}(a,b) = \operatorname{gcd}(b,a - b \left\lfloor {a \over b} \right\rfloor).&lt;/math&gt;

Which also could be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gcd}(a,0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gcd}(a,b) = \operatorname{gcd}(b, a \mbox{ mod } b).&lt;/math&gt;

The series of quotients generated by the Euclidean algorithm composes a [[continued fraction]].

=== Other methods ===

If ''a'' and ''b'' are not both zero, the greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'' can be computed by using [[least common multiple]] (lcm) of ''a'' and&amp;nbsp;''b'':

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=\frac{a\cdot b}{\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Keith Slavin has shown that for odd ''a''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=\log_2\prod_{k=0}^{a-1} (1+e^{-2i\pi k b/a})&lt;/math&gt;

which is a function that can be evaluated for complex ''b'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Slavin |first=Keith R. |title=Q-Binomials and the Greatest Common Divisor |journal=Integers Electronic Journal of Combinatorial Number Theory |volume=8 |pages=A5 |publisher=[[University of West Georgia]], [[Charles University in Prague]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.integers-ejcnt.org/vol8.html |accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wolfgang Schramm has shown that

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^a {\exp (2\pi ikb/a)} \cdot \sum\limits_{d\left| a\right.} {\frac{c_d (k)}{d}} &lt;/math&gt; 

is an [[entire function]] in the variable ''b'' for all positive integers ''a'' where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'') is [[Ramanujan's sum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schramm |first=Wolfgang |title=The Fourier transform of functions of the greatest common divisor |journal=Integers Electronic Journal of Combinatorial Number Theory |volume=8 |pages=A50 |publisher=[[University of West Georgia]], [[Charles University in Prague]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.integers-ejcnt.org/vol8.html |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcelo Polezzi has shown that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=2\sum_{k=1}^{a-1} \lfloor k b/a\rfloor+a+b-a b&lt;/math&gt;

for positive integers ''a'' and ''b''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Polezzi |first=Marcelo |title=A Geometrical Method for Finding an Explicit Formula for the Greatest Common Divisor |journal=Amer.

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gcd}(2^a-1,2^b-1)=2^{\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)}-1&lt;/math&gt;

for non-negative integers ''a'' and ''b'', where ''a'' and ''b'' are not both zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald E. |last=Knuth|title=[[Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science]] |coauthors=R.

=== Complexity ===

The existence of the Euclidean algorithm places the ([[decision problem]] version of) the greatest common divisor problem in [[P (complexity)|P]], the class of problems solvable in polynomial time. The GCD problem is not known to be in [[NC (complexity)|NC]], and so there is no known way to parallelize its computation across many processors; nor is it known to be [[P-complete]], which would imply that it is unlikely to be possible to parallelize GCD computation. In this sense the GCD problem is analogous to e.g. the [[integer factorization]] problem, which has no known polynomial-time algorithm, but is not known to be [[NP-complete]]. Shallcross et al. showed that a related problem (EUGCD, determining the remainder sequence arising during the Euclidean algorithm) is NC-equivalent to the problem of [[integer linear programming]] with two variables; if either problem is in '''NC''' or is '''P-complete''', the other is as well.&lt;ref&gt;D. Shallcross, V. Pan, and Y. Lin-Kriz. The NC equivalence of planar integer linear programming and Euclidean GCD. 34th IEEE Symp. Foundations of Computer Science, 1993, pp. 557-564. [http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/techreports/tr-92-041.pdf (PDF of technical report)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since '''NC''' contains [[NL (complexity)|NL]], it is also unknown whether a space-efficient algorithm for computing the GCD exists, even for nondeterministic Turing machines. 

Although the problem is not known to be in '''NC''', parallel algorithms with time superior to the Euclidean algorithm exist; the best known deterministic algorithm is by Chor and Goldreich, which (in the [[CRCW-PRAM]] model) can solve the problem in O(''n''/log ''n'') time with n&lt;sup&gt;1+&amp;epsilon;&lt;/sup&gt; processors.&lt;ref&gt;B.

Algorithmica, 5:1–10, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Randomized algorithm]]s can solve the problem in O((log ''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) time on &lt;math&gt;\exp[O(\sqrt{n \log n})]&lt;/math&gt; processors (note this is superpolynomial).&lt;ref&gt;L.

== Properties ==
*Every common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'' is a divisor of gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'').
*gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''), where ''a'' and ''b'' are not both zero, may be defined alternatively and equivalently as the smallest positive integer ''d'' which can be written in the form ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''·''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''·''q'' where ''p'' and ''q'' are integers. This expression is called [[Bézout's identity]]. Numbers ''p'' and ''q'' like this can be computed with the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].
*gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;0) = |''a''|, for ''a'' ≠ 0, since any number is a divisor of 0, and the greatest divisor of ''a'' is |''a''|. This is usually used as the base case in the Euclidean algorithm.
*If ''a'' divides the product ''b''·''c'', and gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''d'', then ''a''/''d'' divides ''c''.
*If ''m'' is a non-negative integer, then gcd(''m''·''a'',&amp;nbsp;''m''·''b'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''·gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'').
*If ''m'' is any integer, then gcd(''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''·''b'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''). 
*If ''m'' is a nonzero common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'', then gcd(''a''/''m'',&amp;nbsp;''b''/''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')/''m''.
*The gcd is a [[multiplicative function]] in the following sense: if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are relatively prime, then gcd(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;·''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b'') = gcd(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b'')·gcd(''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b'').
*The gcd is a [[Commutativity|commutative]] function: gcd(''a'', ''b'') = gcd(''b'', ''a'').
*The gcd is an [[Associativity|associative]] function: gcd(''a'', gcd(''b'', ''c'')) = gcd(gcd(''a'', ''b''), ''c'').
*The gcd of three numbers can be computed as gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'') = gcd(gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''),&amp;nbsp;''c''), or in some different way by applying commutativity and associativity. This can be extended to any number of numbers.
*gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') is closely related to the [[least common multiple]] lcm(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''): we have 
::gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')·lcm(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''·''b''. 
:This formula is often used to compute least common multiples: one first computes the gcd with Euclid's algorithm and then divides the product of the given numbers by their gcd. The following versions of [[distributivity]] hold true: 
::gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;lcm(''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c''))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;lcm(gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''),&amp;nbsp;gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''c''))
::lcm(''a'',&amp;nbsp;gcd(''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c''))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;gcd(lcm(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''),&amp;nbsp;lcm(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''c'')).
*It is useful to define gcd(0,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and lcm(0,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 because then the [[natural number]]s become a [[complete lattice|complete]] [[distributive lattice|distributive]] [[lattice (order)|lattice]] with gcd as meet and lcm as join operation. This extension of the definition is also compatible with the generalization for commutative rings given below.
*In a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') can be interpreted as the number of points with integral coordinates on the [[straight line]] joining the points (0,&amp;nbsp;0) and (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''), excluding (0,&amp;nbsp;0).

== Probabilities and expected value ==
In 1972, J. E. Nymann showed that the probability that ''k'' independently chosen integers are coprime is 1/''ζ''(''k'').&lt;ref name=&quot;nymann&quot;&gt;J. E. Nymann, On the probability that k positive integers are relatively 
prime. Journal of Number Theory, 4:469–473, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[coprime]] for a derivation.) This result was extended in 1987 to show that the probability that ''k'' random integers has greatest common divisor ''d'' is ''d''&lt;sup&gt;''-k''&lt;/sup&gt;/ζ(''k'').&lt;ref name=&quot;chid&quot;&gt;J. Chidambaraswamy and R. Sitarmachandrarao. On the probability that the values of ''m'' polynomials have a given g.c.d. Journal of Number Theory, 26:237–245, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this information, the [[expected value]] of the greatest common divisor function can be seen (informally) to not exist when ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. In this case the probability that the gcd equals ''d'' is ''d''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;/ζ(2), and since ζ(2) = π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/6 we have

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}( \mathrm{2} ) = \sum_{d=1}^\infty d \frac{6}{\pi^2 d^2} = \frac{6}{\pi^2} \sum_{d=1}^\infty \frac{1}{d}.&lt;/math&gt;

This last summation is the [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], which diverges. However, when ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3, the expected value is well-defined, and by the above argument, it is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{E}(k) = \sum_{d=1}^\infty d^{1-k} \zeta(k)^{-1} = \frac{\zeta(k-1)}{\zeta(k)}. &lt;/math&gt;

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, this is approximately equal to 1.3684. For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, it is approximately&amp;nbsp;1.1106.

== The gcd in commutative rings ==

The greatest common divisor can more generally be defined for elements of an arbitrary [[commutative ring]].

If ''R'' is a commutative ring, and ''a'' and ''b'' are in ''R'', then an element ''d'' of ''R'' is called a ''common divisor'' of ''a'' and ''b'' if it divides both ''a'' and ''b'' (that is, if there are elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R'' such that ''d''·''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' and ''d''·''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'').
If ''d'' is a common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'', and every common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'' divides ''d'', then ''d'' is called a ''greatest common divisor'' of ''a'' and ''b''.

Note that with this definition, two elements ''a'' and ''b'' may very well have several greatest common divisors, or none at all. But if ''R'' is an [[integral domain]] then any two gcd's of ''a'' and ''b'' must be [[associate elements]]. Also, if ''R'' is a [[unique factorization domain]], then any two elements have a gcd.
If ''R'' is a [[Euclidean domain]] then a form of the Euclidean algorithm can be used to compute greatest common divisors.

The following is an example of an integral domain with two elements that do not have a gcd:

:&lt;math&gt;R = \mathbb{Z}\left[\sqrt{-3}\,\,\right],\quad a = 4 = 2\cdot 2 = \left(1+\sqrt{-3}\,\,\right)\left(1-\sqrt{-3}\,\,\right),\quad b = \left(1+\sqrt{-3}\,\,\right)\cdot 2.&lt;/math&gt;

The elements 2 and 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;√(&amp;minus;3) are two &quot;maximal common divisors&quot; (i.e. any common divisor which is a multiple of 2 is associated to 2, the same holds for 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;√(&amp;minus;3)), but they are not associated, so there is no greatest common divisor of ''a'' and&amp;nbsp;''b''.

Corresponding to the Bezout property we may, in any commutative ring, consider the collection of elements of the form ''pa''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''qb'', where  ''p'' and ''q'' range over the ring. This is the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by ''a'' and ''b'', and is denoted simply (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''). In a ring all of whose ideals are principal (a [[principal ideal domain]] or PID), this ideal will be identical with the set of multiples of some ring element ''d''; then this ''d'' is a greatest common divisor of ''a'' and  ''b''. But the ideal (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') can be useful even when there is no greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''. (Indeed, [[Ernst Kummer]] used this ideal as a replacement for a gcd in his treatment of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], although he envisioned it as the set of multiples of some hypothetical, or ''ideal'', ring element ''d'', whence the ring-theoretic term.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Least common multiple.png|thumb|LCMs of numbers 0 through 10. Line labels = first number. X axis = second number. Y axis = LCM.]]

In [[arithmetic]] and [[number theory]], the '''least common multiple''' (also called the '''lowest common multiple''' or   '''smallest common multiple''') of two [[integer]]s ''a'' and ''b'', usually denoted by '''LCM(''a'', ''b'')''', is the smallest positive integer that is [[divisible]] by both ''a'' and ''b''.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, § 5.1, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if ''a'' and ''b'' are both different from zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Long|1972|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some authors define lcm(''a'',0) as 0 for all ''a'', which is the result of taking the lcm to be the [[least upper bound]] in the [[lattice (order theory)|lattice]] of divisibility.

The LCM is familiar from grade-school arithmetic as the &quot;least common denominator&quot; ([[lowest common denominator|LCD]]) that must be determined before [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] can be added, subtracted or compared.

The LCM of more than two integers is also well-defined: it is the smallest integer that is divisible by each of them.

== Overview ==

A [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiple]] of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For example, 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 × 2 = 10, so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. Because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2, it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2. By the same principle, 10 is the least common multiple of −5 and 2 as well.

=== Notation ===

In this article we will denote the least common multiple of two integers ''a'' and ''b'' as lcm( ''a'', ''b'' ).  Some older textbooks use [ ''a'', ''b'' ].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Long|1972|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Example ===

What is the LCM of 4 and 6?

Doubly even numbers are:

: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140, 144...

and the even multiples of 3 are:

: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144...

'''Common multiples''' of 4 and 6 are simply the numbers that are in both lists:

: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144....

So, from this list of the first few common multiples of the numbers 4 and 6, their '''least common multiple''' is 12.

2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 (including 20) are all even numbers below 20.

4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 40 (including 40) are all doubly even numbers below 40.

6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54 and 60 (including 60) are all even multiples of 3 below 60.

8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72 and 80 (including 80) are all quadruple even numbers below 80.

10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 (including 100) are all even multiples of 5 below 100.

=== Applications ===

When adding, subtracting, or comparing [[vulgar fraction]]s, it is useful to find the least common multiple of the denominators, often called the [[lowest common denominator]], because each of the fractions can be expressed as a fraction with this denominator. For instance,

:&lt;math&gt;{2\over21}+{1\over6}={4\over42}+{7\over42}={11\over42}&lt;/math&gt;

where the denominator 42 was used because it is the least common multiple of 21 and 6.

== Computing the least common multiple ==

=== Reduction by the greatest common divisor ===
The following formula reduces the problem of computing the least common multiple to the problem of computing the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD), also known as the greatest common factor:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{|a\cdot b|}{\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is also valid when exactly one of ''a'' and ''b'' is 0, since gcd(''a'', 0) = |''a''|. (However, if both ''a'' and ''b'' are 0, this formula would cause [[division by zero]]; lcm(0, 0) = 0 is a special case.

There are fast [[algorithm]]s for computing the GCD that do not require the numbers to be factored, such as the [[Euclidean algorithm]]. To return to the example above,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(21,6)
={21\cdot6\over\operatorname{gcd}(21,6)}
={21\cdot6\over\operatorname{gcd}(3,6)}
={21\cdot 6\over 3}= \frac{126}{3} = 42.&lt;/math&gt;

Because gcd(''a'', ''b'') is a divisor of both ''a'' and ''b'', it's more efficient to compute the LCM by dividing ''before'' multiplying:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\left({|a|\over\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)}\right)\cdot |b|=\left({|b|\over\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)}\right)\cdot |a|.&lt;/math&gt;

This reduces the size of one input for both the division and the multiplication, and reduces the required storage needed for intermediate results (overflow in the ''a''&amp;times;''b'' computation). Because gcd(''a'', ''b'') is a divisor of both ''a'' and ''b'', the division is guaranteed to yield an integer, so the intermediate result can be stored in an integer. Done this way, the previous example becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(21,6)={21\over\operatorname{gcd}(21,6)}\cdot6={21\over\operatorname{gcd}(3,6)}\cdot6={21\over3}\cdot6=7\cdot6=42.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Finding least common multiples by prime factorization ===

The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|unique factorization theorem]] says that every positive integer greater than 1 can be written in only one way as a product of [[prime number]]s. The prime numbers can be considered as the atomic elements which, when combined together, make up a [[composite number]].

For example:

:&lt;math&gt;90 = 2^1 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have the composite number 90 made up of one atom of the prime number 2, two atoms of the prime number 3 and one atom of the prime number 5.

This knowledge can be used to find the LCM of a set of numbers.

Example: Find the value of lcm(8,9,21).

First, factor out each number and express it as a product of prime number [[Power (mathematics)|powers]].
:&lt;math&gt;8\; \, \; \,= 2^3 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;9\; \, \; \,= 3^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;21\; \,= 3^1 \cdot 7^1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The lcm will be the product of multiplying the highest power of each prime number together. The highest power of the three prime numbers 2, 3, and 7 is 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and 7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(8,9,21) = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7^1 = 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 7 = 504. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This method is not as efficient as reducing to the greatest common divisor, since there is no known general efficient algorithm for [[integer factorization]], but is useful for illustrating concepts.

This method can be illustrated using a [[Venn diagram]] as follows.  Find the [[prime factorization]] of each of the two numbers.  Put the prime factors into a Venn diagram with one circle for each of the two numbers, and ''all'' factors they share in common in the intersection.  To find the LCM, just multiply all of the prime numbers in the diagram.

Here is an example:

: 48 = 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 3,
: 180 = 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 3 &amp;times; 3 &amp;times; 5,

and what they share in common is two &quot;2&quot;s and a &quot;3&quot;:

:[[Image:least common multiple.svg|400px]]

: Least common multiple = 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 3 &amp;times; 3 &amp;times; 5 = 720
: Greatest common divisor = 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 3 = 12

This also works for the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD), except that instead of multiplying all of the numbers in the Venn diagram, one multiplies only the prime factors that are in the intersection.  Thus the GCD of 48 and 180 is 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12.

===A simple algorithm===

This method works as easily for finding the LCM of several integers.

Let there be a finite sequence of positive integers ''X'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''n'' &gt; 1. The algorithm proceeds in steps as follows: on each step ''m'' it examines and updates the sequence ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt;), ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; = ''X'', where ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''m''th iteration of ''X'', i.e. ''X'' at step ''m'' of the algorithm, etc. The purpose of the examination is to pick the least (perhaps, one of many) element of the sequence ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt;. Assuming ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt; is the selected element, the sequence ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''m''+1)&lt;/sup&gt; is defined as

: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''m''+1)&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt;, ''k'' ≠ ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''m''+1)&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.

In other words, the least element is increased by the corresponding ''x'' whereas the rest of the elements pass from ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''m''+1)&lt;/sup&gt; unchanged.

The algorithm stops when all elements in sequence ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt; are equal. Their common value ''L'' is exactly LCM(''X''). (For a proof and an interactive simulation see reference below, ''Algorithm for Computing the LCM''.)

===A method using a table===

This method works for any number of factors.  One begins by listing all of the numbers vertically in a table (in this example 4,&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;21,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;42):

: &amp;nbsp;4
: &amp;nbsp;7
: 12
: 21
: 42

The process begins by dividing all of the factors by 2.  If any of them divides evenly, write 2 at the top of the table and the result of division by 2 of each factor in the space to the right of each factor and below the 2.  If a number does not divide evenly, just rewrite the number again.  If 2 does not divide evenly into any of the numbers, try 3.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! ''x''
! 2
|-
| 4
| 2
|-
| 7
| 7
|-
| 12
| 6
|-
| 21
| 21
|-
| 42
| 21
|}

Now, check if 2 divides again:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! ''x''
! 2
! 2
|-
| 4
| 2
| 1
|-
| 7
| 7
| 7
|-
| 12
| 6
| 3
|-
| 21
| 21
| 21
|-
| 42
| 21
| 21
|}

Once 2 no longer divides, divide by 3.  If 3 no longer divides, try 5 and 7.  Keep going until all of the numbers have been reduced to 1.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! ''x''
! 2
! 2
! 3
! 7
|-
| 4
| 2
| 1
| 1
| 1
|-
| 7
| 7
| 7
| 7
| 1
|-
| 12
| 6
| 3
| 1
| 1
|-
| 21
| 21
| 21
| 7
| 1
|-
| 42
| 21
| 21
| 7
| 1
|}

Now, multiply the numbers on the top and you have the LCM.  In this case, it is 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;84. You will get to the LCM the quickest if you use prime numbers and start from the lowest prime, 2.

==Formulas==

===Fundamental theorem of arithmetic===

According to the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] a positive integer is the product of [[prime number]]s, and, except for their order, this representation is unique:

:&lt;math&gt;n=2^{n_2} 3^{n_3} 5^{n_5} 7^{n_7} \cdots = \prod_p p^{n_p},\;&lt;/math&gt;

where the exponents ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... are non-negative integers; for example, 84 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; 7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 11&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; 13&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ...

Given two integers &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\;a=\prod_p p^{a_p}\;\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\;b=\prod_p p^{b_p}\;\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; their least common multiple and greatest common divisor are given by the formulas

:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b) = \prod_p p^{\min(a_p, b_p)}\;&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = \prod_p p^{\max(a_p, b_p)}.\;&lt;/math&gt;

Since
:&lt;math&gt;\min(x,y) + \max(x,y) = x+y,\;\;&lt;/math&gt;
this gives
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b)\,\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = a\,b.\;&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, any rational number can be written uniquely as the product of primes if negative exponents are allowed. When this is done, the above formulas remain valid. Using the same examples as above:
:&lt;math&gt;4 = 2^2 3^0, \;\; 6 = 2^1 3^1, \;\;  \gcd(4, 6) = 2^1 3^0, \;\; \operatorname{lcm}(4,6) = 2^2  3^1.\;&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}=2^0 3^{-1} 5^0,\;\;\tfrac{2}{5}=2^1 3^0 5^{-1}, \;\; \gcd(\tfrac13, \tfrac25)= 2^0 3^{-1} 5^{-1}, \;\;\operatorname{lcm}(\tfrac13, \tfrac25) = 2^1 3^0 5^0, \;\;&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{6}=2^{-1} 3^{-1} ,\;\;\tfrac{3}{4}=2^{-2} 3^1, \;\; \gcd(\tfrac16, \tfrac34)= 2^{-2} 3^{-1}, \;\;\operatorname{lcm}(\tfrac16, \tfrac34) = 2^{-1} 3^1. \;\;&lt;/math&gt;

===Lattice-theoretic===

The positive integers may be [[partially ordered]] by divisibility: if ''a'' divides ''b'' (i.e. if ''b'' is an integer multiple of ''a'') write ''a'' ≤  ''b'' (or equivalently, ''b'' ≥  ''a''). (Forget the usual magnitude-based definition of ≤  in this section - it isn't used.)

Under this ordering, the positive integers become a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] with [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] given by the gcd and [[join (mathematics)|join]] given by the lcm. The proof is straightforward, if a bit tedious; it amounts to checking that lcm and gcd satisfy the axioms for meet and join. Putting the lcm and gcd into this more general context establishes a [[duality (order theory)|duality]] between them:

:'''If a formula involving integer variables, gcd, lcm, ≤ and ≥  is true, then the formula obtained by switching  gcd with lcm and switching  ≥  with ≤ is also true. ''' (Remember ≤  is defined as divides).

The following pairs of dual formulas are special cases of general lattice-theoretic identities.

{| style=&quot;margin:0;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|
;[[commutative operation|Commutative laws]]
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = \operatorname{lcm}(b, a),\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a, b) =\gcd( b, a).\;&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|
;[[associativity|Associative laws]]
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a,\operatorname{lcm}(b, c)) = \operatorname{lcm}(\operatorname{lcm}(a , b),c),\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a, \gcd(b, c)) = \gcd(\gcd(a,b), c).\;&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|
;[[Absorption law]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a, \gcd(a,b)) = a,\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a, \operatorname{lcm}(a, b)) = a.\;&lt;/math&gt;
|}

{| style=&quot;margin:0;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|
;[[Idempotent|Idempotent laws]]
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a, a) = a,\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a, a) = a.\;&lt;/math&gt;.
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|
;[[Lattice (order)#Connection between the two definitions|Define divides in terms of lcm and gcd]]
:&lt;math&gt;a \ge b \iff a = \operatorname{lcm}(a,b),\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a \le b \iff a = \gcd(a,b).\;&lt;/math&gt;
|}

It can also be shown&lt;ref&gt;The next three formulas are from Landau, Ex. III.3, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; that this lattice is [[distributive lattice|distributive]], i.e. that lcm distributes over gcd and, dually, that gcd distributes over lcm:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a,\gcd(b,c)) = \gcd(\operatorname{lcm}(a,b),\operatorname{lcm}(a,c)),\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,\operatorname{lcm}(b,c)) = \operatorname{lcm}(\gcd(a,b),\gcd(a,c)).\;&lt;/math&gt;

This identity is self-dual:
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(\operatorname{lcm}(a,b),\operatorname{lcm}(b,c),\operatorname{lcm}(a,c))=\operatorname{lcm}(\gcd(a,b),\gcd(b,c),\gcd(a,c)).\;&lt;/math&gt;

===Other===

Let ''D'' be the product of &amp;omega;(''D'') distinct prime numbers (i.e. ''D'' is [[squarefree]]).

Then&lt;ref&gt;Crandall &amp; Pomerance, ex. 2.4, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|\{(x,y)\;:\; \operatorname{lcm}(x,y)=D\}|= 3^{\omega(D)},\;&lt;/math&gt;

where the absolute bars || denote the cardinality of a set.

== The LCM in commutative rings ==
The least common multiple can be defined generally over [[commutative ring]]s as follows: Let ''a'' and ''b'' be elements of a commutative ring ''R''. A common multiple of ''a'' and ''b'' is an element ''m'' of ''R'' such that both ''a'' and ''b'' divide ''m'' (i.e. there exist elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''R'' such that ''ax'' = ''m'' and ''by'' = ''m''). A least common multiple of ''a'' and ''b'' is a common multiple that is minimal in the sense that for any other common multiple ''n'' of ''a'' and ''b'', ''m'' divides&amp;nbsp;''n''.

In general, two elements in a commutative ring can have no least common multiple or more than one. However, any two least common multiples of the same pair of elements are [[Unit (ring theory)|associates]]. In a [[unique factorization domain]], any two elements have a least common multiple. In a [[principal ideal domain]], the least common multiple of ''a'' and ''b'' can be characterised as a generator of the intersection of the ideals generated by ''a'' and ''b'' (the intersection of a collection of ideals is always an ideal). In principal ideal domains, one can even talk about the least common multiple of arbitrary collections of elements: it is a generator of the intersection of the ideals generated by the elements of the collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Undergraduate Mathematics/Top}}

In this first module, we look into the core of everything that follows: proof. Mathematics is an attempt to discover truth considered from the perspective of logic and without proof we will get nowhere.

The distinction between proof and verification by experiment is that proven ideas are precisely as reliable as the assumptions you make and the logical vadility of the proof.

We will look at a few different methods of verifying the truth of an idea that will become very familiar to anyone that uses mathematics in the sense of a mathematician. Engineers, physicists and other scientists may use our theorems and corollaries without needing to understand the proofs but that is precisely because we do.</text>

This is a record of recipes from 1881.  Please do not tag it as needing work, etc.  You are welcome to create new recipes using this information.


== How meat was prepared in the 19th century ==
From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia'' -- Outdated, but some info may actually be useful.  Any chefs out there?

=== To Boil Meats ===
The most simple of culinary processes is not often performed in perfection, though it does not require so much nicety and attendance as roast; to skim the pot well, and to keep it moderately boiling, and to know how long the joint requires, comprehends the most useful point of this branch of cookery. The cook must take especial care that the water really boils all the while she is cooking, or she will be deceived in the time. An adept cook will manage with much less fire for boiling than she uses for roasting, and it will last all the time without much mending. When the water is coming to a boil there will always rise from the cleanest meat a scum to the top, this must be carefully taken off as soon as it appears, for on this depends the good appearance of a boiled dinner. When you have skimmed it well put in a little cold water, which will throw up the rest of it. If left alone it soon boils down and sticks to the meat which, instead of looking white and healthful, will have a coarse and uninviting appearance. 

Many cooks put in milk to make what they boil look white but this does more harm than good; others wrap the meat in a cloth, but if it is well skimmed it will have a much more delicate appearance than when it is muffled up. 

Put the meat into cold water in the proportion of about a quart to every pound of meat; it should remain covered during the whole process of boiling but only just so. Water beyond what is absolutely necessary renders the meat less savory and weakens the broth. 

The water should be gradually heated according to the thickness, etc., of the article boiled; for instance a leg of mutton of ten pounds' weight should be placed over a moderate fire, which will gradually heat the water without causing it to boil, for about forty minutes. If the water boils much sooner, the meat will be hardened, and shrink up as if it were scorched. Reckon the time from its first coming to a boil, the slower it boils the tenderer, the plumper, and whiter it will be. For those who choose their food thoroughly cooked, twenty minutes to a pound will not be found too much for gentle simmering by the side of the fire. Fresh killed meat will take much longer time boiling than that which has been kept till what the butchers call ripe; if it be fresh killed it will be tough and hard if stewed ever so long, and ever so gently. The size of the boiling pots should be adapted to what they are to contain; in small families we recommend block-tin saucepans, etc., as lightest and safest, taking care that the covers fit close, otherwise the introduction of smoke may be the means of giving the meat a bad taste. Beef and mutton a little underdone is not a great fault, but lamb, pork, and veal are uneatable and truly unwholesome, if not thoroughly boiled. Take care of the liquor in which poultry or meat has been boiled, as an addition of peas, herbs, etc., will convert it into a nourishing soup. 

=== To Bake Meats ===
This is one of the cheapest and most convenient ways of dressing a dinner in small families, and although the general superiority of roasting must be allowed, still certain joints and dishes, such as legs and loins of pork, legs and shoulders of mutton, and fillets of veal, will bake to great advantage if the meat be good. Besides those joints above-mentioned, we shall enumerate a few baked dishes which may be particularly recommended. 

A pig when sent to the baker prepared for baking, should have its ears and tail covered with buttered paper, and a bit of butter tied up in a piece of linen to baste the back with, otherwise it will be apt to blister. If well baked it is considered equal to a roast one. 

A goose prepared the same as for roasting, or a duck placed upon a stand and turned, as soon as one side is done upon the other, are equally good. 

A buttock of beef, prepared as follows, is particularly fine: After it has been put in salt about a week, let it be well washed and put into a brown earthen pan with a pint of water cover the pan tight over with two or three thicknesses of cap paper, and give it four or five hours in a moderately heated oven. 

A ham, if not too old, put in soak for an hour, taken out and baked in a moderately heated oven cuts fuller of graver, and of a fitter flavor, than a boiled one. 

Codfish, haddock, and mackerel should have a dust of flour and some bits of butter spread over them. Eels, when large and stuffed, herrings and sprats are put in a brown pan, with vinegar and a little spice, and tied over with paper. 

A hare, prepared the same as for roasting, with a few bits of butter and a little milk, put into the dish and basted several times, will be found nearly equal to roasting. In the same manner legs and shins of beef will be equally good with proper vegetable seasoning. 

=== To Roast Meats, etc. ===
The first thing requisite for roasting is to have a strong, steady fire, or a clear brisk one, according to the size and weight of the joint that is put down to the spit. A cook, who does not attend to this, will prove herself totally incompetent to roast victuals properly. All roasting should be done open to the air, to ventilate the meat from its gross fumes; otherwise it becomes baked instead of roasted. The joint should be put down at such a distance from the fire as to imbibe the heat rather quickly; otherwise its plumpness and good quality will be gradually dried up, and it will turn shrivelly, and look meager. When the meat is first put down, it is necessary to see that it lies level in the pan, otherwise the process of cooking will be very troublesome. When it is warm, begin to baste it well, which prevents the nutritive juices escaping; and, if required, additional dripping must be used for that purpose. 

As to sprinkling with salt while roasting, most able cooks dispense with it, as the penetrating particles of the salt have a tendency to draw out the animal juices. However a little salt thrown on, when first laid down, is sometimes necessary with strong meats. When the smoke draws towards the fire, and the dropping of the clear gravy begins, it is a sure sign that the joint is nearly done. Then take off the paper, baste well, arid dredge it with flour, which brings on that beautiful brownness which makes roasted meats look so inviting. 

With regard to the time necessary for roasting various meats, it will vary according to the different sorts, the time it has been kept, and the temperature of the weather. In summer twenty minutes may be reckoned equal to half an hour in winter. A good screen, to keep off the chilling currents of air, is essentially useful. The old housewife's rule is to allow rather more than a quarter of an hour to each pound, and in most instances it proves practically correct. 

In roasting mutton or lamb, the loin, the chine, and the saddle, must have the skin raised, and skewered on, and, when nearly done, take off this skin, and baste and flour to froth it up. 

Veal requires roasting brown, and, if a fillet or loin, be sure to paper the fat, that as little of it may be lost as possible. When nearly done baste it with butter and dredge with flour. 

Pork should be well done. When roasting a loin, cut the skin across with a sharp knife, otherwise the crackling is very awkward to manage. Stuff the knuckle part with sage and onion, and skewer it up. Put a little drawn gravy in the dish, and serve it up with apple-sauce in a tureen. A sparerib should be basted with a little butter, little dust of flour, and some sage and onions shred small. Apple-sauce is the only one which suits this dish. 

Wild fowls require a clear brisk fire, and should be roasted till they are of a light brown, but not too much; yet it is a common fault to roast them till the gravy runs out, thereby losing their fine savor. 

Tame fowls require more roasting, as the heat is longer in penetrating. They should be often basted, in order to keep up a strong froth, and to improve their plumpness. The seasoning of the dressing or stuffing of a fowl is important to its flavor. The dressing should consist of bread crumbs, seasoned with black pepper, salt, and no herb but thyme. 

Pigs and geese should be thoroughly roasted before a good fire, and turned quickly. 

Hares and rabbits require time and care, especially to have the ends sufficiently done, and to remedy that raw discoloring at the neck, etc., which proves often so objectionable at table. 

=== To regulate Time in Cookery. ===
'''Mutton'''.--A leg of 8 pounds will require two hours and a half. A chine or saddle of 10 or 11 pounds, two hours and a half. A shoulder of 7 pounds, one hour and a half. A loin of 7 pounds, one hour and three quarters. A neck and breast, about the same time as a loin 

'''Beef'''.--The sirloin of 15 pounds, from three hours and three quarters to four hours. Ribs of beef, from 15 to 20 pounds, will take three hours to three hours and a half. 

'''Veal'''.--A fillet, from 12 to 16 pounds, will take from four to five hours, at a good fire. A loin upon the average, will take three hours. A shoulder, from three hours to three hours and a half. A neck, two hours. A breast, from an hour and a half to two hours. 

'''Lamb'''.--Hind quarter of 8 pounds will take from an hour and three-quarters to two hours. Fore quarter of 10 pounds, about two hours. Leg of 6 pounds, from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half. Shoulder or breast, with a quick fire, an hour. 

'''Pork'''.--A leg of 8 pounds will require about three hours. Griskin, an hour and a half. A spare-rib of 8 or 9 pounds will take from two hours and a half to three hours to roast it thoroughly. A bald spare-rib of 8 pounds, an hour and a quarter. A loin of 5 pounds, if very fat, from two hours to two hours and a half. A sucking pig, of three weeks old, about an hour and a half. 

'''Poultry'''.--A very large turkey will require about three hours; one of 10 pounds two hours; a small one an hour and a half. 

A full-grown fowl, an hour and a half; a moderate sized one an hour and a quarter. 

A pullet, from half an hour to forty minutes. 

A goose, full grown, two hours. 

A green goose, forty minutes. 

A duck, full size, from an hour and a quarter to one hour and three-quarters. 

'''Venison'''.--A buck haunch which weighs from 20 to 25 pounds will take about four hours and a half roasting; one from 12 to 18 pounds will take three hours and a quarter. 

=== To Broil ===
This culinary branch is very confined, but excellent as respects chops or steaks, to cook which in perfection the fire should be clear and brisk, and the grid-iron set on it slanting, to prevent the fat dropping in it. In addition, quick and frequent turning will ensure good flavour in the taste of the article cooked. 

=== To Fry Meats ===
Be careful in keeping the frying-pan clean. See that it is properly tinned.  When frying any sort of fish, first dry them in a cloth, and then flour them. Put into the pan plenty of dripping, or hog's lard, and let it be boiling hot before putting in the fish. Butter is not so good for the purpose, as it is apt to burn and blacken, and make them soft. When they are fried, put them in a dish or hair-sieve, to drain, before they are sent to table. Olive oil is the best article for frying, but it is very expensive, and bad oil spoils every thing that is dressed with it. Steaks and chops should be put in when the liquor is hot, and done quickly, of a light brown, and turned often. Sausages should be done gradually, which will prevent their bursting. 

=== [[Cookbook:Corned Beef|Corned Beef]] ===
Fifty pounds of beef, three pounds of coarse salt, one ounce of saltpetre, three-quarters of a pound of sugar, two gallons of water. Mix the above ingredients together and pour over the meat. Cover the tub closely.

=== To Pot Beef ===
Cut it small, add to it some melted butter, two anchovies boned and washed, and a little of the best pepper, beat fine. Put them into a marble mortar, and beat them well together till the meat is yellow; put it into pots and cover with clarified butter. 

=== To Pot Leg of Beef ===
Boil a leg of beef till the meat will come off the bone easily, then mix it with a cow heel, previously cut into thin pieces, and season the whole with salt and spice; add a little of the liquor in which the leg of beef was boiled, put it into a cheese-vat, or colander, or some other vessel that will let the liquor run off, place a very heavy weight over it, and it will be ready for use in a day or two. It may be kept in souse made of bran boiled in water, with the addition of a little vinegar. 

=== Dried Beef ===
Have the rounds divided, leaving a piece of the sinew to hang up by; lay the pieces in a tub of cold water for an hour, then rub each piece of beef that will weigh fifteen or twenty pounds, with a handful of brown sugar and a tablespoonful of saltpetre, pulverized, and a pint of fine salt; sprinkle fine salt in the bottom of a clean tight barrel, and lay the pieces in, strewing a little coarse salt between each piece; let it lie two days then make the brine in a clean tub, with cold water and ground alum salt--stir it well; it must be strong enough to bear an egg half up; put in half a pound of best brown sugar and a table spoonful of saltpetre to each gallon of the salt and water, pour it over the beef, put a clean large stone on the top of the meat to keep it under the pickle (which is very important!), put a cover on the barrel, examine it occasionally to see that the pickle does not leak, and if it should need more, add of the same strength. Let it stand six weeks then hang it up in the smoke-house, and after it has drained, smoke it moderately for ten days; it should then hang in a dry place. Before cooking let it soak for twenty-four hours; a piece that weighs fifteen or twenty pounds should boil two hours--one half the size, one hour, and a small piece should soak six or twelve hours, according to size. 

=== Potted Lobster or Crab ===
This must be made with fine hen lobsters when full of spawn; boil them thoroughly. When cold pick out all the solid meat, and pound it in a mortar; it is usual to add, by degrees, (a very little) finely powdered mace, black or Cayenne pepper, salt, and, while pounding, a little butter. When the whole is well mixed, and beat to the consistence of paste, press it down hard in a preserving pot, pour clarified butter over it, and cover it with wetted bladder. 

=== To Pot Shad ===
Clean the shad, take off the tail, head, and all the fins, then cut it in pieces, wash and wipe it dry. Season each piece well with salt and Cayenne pepper. Lay them in layers in a stone-jar, place between each two layers some allspice, cloves, and stick-cinnamon. Cover them with good cider vinegar, tie thick paper over the jar, place them in a moderate oven, and let them remain three or four hours. 

=== To make Bologna Sausages ===
Take a pound of beef suet, a pound of pork, a pound of bacon fat and lean, and a pound of beef and veal. Cut them very small. Take a handful of sage leaves chopped fine, with a few sweet herbs. Season pretty high with pepper and salt, take a large well-cleaned gut and fill it. Set on a saucepan of water, and when it boils, put it in, first pricking it to prevent its bursting. Boil it one hour. 

=== To make Bologna Sandwiches ===
Take sliced bread (two pieces) and apply margarine to one side of each slice. Take three slices of bologna and put on the margarine side of one piece of bread. Add mustard to taste. Place other piece of bread margarine side down on top. Note. Cheese may also be added. 

=== To make Oxford Sausages ===
Take 1 pound of young pork, fat and lean, without skin or gristle; 1 pound of beef suet, chopped fine together; put in 1/2 pound of grated bread, half the peel of a lemon, shred, a nutmeg grated, 6 sage leaves, chopped fine; a teaspoonful of pepper; and 2 of salt; some thyme, savoury, and marjoram, shred fine. Mix well together and put it close down in a pan till used. Roll them out the size of common sausages, and fry them, in fresh butter, of a fine brown, or broil them over a clear fire, and send them to table hot. 

=== To make Epping Sausages ===
Take 6 pounds of young pork, quite free from skin, gristle, or fat; cut it small, and beat it fine in a mortar. Chop 6 pounds of beef suet very fine, shred a handful of sage leaves fine, spread the meat on a clean dresser, and shake the sage over it. Shred the rind of a lemon very fine, and throw it with sweet herbs on the meat. Grate 2 nutmegs, to which put a teaspoonful of pepper, and a table spoonful of salt. Throw the suet over it, and mix all well together. Put it down close in the pot and when used, roll it up with as much egg as will make it smooth.

The objectives of this book are as follows:
* Provide comprehensive notes for the HKDSE syllabus. This includes:
** Concept words. Remember that geography students must not write 'everyday language'. This is a common complaint from the HKEAA's candidate performance reports. In DBQs, if you do not use the exact word provided in the marking scheme, you will not score anything. In essays, your score will be very low. Therefore, it is important to know your keywords. (For instance, you must write 'expressway', not 'highway'.) Keywords are in '''bold'''. (Not everything in the curriculum is important, so less important concepts are put instead in ''italics''.)
** Concepts. From waterfall formation to drip irrigation, concepts are very important in geography.
** Examples. Only important and relevant examples are given. (Examples are needed in essays only. They are not required in DBQs.)
* Provide past paper and exam trend information, as well as how to tackle various questions.

When writing this book, we will adhere to these principles:
* Exam-oriented: Not a single word will be wasted on unrelated material. There will be no 'suggested reading', 'further information', 'fun facts', etc.
* Emphasis on both knowledge and application: Reciting everything will not get you a 5**. You need to apply your knowledge to a flexible range of question types.
* Clarity: There will be explanations in plain English. If this book ever gets translated by the Chinese Wikibooks, there will be a translation to which to refer, too. Also, the sequence of the book will not follow strictly HKEAA's, but will instead by altered to facilitate comprehension.

Moreover, note that:
* All photographs are in full colour.
* There will be no maps for map-reading as they require very hefty royalties from the government to be reproduced.
* A lot of annotated diagrams will be in black-and-white. You exam paper will be scanned black-and-white, so it's just as well.

== A Word on Conventions ==
{{Dbox|Definition boxes|house definitions that you must recite. (In other words, definitions anywhere else don't have to be recited, although you do need to understand them.)}}
{{Robox|theme=4|title=Red boxes}}Red boxes are about common misconceptions in geography. You are frequently tested about them in multiple-choice questions, so make sure you read through these.{{Robox/Close}}
{{Robox|theme=2|title=Green boxes}}Green boxes provide statistical data and examples that you should cite in essays for higher scores. Only study and remember this if you have time on your hands and want to aim for a 5+ grade.{{Robox/Close}}
Let us get started.

      <comment>/* Four Processes */ typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{HKDSE Geography}}
The three fluvial processes are '''erosion''', '''transportation''' and '''deposition'''.

* Erosion is the process in which materials are removed by an agent.
* Transportation is the process in which eroded materials are carried away.
* Deposition is the process in which materials are 'dumped'.

== Erosion ==
There are three directions and four processes. Remember the names and what they mean (but don't memorise the definitions).

===Three Directions ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
!Headward erosion
!Vertical erosion/Downcutting
!Lateral erosion
|-
! Diagram
| 
|
|
|-
! Primary location
| Source
| River bed of upper course
| River bank of middle and lower courses
|-
! Result
| The river is lengthened.
| The river is deepened.
| The river is widened.
|-
! Description
| Loose rock debris is brought down by overland flow running downslope. The source is extended backward and the '''backwall''' retreats upslope, accelerated by mass movement.
| The riverbed is eroded.
| The two riverbanks are eroded when the river swings from side to side.
|}

===Four Processes===
Four processes:
* '''Hydraulic action''': Water exerts pressure on the river bank and '''undercuts''' it. Cracks are widened.
* '''Corrosion/Solution''' (''Solvent action''): Water dissolves soluble minerals from the bed or bank, e.g. calcium in limestone. It is a form of chemical erosion.
* '''Abrasion''' (''Corrasion''): River load acts as a tool to wear away the bed or bank, e.g. large, angular boulders downcut the bed.
* '''Attrition''': Load knocks against each other, the bed or the bank. They break down into smaller pieces and get smaller and smaller.

{{Robox|theme=4|title=Attrition vs. Abrasion}}
Attrition is the wearing down of the load. Abrasion is the wearing down of the bed or bank.

When load knocks against the bed or bank, abrasion occurs on the bed or bank, and attrition occurs in the load.
{{Robox/Close}}

===Factors===
These factors affect erosion:
*'''Nature of load''':
** Load weight ↑ → Erosion ↑
** Load angularity ↑ → Erosion ↑
*'''Amount of load''': Load amount ↑ → Erosion ↑
*'''Discharge and velocity''':
**Discharge ↑/Velocity ↑ → Energy ↑  → Erosion ↑ 
*'''Geology of rocks''': Joints ↑ → Erosion ↑ 
*Additional factors for corrosion:
**'''Water acidity''' ↑ ('''pH value''' ↓) → Erosion ↑ 
**Hot and humid climate → Erosion ↑  
**Rocks composed of soluble minerals → Erosion ↑ 

== Transportation ==
The materials carried by transportation are '''load'''.

=== Four Processes===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Name||Load||Description||Weight
|-
| Solution||Dissolved load||Soluble minerals are dissolved and carried downstream||Lightest
|-
| Suspension||Solid load (suspended load)||Small particles are carried downstream in water without touching the bank||Light
|-
| Saltation||Solid load (suspended load)||Load is moved in a series of hops and bounces along the bed||Heavy
|-
| Traction||Solid load (bed load)||Load rolls and slides on the bed||Heaviest
|-
| 
|}

=== Factors ===
*Energy ↑ → Velocity ↑ → More, heavier load
*Erosion ↑ → Load ↑
*Soil Erosion ↑ → Load ↑
*Deposition ↑ → Load ↓

== Deposition ==
=== One Process ===
One process occurs in deposition: Sorting. The heaviest load is deposited first. Cobbles are deposited, then pebbles, then sand, then silt, and finally clay. Thus deposited materials are deposited in layers.

=== Factors ===
* Input of water ↓ / Output of water ↑
** Drought, dry season, high evaporation rate → Amount of water ↓ → Deposition ↓

* Velocity ↓
** Inland flow of seawater →  Velocity ↓ → Deposition ↑ 
** Load ↑ → Internal friction ↑ →  Velocity ↓ → Deposition ↑ 
*** Examples: Siltation, landslide
** Channel friction ↑ → Deposition ↑ 
*** Examples: entering a channel with long wetted perimeter
** Gradient ↓ →  Velocity ↓ → Deposition ↑ 
*** e.g. waterfall, entering a flood plain
** Water enters a large body of water
*** shallow lake, shallow sea
** At inner banks (will be discussed later)

== Impact of Velocity on Fluvial Process Occurrence ==

== Downstream Variation ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Zimbabwe''' is a country in southern Africa.  It borders [[../South Africa|South Africa]] to the south, [[../Botswana|Botswana]] to the southwest, [[../Zambia|Zambia]] to the northwest and [[../Mozambique|Mozambique]] to the east.  It is a landlocked country meaning it has no coastline.  The capital is '''Harare'''.  At the moment there is no official currency so people use the British pound, South African rand, American dollar and other currencies.

==Geography==
The most famous feature of Zimbabwe is '''Victoria Falls'''.

==History==
Zimbabwe has been a fully independent country since 1980 but it declared independence from the [[Wikijunior:Europe/United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] in 1965.  Before independence Zimbabwe was known as '''South Rhodesia'''.  In the first decade of the 21st century Zimbabwe suffered many economic problems including hyper-inflation (when money becomes worthless).

==Economy==

==People==
There are 16 official languages in Zimbabwe.  English is one of those languages and the language of business and politics.

 * @source en.wikinews.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Gadget-dictionaryLookupHover.js
 * 
 * Note this script can take a number of parameters. Parameters are stored in the wiktLookup object.
 * Generally its a good idea to set parameters before the onload event is fired (some parameters it
 * matters, others it doesn't). An example of parameters would be using the following js code (don't
 * feel like you have to set all of them. they all have defaults. this is just an example):
 * 
 * if (!window.wiktLookup) wiktLookup = {};
 * wiktLookup.count = 1; // number of defn to return.
 * wiktLookup.showWord = 'bold'; // to show what word we're looking up. one of bold, none, link
 * wiktLookup.noRedir = false; // true to stop magic (not mediawiki)-redirection. unrecomended
 * wiktLookup.audio = true; // true, false, autoplay. NOT IMPLEMENTED
 * wiktLookup.width = 500; // width of box. make sure number not string. in units of pixels.
 * wiktLookup.height = 400; //- height of box
 * wiktLookup.key = 'w';// - ctrl+shift+key makes box popup (should be lowercase. default is 'l')
 * wiktLookup.reverseShift = false; // - if set, requires shift+double click to lookup a word.
 * wiktLookup.mode = 'context'; // - context, bottom. default to context. to display as tooltip, or at bottom
 * wiktLookup.definitionBegin = 'Definition ('; // - for i18n. in english it is 'Definition ('. used in mode='bottom'
 * wiktLookup.definitionEnd = '):'; //	- for i18n. in English it is '):' used in bottom mode
 * wiktLookup.hideText = 'hide'; //- for i18n. in English it is 'hide'. used in bottom mode.
 * wiktLookup.exit = true; // have a hide link.
 * wiktLookup.disableByDefault = true; // enable only in &lt;span class=&quot;wiktLookup-enable&quot;&gt;blah&lt;/span&gt; sections.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Featured books / nominations ==

Twice or three times in the past week or so, IP editors have put up a book in the Featured Books Nominations page that is not, in fact, a Wikibook. I'm reluctant to suggest that we should limit editing that page to those who have accounts, but perhaps it is necessary... we're not in the business of advertising other people's books, of course, nor of providing a home for those advertisements, IMHO. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:45, 26 February 2014 (UTC)
: I see that QuiteUnusual has now protected the page.  Seems like a good idea for now.  We do seem to be inviting people to nominate any book on pages like [[Wikibooks:Featured_books]] which has a nice big button saying ''Nominate a book''.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:10, 26 February 2014 (UTC)
::True, that. Still, I would have thought that, seeing this is the English Wikibooks site, that they would have at least had the courtesy to try to push books that are in English... Well, we'll see what happens. Maybe the button text should be changed? &quot;Nominate a Wikibook&quot;? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:24, 26 February 2014 (UTC)

== Plagiarism on World History  ==

The wikibook World History(which it seems has had little activity for long time) seems to be largely plagiarism, I was suspicious and you have already seen/approved the first edit I made of deleting copied materials. It looks like theirs alot more than that, should I go head and delete more? Most of this looks like it would violate copyright laws although some looks likes it copied and pasted from other wikibooks, is that ok(they were not cited)? -Worldhistorian123 [[User:Worldhistorian123|Worldhistorian123]] ([[User talk:Worldhistorian123|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Worldhistorian123|contribs]]) 02:06, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

== Thanks for the speedyD help ==

I had trouble getting '&amp;' to behave in a link forming template and consequently need a number of pages double moved (''I'd stubbed in before I noticed the url malformation''). That is ''possibly some'' to back over the redirect where they came from initially... OR at least one like that as below. I'm still trying to juggle organizing things into 4+ sub-books (Divisions) vice 4+ volumes, so I've no list yet to hand off.

Thank you for welcoming me to wikibooks!

== Interview to help us with Master Thesis? ==

Hi Xania,

We are two students doing our M.Sc. thesis about motivational factors to contribute with Open Educational Content and we need people to interview. We were wondering if you would like to help us? The interview won't take long and we can do it over Skype. Interested? Please send me an e-mail me at ottve507@student.liu.se or leave us a reply here.

We would be really happy if you choose help us!

== RFP ==

Thought this might help. When you get at least 25 supports, you'll need to make a request at [[m:Steward requests/Permissions#CheckUser_access|Meta]] to have the CheckUser bit assigned. Before it can be assigned, you'll need to follow the instructions on identifying to the Foundation that can be found linked to from [[m:Identification_noticeboard|the Identification Noticeboard]]. Once this is done a member of the Foundation staff will add you to the Noticeboard, and then a Steward will add the rights, and ask a CU list admin to add you to the CheckUser mailing list, the CheckUser wiki and the IRC channels if you want to use them. This will take a few days end to end. The Steward applying the rights will examine the voting carefully so again expect some delays!

== Help ==

Hi :) I have become active on urdu wikibooks, and would like to enchance it from scratch. May you help me?

Recently I have one problem, [https://ur.wikibooks.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%86%DA%AF%D9%84_%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B1 in this page], side templates which indicate versions of book (pdf, print etc) dont look like in [[C Programming|this page]] in enwikibooks. --[[User:محمد شعیب|Muhammad Shuaib]] ([[User talk:محمد شعیب|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/محمد شعیب|contribs]]) 17:17, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:Hi, I'm not too sure.  I'm not very technical but it appears that Template:Print Version is slightly different on en.wikibooks and ur.wikibooks.  I'd suggest going to [[Template:Print version]] and directly copying the contents of that content over to [http://ur.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Print_version here].  If this doesn't work you could leave a message on [[User:QuiteUnusual]]'s talk page as he is more technical.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:30, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi, this page is spam - I see you weren't sure. This type of user page (often known as a [[meta: NTSAMR|NTSAMR spam)]] is common across all projects. If you CheckUser the account there's a common pattern that can be seen that helps identify it. In addition, if you look at CentralAuth to view the account you'll see there's no account on login.wikimedia.org which is a red flag that it is a spambot [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 07:31, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:I had suspected as much.  Thought I had CU'ed it but when I logged in yesterday evening (21.00 UK time) there was so many edits, so much spam, all types of things - busy day.  Any idea about the point of such spam?  It's often gone within minutes well before any chance of being indexed by search engines, nobody clicks on the links, it all just seems even more pointless than regular spam.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:57, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

== Thanks for your assistance ==

Dear Xania,&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for your assistance with my proposed edits to the cookbook.  I thought I would mention in advance that I hope begin a process to distinguish Texas cuisine from Tex-Mex cuisine and, to that end, hope to adjust the majority of the recipes in the 'Texan cuisine' category to be in the Tex-Mex cuisine category and to categorize other existing recipes as being 'Texas cuisine'.  I apologize if this is not the right place in which to mention these matters.  Do not hesitate to let me know if there is a more appropriate forum. &lt;br /&gt;
Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;

== The Computer Revolution ==

Dear Xania,

Thank you for doing so much to make Wikibooks better.

One thing mystifies me.
Recently you added the sentence &quot;This page should be written.&quot;
to the top of a page.[https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=The_Computer_Revolution/Communication&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=2645831]

Huh? That page has been written.
That page is not finished, but what page at Wikibooks is ever finished?

== Reviewer ==

Hello Xania,

I can see that you have been reviewing most of the edits on Wikibooks, and can also see that or rather I would say that you are the only active admin out here. I wanted to understand few things stated [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reviewers here], about the Automatic criteria for Reviewer.

The points are:
&lt;br&gt;1. 5 or more edits are in recent changes at the time automatic reviewer promotion is checked (this works out to be anytime in the past week).
&lt;br&gt;2. 10 or more unique pages are edited at least once.
&lt;br&gt;3. 8 edits are spaced 2 or more days apart from each other (which takes at least 14 days, if you edit every 2 days).

Oh and also, how can I have the reviewer tool, if I have never been granted reviewer access.↓
*Have never been blocked, and have never had the reviewer tools removed (you can request the tools if otherwise).

If you can assist me in this, I would be grateful.

Danke.

:Hi, I am quite active at the moment but there are at least two other active admins at present.  I don't understand the point you were asking.  The list about 5 or more edits in recent changes, etc. is all correct.  The criteria for Reviewer was created so that reviewers have a diverse range of edits on the site rather than just editing their user page 100 times, constant minor edits on one book, etc.  By fulfilling the criteria a Reviewer probably has plenty of experience at Wikibooks.  It usually takes 1-2 months depending on how often you are online, etc.  Alternatively users can request Reviewer flag at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]] --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:07, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

:No no. What I meant to ask was something else. However, now I have re read (paying attention) and understood the criterion's. Can you advice me, when I might ask for a Reviewer Flag for myself, as I wish to assist as much as I can, apart from providing my own edits, which are currently at German Language. Oh, I really liked the way you have showcased your page, and the signature. I have tried few of the things you have done, on my own page. I really liked it. :) Danke.

:You can ask at any time on the RfP page.  If you have a good history here and on another Wikimedia site it will likely be granted.  Feel free to copy or use the signature but beware that some Wikimedia sites (Wikipedia, I think) don't allow graphics in signatures.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:02, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

:I don't think for the time being I would ask for it, as I have just started editing again. As such I had started using WP from somewhere around the year 2005-06(When I did not have any user ID). However, due to many constraints, I have not been active till this year, and yes, I have committed mistakes, also on Wikipedia, but I am learning, and I am not repeating the errors anymore (hopefully). I actually just copied the rack template from your page, as that was something which I liked. I am currently editing the German book, and if there is anything, you think, I am doing incorrect, kindly let me know, and if you can also let me know of the way I am progressing, given your time here, and experience you have.

== You Tube Links. ==

Hi I am unsure of whether we can accept any social media links here as citations? Like say You tube, or Flickr, or FaceBook etc. Even Vogue in fact for in that matter? Please see the citation here at [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Industrial_and_commercial_practice/Information_and_communication_technology ICT], which has provided a [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Industrial_and_commercial_practice/Information_and_communication_technology#cite_note-2 You Tube] link. Also this[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Industrial_and_commercial_practice/Information_and_communication_technology#cite_note-3 You Tube] one.
:I don't think there's any policy against sources and links to Youtube.  They seem a really good idea.  I would avoid Facebook links as links and sources should only be made for sites where registration isn't necessary.  Ciatations are not needed on Wikibooks as much as on Wikipedia.  Most books don't have many.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:43, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
::That is what I was thinking too, when I was unable to locate any guide on it. I propose few thibgs:
*Start with citations, wherever feasible, since all the books cannot have sources always. Like the German book that I am currently editing, is being done from my own notes, which I have with me.
*There should be a guide and rule for citations.
*External links should not be of Social sites or blog sites, except for some verified ones like govt. sites or say Microsoft site, etc.,
*If possible inlines can be cited, but not at a cost of server load. I would not want WB to suffer any loads as this is a far far better project than the current WP.

Please let me know what you think of this so that we can put this forward.

:(edit conflict) See the question '''How do I cite sources or include references?''' in [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikimedians#Wikibookians take a different approach to many things]], and also [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style#Bibliography]] for how Wikibooks differs from Wikipedia. What external links to include is left up to book contributors, and when there is disagreement through consensus discussion on the book's relevant discussion page. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:08, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
:I am inclined to be against any new policies and rules.  Wikibooks doesn't need more fixed rules and policies and it's probably the biggest problem with Wikipedia today.  On Wikipedia it is very hard to argue one's opinions in VfD, RfA, etc. when the idea on Wikipedia seems to be that the be heard you must quote lots of policies (according to [[BLG]], [[FFT]] and [[My Hamster]]).  As Wikibooks is a collection of books it should be left for those working on each book to decide how they want to structure their book - Wikipedia is one book (an encyclopaedia), Wikibooks is thousands of books.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:23, 17 May 2014 (UTC)

:I agree with both of you, as I see that both commons and wikipedia are bound on more warring and arguments, than anything else. However, the only reason I suggested was due to the fact that if all kinds of citations are provided, than there can be problems, however those can be rectified when reviewing, still. I agree too that wb is better with less hassle than others. I also believe that this place is for users who can assist others by making good stuff, and that anyways helps everyone. Good to all.
*P.S.: I hate what Wikipedia has become, with all sorts of bad things, and always having conflicts etc.

: One of the four (or so) systemic woes of Wikipedia is a lack of common purpose.  People pour enthusastic effort into writing artiles that other people then nominate for deletion on the grounds that they're beneath the dignity of an encyclopedia, or whatever; working at cross-purposes, anyway.  One great thing about Wikibooks is that the community naturally divides up neatly into groups (albeit small ones) with common interests, by book.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 00:07, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

== Finding What Is Obvious ==

Where might I find info. about what to do about orphaned sections? [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 23:32, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
:Orphaned sections of a book?  If you feel that the page is no longer needed then you can add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|reason}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  If you think that others might disagree (maybe, on a very active book) then it would be best to add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{rfd}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the page and then add a new section to the [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion]] page so that a discussion can take place to decide what to do.  Alternatively you could try to reincorporate the work into the book if it's possible.
The book [[Using Wikibooks]] has information about most aspects of Wikibooks and is useful for most things but for anything else it's best to ask an active editor or post a message in one of the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room]]s (all of the reading rooms are on admins' watchlists so any comments left there will be seen fairly quickly).--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:47, 17 May 2014 (UTC)

Hello [[User:Jsumerau|Jsumerau]],

I see that you have made quite a lenghty edit to the following topic :[https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Introduction_to_Sociology/Family&amp;oldid=2644089&amp;diff=cur Family]. I have been reviewing the same edit, and have accepted it. However, would like you to check the same again, and try and use some words which will help it make a better read than the use of the words which might lead to mere complications and make questions arise due to confusions as well. Thus request you to recheck your edit, and try and rephrase the subject to make it fir for better read. In case you want to discuss further, please start the topic on the discussion page of the book, and tag my user id there. I will surely respond upon the same.
Also, if you wish I would be happy to assist.

Hello [[User:Harrybrowne1986]],

I am currently in the process of revising the book with the help of the principle author and substantial changes should be expected.  As far as terminology/wording goes, we are merely making adjustments to bring the book into form for use in Introduction to Sociology classes.  As such, I'm uncertain what words you would like changed (feel free to send me some examples), and I don't know if changing them (while remaining appropriate for a college textbook being adopted for use in courses) would be possible without reviewing specific cases.  All that said, lovely to hear from you and thanks for your thoughts.  Best, j

:Thanks for looking at it and advising me of the same. I understand that you are working with the original researcher, which is nice. The words I meant were few status words, sentence construction. I believe that I see them as a bit different than how other readers might see, so like this sentence '''built upon monogamous sexual and emotional relations''', which has '''monogamy''' related to it, can be broadened to state the word '''monogamy''' and also describe it a bit. Again, although this sentence was previously, '''In earlier centuries, young adults were expected to court with the intention of finding a marriage partner, rather than for social reasons.''', you amended it to '''In earlier centuries, young adults were expected to court with the intention of finding marriage partners, rather than for social reasons.'''. I still think the sentence can be made more constructive like '''In ''the'' earlier centuries, young adults were expected to court with the intentions ''to find'' a marriage ''partner'', rather than for ''any other'' social reasons.''' Although these are some of my understanding portions, it can be still what you stated, as this is a book, and can be stated to best suit the readers.
:Saying that, just a gentle reminder, please use four tildes to end any conversation, as this assists in knowing when and by whom was this signed.
:Please advice if I am correct in my figure of sentences, otherwise, the ones by you are still okay.
:Danke Schôn. [[User:Harrybrowne1986|Vishal]][[User Talk:Harrybrowne1986| Bakhai]] - [[Special:Contributions/Harrybrowne1986|Works]][[Image:Flag_of_India.svg|15px]] 08:12, 8 June 2014 (UTC)


Hello [[user:Harrybrowne1986]],

Thank you for your thoughts and response.  I think (based on audience) these wordings will likely be best, but just in case I've passed your notes on to the primary author (Ryan Cragun) for his review since he is much more tech savvy and familiar with wiki norms as well as the audience we're working for.  Also, I'm not sure I know what a &quot;tildes&quot; is, but I'll try to sign off accordingly (I'm not very tech savvy).  Best, j. [[User:Jsumerau]][[User Talk:Jsumerau]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Computer-integrated manufacture takes [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Systems_and_control/Manufacturing_systems#Flexible_manufacturing_systems_.28FMS.29|FMS]], the companies manufacturing line and all other aspects of the company into one network where they all share information with one another; computers control the whole process&lt;ref name=&quot;CIM&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-integrated_manufacturing&lt;/ref&gt;. CIM works on [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Systems_and_control/Flow_charts#Closed-loop|closed-loop]] processes and real-time inputs are gathered from sensors&lt;ref name=&quot;CIM&quot;/&gt;.

Tasks that CIM performs may be:
* The design of a product using [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Industrial_and_commercial_practice/Information_and_communication_technology#Computer-aided_design_.28CAD.29|CAD]]
* Planning the most cost effective workflow
* Controlling the operations of machinery and equipment
* Performing business task like: ordering stock and materials and invoicing customers

=== Advantages ===
The main main advantages of CIM are&lt;ref name=&quot;CIM&quot;/&gt;:
* It's faster
* Less error-prone
* Creates an automated manufacturing process

=== Disadvantage ===
A disadvantage of CIM is that it is full dependant on computer data. This can be a problem if the data can only be interpreted on one brand of software company, and if some machinery requires software for another software brand then this can be an issue (Machinery's automatic storage and retrieval system (ASRS) is loyal to a different software brand to which the company works with). This problem can be fixed with the use of a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Data_Management product data management system (PDM)].

== Product data management (PDM) with CIM ==
PDM follows a product's process from design to manufacture; it uses plans, [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Industrial_and_commercial_practice/Information_and_communication_technology#Virtual_modelling_and_testing|3D Models]], [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Industrial_and_commercial_practice/Information_and_communication_technology#Computer-aided_design_.28CAD.29|CAD]], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control CNC programs] and all other design/manufacture documents. PDM also monitors changes that have been made onto a database, this means that further changes can happen based upon this change.

=== Advantages of Product data management (PDM)&lt;ref name=&quot;PDM&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_data_management#Utilities_of_Product_Data_Management&lt;/ref&gt; ===
* '''Reduced time-to-market''' as all of the data is instantly available for everyone on the team to see, this eliminates waiting times during development.
* '''Improved productivity''' as changes are handled automatically, reducing document retrieval time.
* '''Improved control''' due to efficient control management systems that ensure that everyone in the company are working from the most recent data.

== Enterprise resource planning (ERP) within CIM ==
'''Enterprise resource planning''' ('''ERP''') is a business management software—usually a suite of integrated applications—that a company can use to collect, store, manage and interpret data from many business activities, including&lt;ref name=&quot;ERP&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Product planning, cost and development
* Manufacturing or service delivery 
* Marketing and sales
* Inventory management
* Shipping and payment

ERP systems can cost a lot of money to install as well as the fact that when the new hardware and software is installed, there is a 'switch over' period; staff will need to be trained with the new software which takes more time&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Lean manufacturing and just-in-time systems ==
=== Lean manufacturing ===
Lean manufacturing improves business performance using simple, practical tools and techniques to enhance quality, cost, delivery and people contribution&lt;ref name=&quot;LeanVid&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEIeQRp4AHU&lt;/ref&gt;. The end goal of Lean is to make the end product have value&lt;ref name=&quot;Lean&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing&lt;/ref&gt;. You can learn more about lean manufacturing [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEIeQRp4AHU here].

Lean manufacturing requires&lt;ref name=&quot;LeanVid&quot;/&gt;:
* that people need to change their long standing work practices and ideas.
* that senior management needs to drive the lean principles forward with total commitment to its success.
* a total change in culture.
* you find all of the waste within the current system.

==== The five key stages of lean manufacturing ====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Key Stage !! Content
|-
| 1 || Value || This is about what the customer is prepared to pay for.
|-
| 2 || Value stream || Value stream mapping is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_Stream_Mapping&lt;/ref&gt;.
|-
| 3 || Flow || The idea of an uninterrupted work flow; materials come in, final product goes out.
|-
| 4 || Pull || The idea of responding to demand, rather than just producing a consistent amount.
|-
| 5 || Perfection (Kaizen) || Use the approach of continuously improving the working process.
|}

=== Just-in-Time (JIT) systems ===
JIT is a Japanese manufacturing philosophy. JIT ensures that the right materials, components and products arrive at the right time, the right amount and right place. This reduced over stock, which would require the company to pay for a storage location. This also means that you don't buy too much stock for a product that might not be of high demand at that time. One disadvantage of JIT is that it is totally reliant on the suppliers coming in at the right time, else manufacturing will be put to a halt.

=== Pull tools - Kanban ===
This is the concept of when a product/material is removed from the shelf to be used as a part of the final product, on the shelf it is replaced by a card saying that this needs to be replaced&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIv2e61SH1A&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The main benefit of Kanban is that it reduces the amount of work-in-progress and finished goods in stock; thus making for a more effective JIT system.

A visual demonstration can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIv2e61SH1A

=== Perfection tools - Kaizen ===
This is the concept of tweaking small parts of of the production process, the cost for these tweaks are minimal, but they can achieve a small over all advantage for the company&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Flexible manufacturing cells ===
This is there the machinery is arranged in such a way that means that process can happen in a cyclic way. This video illustration will give you a good insight on how the process works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUPji7L9aSs

== CAM in context of CIM ==
What is CAM? [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing Click here].

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
| Give a greater control of the production process, meaning that it can be fully automated. || Extremely high set-up costs as the machinery costs a lot.
|-
| Safer for humans, no human risk as no traditional tools are used. || Has negative effects on employment (human jobs are replaced by machines).
|-
| Flexible production thanks to the use of CNC machinery which can be re-programmed.  || 
|-
| The amount of products produced can be directly linked to the demand, this means that there is no waste and minimal storage costs. || 
|-
| Improved productivity as production times are consistent. || 
|-
| Increased reliability and productivity of repetitive tasks. || 
|-
| Reduced manufacturing times as efficient cutting paths are generated by software. || 
|}

== Computer-aided quality (CAQ) control systems ==
CAQ can be achieved with the use of the manufacturing cell: coordinate-measuring machine (CMM). This is used to accurately measure the products that are being created to make sure that they are of the highest standard. All of this data is fed back into the database for analysis of tolerances and quality, thanks to laser scanning technology.

== Automated materials-handling systems ==
This is the process of transporting goods and components within the factory. These components will come in from a truck, they can then be place on a conveyor belt and be taken to the correct location. Goods can then be loaded onto another truck for exportation. 

These forms of transport could be:
* Conveyor belts
* Fork-lift trucks
* Manual offloading and on-loading onto a lorry.
* [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Systems_and_control/Computer-integrated_manufacture#Automated_guided_vehicles_.28AGV.29|Automatic guided vehicle (AGV)]]

Systems are best when they require no manual labour, this means that all of the machinery and stock levels are consistent, there's no room for human error that way.

== Automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS) ==
[[File:Miniload ASRS.jpg|thumb|right|Fully automated 4 aisle bin warehouse for electronic components with Mustang AS/R machines from TGW]]
This is a robotic sorting, storing and retrieving system used in warehouses. All stock levels and locations of parts are stored within the computer; they are all physically stored on a shelves that are often stacked up high to make the most of a small space. Items are can then be placed onto conveyor belts or [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Systems_and_control/Computer-integrated_manufacture#Automated_guided_vehicles_.28AGV.29|AGV]]s. 

The advantage of this is to speed up the process, it allows for products to get to market quicker meaning that products can sell better. Additionally, this reduces labour costs, but the sorting machinery would have high set-up costs.

== Automated guided vehicles (AGV) ==
This is a machine that is powered by one of the following methods: 
* Radio frequency from wires buried in the floor, local transmissions are sent from the floor to the vehicle&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_guided_vehicle#Wired&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Optical sensors in a laser-guided navigation system&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_guided_vehicle#Laser_target_navigation&lt;/ref&gt;.
They are small independent powered vehicles that move parts between machines and work-centres. They receive their command and instruction from a central computer, or from their on-board computer&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_guided_vehicle#Traffic_control&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[File:AGVs amarillos.jpg|thumb|centre|]]

== The impact of advanced manufacturing technologies on employment ==
Having a CIM system integrated can result in a reduction in workforce, however, for the people that are still working there they will be skilled professionals in fields such as:
* Product designers
* Manufacturing engineers
* CNC programmers
* People that use simulation tools

Affects on employment:
* Reduction is low skill workforce
* Increase in the need for skill workforce
* Need highly computer literate workforce
* Greater need for more flexible workforce
* Workers need to be multi-skilled
* Effects on workforce morale.

{{Sidebox|{{:RAC Attack - Oracle Cluster Database at Home/RAC Attack 12c/Flex Cluster and ASM TOC}}|}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Purpose ==
The purpose of this particular is to illustrate a conversion from standard to flex for both Cluster and ASM. Although the names Flex Cluster and Flex ASM appear similar, they are two distinct and for the most part mutually exclusive, components of RAC in 12c.

== Flex Clusters ==
[[Image:RA-Flex_Clusters_12c-Intro_Illustration.PNG|Flex Clusters Illustration]]

Flex Clusters introduces (among many other new features) the concept of Hub and Leaf nodes. 

=== Hub Nodes ===
Hub Nodes are similar to Oracle Grid Infrastructure nodes in an Oracle Clusterware standard Cluster configuration.

=== Leaf Nodes ===
Leaf Nodes are different from standard Oracle Grid Infrastructure nodes, in that they do not require direct access to shared storage, but instead request data through Hub Nodes.

[[Image:RA-Flex_Clusters_12c-Intro-Leaf_and_hub_nodes.PNG|Leaf and Hub Nodes in Flex Cluster]]

Leaf nodes were designed to contain application (non-database) components of a system. For example, one could place Fusion Middleware, EBS, IDM etc on a set of leaf nodes, where as on the hub nodes the actual databases for the application would reside.

For a standard cluster to covert to a Flex Clusters, Flex ASM must be enabled.

== Flex ASM ==
Oracle Flex ASM enables Oracle ASM instances to run on a separate physical server from the database servers. An Oracle ASM instance can operate in several configurations in Oracle Flex ASM. The aim of Flex ASM is to consolidate ASM instances into a set of nodes within a cluster.

[[Image:RA-Flex_Clusters_12c-Intro-Flex_ASM.PNG|Flex ASM]]

== Assumptions ==
This lab assumes that the user has an existing 2-node RAC environment configured as per the base RAC Attack 12c manual instructions.

I'm first drafting a lot for the [[Topology]] wikibook and a new overview work on [[Undergraduate Mathematics]]. This means rewriting a lot of definitions and theorems from English Wikipedia and I feel that being able to import large amounts of text from the site may speed up the job immensely. Otherwise the potentially hundreds of import requests could be a bother for Admins. I understand this is a right reserved for perhaps more experienced editors; I am happy to work for a while longer and request again.
:Done.  If you have any problems ask me or another regular. Read the background to importing on [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_import]] also.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:25, 22 April 2014 (UTC){{end closed}}</text>

This is a graduate level Transportation Economics class text. I am the primary author. [[User:DavidLevinson|dml]] ([[User talk:DavidLevinson|talk]]) 04:06, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
:A quick look at the book (it's impossible for me to understand a word of it given my age), I believe that the book could benefit from a navigational device such as {{tl|navigate}}. This will make the book easier to navigate when it is read online. Also, I think the reference format is a little inconsistent. Otherwise, it looks fine. Good luck with the book!

::Not so sure about this. The book looks like it contains some [[WB:OR|original research]]. see [[Transportation Economics/Revenue/The Choice Between Taxes and Tolls]]. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 18:48, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
::: REFLIST was added, it is citing research, not original research, thanks for noting it. [[User:DavidLevinson|dml]] ([[User talk:DavidLevinson|talk]]) 18:16, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
:::: I guess that's OK then, as the research is already published in reputable journals. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:13, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
::{{Support}} Generally the book looks to have a high quality and level of completeness, and to be suitable for featured status. Personally, I like to see a [[Help:Print_versions|print version]] of the whole book too, and perhaps the text in some of the economic charts could be bigger, but these need not be a bar to featured status I think. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:13, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

::I am new and just finding my way here.  Is this process all that exists so far, for reviewing a book?  I am looking for something like the copyediting-upon-request and peer-review-upon-request services offered in Wikipedia.  Are there equivalents here?  About this transportation book, I notice some copyediting needed, e.g. in the [[Transportation Economics/Revenue/The Choice Between Taxes and Tolls]] section mentioned above. There is mention both of &quot;this section&quot; and &quot;this paper&quot;, perhaps reflecting incomplete adaption of the chapter from the author's article that is the source. --[[User:Doncram|Doncram]] ([[User talk:Doncram|talk]]) 15:14, 17 August 2010 (UTC)
:::{{comment}} As far as I know, those kind of procedures aren't used here, though pages can be labelled as needing attention from an expert with {{tlx|attention}} or requests for help can be made on the [[WB:Reading room/Projects]] page. Probably the best option is to fix any obvious issues yourself or leave a message on the book's talk pages. It is quite common for books to be featured while they are still under construction, anyway. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:08, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

{{comment}} One difficulty I find is the that the navigation breaks down.  Starting with the transition from [[Transportation Economics/Agents]] to the next page on Planning, several of the pages are shared with the [[Fundamentals of Transportation]], which is also of high quality worked on by some of the same authors, etc.  But it would be nice to find a way to repair this. Two possibilities that exist that I can think of
#Fork (that is directly copying) the pages from [[Fundamentals of Transportation]] into [[Transportation Economics]] and continue adding navigation templates of the style already added. 
#Try the generally discouraged practice of placing the core material (excluding category templates, etc.) that is the same for both books into a template page that then get's transcluded into both books, with appropriate navigation &amp; category templates included after the transclusion.  One problem with this idea is that if someone decides to take that page of the book in a new direction they may be inadvertently changing the other book in some less than appropriate way.
Maybe someone else has a more clever idea then these two. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 17:50, 12 October 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Sudanese Republic=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;This short-lived nation was called French Sudan when it first emerged from the former French West Africa in 1958 but soon changed its name to the Sudanese Republic. Only a few months later, in early 1959, it merged with another former French colony, Senegal, to become the Mali Federation. See FRENCH WEST AFRICA and MALI FEDERATION for stamps used in the area before and later.

* The one stamp known is inscribed “REPUBLIQUE SOUDANAISE” in the frank.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Morocco''' (المغرب in Arabic, ⵍⵎⴰⵖⵔⵉⴱ in Berber) is a country in northern Africa on the Mediterranean coast.  The capital is '''Rabat''' and the currency is the Moroccan dirham.

==Geography==
Morocco shares borders with Spain along the coast with [[../Spain|Spain]]'s exclaves: Ceuta, Melilla, and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, [[../Algeria|Algeria]] to the east and Western Sahara to the south.  Western Sahara is claimed by Morocco as a part of the country so technically Morocco also shares a border with [[../Mauritania|Mauritania]] in the south.  

The highest mountain in Morocco is [[w:Toubkal|Toubkal]] at 4,167 m.

==History==

==Economy==

==People==
Arabic and Berber are the country's official languages.  [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Islam|Islam]] is the main religion in Morocco and is practised by almost all of the population.

Hello. I am requesting a deletion of [[Identified Health Hazard]], as this looks completely absurd stuff that has been written. It does not make any sense, and does not meet the criteria for a book. Above that, the way it has been stated, and the context make no sense. I have tagged it with Deletion at the page, and also notified the user with a warning message. Please let me know, if this is correct, and delete the page! Danke.

I think I could have just speedy deleted it but I'll let y'all decide.  The 2 (now 3) cleanup templates consume more space than the actual recipes which consists of 10 words, a full stop and a comma.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:17, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

: I have edited the recipe to better fit the format of other recipes, but there was some guesswork involved. Is the recipe still a stub? Does the recipe still need cleanup? Is a more specify measurement of yogurt called for? I am neutral about the appropriateness of this recipe for inclusion in the cookbook. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:36, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

By the way, this part is intentionally not detailed, for it should be put on a single printed page, and it might even be effective to formulate thoughts shortly, allowing people to realize that their mind is also needed for the utilization of this knowledge.</text>

Wireless networks are convenient ways that modern technology uses to create networks with low costs as there are almost no wires involved. Wireless access points (WAP) allow devices to connect to such networks. the network can continue to run as a normal network. There are two types of wireless network methods that AQA have said you need to be aware of; [[w:Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi]] and [[w:Bluetooth|Bluetooth]]. These are both radio-based protocols that are used to create networks that users can transfer data over.
==Wi-Fi==
[[File:Wi-Fi Logo.svg|thumb|right|Wi-Fi logo.]]
{{Main|w:Wi-Fi|l1= Wi-Fi}}

'''Wi-Fi''' (also written '''Wifi''' or '''WiFi''') is a trademark name for a technology that allows devices to wirelessly '''access a local area network''' as well as '''data transfer'''. [[w:Wi-Fi Alliance|The Wi-Fi Alliance]] defines Wi-Fi as any '''wireless local area network''' ('''WLAN''') products that use [[w:IEEE 802.11|IEEE 802.11 standards]]. The IEEE is the [[w:Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ]]. Wi-Fi uses a radio wave frequency range of 2.4GHz to 2.5GHz and 4.9GHz to 5.8GHz although allowed channels vary between countries. In Europe only 5.240-5.700GHz of the 5GHz frequency band is usable.

Devices connect to a Wi-Fi network by means of a wireless router or 'hotspot' which usually has an approximate range of 20 metres indoors and greater range outdoors. Because wireless is always less secure than wired, Wi-Fi is usually considered less secure than ethernet connection. Wi-Fi can be encrypted using either [[w:WEP|WEP]], [[w:WPA|WPA]] or [[w:WPA2|WPA2]].

==Bluetooth==
[[File:BluetoothLogo.svg|thumb|right|Bluetooth logo.]]
{{Main|w:Bluetooth|l1= Bluetooth}}
'''Bluetooth''' is a trademark name for a wireless technology with '''very short range'''. It can be used for '''data and media transfer between devices'''. The range of the radio wave frequency is 2.4GHz to 2.485 GHz. The small range of Bluetooth (approximately 5 metres) means that the network is call a '''Personal Area Network''' ('''PAN'''). However it can also be categorised under a '''wireless local area network''' ('''WLAN''').</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This purpose of this Wikibook is to provide an introduction to the mobile survey software suite called KoBo Toolbox (http://www.kobotoolbox.org/). Using the KoBo Toolbox, surveys for mobile Android devices, such as smartphones and tablets, can be created. The screenshot of the Android application shows a typical multiple-choice (single-select) question.

[[File:KoBoCollect-PetSurvey.png|thumb|right|A question in the KoBo App.]]

Although there are many mobile survey software suites, the KoBo Toolbox is particularly interesting for a number of reasons:

* open-source: free to use and change, fully transparent
* scalability: use multiple devices, aggregate results
* remote administration: results can be synchronized automatically
* robustness: works under difficult conditions, such as limited internet

The topics discussed in this Wikibook are listed below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">KoBo surveys are created using the standard Xform format, which is build on XML. In order to create these forms, we use KoBoForm (http://kobotoolbox.org/koboform).

== New Form ==
[[File:KoBoForm-NewForm.png|thumb|right]]

After the KoBoForm editor has loaded a menu bar is displayed. The '''Menu''' button on the left opens the file menu, using the option '''New form''', a form can be created.


== Overview ==
[[File:KoBoForm-EmptyForm.png|thumb|left|Empty form]]
The two panels is the bottom part of the screen are now populated, as seen in the '''Empty form''' image. On the left side the structure of the form is outlined. The new form is already populated with a few elements:

* New form 1: title of the form
* deviceid: automatic registration of Android device id number
* start: survey start date and time
* end: survey end date and time
* QuestionA01: first question, type single select
* OptionA01_1: first option to the first question

[[File:KoBoForm-FormTitle.png|thumb|right]]

From the structure we can see that all elements are contained within the '''New form 1''' element, and that '''OptionA01_1''' is also contained within '''QuestionA01'''.

[[File:KoBoForm-PetSurvey.png|thumb|right]]

The right hand panel shows the contents of the element which is selected in the left panel. When the form is created the '''New form 1''' element is active, and so this is displayed.

Since our survey will be on pets, we can change the title to '''Pet Survey''' as shown in the picture.

The form title in the structure is automatically updated to reflect the new title.

== User Accounts ==
Note that KoBoForm has the option to create a user account in order to save forms in between browser sessions. These accounts are stored offline, in the browser, which means that they will '''not''' synchronize across computers or browsers.

      <comment>/* A 2nd order type 2 loop goes into slew rate because of the limited HF gain of the loop filter */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">--BORGATO Pierandrea 19:21, 26 May 2014 (UTC){{User sandbox}}
&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;



=====Acquisition and tracking examples with evidence of slew rate limitations=====
&lt;br&gt;
======Onset of slewing in a 2nd order type 2 CDR with  VCO range limits and bang-bang PD======
This example is interesting because it corresponds to an architecture that is common, and also because it points out an intriguing analogy between the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 2|linear model of a 2-2 loop]] and this [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Applications of the 2nd order type 2 architecture|application of a non-linear 2-2 architecture]].


The VCO in a 2-2 CDR with bang-bang PD is limited in its excursion both because of:
#the limited amplification (variable with the jitter frequency) of the filter block, that receives the square wave of fixed amplitude coming out of the PD and that then drives the VCO frequency
#the rapid fall of the VCO gain at the extremes of the VCO characteristic (to simplify it is assumed here that the VCO characteristic is linear inside the range, and flat outside).

The limitation of the VCO &lt;u&gt;frequency&lt;/u&gt; is therefore a curve as in the following figure:



The curve plotted  (fine red line) approximates the curve of max frequency swing of the VCO using the condition of onset of slewing.

It should be kept in mind that the linear model ''(green curve in the figure at the page beginning)'' plots a tolerance function, while the onset of slewing plots a prudent boundary that is lower than the actual tolerance function (that varies with input amplitude and frequency!) in a strongly non linear case.


As long as the loop keeps on tracking, the PD keeps on its bang-bang and the phase error in front of the PD remains very limited. &lt;small&gt;For a run-length of n, it is limited by 2 &amp;Delta;&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;b-b&lt;/sub&gt; + (n-1)&amp;Delta;&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;.

For jitter frequencies of &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; above &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, the waveform at the PD output is amplified by G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and then used to drive the VCO.

For jitter frequencies of &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; below &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, the fundamental component of the waveform at the PD output is amplified by G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; / &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, which is higher than G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, and the loop is able to track with a slope (-20 dB/dec) of the Gain versus frequency curve. 

As long as the slew-rate of the incoming jitter A&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;

======A 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2 loop goes into slew rate because of the limited HF gain of the loop filter======

&lt;small&gt;When tracking becomes difficult because the loop must operate close to its ability to track, the effort becomes evident by the periodic deviation of the phase comparator output (same period as the input jitter) from its average level.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;small&gt;In case of a phase detector, such effort is made evident by a reduction of the bang-bang duty-cycle. Around the zero-crossing of the input jitter sinusoid, the PD output stays constant and indicates the onset of a phase error due to slewing.&lt;/small&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;The sinusoidal jitter signal must be considered in conjunction with the steady state error because a type 1 loop compensates all frequency differences and wander with a shift of the bias level of the signal driving the VCO. The slew rate slope of the CDR response is consequently increased in one direction and reduced by the same amount in the other direction. This would be exactly true if the VCO corresponded to its [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR' VCO#VCO characteristic|simulation model]], but is just approximately true because the actual VCO characteristic is never so neat, symmetric and and simple.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''Slewing can be defined as a contiguous sequence of ten or more identical phase-error indications'''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C.Walker article, IV. SLOPE OVERLOAD, B. Expression for Slope Overload, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;small&gt;When the jitter frequency is too high for a correct tracking, the slew-rate covers the entire jitter period, and the output jitter becomes a triangular saw-tooth of reduced amplitude.The CDR still tracks well because the steady-state frequency error &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; is tracked as well, as can be seen in the asymmetry of the triangular output wave.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;The following figure illustrates the above remarks with the phase signals of a typical CDR.&lt;/small&gt;
[[File:2014 10 15 Tracking is limited by the slew rate in a 2nd order type 2 PLL.png ‎|thumb|center|900px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Slew-rate limitations at medium and at high jitter frequencies.&lt;br&gt;The triangular wave of the output at high frequencies is symmetric: the type 2 loop squeezes to zero any steady state output error.&lt;/small&gt;]]
I&lt;small&gt;'''In this figure the slew rate is generated by  the low gain of the loop filter at frequencies higher than &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' (the frequency of the zero of the loop filter). The output wave from the Phase Detector retains its shape, but attenuated, with a ramp during slewing that compensates any steady-state error.[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Applications of the 2nd order type 2 architecture]]&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''There is another source of slew- rate in a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2 loop, that is the overall limitation of the VCO frequency range''' forced either by the saturation of the output of the loop filter at large signals, or by the saturation of the VCO characteristic at the extremes of its frequency range. This second source of slew-rate obviously takes places with much larger &amp;Delta;&amp;omega; and much higher &amp;omega;. '''In type 1 loops this latter is the only source of slew-rate''' (see next example).&lt;/small&gt;

======A 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 loop goes into slew rate only because of the VCO range limits======

[[File:2014 10 12 Slew rate limited 1-1 PLL.png|thumb|center|800px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Time diagram of phase waveforms at input and output of a 1 - 1 CDR during acquisition and tracking.&lt;br&gt;The CDR is slew rate limited, and the asymmetry of the slew-rates originates from the inaccuracy of the VCO free-running frequency.&lt;br&gt;The initial acquisition phases are deliberately made short and simple to focus on the tracking phase.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
::&lt;small&gt;During the first 100 simulation steps (1.78 nsec) there is no input signal.&lt;/small&gt;
:::&lt;small&gt;LOS is asserted in this interval and the CDR is free-running at its centre frequency &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;ffr&lt;/sub&gt;, that is 2000 ppm ( 0.2% ) slower than the nominal link frequency ( i.e. the frequency of the remote transmitter) of 6.28 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; rad/sec. After 1.78 nsec the PLL lags 0.22 rad behind the transmit clock.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;  &lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;Then the input signal appears (LOS is dis-asserted) with a &quot;step&quot; of +1.25 rad (useful to mark the beginning of the acquisition phase).&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The input signal is flat in phase for the time being (no jitter yet).&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The phase detector jumps from its intermediate state (that was forced by the LOS signal) to its upper state, signalling that a delay is detected.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;This jump propagates without appreciable delay to the VCO drive signal: the VCO jumps to its maximum possible frequency (D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; of the incoming signal is 50%) and its phase (i.e. the CDR output phase) increases linearly with its maximum possible slope.&lt;/small&gt;
:::&lt;small&gt;The VCO maximum frequency is 7.743 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; rad/sec (=12324 ppm) higher than &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (6.28e10 rad/sec), but this value must be reduced because the actual D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is  &lt; 100%  (D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;=50%), in order to obtain the maximum possible value of 4.71 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; rad/sec (=7499 ppm), that is the &quot;rising&quot; slew-rate of this CDR in the present conditions.&lt;/small&gt;
:::&lt;small&gt;In a similar way, the &quot;falling&quot; slew-rate of this CDR is  -7.22 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; rad/sec (=-11499 ppm). It is larger because of the offset between &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ''(2000 ppm, i.e. by 1.257e8 rad/sec)''.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;  &lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The output phase catches up with the input after 4.9 nsec.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The bang-bang detector, that has been frozen to its upper level during the catch-up transient, starts now its typical pattern of bang-bang frequent jumps.&lt;/small&gt;
:::&lt;small&gt;It may also be remarked that, as long as the PD follows its typical bang-bang pattern, the distance in phase between input and output (=the error signal) remains very close to zero, and there is no evidence of the steady-state phase error typical of linear systems. In this condition the PD operates very close to its middle point, where its gain is extremely high: the steady stye error of a type 1 system can be computed as the angular frequency offset, divided by the open loop gain. As the gain is almost infinite, the error is almost zero during this interval.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;  &lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;When 300 simulation steps have elapsed (5.35 nsec), the input signal starts an additional sinusoidal jitter with an angular frequency of 7.5 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; rad/sec and a peak amplitude of  1.20 rad.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The sinusoidal component of the input jitter starts with its maximum slope (9.0 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; rad/sec) and the slew-rate that the PLL can produce is slightly smaller: as indicated above it is 4.71 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; rad/sec&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The output phase cannot follow the input but follows its maximum slope until the input slows down and it can track it again. This happens 2.46 nsec after the start of the sinusoidal jitter.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;Then the tracking resumes until the falling slope of the input sinusoidal jitter becomes too steep and exceeds the maximum negative slew-rate that is  -7.22 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; rad/sec.&lt;/small&gt; 
::&lt;small&gt;  &lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;Once there has been tracking at one peak of the input sinusoid, all the subsequent cycles are identical, and the average value of the phase error waveform generates the average drive error at the VCO input that corrects the &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;ffr&lt;/sub&gt; difference.&lt;/small&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Robots in automated manufacturing systems ==
Currently robots are mainly used in the manufacturing industry working on automated production with manufacturing cells. These robots are machines that are re-programmable that are designed to manipulate and transport parts, tools and specialist processes; this can be achieved through various motion and it's used to achieve a a specific manufacturing task&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bara.org.uk/ At the heading: Industrial Robots Defined&lt;/ref&gt;. Japan are having further advances in robot technology, robot arms directly controlled by humans.

Robots generally have more freedom than just regular [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control CNC]; they can be used for tasks like painting, welding, material handling and assembly work. Robots can also have sensors added, this allows for feedback&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot&lt;/ref&gt;.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

| Good for repetitive, monotonous, mundane tasks with precision. || There's no standard programming language for robots, this means people need to learn a new language.
|-
| Good for hazardous environment (no one can get hurt). || Maintenance issues as there are many different types of robots, meaning that there's no standard check-up procedure, people need to be trained to test/fix each machine differently.
|-
| Can hold heavy loads. || High cost in making the robots safe around humans, sensors needed.
|-

== Industrial applications of artificial intelligence (AI) ==
[[File:HONDA ASIMO.jpg|thumb|right|ASIMO (2000) at the Expo 2005, a bipedal humanoid robot.]]

An AI robot is a robot that has human-like features, for instance, they have the ability to learn and react through experiences. The big problem that robot engineers/programmers face is trying to make robots to have feelings.

=== Expert systems ===
A robot expert system is a system where they have the ability to process large amount of information and make decision based upon that information, like what a human would&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph one: http://st-julians-itgs.wikispaces.com/3.11+Robotics,+artificial+intelligence+and+expert+systems&lt;/ref&gt;. An example of a expert system is an AI that you could play chess with; many moves have been taken into account before it moves, just like a human would. 

Expert systems linked with voice recognition would allow people to talk to them in order to solve problems. In the future, this technology would act as a personal assistant for people.

=== Autonomous robots ===
The ideal robot would be one that doesn't need to be programmed, one that learns the skills needed to perform in a particular environment. Intelligence is the key to this, not cameras (this is because cameras aren't as good as the human eye). However when it comes to robots, they can sense other things better than use like heat and X-rays.

Humans use some guess-work and assumptions to come to conclusions, robots use sensors and they decode each pixel from the camera and analyse the scene, this allows them to make their decisions that way.

== [[Chapter 1: Intro, What’s a Model/Theory?, Framework: Perception]] ==

Your recent edits to this book are fine but what is the book?  There is no book called ''Chapter 1: Intro, What's a Model''.  Chapter 1 of what?  Books on Wikibooks have the structure of '''BOOKNAME/PAGENAME'''.  If we know what book this is supposed to be a part of then it can easily be moved to the correct place.  Thanks.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:55, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
:OK, I have now moved the sub-page and the main page of the book to new locations so that they match titles of other books and so that they can be found more easily.  The new locations are:
* [[Models and Theories in Human-Computer Interaction]] - for the main page of the book
* [[Models and Theories in Human-Computer Interaction/What’s a Model]] - for the sub-page.

== Intro to Imported Libraries and other Functions ==

:In this chapter, we will cover some functions from various imported libraries that are commonly asked about, or used in Python. This chapter is not required to fully understand basics of Python. This chapter is meant to show further capability of Python, which can be utilized with what you already know about the language.

=== math ===

:The math library has many functions that are useful for programs that need to perform mathematical operations, that cannot be accomplished using the built in operators.

:This section assumes you have math training up to and including Trigonometry.

The following list, shows all the functions in the math library:
*math.ceil

*math.fmod (Not the most ideal for it's purpose. Will not be explained.)
*math.frexp (Outside the scope of this tutorial. Will not be explained.)
*math.fsum

=== tkinter ===

:The tkinter library is a basic GUI library that is built into Python.  It will work on all major platforms, although some platforms have bugs which need to be worked around.  We won't be covering those bugs here, as this is geared towards more of a general introduction.

:This section assumes you have a rough understanding of Object Oriented Programming, as it is quite essential to understand when building a GUI.

To start using tkinter, first you must create a main window:
 import tkinter
 
 root = tkinter.Tk()
 root.title = &quot;Demo Window&quot;
 root.grid(row=0,column=0)

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a balance that manufacturer need to get correct, this is the balance between making the product good for the environment and inexpensive to make/sell.

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is the process of reviewing a product's life, from &quot;cradle to grave&quot; (from when the materials are being obtained from the ground until the point it is disposed). 

== Life-cycle inventory (LCI) ==
Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental impact of certain products. The  BSI and ISO 14000 now demand that companies constantly improve their attitude toward the environment; this is measured through a life-cycle inventory.

A life-cycle inventory will look at all of the input and output processes that occur during the life-cycle of a product. 

This is split into two parts:

* '''Environmental inputs and outputs''' of raw materials and energy resources.
* '''Economic inputs and outputs''' of products, components or energy that are outputs from other processes.

[[File:LCI Diagram.png|thumb|centre|450px|This is an example of a Life-cycle inventory (LCI) diagram.]]

The formulation of the questions and the answers is extremely important, however this fall outside of the scope of this wikibook. For more information on survey design see the chapter [[Social_Research_Methods/Surveys|Surveys]] of the wikibook [[Social Research Methods]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Through out all of the design movements, there has been contrasting views of whether form or function is better. Currently in this society, form seems to be taking priority in products, function is still important, but if it's not aesthetically pleasing then it's not going to sell very well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">TICAS is the software that is primarily used for travel time and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data collection in Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP II) Project L38-Pilot Testing of Reliability Data and Analytical Tools. TICAS calculates and provides cumulative travel time with records every 0.1-mile from the specified start point to the end point along the corridor.  Data is available in varying time intervals, ranging from 30 seconds to one hour.

For primary test, three corridors were selected, and the routes were created and save in TICAS. The start and end points for the corridors are listed below in Table 1.

'''Table 1: Corridor Boundaries'''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Corridor !! From !! To !! Length (miles) !! Number of Stations
|-
| TH 100 || 77th Street || 57th Avenue || 14.6 || 30
|-
| I-94 (I-494 to TH 101) || I-494 || CR 81 || 9.0 || 11
|-
| I-94 (Minneapolis to St. Paul) || Plymouth Avenue || Mounds Boulevard || 12.8 || 29
|}

The team downloaded data from January 2006 through December 2012 for each corridor. Downloading the traffic data was a time consuming effort due to the fact that the TICAS software is only capable of calculating two months of data per query. In addition, when downloading the data for TH 100, TICAS would tend to quit working if more than two weeks of data were selected at one time, due to the large number of stations along the corridor.  If days with no travel time or VMT data available were selected when using TICAS, an “Error in evaluation” message would appear.  When this occurred, each individual day had to be checked to determine which days were missing data.  After recognizing that, in general, the only days with missing data were the first Saturday and Sunday of November each year (on occasion, the last weekend of October was missing data), the search was narrowed down fairly quickly and the days with missing data were simply not selected in TICAS.  

'''Table 2: Days with Missing TICAS Data'''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Year !! Days with Missing Data
|-
| 2006 || October 28th-29th
|-
| 2007 || November 3th -4th
|-
| 2008 || November 1th -2th
|-
| 2009 || October 31st-November 1st
|-
| 2010 || November 6th -7th
|-
| 2011 || November 5th -6th
|-
| 2012 || November 3th -4th
|}

For the further extension of the SHRP II Project L38, the team also downloaded the travel time and VMT data from TICAS on I-35E and TH 13. Instead of performing analysis with seven-year data, only data in year 2012 was downloaded. 

In summary, TICAS is a powerful software that could provide corridor-based traffic metrics like travel time and VMT. The data can be collected in every 30 seconds and can be specified in every 0.1 mile. However, there are some limitations when using TICAS. Firstly, downloading the traffic data with multiple years was a time consuming effort due to the fact that the TICAS software is only capable of calculating two months of data per query. Secondly, there is no button like &quot;Select All&quot; which enable user to download the data in large number of days. For example, if user needs to download certain traffic data for a whole year in 2012, TICAS does not allow selecting 366 days in 2012 directly, but select one by one for 366 times. Thirdly, TICAS cannot identify the specific date with error traffic data, but only give user a “Error in evaluation” message. When this occurs, each individual day has to be checked to determine which days are missing data.

== Creating new pages and then categorising them ==

Hi, I've noticed your recent edits and they seem good.  Here at Wikibooks, when creating new pages in a book, it is recommended to add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{bookcat}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the bottom of each new page.  This will add that page to a category which includes all the pages of the book.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:45, 27 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">TTRMS analysis tool provides numerous important surface plots that display individual records throughout an entire year for each corridor. This makes the plots more accurate and easier to compare with surface plots from other years and corridors. For all of the surface plots shown in this section, each day of the year is shown across the x-axis from left to right. The time of day is shown on the y-axis from bottom to top and is split into five-minute time intervals. 

Surface plots were prepared for all of the data elements included in the travel time reliability monitoring system (TTRMS) database.  These can broadly be categorized in two groups: one is the traffic data, which is continuous and includes the aggregate measures of vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and travel time.  The other is the non-recurring conditions data.  These records are not necessarily continuous as there are times when none of these conditions are present on the corridor.  The non-recurring conditions include:

•	Weather

•	Crash

•	Incident

•	Road Work

•	Event

Figure 1 and Figure 2 are examples of the surface plot for the crashes and incidents in 2012 along the I-94 Westbound from I-494 to TH 101. Crash and incident information was gathered from three different sources, which include:

•	Minnesota State Patrol Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) data

•	MnDOT’s Dynamic Message Sign (DMS) logs

•	Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) crash records.

Crash plots are color coded by crash severity. Incident plots are color coded by impact to roadway capacity.

Figure 3 is an weather surface plot example that shows the weather data collected at the Weather Underground site near the I-94 study corridor in 2012. The colors in the legend represent the precipitation type.

Figure 4 is an event surface plot example. The majority of the events considered in this analysis take place during or after the p.m. peak period. Therefore, events have a greater impact on the corridors where the traffic volume is highest during the p.m. peak period.

      <text xml:space="preserve">TTRMS tool is able to provide surface plots of travel time and VMT as well. Those plots can give user a visual view of the reliability of travel by time of day and day of the year. Instead of displaying travel time on the plots, TTRMS analysis tool uses travel time index (TTI). The travel time index is the ratio of the observed travel time divided by the speed limit (free-flow) travel time. This allows for an easier comparison between each of the corridors regardless of length or free-flow speed. The following thresholds were used for the travel time surface plots:

•	Speed limit travel time

•	The 45 miles per hour (mph) travel time. This threshold was chosen because MnDOT defines congestion as 45 mph or less. 

•	1.5-2.0 times the TTI

•	2.0-2.5 times the TTI

•	2.5-3.0 times the TTI

•	3.0-3.5 times the TTI

•	3.5-4.0 times the TTI

•	Greater than 4.0 times the TTI

Figure 1 is a example of TTI surface plot along I-94 Westbound from I-494 to TH 101 in 2012. The colors in the legends represent different TTI levels. The plots can automatically updated by different free-flow travel time input.

Figure 2 is a example of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) surface plot along I-94 Westbound from I-494 to TH 101 in 2012. In this plot, each five-minute observation is displayed as a unique value.  Seven VMT bins with increments of 750 vehicle-miles were selected for the VMT surface. In addition, the plot and bins can be updated by entering different &quot;base VMT&quot; to the TTRMS analysis tool.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Interactive Fiction?==

Interactive Fiction(commonly abbreviated as IF) is a genre of writing that evolved out of older text-based adventure games. The main point of differentiation is that the player can input commands and influence how the story proceeds. This makes the player an active participant as opposed to a passive observer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A typical IF follows the player as they interact with the places, people, and things within it. The player inputs commands via command prompt. An example of playing through a very minimalist IF is:

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:#E6E6E6; display:block; border:1px solid black; padding-left:5px&quot;&gt;
Magic Flask&lt;br /&gt;
An Interactive Fiction by Dylan Greene&lt;br /&gt;
Release 1 / Serial number 140527 / Inform 7 build 6L02 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD &lt;br /&gt;

Altar&lt;br /&gt;
You can see a flask here.&lt;br /&gt;

&gt;get flask &lt;br /&gt;
You got the flask!&lt;br /&gt;

    *** The End *** &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A [[w:Database_transaction|transaction]] is an embracing of '''one or more''' SQL statements - especially of such statements, which write to the database such as INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE, but also the SELECT command can be part of a transaction. All writing statements &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; be part of a transaction. The purpose of transactions is the guarantee that the database changes only from one consistent state to another consistent state fading out all intermediate situations. This holds true also in critical situations such as parallel processing, disc crash, power failure, ... . Transactions ensure the '''database integrity'''.

To do so they support four basic properties, which all in all are called the ''[[w:ACID|ACID paradigm]]''.
:{|
|-
| '''A'''tomic || All SQL statements of the transaction take place or none.
|-
| '''C'''onsistent || The sum of all data changes of a transaction transforms the database from one consistent state to another consistent state.
|-
| '''I'''solated || The isolation level defines, which parts of uncommited transactions are visible to other sessions.
|-
| '''D'''urable || The database retains committed changes even if the system crashes afterwards.
|}

== Transaction Boundaries ==
As every SQL statement which writes to the database must be part of a transaction, the DBMS silently starts a transaction for every of them, if actually there is no transaction started. An alternative is that the application/session starts a transaction explicitly by the command &lt;code&gt;START TRANSACTION&lt;/code&gt;.

All subsequent SQL commands are part of this transaction. The transaction remains until it is confirmed or rejected. The confirmation takes place with the command &lt;code&gt;COMMIT&lt;/code&gt;, the rejection with the command &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt;. Before the COMMIT or ROLLBACK command is submitted, the DBMS stores the results of every writing statement into an intermediate area where it is not visible to other sessions (see: [[#Isolation|Isolation Levels]]). Simultaneously with the COMMIT command all changes of this transaction ends up in the common database, are visible to every other session and the transaction terminates. If the COMMIT fails for any reason, it happens the same as when the session submits a ROLLBACK command: all changes of this transaction are discarded and the transaction terminates. Please notice, that a session can revert its complete writing actions, which are part of the actual transaction, by submitting the single command ROLLBACK.

An Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Begin the transaction with an explicit command (In general not necessary. Not supported by Oracle.)
START TRANSACTION;
-- Insert some rows
INSERT ... ;
-- Modify those rows or some other rows
UPDATE ... ;
-- Delete some rows
DELETE ... ;
-- If the COMMIT succeeds, the results of the above 3 commands have been transfered to the 'common' 
-- database and thus 'published' to all other sessions.
COMMIT;
--
-- 
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT ... ;
UPDATE ... ;
DELETE ... ;
-- Discard INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE
ROLLBACK;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Savepoints ===
As transactions can cover a lot of statements, it is likely that runtime errors or logical errors arise. In some of such cases applications want to rollback only parts of the actual transaction and commit the rest or resume the processing a second time. To do so, it is possible to define internal transaction boundaries which reflects all processing from the start of the transaction up to this point in time. Such intermediate boundaries are called '''savepoints'''. COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements terminate the complete transaction including its savepoints.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Begin the transaction with an explicit command
START TRANSACTION;
--
INSERT ... ;
-- Define a savepoint
SAVEPOINT step_1;
--
UPDATE ... ;
-- Discard only the UPDATE. The INSERT remains.
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT step_1;
-- try again (or do any other action)
UPDATE ... ;
-- confirm INSERT and the second UPDATE
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;

During the lifetime of a transaction a savepoint can be released if he is no longer needed. (At the end of the transaction he is implicitly released.)
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- ...
-- ...
RELEASE SAVEPOINT &lt;savepoint_name&gt;;
-- This has no effect to the results of previous INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE commands. It only eliminates the
-- possiblity to ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT &lt;savepoint_name&gt;.
&lt;/source&gt;

== Atomicity ==
Transactions guarantees that the results of '''all''' of its statements are handled on a logical level as '''one single''' operation. All writing statements have a temporary nature until the COMMIT command terminates successful.

This behaviour helps to ensure the logical integrity of bussiness logic. Eg: If one wants to transfer some amount of money from one account to another, at least two rows of the database must be modified. The first modification decreases the amount in one row and the second one increases it on a different row. If there is a disc crash or power failure between this two write-operations, the application has a problem. But the ''atomicity property'' of transactions guaranties that none of the write-operations reaches the database (in the case of any failure or a ROLLBACK) or all of them (in the case of a successfull COMMIT).

There are more detailed informations about the [[w:Atomicity_(database_systems)|atomicity property]] at Wikipedia.

== Consistency ==
Transactions guarantees that the database is in a consistent state after they terminate. This consistency occurrs at different levels:
:* The data and all derived index entries are syncronized. In most cases data and index entries are stored at different areas within the database. Nevertheless after the end of a transaction both areas are updated (or none).
:* [[../Create_Table#Table_Constraint|Table constraints]] and [[../Create_Table#Column_Constraint|column constraints]] may be violated during a transaction (by use of the DEFERRABLE key word) but not after its termination.
:* There may be [[../Create_Table#Primary_Key.2C_UNIQUE_and_Foreign_Key|Primary and Foreign Keys]]. During a transaction the rules for Foreign Keys may be violated (by use of the DEFERRABLE key word) but not after its termination.
:* The '''logical''' integrity of the database is '''not''' guaranteed! If in the above example of a bank account the application forgets to update the second row, problems will arise.

== Isolation ==
In most situations there are a lot of sessions working simultaneously on the DBMS. They compete for their resources, especially for the data. As long as the data is not modified, this is no problem. The DBMS can deliver the data to all of them.

But if multiple sessions try to modify data at the same point in time, conflicts are inescapable. Here is the timeline of an example with two sessions working on a flight reservation system. Session S1 reads the number of free seats for a flight: 1 free seat. S2 reads the number of free seats for the same flight: 1 free seat. S1 reserves the last seat. S2 reserves the last seat.

The central result of the analysis of such conflicts is that all of them are avoidable, if all transactions (concerning the same data) run sequentially: one after the other. But it's obvious that such a behavior is less efficent. The overall performance is increased if the DBMS does as much work as possible in parallel. The SQL standard offers a systematic of such conflicts and the command &lt;code&gt;SET TRANSACTION ...&lt;/code&gt; to resolve them with the aim to allow parallel operations as much as possible.

=== Classification of Isolation Problems ===
The standard identifies three problematic situations:
:* P1 ('''Dirty read'''): &quot;SQL-transaction T1 modifies a row. SQL-transaction T2 then reads that row before T1 performs a COMMIT. If T1 then performs a ROLLBACK, T2 will have read a row that was never committed and that may thus be considered to have never existed.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ISO/IEC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=53682| title = ISO/IEC 9075-2:2011: Information technology -- Database languages -- SQL -- Part 2: Foundation (SQL/Foundation) }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* P2 ('''Non-repeatable read'''): &quot;SQL-transaction T1 reads a row. SQL-transaction T2 then modifies or deletes that row and performs a COMMIT. If T1 then attempts to reread the row, it may receive the modified value or discover that the row has been deleted.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ISO/IEC&quot;/&gt; Non-repeatable reads concern single rows.
:* P3 ('''Phantom'''): &quot;SQL-transaction T1 reads the set of rows N that satisfy some search condition. SQL transaction T2 then executes SQL-statements that generate one or more rows that satisfy the search condition used by SQL-transaction T1. If SQL-transaction T1 then repeats the initial read with the same search condition, it obtains a different collection of rows.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ISO/IEC&quot;/&gt; Phantoms concern result sets.

=== Avoidance of Isolation Problems ===
Depending on the requirements and access strategy of an application some of the above problems may be tolerable - others not. The standard offers the &lt;code&gt;SET TRANSACTION ...&lt;/code&gt; command to define, which are allowed to occur within a transaction and which not. The &lt;code&gt;SET TRANSACTION ...&lt;/code&gt; command must be the first statement within a transaction.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
-- define (un)tolerable conflict situations (Oracle does not support all of them)
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL [READ UNCOMMITTED |
                                 READ COMMITTED   |
                                 REPEATABLE READ  |
                                 SERIALIZABLE];
&lt;/source&gt;

The following table shows which problems may occur within each level.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Isolation level !! Dirty reads !! Non-repeatable reads !! Phantoms
|-
| Read Uncommitted  || may occur || may occur || may occur
|-
| Read Committed  || - || may occur || may occur
|-
| Repeatable Read || - || - || may occur
|-
| Serializable || - || - || -
|}

At Wikipedia there are more detailed informatiton and examples about [[w:Isolation_(database_systems)|isolation levels]] and [[w:Concurrency_control|concurrency control]].

== Durability ==
Transactions guarantees that every confirmed write-operation will survive (almost) every following disaster. To do so, in most cases the DBMS writes the changes not only to the database but additionally to logfiles, which shall reside on different devices. So it is possible - after a disc crash - to restore all changes from a database backup plus these logfiles.

There are more detailed informations about the [[w:Durability_(database_systems)|durability property]] at Wikipedia.

== Autocommit ==
Some DBMS offers - outside of the standard - an [[../COMMIT_and_ROLLBACK#AUTOCOMMIT|AUTOCOMMIT]] feature. If it is activated, the feature submits automatically a COMMIT command after every writing statement with the consequence that you cannot ROLLBACK a logical unit-of-work consisting of a lot of SQL statements. Furthermore the use of the SAVEPOINT feature is not possible.

In much cases the feature is activated by default.

I'm nominating this ''book'' for deletion because it is an orphaned book without pages.  The only pages it contains are actually links to pages within the [[Japanese]] book.

: I suggest speedy deletion. [{{fullurl:Easy Japanese Pronunciation|action=history}} History] and [{{fullurl:Special:Log/delete|page=Easy_Japanese}} Logs] show this was part of a book named &quot;Easy Japanese&quot;, which copied contents from the Japanese book, the main page got deleted when the book was abandoned for some time, this page was likely left behind as an oversight by the deleting administrator, and this page was later renamed by you to be a book that still remains abandoned. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:59, 27 May 2014 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">TTRMS analysis tool can also provide user the observed frequency of each of the non-recurring factors. Figure 1 is an example of observation along I-94 Westbound from downtown St. Paul to downtown Minneapolis. This represents the number of fifteen-minute intervals throughout the year that have these factors present in the database. In this example, 60 percent of the time intervals do not have any non-recurring factors present, i.e. normal conditions. The intervals with a single factor observed, such as weather, crash, incident, event or roadwork, range from one percent to ten percent of the intervals. Time intervals with two or more factors present are shown in the combinations category and were observed in nine percent of the time intervals in 2012.

[[File:Ob pie2.PNG|550px|Ob pie2]]

'''Figure 1: 2012 WB I-94 Observation Pie Chart'''


Figure 2 shows the delay experienced during each of the regimes. To calculate this, the average delay for each time period (observed travel time minus free-flow travel time) is multiplied by the number of users during that time period. All of the time periods are then separated by regime to establish the proportion of delay experienced under each condition. Comparing this chart to Figure 1 shows that a disproportionate amount of the delay is experienced during times with non-recurring factors present, indicating that these factors contribute to increased delay on the corridor. 

[[File:Delay pie2.PNG|550px|Delay pie2]]

'''Figure 2: 2012 WB I-94 Delay Pie Chart'''


However, there is an argument that a portion of the event delay was likely due to normal delay but not caused by the specific event. For example, 15 percent of crash delay is derived in the example stated above. The right interpretation of the number is that 15 percent of delay is observed during crash time. It cannot be explained as 15 percent of delay is caused by crash because normal delay is included in the 15 percent. TTRMS tool can also provide an adjusted delay pie chart that represents the particular event delay. The basic methodology TTRMS tool applied is to subtract the average normal delay in the specific time when events occurred from the observed delay during events. For example, if a crash lasted for 30 minutes, and the observed corridor delay is 1,000 hours, and the average normal congestion delay is 400 hours, the adjusted delay for this particular crash is 600 hours (1,000 hr- 600 hr) rather than 1,000. However, if a crash lasted for 30 minutes, and the observed corridor delay is 1,000 hours, and the average normal congestion delay is 1,400 hours, the adjusted delay for this particular crash is 0, which indicates that the specific crash does not cause delay at all. Figure 3 shows the adjusted delay pie chart. Comparing with Figure 2 that displays the observed delay pie chart, all of portions for non-recurring events decrease. This chart is more accurate if user would like to analyze the association between the delay and specific types of events.

'''Figure 3: 2012 WB I-94 Adjusted Delay Pie Chart'''


Figure 4 shows the delays caused by non-recurring events only along I-94 Westbound from downtown St. Paul to downtown Minneapolis. This chart shows the same things with Figure 3 except excluding the normal congestion delay.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Is HCI really the most visible part of computer science?: A Critique of Carroll's Introduction===

Even when the initial paradigm of windows, menus, icons, and mouse pointing evolved from early work on limited office contexts thanks to the evolution of technology we find now that HCI work has given way to new mobile and virtual trends.  Nowawadays, HCI pervades every field/discipline from daily interfaces, like an online banking system, to highly specialized ones like cockpits and surgery dashboards.

Thanks to HCI multidisciplinarity we can resort to a plethora of methodologies, from experimental quantitative through context-sensitive qualitative protocols.  Specifically, [[Carroll|http://ist.psu.edu/directory/jmc56]] holds that HCI has become a primary testbed for two broad innovations in design methods, participatory design and ethnographically driven design.
In any case, HCI is young and it has a need to be multidisciplinary; ergo, I propose that HCI enables a new renaissance in which we see a move away from specialization which gives way to a blend of the sciences (hard and &quot;soft&quot;/social) and the humanities.  HCI has brought about the DaVinci era of the 2000s.

===What Golden Age?===
HCI was originally a joining of software engineering and human-factors engineering expertise.  Then, in the 70s, the waterfall development model saw a crisis brought about by the need to move away from a linear model of development to one that integrated the user throughout the design and development process.  PCs came about to crash this design methodology which was not suitable for systems development that was user-oriented.  It is likely that, in the past, this had not been as necessary because systems were not as widespread and they were only used by elites who had the time and ability to cope with systems shortfalls.

===Cognitive science and theory of mind===
Cognitive scientists elaborated models of thought and behavior that informed HCI research.  Specifically, Card, Moran and Newell proposed the GOMS model which intended to explain the process given from thoughts to behavior.  Prior to this, we had human factors models which did not seek to integrate and/or explain the human micro components—mind, thoughts, behavior.

===The change in HCI thought===

In 1985, Newells’ address to the CHI founding gathering provoked a change in thought.  I would argue even before that you could sense the boiling over of a need for a unified concern in this multidisciplinary science...  from Wiener’s cybernetics through systems theory to Vannevar Bush's touted address about the future of technology.  In the mid 20th century there was already a sense that computers were going to be important and they would be widespread enough that there needed to be a concern with the future and how to effectively integrate them in human society

Newell’s vision implicitly marginalized this work, motivating the emergence of alternative cognitive-science paradigms.  As a result, among others we have, Suchman's situatedness (1987) theory elaborated from the study of photocopier use which described a variety of usability problems with an advanced photocopier's user interfaces. To be innovative, Suchman considered the interaction between the person and the machine as a sort of conversation that frequently failed because the participants did not understand one another.  We see then HCI turns toward Derrida's deconstruction of science, we see HCI study evole into a critique that seeks to present an understanding of reality in which objects and people are accounted for.

Suchman brought field-study concepts, techniques, and sensibilities from anthropology, ethnomethodology, and sociology, and she applied them to a real problematic situation of human-computer interaction. 

On the other hand, Carroll also argues that the internationalization of HCI may have contributed to this new HCI thought. He holds that, thanks to the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) conferences held in Europe, and by initiatives within major computer companies, HCI has boiled over with a stream of input that is diverse and multinational/cultural.  We have experienced this first-hand in CHI gatherings where practitioners, artists, technologies, and multinationals come together to thinks about and discuss the evolution of technology as it pertains to human society and individuals.

Carroll cites Bødker’s (1991) application of activity theory to HCI as yet another contribution that modeled HCI thought.  Born out of Russian marxist philosophy, rooted in Vigotsky's writings, activity theory could not deny its beginnings, its Marxist foundations that sought to integrate culture, tools, and cooperation as elements to be considered in any attempt to explain phenomena associated with human cooperation.

According to Carroll then there are historical factors acting as sources of ideas in  the development of theory in HCI:
1. differentiation within the original cognitive-science community of HCI. (distancing from GOMS)
2. growing multidisciplinary constituency of cognitive science itself.
3. internationalization and
4. technology

===Ultimately, wary but hopeful of the &quot;New Golden Age&quot;===

We see that the future may take unsuspected directions.  We confront the challenge (and at the same time advantage) of having to deal with a multidisciplinarity that has brought about fragmentation, the making up of camps and the tension between depth and breadth in scientific expertise.  Furthermore, we have researchers and practitioners seeking to prevail in their views of what should be considered an HCI discipline.  The ACM itself cannot come up with a unified definition of our field.  But, I argue that old views, rigidly bound to ergonomics and a linear model of design, has been supplanted by a more interactive view in which practice plays a more central role in articulating requirements for theory and technology as well as in evaluating their efficacy in applied settings.

My sense is that we are ever more driven toward producing practical/applied knowledge.  That the &quot;mediocrization&quot; of the field--- external factors such as schedule, budget, and compatibility with standard solutions often prevail. This may cause that HCI unofficial reports include no understanding of underlying theoretical aspects and do not follow the exigencies of scientific methodologies which seek to address validity and veracity concerns.  Carroll indicates the need for synthesizing a comprehensive and coherent methodological framework but HCI is not about standards.  At the end, as HCIers we need to remain educated and recognize the need to adopt a lifelong learner model in which we inform our research and practice with the understanding of objects and phenomena in the world, science, and society.

Carroll recognizes that, ''in 1988, an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) task force enumerated HCI as one of nine core areas of the computer-science discipline (Denning et al., 1989). And a joint curriculum task force of the ACM and the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) recommended the inclusion of HCI as a common requirement in computer-science programs (Tucker &amp; Turner, 1991).(Carroll 2003).''  However, he also recognizes the inaccessibility of advanced-level materials on HCI science and theory.  We ourselves have experienced that in the search for a textbook for this class.

At the end, HCI remains ripe with possibilities.  However, we need to remain wary of distancing from the rigour required by a scientific pursuit.  We need to adapt and adopt but always keeping in mind those who came before us and the need for validity in our methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The SHRP 2 reliability data and analytical tools are intended to address travel time variability in one of three ways: 

1)	Establish monitoring systems to identify sources of unreliable travel times;

2)	Identify potential solutions to cost-effectively improve reliability;

3)	Incorporate consideration of travel time reliability into transportation agencies’ planning and programming framework.

This technical memorandum documents the development of a travel time reliability monitoring system (TTRMS) for the Minnesota pilot site.  The development of this system followed the guidelines of the SHRP 2 Project L02 guidebook: Guide to Establishing Monitoring Programs for Travel Time Reliability (September 10, 2012).

This document details the data sources used in the development of the TTRMS for the Minnesota Pilot site.  This includes: 

•	Travel time and traffic data;

•	TTRMS database development;

•	TTRMS analysis tool

Travel time and other traffic data can be accessed from TICAS. Comparing with the MnDOT data extraction tools, TICAS performs a number of additional calculations using the data from the detector stations to produce the travel time and VMT information. The TTRMS database is configured using a macro-enabled Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.  This software package was identified to be the most user-friendly and data compatible for the variety of data sources under consideration.  The macros that were developed for the database application assist in the organization of the various data sources to construct the database.  This section describes how these features operate and how the various data sources are linked in the database.

A series of refinements were made throughout the development of the database.  For example, the database allows users to specify corridor length if a shorter segment of the overall corridor is to be analyzed.  In addition, it is capable of accommodating a variety of observation time bins (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, or 15-minutes), provided the traffic data is in the corresponding format.  These refinements are expected to be used to their full capabilities in later stages of this study and the findings documented in future memoranda.


'''Input Data Processing'''

This section explains how the TTRMS interprets each data source and configures it to a standardized format allowing the data to be combined in the TTRMS database.

'''Traffic Data'''

The traffic data downloaded using TICAS determined the maximum corridor length and the analysis time interval.  The start and end point was chosen based on the detector stations, and travel time and VMT output data is provided in 0.1-mile increments. 

'''Weather Data'''

A process in the database reformatted the weather data into the appropriate length time intervals as determined by the traffic data.  When the time interval from the raw weather data was greater than five minutes, the missing intervals were assigned the conditions of the previous bin until another record was available.  For example in a five-minute system, if the source data interval was from 13:05 to 13:20, the travel time records for the 13:10 and 13:15 bins would be assigned the 13:05 weather record. Conversely, when multiple records were available in a single five-minute bin, the most severe weather condition was chosen to represent the bin. Table 1 ranks the precipitation type and intensity by descending order.


'''Table 1 Precipitation Type and Intensity Hierarchy'''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Precipitation Type !! Precipitation Intensity
|-
| Snow || Heavy
|-
| Frozen|| Moderate
|-
| Rain|| Slight
|-
| Other|| None
|-
| None|| 
|}

'''Crash and Incident Data'''

Crashes are motor vehicle collisions with other vehicles or fixed objects that result in over $1,000 of property damage or personal injury.  These events are recorded by law enforcement personnel, and crash records are compiled in the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) database. Incidents are any other non-recurring disruption to the highway that has the potential to affect capacity and throughput. These situations can include stalled vehicles, medical emergencies, or animals and debris that are on the roadway.These are frequently used to perform safety reviews on highways by computing historical crash rates to identify high crash locations.For crash data, the duration was added to the start time to determine when the crash had cleared. If the crash spanned multiple time intervals, all of the time bins contained in the duration were assigned with the crash details. Similar to the weather data, if crashes overlapped, the “worst” crash (based on severity) was selected to populate the affected time bins.  A similar process was used for the incident data, with “Incident Impact” used as the hierarchy variable.

'''Event Data'''

Events defined in the TTRMS tool are sports games, concerts, state fairs that have significant impacts on traffic. When an event was taking place, all time bins in the arrival and departure windows were marked with the name of the event type. Each event type was assigned name, such as “Twins_A” (for arrival) or “Vikings_D” (for departure).  For instances with multiple events taking place, the names of events were combined to reference both events. For example, if a Twins game arrival overlapped a Vikings game arrival, the event would be categorized as “Twins_A_Vikings_A”.

'''Road Work'''

Road work is defined as any agency activity to maintain or improve the roadway that may result in impacts to capacity. This may include short-term activities such as guardrail, sign, or lighting repair as well as more significant, long term construction actions.Road work records were applied to the TTRMS records using a similar protocol as the crash, incident, and event conditions.  The input data included start time, end time, and impact attributes.  All travel time records during the periods that the road work was active were assigned with the impact category.

      <comment>/* Renewable energy sources */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Burning fossil fuels is a great source of power, however it releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions that are harmful the the Earth's atmosphere; this causes more of the Sun's heat to pass through, heating up the planet. This can cause further problems such as flooding and desertification. Is there are solution?

== The 'Sandals' versus the 'Nukes'&lt;ref&gt;http://phe.rockefeller.edu/docs/Appleyard.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ==
=== 'Sandals' ===
Sandals are people that strongly believe that we should be using renewable, Earth 'friendly' sources of power such as: wind, solar and bio-fuels. They think we should be more integrated with the natural environment.

=== 'Nukes' ===
Nukes are people that are the opposite of 'Sandals' they think that we should use technology rather than nature. They like power sources like: nuclear energy and carbon-scrubbed natural gas. They think we should be less dependant on nature.

== Renewable energy sources ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Global sustainable development ==
=== Aims of Developing countries versus Developed countries ===
The general aim for developed countries (wealthy countries like the UK, USA, Germany etc.) at the minute (in terms of the environment) is to try and reduce the amount of scarce resources used and the amount of pollution created; this is known as reducing your carbon footprint.

The general aim for developing countries (poor countries like India, China etc.) is to consume more, their aim is to make their countries have cleaner water, electricity and health care. Developing countries will achieve this by having access to markets in developed countries. 

=== United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) &amp; World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) ===
At the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), representatives for countries can discuss how they can improve their environmental impact. Most countries have established with the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), some what of a focal point on the oversea implementation of the Earth Summit Agreements e.g. global trade or the reduction of greenhouse emissions. 

For this system to work two steps need to happen:
* Agree the terms and conditions
* Implementing the changes that are needed.

== Impact of industrialisation on global warming and climate change ==
[[File:Kyoto protocol parties and 2012-2020 commitments.svg|thumb|right|400px|
'''The Kyoto Protocol Participants'''
{{legend|#006400|Parties; Annex I &amp; II countries with binding targets}}
{{legend|#32CD32|Parties; Developing countries without binding targets}}
{{legend|#D3D3D3|States not Party to the Protocol}}
{{legend|#D2691E|Signatory country with no intention to ratify the treaty, with no binding targets}}
{{legend|#B22222|Countries that have renounced the Protocol, with no binding targets}}
{{legend|#662D91|Parties with no binding targets in the second period, which previously had targets}}
]]

=== Kyoto Protocol ===
The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international treaty that sets binding obligations on industrialized countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_protocol&lt;/ref&gt;. The protocol sets targets for the reduction of greenhouses gases by certain percents between given dates.

The treat was founded in Kyoto, Japan in 1997 and came into force in 2005 thanks to Russia. As of 2006, 169 countries signed up for the agreement. Developing countries didn't need to participate as they had developing needs.

Notability, America didn't agree sign up for the Kyoto protocol, however they agree with the principles, but just didn't want to take part.

=== Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) ===
This was founded in the UK in 1989, it's goal was to cut down on the consumption of fossil fuels; to use nuclear or renewable sources instead&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Fossil_Fuel_Obligation&lt;/ref&gt;. 

One obligation of NFFO for electricity suppliers is for them to have 10% of their power being sourced from renewable sources by 2010; raised to 15% by 2015.

Aims of NFFO:
* To help encourage renewable energy sources.
* Provides financial support to renewable energy projects.
* Government involvement in these targets.
* Electricity distribution companies need to buy a certain amount from renewable sources.
* Aim to reduce need for fossil fuels.
* Aids development in renewable sources projects.

== Reducing your 'carbon footprint' ==
A 'carbon footprint' is a metaphor for the measure of a human's impact on the environment in terms of the amount of greenhouse gases produced, measured in units of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint&lt;/ref&gt;. This is the result of greenhouse gases produced from industrialisation and modern living which has a negative impact on the environment. 

Generally, you could categorise a carbon footprint into two categories:
* Impact caused by house hold living, electricity and gas use etc.
::A way to fix this type of carbon foot print would be to turn off light/appliances when they're not in use.
* Impact caused by travel, public transport and planes etc.
::A way to fix this type of carbon footprint would be to not use public transport and use an eco-friendly alternative like walking or cycling.

=== Carbon offsetting ===
Carbon offsetting is way to compensate the unavoidable bad things we do to the environment by improving other unrelated process and making them more eco-friendly. Another definition would be: A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for or to offset an emission made elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;Directly sourced from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offsetting&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Methods for manufacturers to fix their non-eco-friendly ways ===
* Applying [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Sustainability/Life_cycle_assessment|life-cycle assessment (LCA)]] techniques to get just enough products, not too much that would otherwise use more fuel and create more bad emissions.
* Identifying the problems in a certain manufacturing process.
* Optimising energy efficiency.
* Identifying [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Sustainability/Responsibilities_of_developed_countries#Carbon_offsetting|carbon offsetting]] solutions.

== Sustainable timber production ==
Majority of timber is imported into the UK from developing countries, these developing countries benefit a little from this.

=== There are many problems linked with timber ===
* '''Deforestation''' The general cutting down of trees
:: Environmental impact of deforestation:
** Micro-climate changes/Global warming
** Loss of wildlife/extinction
** Food chain reduced
** More CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere
** When trees are burnt, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is released
** Increased greenhouse gases
** Ground erosion/landslides
** Heavy machinery causes pollution
** Rising sea levels
* '''Environmental degradation of forest areas''' soil erosion, micro-climate change, air pollution leads to reducing the forest's health.
* '''Loss of biodiversity''' The killing off of species.
* '''Loss of cultural assets and knowledge''' native/tribal people that live in the forests having their home destroyed.
* '''Loss of livelihood''' Forests getting cut down to make space for cities.
* '''Climate change''' Trees help balance out the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, the more trees the less harmful CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Benefits on changing the way that we get timber ===
* No longer importing from sources that involve deforestation.
* Moving to suppliers of large areas of ecological surplus, e.g. high-yield plantations of countries like: Brazil, Chile and New Zealand.
* Certification systems that ensure that the trees that are cut down are replaced with [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sapling tree saplings].
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XL-6Ws0zMo Timber tracing] used to identify the timber has good from a certified place.
* Improves the aid process for poor communities involved in current deforestation methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is an in-depth list of the four Rs.
== Reduce ==
This is the idea of reducing the amount of materials that are chosen in the first place, before the product is even made.

The benefits of this are:
* Minimisation of the consumption of resources.
* Reduced Cost saving on materials, resulting in improved profit-margins.

Manufacturers are obligated to reduce their material consumption as part of the '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer_Responsibility_Obligations_(Packaging_Waste)_Regulations_2007 UK Producer Responsibilities Obligations (Packaging and Waste) Regulations 1997]'''. 

This suggests that manufacturers do the following&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/producer/packaging/documents/userguide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Consider the materials and designs they use.
* Examine ways of eliminating/reducing the packaging required.
* Optimising packaging use, i.e. match packaging to the level of protection needed.

== Reuse ==
This is the idea of reusing products that have been manufactured. This is usually because either the material can't be recycled, or that the product has had a lot of time, money and energy put into making it, what it is.

An example of reusing a product is where you can leave a milk-bottle on your 'door-step' and the empty bottle will be collected, cleaned and reused, this saves the manufacturing process, which saves time, money and energy.

== Recover ==
This is the concept of burning old products rather than just throwing them in a landfill site, this isn't the ideal solution (waste reduction is) but it's better than throwing it into a landfill. If a product is thrown away then all of the energy put into the object upon creation is wasted.

Waste is incinerated which is a form of heat, this heat can then turn turbines (most likely from creating steam from water) which generates electricity.

== Recycle ==
This essentially is the process of breaking down a product, using it's materials to transform it into something new.

=== Recovering and recycling of paper and board ===
[[File:Corrugated Cardboard.JPG|thumb|right|Corrugated board]]
Cellulose fibres found in a variety of plant life can be used to manufacture paper and card&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose 2nd Paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;. Cellulose can only be recycled so many times as it will break down over time making it become weak. New fibres (virgin pulp from new trees) can be added in with old ones as a way to make it stronger. When the paper/board is recycled it will go through an elaborate grading and sorting system; this is used to get the maximum value obtainable (in terms of fibre).
* Corrugated board
:: This is 3 layers of card layered on top of one another, each layer is made from lower grade recycled paper which is why it's often brown and has impurities in the box. The middle layer is special as it goes up and down in the form of a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine sine wave]; this makes it thicker, stronger and more stiff. The strength of this material is dependant upon the quality of the kraft that's imported from abroad.
* Newsprint
:: This is the material used for newspaper. It contains the weakest fibres because newspaper has a short lifespan. Newspaper publisher and the government are encouraging the user of a high percentage of newspapers to be made from recycled materials, rather than being wasteful and importing virgin fibres.

When waste paper is recycled, it goes through a series of processes:
* It is collected by local authorities
* Sent to a paper mill
* [http://individual.utoronto.ca/abdel_rahman/paper/fpmp/fpmp-hydrapulper.html Hydrapulper] (filled with water) is used to make it into a 'slush'

==== Properties ====
There are three factors to take into account when considering to use waste/recycled paper:
* Strength
::Every time fibre is recycled it loses some strength, so much so, that if you were to keep recycling it would fall apart; roughly the maximum times you can recycle it is around six times.
* Quality
::Some paper can loose quality, this is because they require certain qualities that can only be obtain from new fibres (e.g. smooth and white).
* Utility
::Some paper isn't recycled at all, paper in books stays in books, toilet paper is dis-guarded and some paper is laminated.
==== The four grades of waste paper ====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Paper Grade !! Characteristics !! Sources !! Recycled applications
|-
| Pulp substitute grades || Top-quality waste paper that can be used with little to no cleaning. || Unprinted trimming and off-cuts from printers/photocopiers || Printing and writing paper
|-
| De-inking grades || Grades where ink needs to be removed before recycling. || Office waste, newspapers and magazines || Graphic and hygiene material or newspapers
|-
| Kraft grades || Long string fibres that usually come from unbleached packaging. || Paper sacks || New packaging including corrugates cardboard/packaging
|-
| Lower Grades || Mix of all types that are not worth sorting as they are too small to make a difference || Junk mail || Middle layers of packaging paper and boards
|}

=== [http://www.remarkable.co.uk/index.php/ Remarkable Pencils Ltd] ===
This is a company that has recycled plastic cups from vending machines into pencils and other stationary. One polystyrene cup is enough to make one pencil. They convert 20,000 cups into 20,000 pencils per day. They work on the idea that people are more likely to buy an environmentally clean product, rather than a traditional wooden pencil.

== References ==
Note: 'References' isn't one of the four Rs.

English pea salad is a simple salad, intended to be reminiscent of Spring and innocence. 

English pea salad is very traditional, rather than being currently in style, and may be more likely served at family gatherings, especially in the U.S.  

== Ingredients ==
Basic Recipe
*1 15 oz (425 g / 445 ml) can of English [[W:Pea|peas]] 
*1 tbsp mayonnaise 
*1 tbsp chopped white or yellow onion (may be omitted)
*1 hard-boiled egg, with yolk (or 2 hard-boiled egg whites, without yolks)
*salt to taste
*ground black pepper to taste
*parsley, if desired for presentation

== Procedure ==
You may wish to make the basic recipe a day or several hours in advance of serving, through step 7, then add other ingredients when nearly ready to serve.  
#Depending on your preferences, you may wish to blanch or par-boil the chopped onion in a small amount of water so that the onion flavor is not as strong.  If you do so, drain and cool thoroughly before adding.
#Drain the English peas and either discard the liquid or use for some other purpose.
#Lightly rinse the peas in a colander and place in a suitable bowl. 
#Chop either the 1 entire hard-boiled egg or the 2 hard-boiled egg whites into about 1/4&quot; (0.5 cm) pieces.  If you use the entire egg, the yolk will impart a yellow tint to the salad dressing, while using the 2 hard-boiled egg white (i.e. no yolks) will keep the salad dressing white.  You may, if you wish, mash the diced hard-boiled egg yolk and mix it thoroughly with the mayonnaise.  Adding hard-boiled egg whites provides a shape and color contrast compared to the green color of the round peas.
#Add the chopped egg,  chopped onion, mayonnaise to the peas and mix lightly until all the ingredients are well distributed.
#Add salt, ground pepper to taste and mix to distribute.
#Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
#Serve cold, sprinkled lightly with parsley, if desired, in the manner of a side dish, rather than as a separate course.  No additional dressings or condiments would ordinarily be served or expected.

== Notes, Tips, and Variations ==
SOME COMMON ADDITIONS:
*2 Tbsp very finely chopped (1/8&quot; or 1/4 cm diced) celery
*1/4 cup (or less) cubed (3/8” or 0.75 cm diced) yellow cheese food product (for example Velveeta).  Adding cheese adds a color contrast, however, the cheese can become somewhat soft if the salad is stored.  If you make the main part of the salad well in advance of serving, you may wish to wait to add cheese only when you are nearly ready to serve the salad.

==Introduction==

The incentive to start this Wikibook is based on the increasing problem on chronic renal diseases of unknown origin among the poorest farm workers in Central America and Sri Lanca. The victims of this deadly disease are most often among the poorest agricultural workers and we have to ask why hash´t this disease never been diagnosed as an occupational disease. Some of the answer may relate to the fact that the tropical occupational medical problems are mostly absent in the occupational medical textbooks written by authors from outside the tropical areas. There seems to be a lack of development of occupational medicine in Panama and other tropical countries. The intention is to strengthen the development of occupational medicine as a clinical speciality in the tropical countries. Moreover, the occupational accidents constitute an important part of work related health complaints, the definition and the prevention of the work related accidents will be included here. 
We want to invite all interested health professionals to participate in the development by correction of the content, linguistic corrections, and by adding new texts and chapters. When the book is more developed we hope it will be used as the basic textbook by the medical and nurse students and post grade courses in occupational health in the tropical countries. The book will primarily be written in English, later in Spanish and other languages. Very welcome to this Wikibook.

==[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_healthcare Preventive healthcare]==
Occupational medicine is a medical speciality that aims for the prevention among workers of departures from health caused by their working conditions; the protection of workers in their employment from risks resulting from factors adverse to health need to be studied so epidemiological research is an important part of the speciality; placing and maintenance of a worker in an occupational environment adapted to his physiological and psychological equipment and the promotion and maintenance of physical, mental and social well-being of workers;

==[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking Critical thinking]==
Critical thinking and asking questions is significant in academics, research and especially important in occupational medicine. One basic question is to ask the patient about his/her job and to pursue the causalities of the disease in order to propose prevention in the branch and for the patient.

== [[/Clinical diagnostic guidelines/]]  ==

==[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis Medical diagnosis]==
Medical diagnostics is &quot;sine qua non&quot; in occupational medical practice with patients and epidemiological research. The occupational clinical diagnosis is closely related to the establishment of the causality, as the diagnostic and compensation of an occupational disease involve the diagnosis and the probability of the etiology. 

==[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality Medical causality]==
Medical causality or etiology is &quot;sine qua non&quot; in medical practice with patients and research for adequate treatment and prevention with roots back to Aristotle [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle Wikipedia Aristotle]. Especially for occupational medicine, the development of causality is closely related to the diagnostic process of the single patients and epidemiological research. The importance of the work as possible contribution factor to many diseases was stated by Doctor B.Ramazinni from Italy some 300 years ago[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardino_Ramazzini Article in Wikipedia]

==[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis Medical prognosis]==
Occupational medical prognosis and advice to the patient depend on the diagnosis, the seriousness of the disease and the specific working conditions. The occupational medical advice might include that the patient needs to change job or leave the labour market. 

==[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Medical_Ethics International Code of Medical Ethics]==

[[File:Hippocrates.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Hippocrates]]

The international Code of Medical Ethics forms the basic content of the specific demands of ethics in all the medical specialities. The Spanish version is more elaborated than the English  [http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3digo_Internacional_de_%C3%89tica_M%C3%A9dica Spanish version]. The ethics for occupational physicians are normally seen from two main viewpoints: 1) the legal standing and ethics in job execution; 2) ethics in research on occupational medicine. Among lots of guidelines we choose for a start the International Code of Ethics for Occupational Health Professionals from the  [http://www.icohweb.org/site_new/multimedia/core_documents/pdf/code_ethics_eng_2012.pdf ICOH code of ethics] and the translation into Spanish [http://www.medigraphic.com/pdfs/trabajo/lm-2001/lm012b.pdf ICOH Ethics code in Spanish].

The underreporting of occupational accidents and occupational diseases, globally is well recognised. However, the degree of underreporting is especially high in Latinamerca &lt;ref&gt;Mora AM, Mora-Mora MG, Partanen T, Wesseling C.

For comparison in Denmark with 2,6 million economic actives there were reported about 20000 occupational diseases (with at least 1 day off from work). Of course any comparison depends on a lot of different conditions on the labor market, of the definition of the inclusion criteria and the degree of underreporting. These issues will be debated in the text.

== [[/Occupational medicine in general practice/]]  ==
General practice and occupational medicine share close similarities in their focus on disease prevention and health promotion. The workforce constitutes a significant part of the population and thus the patient load of a typical primary healthcare practice. Moreover, with an ageing population and rising retirement age, we can expect that there will be an increasing number of health issues to be addressed among older working people. Both occupational and non-occupational factors are important in determining an individual's health. Thus, family physicians need to adequately understand occupational medicine and vice versa .Most occupational health care will continue to be provided by family physicians, who may also be the physicians closest to the workers and their families. There are many opportunities for family physicians to develop their skills in occupational health care and to incorporate occupational medicine into their practices&lt;ref&gt;Sng J, Lee SM, Koh D. Bridging the gap between occupational medicine and family medicine. Ann Acad Med Singap. 2008 Feb;37(2):158–61. &lt;/ref&gt;

== [[/Occupational psychiatry/]] ==
Organisational and occupational psychiatry (OOP) is the subspecialty of psychiatry that focuses on work, its importance in the lives of individuals and work organizations. The psychiatrists do many important occupational health functions. For example they help the patients to stay in the job or to get another change position without the mental hazards they have been exposed to. 
As the psychiatry include much occupational medicine, a specific chapter will be written about the occupational psychiatry. 
However there is a gap of knowledge on how much mental disease and symptoms are related to job hazards not only in Panamá but globally. Therefore it is found relevant to do a prevalence study of the proportion of mental disease associated with job hazards. The study is similar to a study planned for general practice. The objective is to answer the questions: How many per cents of the mental health disease can be related to hazards in the work-place? Why should the study be done a psychiatry hospital and not in general practice? 
The answer is that the patients in the psychiatric clinics are selected via the General Practice. So the main part of the patients have an established psychiatric diagnosis. The questionnaire page 2 is different than that for general practice. On page two the psychiatrist will mark the general area of the ICD-10 diagnosis and not the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) that is used for general practice. This has the methodical advance that the diagnosis is on a specialist level and less patients is needed to make conclusions about the percentage of work-related psychiatric diseases.

== [[/Occupational dermatology/]] ==
Dermatologic complaints are among the most common occupational illnesses. Many occupational exposures can cause skin disease.  The most frequent occupational skin disease is contact dermatitis. This may be either irritant or allergic contact dermatitis but often is a combination of both. Irritations may occur from chemical factors including caustics, solvents, detergents, and even plain water. Physical factors that cause irritation include friction, repeated trauma, heat, and low humidity. Contact allergy may be caused by several thousand chemicals and substances, but relatively few agents are common causes of allergic contact dermatitis. Some of the more important include metals (nickel, cobalt, chrome), preservatives, rubber additives, and plastic components (epoxy resins, acrylates). Contact urticaria is an immediate hypersensitivity reaction distinct from allergic contact dermatitis. Latex allergy is the most well-known cause of immunologic contact urticaria, but many other substances, usually protein-based, can also cause contact urticaria. A variety of other skin conditions can also be occupationally related. Skin cancer caused by ultraviolet light (sunlight) exposure or certain chemicals can be attributed in some cases to occupational exposure. Chloracne, a specific acneiform eruption caused by exposure to various halogenated hydrocarbons, is a sensitive indicator of systemic exposure to these agents. Various cutaneous infections are seen more commonly in some occupations, such as warts in meat cutters or erysipelothrix in fishermen. Cutaneous hypopigmentation (chemical leukoderma) can be seen in certain workers who are exposed to depigmenting agents such as phenolic germicides. Systemic sclerosis has been occasionally seen in association with certain job exposures. In evaluating a patient with a possible occupational dermatosis, accurate diagnosis is essential. Certain diagnostic tests, especially the patch test, are important adjuncts to the clinical evaluation. Consideration of nonoccupational components of the disease (confounders) is necessary to arrive at a proper assessment of causation. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104004869890000X&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge on the health risks in specific industries ==
Bernardino Ramazzini (1633–1714) published his most famous book 1713, De Morbis Artificum Diatriba (Diseases of workers). His book is a descriptive account of working conditions in more than fifty occupations and of the diseases of workers in these occupations. Ramazzini's observations were accurate and precise, although he provided no numerical information and made statements implying rather than expressing levels of risk, so readers could not determine, for example, whether pottery was a safer occupation than knife grinding. His accounts remain a good model for occupational health. We want to continue in his footsteps by descrbing the working conditions in the occupations and the diseases of the workers step by step over the next years. The descriptions will be based on the workers own descriptions, interviews and the existing scientific evidence about the hazards and the health risks. The objective is to prepare the health professionals with knowledge about the workers´daily conditions so they are well prepared to establish the correct diagnosis, identify the causal factors and so to give the best treatment and guide for prevention. And possibly notify the disease or symptoms as work-related where relevant.

==Overall structure for job descriptions==

== [[/Community intervention programs | Community intervention programs ]]  ==
[[File:Circular effect asessment.png|400px|thumb||right|EBM]]  
Health interventions applied on a community-wide basis have come into increasing use in public health and epidemiologic research over the past several decades. The emphasis on interventions focusing on
communities has created distinct methodological challenges for researchers. Effective program evaluation is a systematic way to improve and account for public health actions. Evaluation involves procedures that are useful, feasible, ethical, and accurate &lt;ref&gt;CDC - A Framework for Program Evaluation [Internet]. [cited 2014 Jun 19]. Available from: http://www.cdc.gov/EVAL/framework/&lt;/ref&gt;  
It is important to develop a tool to measure success and to include these results in the promotion campaign. Even if the program is part of the global campain, it is essetial to establish goals and measure the progress against your goals. By reviewing the program’s successes and failures you can see how it has been the most effective. In conclusion there is a need to add research programs to the interventions. 
This could be an attractive research area for public health students in Panama and students from outside!

==1. Epidemiology==
Research is an indispensable part of occupational medicine and the epidemiology is traditionally viewed as the main research tool for occupational medical researchers, practitioners and administrators. Though many other disciplines are important to occupational medicine the epidemiology is often described as the ‘basic science of public health and occupational medicine. Unfortunately the university teaching in epidemiology rarely give the students sufficient interest and understanding of the basic principles of epidemiology &lt;ref&gt;Gouda HN, Powles JW. The science of epidemiology and the methods needed for public health assessments: a review of epidemiology textbooks. BMC Public Health. 2014 Feb 10;14(1):139.&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore we want to amend the gab of skills and knowledge by offering an integrated course in Epidemiology. The course forms the scientific base for the other three courses (see below) This course will include epidemiology as an integrated part of EBM, OM and basic research. 
[[File:EBMfr.jpg|300px|th

== 2. Evidence Based Medicine== 
Evidence based practice is an approach to clinical decision making that has gained considerable interest and influence during the last decade. The phrase 'evidence based medicine' originated in the 1980s as a way of describing the problem based learning approach&lt;ref&gt;Sally Bennett and John W. Bennett The process of evidence based practice in occupational therapy: Informing clinical decision. Australian Occupational Therapy Journal (2000), 47, 171-180 &lt;/ref&gt; The participants will learn to pose relevant questions related to medical diagnosis, treatment, prevention and research. Further to search the relevant literature, read and get the information and be able to communicate the message and the answer to the question effectively and systematically. Some useful existing reviews and guidelines for occupational medicine diagnosis will be presented and explained how they were developed.

== 3. Occupational Medicine==
We are planning to offer short OM courses for students, nurses, physicians at the hospitals, general practice and other health professionals. Later we pretend to offer more advanced courses when the course materials are sufficiently developed. The courses will be structured like the content of this Handbook. The intention is that '''the participants will add new knowledge to the Handbook''' and get a valuable learning at the same time. The course content reflect the content of the Handbook. The aim of the course is to improve the diagnostics, treatment and prevention of occupational diseases in Panamá by application of the Evidence Based Medicine. 
After the course the participants will be better to establish the diagnosis and give attention about the notification as occupational diseases. Also be better to try to discover any relevant relation between the work hazards (psychological, physical, chemical, ergonomic etc) and the symptoms. This in order to give the best advice on how to solve the problems for the patient and how to prevent the same could happen for others. The participant will learn to edit and to add text and new chapters to the Wikibook. The homework could be to write and add a chapter to this book, for example 1) diagnostic guidelines for occupational asthma or 2) description of the work processes and health risk factors for urban bus drivers.
=== [[/Overview of the content of the courses |Overview of the content of the course ]]===

==4. Basic research course for health professionals ==
[[File:Program Scheme.png|1000px|right|The programme for a basis course in health research]]
We are planning to offer a basic research training course for health professionals in the clinics and in the health administrations. The participants should have access to patients (handout the questionnaires) or access to administrative health data. The participants will stepwise learn how to plan and perform an epidemiological prevalence study based on a given questionnaire. See the questionnaires for general practice, dermatology and psychiatry. Training in the relevant computer programs like Epidata is included. The aim of the training is that '''the participants will add knowledge to the Handbook''' and get a relevant learning at the same time. Patient records in general practice (and health registers in the public administrations) are unique resources that can provide evidence to help to improve their understanding of research, improve patient diagnostics (attention to occupational medicine), patient treatment and prevention. We hope the course will be a valuable for general practitioners, administrative health professionals, medical and nurse students and other students so that many of them will enter in to active research activity. After the course the participants will be able to perform their own research, do literature searches and publish articles.

The course participants are invited to publish their comments and scientific work in this journal. The academic requirements are less than for international indexed journals, but still contribute with important new knowledge for the development of the occupational medicine in Panama. The articles can later be published in revised form in indexed international scientific journals. Articles with relevant new original knowledge will be added to the Handbook. So there is a dynamic relation between the journal, the research courses and the Wikibook.

==Rules for research in the CSS hospitals in Panama ==
The rules are divided in observational studies and medical experiments. 
The medical experiments need approval by the CSS Director General, while other non-experimental studies can be approved by the head of the local hospital department, the hospital medical director and the etical committees.

[[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Transwiki''' Hi! Sorry for nominating so many at once - I'd like to nominate the above books for export to [[:voy:|Wikivoyage]], the WMF's travel guide project. They are largely incomplete and could be integrated well either into existing articles on WV or the site's guide framework. Let me know what you think! :) --[[User:Nicholasjf21|Nicholasjf21]] ([[User talk:Nicholasjf21|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nicholasjf21|contribs]]) 22:54, 5 February 2014 (UTC)
:On a procedural note, there is nothing to prevent Wikivoyage importing the books, regardless of the outcome of this discussion. However, I thought I'd note that Transwiki import is not enabled for Wikivoyage from Wikibooks and nor does any usergroup have the importupload right needed to complete an XML upload. You will therefore need to make a request at Meta for a Steward to do the import or to add the userright temporarily to a trusted user / admin. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 14:08, 6 February 2014 (UTC) 
::Thanks for the heads-up! How long do discussions of this nature normally take on Wikibooks before consensus is formed? I wouldn't want to appeal for a steward's assistance prematurely. --[[User:Nicholasjf21|Nicholasjf21]] ([[User talk:Nicholasjf21|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nicholasjf21|contribs]]) 02:13, 9 February 2014 (UTC)
::: You don't need to wait for this discussion.  Importing the material to Wikivoyage won't have any effect on Wikibooks, so that can happen while we're still discussing it here.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 03:01, 9 February 2014 (UTC)

* {{Comment}} Note that I've tagged the individual books with {{tl|rfd}} and notified (what appeared to be) the primary authors with {{tl|rfd warning}} (except the editors of ''[[Guide to Electrical Equipment for Travelers]]'', which was transwikied from Wikipedia and doesn't seem to have attracted any significant authors since then). - [[User:Dcljr|dcljr]] ([[User talk:Dcljr|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dcljr|contribs]]) 04:49, 6 February 2014 (UTC)

:::: That's OK, neither am I. [g] - [[User:Dcljr|dcljr]] ([[User talk:Dcljr|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dcljr|contribs]]) 04:56, 6 February 2014 (UTC)
:{{trans}} Seems right to me... now that there is a place better suited to these things, a transwiki seems to be the most obvious choice. I know I would not have expected to find travel guides on a textbook site... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:02, 6 February 2014 (UTC)
:: It's always been controversial to limit Wikibooks to textbooks; I gather there was some politics behind pushing the project to limits its scope that way (before my time here), and some objections continuing, I believe, to this day.  In this case, though, Wikivoyage exists and we wish it every success, so the scope question is largely a matter of alternative history.  We're happy to host such books, but there's no need for us to host them if Wikivoyage welcomes the material.  If some thing where not a good fit for Wikivoyage, it could certainly be hosted here and Wikivoyage could link back to its location here; but I see no such thing in this case.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:52, 6 February 2014 (UTC)
*{{trans}} Most of the material is indeed quite incomplete, for the book form, though it looks like there was some real effort into [[Hiking in the Canadian Rockies/Day Hikes/Kananaskis]].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:52, 6 February 2014 (UTC)
::You're right - I'd sort of earmarked that one for its own article, to make use of the effort that's been put into it. --[[User:Nicholasjf21|Nicholasjf21]] ([[User talk:Nicholasjf21|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nicholasjf21|contribs]]) 15:56, 6 February 2014 (UTC)
:{{trans}} transwiki-ing seems right, as the center of enthusiasm for improving travel guides is at Wikivoyage now. I can also imagine collections of many guides from WikiVoyage someday becoming books (&quot;travelling in europe&quot; or similar) that could be downloaded, printed, added to Wikibooks, etc. -- [[User:Phoebe|Phoebe]] ([[User talk:Phoebe|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Phoebe|contribs]]) 22:23, 7 February 2014 (UTC)
*{{trans}} most of these, good idea. .  I don't know about the Guide to Electrical Equipment.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sj|contribs]]) 02:50, 15 February 2014 (UTC)

I think Wikivoyage aims to have articles about specific destinations that are of use to any traveler. With that in mind, I propose to close this as consensus to transfer to Wikivoyage, but keep &quot;Hiking in the Canadian Rockies&quot;, &quot;Teaching Assistant in France Survival Guide&quot;, and &quot;Guide to Electrical Equipment for Travelers&quot; because those books have more specific aims and audiences as can be seen from the book titles, like instructing hikers, teaching assistances, or anyone with electrical equipment. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:00, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">After we have managed to create a survey form in the KoBoForm form designer, we will need to save the form to a file, and transfer this file to the Android device.

In this chapter, we will assume that the form has been created on a computer other than the Android device which we will use to administer the survey. There will therefore be two steps to this process:

# Save the form to an XML file
# Transfer the XML file to the correct location on the Android device

In addition to setting up the survey on the device, this chapter will also discuss:

# Filling out the survey on the device
# Saving the results on the device
# Transferring the results to a computer

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter will deal with the post processing of data collected using the KoBoCollect Android app.

The first step is to aggregate all the individual XML output files (instances) from one or more devices. Using the KoBoSync java application (which is also available through the KoBoForm website) these results XML files can be aggregated in to a singel CSV (Comma Separated Values) file. CSV files can easily be imported in virtually all software used for data analysis, such as spreadsheets, R, or SPSS/PSPP.

In the part, we discuss how KoBoForm has the option to export the variable types and labels from the from to an SPSS/PSPP syntax file. Using SPSS or the free and open-source alternative PSPP, we can then use this syntax file to correctly encode and label the variables and data in SPSS/PSPP. From here it is possible to export the SPSS data file within which all variables are correctly encoded, this file can then also be imported in other statistical software such R.

A local area network is a group or network of computers linked physically by cables. you should not think about the physical distance between the computers, more about the location of other computers within the network.

==Wide Area Networks==
A set of links that connect geographically remote computers and LANs.

==Network adapter or Network Interface Card==
A computer communicates on the network through a network adapter. A network adapter plugs into the motherboard of a computer and into a network cable. They convert data from the form stored in the computer to the form transmitted or received on the cable. Data is passed through electronics that calculate a checksum value and its own and destination address. It is now known as a frame. The frame is transmitted a bit at a time onto the network cable, with the address sent first, then data and lastly, the checksum. Each network adapter card has a unique 48 bit hexadecimal MAC address.

==Topology==
The structure of the connections that connect devices to a network

===Bus===
[[Image:Netzwerktopologie Bus.png|thumb|center|300px|Bus Network]]

{{Plus|If a computer goes down it doesn't take out the entire system}}
{{Plus|Less cabling required}}
{{Minus|Cannot have two computers transmitting at the same time.  Messages 'collide'}}
{{Minus|As several computers are using the same wire you can eavesdrop on messages for other machines}}
{{Minus|A break in the cable breaks the entire network}}

===Star===
[[Image:Netzwerktopologie Stern.png|thumb|center|300px|Star Network]]
{{Plus|If a node fails the entire system stays up}}
{{Plus|Message collisions do not occur, the switch in the centre stores the frames of information until the backbone is ready to receive}}
{{Plus|Hard for people to eaves drop on your messages.  Each computer has a dedicated cable used to connect it to the switch}}
{{Minus|If the central server / switch goes down the entire network fails}}

==Bus Networks==
[[Image:NetworkTopology-Bus.png|thumb|300px|Bus layout]]
*A bus network relies on each computer being connected to one wire, the ''bus''.
*When a computer on the network wishes to transmit data, it is possible to do so immediately if no other data is detected on the bus.
*If there is already data being transmitted on the wire then the computer has to retry later.
*If two or more computers transmit at exactly the same time a ''collision'' occurs.
*If a collision occurs the computer that was trying to send the data detects that the sending has failed and proceeds to try again at a different time.
*At times when the network is in heavy use, lots of computers will be transmitting data therefore leading to a number of collisions. This causes the overall performance of the network to deteriorate.

===Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)===
To prevent collisions on a bus network, a set of rules can be used. An example of one of these sets of rules is CSMA/CD:
# If the bus is quiet then transmit
# If the bus is busy, listen until it is quiet, then transmit immediately
# While transmitting monitor for a collision
# If there is a collision, send a jamming signal to let the other computers on the network know there has been a collision, and stop transmitting
# Wait a random amount of time before starting from step 1 again

==Star networks==
[[Image:NetworkTopology-Star.png|thumb|200px|Star layout]]
*A star network will have a ''switch'' at its centre.
*All data transmitted from the individual computers on the network will go through the switch then sent on to their destination, therefore removing any congestion.

Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each.

Candidates should be able to compare local area networking with standalone operation. AG

==Network Segment==
A segment refers to a string of computers. 
Segmentation refers to non switched Ethernet bus networks that are split to improve performance.

==Peer-to-peer networking==
This a network system where each workstation has equivalent capabilities.

[[Peer-to-Peer LANs]]
Good for less than 10 users where users are located in a close proximity and security isn't an issue. However provides a limited growth for future network extensions.

[[Peer-to-Peer WANs]]
used to share files among a large number of users connected temporarily. E.g.: BitTorrent

==Server-based networking==
Where resources, security and administration on a network is carried out by dedicated servers.

==Thin client computing==
Thin-client computing is when all of a networks procession comes from a central server.  The thin-clients are computers used to connect to one central server to be able to form a network.  Some star formatted systems use thin-client networks.  Thin-client networks do not require the client computers to have any hard disk storage and they often have very little processing power. They are often called dumb terminals because of this. A thin-client network would be used on a small scale e.g. in a small office because a thin-client network has very little bandwidth. The central server is the application server and can run applications like Word, multimedia and send these to different users terminals.  Also, the central server can control user's login to see if the terminals are connected to the server.

==Web services==
Explain these termsand describe situations where these might be used.
Compare and contrast thin client computing (software as a service, AJAX, Web 2.0, etc.) vs rich client computing (client-server, peer-to-peer), web services as examples of ‘systems architectures’.

===Inter-networking===
* Internetworking is formed when computers from one network communicates with computers from other networks.
* These networks communicate via gateways.
* An example of internetworking is the internet, which has now become important and widely used in everyday life.

===Routers===
Routers and Bridges allow communication between computers on different segments.
A Router is a device that receives packets from a router or a host and uses the destination IP address the packets contain to pass them to another router or host. Routers are commonly connected to a network of other routers.
An example of how routers are used:
If a host of a network (network A) in one country(country A) wants to communicate with a host on a network(network B) of another country (country B), it will have to send packets to the gateway router on network A; this will pass the packets to the
 local router -&gt; regional router -&gt; national router -&gt; international router
until the network of country B is reached.

===Bridges===
A bridge holds a table of MAC addresses for each connected machine. Data packets received from one segment are only forwarded if they have a valid destination MAC address on the other segment. This helps to reduce overall traffic. Note that bridges are similar to switches but have only two connections.

===Switches===
Like a Bridge a Switch has a table of MAC addresses for each connected machine. Data packets received from one connection are only forwarded if they have a valid destination MAC address on the other connection. Unlike Bridges, Switches can have many connections.

===Hubs===
Hubs broadcast any packets received to all other connections.

===Gateways===
A device used to connect networks using different protocols so that information can be passed from one system to another.
Gateways are used to connect LANs through the internet; in order to do this, they must translate the LANs frame into equivalent WAN frame, vice versa; this is because the LANs uses a protocol that is different from the protocols used on the internet which is WAN.

Define these and consider where and why they are used. In particular, consider how routing is achieved across the Internet and how local area networks are connected to the Internet via gateways.

===Subnetting===
Subnetting is used to divide a network into smaller logical networks, e.g a LAN within a WAN. By dividing the address the responsibility for maintaining the network can be split between the WAN operator and the LAN operator.
A subnet mask is used to identify which bits in an IP adress specify its subnet, and hence which addresses it can send packets directly to, not via a router. 255.255.255.0 is the network mask for the segment 192.168.1</text>

==Firewalls==
[[Image:Firewall.png|thumb|200xpx]]
A firewall is a device or program that monitors and controls data traffic between the internet and a private network (such as your network at home). Every firewall can be customised and assigned rules which determine which data packets are allowed through from the internet and which are not.

Firewalls can also be used to block data from certain IP addresses, domain names or port numbers. Many firewalls also have the capability of being able to search individual packets for specific matches of text.

''Packet filtering -'' 
*When using the packet filtering method, the firewall analyses the packets that are sent from the internet against a set of filters (firewall rules) which determine whether or not the packet is allowed to go through.

''Proxy server -''
*Proxy servers prevent the user of a private network coming into direct contact with the computer that hosts a web page on the internet. This works by the proxy requesting the data from the internet and then passing it on to the private network user.

==Encryption==
'''Encryption''' is used to hide sensitive messages from illegitimate recipients by using encryption algorithms and an encryption key to convert plain text to cipher text, illegible to those without the encryption and decryption key. '''Private/Public key encryption''' is when both parties have a pair of keys, one private and one public. The Public Key is kept in the open freely usable by anyone as is the encryption algorithm, however the Private Key is kept hidden.
*A message encrypted with A's public key can only be decrypted with A's private key.
*A message encrypted with A's private key can only be decrypted with A's public key.
*A message encrypted with B's public key can only be decrypted with B's private key.
*A message encrypted with B's private key can only be decrypted with B's public key.

==Digital signatures==

'''Digital signatures''' are a way for the sender to prove to the receiver that the message did in fact originate from them. A digital signature is obtained through the following process: 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;float: right; text-align: center; margin: 1em;&quot;
! rowspan=&quot;1&quot; | Processes required before A sends the message to B 
! rowspan=&quot;1&quot; | Processes required to ensure the message is from A
|-
| Message is hashed to get a message digest. || B decrypts the message with B's private key.
  |-
| The message digest is encrypted with A's private key, this then becomes the signature. || B decrypts the signature with A's public key to get the original message digest.
|-
| The signature is appended to the message. || The decrypted message is hashed again, reproducing the message digest.
|-
| The message is encrypted using B's public key. || The message has not been tampered with if the decrypted message digest is the same as the reproduced digest. 
|-
| The encrypted message is sent to B. ||  
|}

[[File:Digital Signature diagram.svg|800px]]

[[File:CPT-Internet-DigitalSignatures.svg|800px]]

A '''Digital Certificate''' is a way of proving that the public key of the sender is authentic. Digital Certificates are only issued by a [[w:Certificate_Authority|certification authority]] (CA). The certificates are encrypted into the message via the CA's private key, and can only be decrypted with the CA's public key.

==Security Threats ==
There are a number to be aware of:

===Viruses===
A virus is a small computer program attached to another program or file and is intended to cause harm to a computer. The first step that a computer performs when the program is executed is to copy itself onto the disk and hide itself. After being copied onto the disk the virus can reside in memory and reconfigure the system so it causes problems such as displaying unwanted messages, destroying or corrupting files or even wiping the entire hard disk. Viruses tend to replicate themselves and also try to spread to other computers. 
Anti-virus programs are used to detect and remove these viruses. Nowadays web browsers have built-in virus scanners which scan files that are available for download.

===Worms===
A worm is a malicious program designed to replicate itself in an attempt to spread across a computer network such as the internet. The most significant difference between a worm and a virus is that a worm is a complete program on its own. Worms can disrupt network traffic and damage data.

===Spam===
Spam is the flooding of irrelevant unwanted message (silly pointless annoying messages) these can either be by email, SMS or instant messaging. Email spam is usually considered junk mail and millions of spam emails are sent every day. Text messaging spam is also used by companies to advertise themselves. Spam is considered to be disruptive and a waste of network bandwidth.

===Phishing===
Phishing is the act of deceiving a user to give sensitive information about themselves. This may happen by the use of phishing emails or even phishing sites, these look like the site the user is trying to access but are not, they are intended to capture information from the user. The term phishing comes from fishing, where instead of catching fish, information is caught. 

===Pharming===
Pharming is technique used to redirect traffic from one website to another, Phishing and Pharming are used in conjunction. Pharming is the process of redirecting users to a different location so that a phishing technique can imitate and capture information about the user.

==Computer Security Procedures==
Authentication, Authorisation, Accounting.

===Authentication===
Verification of the user of the computer system.  It is used for passwords, biometric data, security token and digital signatures.

===Authorisation===
Specifying the access rights of different users to resources on a network.

===Accounting===
Keeping logs of user activity on a network.

A chapter that is purely links to external sites. Also nested chapters. There are four chapters - one containing the three internal links and nothing else and the three chapters of external links.

There's the usual ultimateguitar.com links but also wikitabs.org. I want to know if this wikitabs site is part of Wikipedia et al.

The chapter is also full of links to tabs generated by: bettylou.zzruss.com

I don't know what to make of all this. This chapter seems to be an external link directory. This is meant to be a book about the guitar not a search engine or link directory. I've added a deletion request.

So it wikitabs.org part of Wikipedia et al?

Also why have they nested the chapters?. You click on Song Library and get presented with a whole chapter dedicated to displaying three links.

cheers

Forgot to sign it. This request was posted on the 17 August 2013. I'm signing it today. Sorry about that.

* {{question}} Wikitabs isn't part of the &quot;Wikimedia&quot; family, no. Now you've deleted all the links, do you still feel the page should be deleted?

The book is progressing and these spam links really belong to the Wild West days of Wikimedia projects. I edit the Guitar book regularly and find that these legacy pages stand in the way. Here's my idea about what this book can be. Most books are started and then seem to get stuck. Its almost like the order of the material forces future editors to avoid tackling structure. I'm reworking material from other editors and adding my own with a view of creating a Wikibook that is comprehensive in its coverage and logical in its structure and presentation. I'm not admin so I have to request that pages and chapters be deleted. The Guitar Chords Song Library has to go - its spam. its boring, its overloaded with links, its nested pages that are separated from the main structure.

Probably the most important reason is its spam. External links to commercial sites and some amateur sites with basic lyric sheets with chords symbols above. If you want to go to the Delta Quadrant on Voyager with a bunch of guitarists who all use the same wrong chords and keys that's up to you. Personally it all smacks of Lister on the Red Dwarf if you ask me. Its spam.  

[[User:Sluffs|Sluffs]] ([[User talk:Sluffs|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sluffs|contribs]]) 19:46, 21 October 2013 (UTC)

I think this has been sitting here for awhile, because whether this decision should be left up to book contributors and whether the pages are within project scope, may have been difficult to determine.

CC-BY-SA and public domain sheet music may be appropriate for inclusion in a book about learning to play a musical instrument. A book about learning to play a musical instrument may also link to reliable websites that include relevant sheet music. Books often have a [[WB:MOS#Bibliography|bibliography]] with external links to relevant material on the topic collected in one place. One link to a website is often enough when the whole website is relevant for a book. What content to include and what websites to link to is best left to book contributors to decide through [[WB:BOLD|bold actions]] and the [[WB:DM|decision making]] process. If book contributors decide through consensus a page should be deleted, then that page can be [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deleted]].

Books must maintain a [[WB:NPOV|neutral point of view]] and must be instructive for inclusion at [[WB:WIW|Wikibooks]]. A list of songs to learn by skill level must be based on reliable sources to maintain a NPOV and to verify factual accuracy. A list must have an instructional context, such as helping anyone with the musical instrument learn to play the songs through instruction and practice. These things can be addressed by book contributors, and are normally not a reason to delete.

No community consensus is possible based on the current level of feedback. However the feedback that has been provided should be used to improve the book, and these pages. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:40, 29 May 2014 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sustainable product design ==
Designers now need to consider the following when creating their products:
* Easy to dismantle for re-pair, reuse to extend the life-span.
* Easy to dismantle and part the different material for recycling
* Easy to remove separate parts that have a different repair criteria.
* Reduction in the material used to product the product.
* Label the material in order to sort them correctly
* Avoid coating the material with something that would make it more difficult to recycle.

In the book, &quot;[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beauty-Sustainable-Products-Design-Fundamentals/dp/2880465451/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401404038&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9782880465452 The Total Beauty of Sustainable Products]&quot;, there are five factors that make a product sustainable:
* Cyclic
::Made from biodegradable materials, or mineral that are recycled, E.g. Biopol®
* Solar
::Products that only consume renewable sources of power. E.g. Solar cells
* Safe
::Products that don't do any harm the the environment. E.g. They don't emit emission during manufacture.
* Efficient
::Products that require less energy than they did previously. E.g. [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Sustainability/Minimising_waste_production#Reduce|click here]]
* Social
::Products that support human rights and natural practices. E.g. Fairtrade products.

== Raw materials ==
Material have an economic and environment cost; for example metals are abundant, but they need a lot of energy to get them out of the rock, and a lot of money to pay people to use expensive machinery to take it out. 

=== Table of the environmental impact of raw materials for packaging ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Packaging material !! Raw material !! Extraction !! Processing
|-
| Paper and board || Trees || [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Sustainability/Responsibilities_of_developed_countries#Sustainable_timber_production|Click here for details]] || Chemical pollutants used in chemical wood pulp production/bleaching
|-
| Metals || 
* Aluminium from Bauxite ore
* Steel from Iron Ore
|| Mining, Energy use, Open-cast mining and transport || Large amounts of energy put into the processing of these ores which gives out carbon emissions.
|-
| Polymers || Crude Oil || Drilling, Energy use, destruction of habitat || Large amounts of energy put into the processing of these polymers which gives out carbon emissions.
|}

== Manufacture ==
Ways to [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Sustainability/Minimising_waste_production#Reduce|reduce]] use of materials in manufacturing:
* Make a simpler design
* Different materials to reduce weight or quantity needed.
* Materials that use less energy to process.
* Simpler components
* Better work flow.

=== The Coca-Cola '202' drinks can ===
This is a can developed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_Enterprises Coca-Cola Enterprise Ltd] that replaced the 206 can. The difference is that the top of the can went from a diameter of 206, to a diameter of 202, thus making a material reduction&lt;ref&gt;http://www.packaging-gateway.com/projects/amcor/&lt;/ref&gt;. 

This small change resulted in:
* £1 Saving per 1,000,000 cans
* £2,300,000 saving per year from 1995 onwards
* Made the can more light weight, better for delivery.

Another way they made material cost changes was that they changed the way that the aluminium sheet were cut, rather than a square tesselation, they interlocked each circular shape, this saved them around 12.1% of aluminium.

== Distribution ==
The main problem is a lot of energy is needed and that a lot of carbon emissions are released, with congested roads not helping. Other forms of transport could be used like a train.

If a delivery lorry wants to reduce the fuel used, then the following could be changed:
* Move the manufacturing company to a better location, nearer to delivery location(s).
* Reducing the amount of products
* Lightening the load, make lighter products
* Driving sensibly
* using alternative fuels

=== Alternatives to fossil fuels ===
A good solution for the distribution problem would be to use an alternative eco-friendly fuel, however, there is currently a lack of availability.

==== Table of alternative fossil fuels ====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Fuel Type !! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
| [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_petroleum_gas Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)] || 
* Good availability
* Large supply
* Range of kits available
* Reduction in emissions
* Low cost
* Reliable performance
|| 
* Doesn't work with diesel
* No factory-fit models yet
|-
| [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio_ethanol Bio ethanol] || 
* Reduced emissions
* Increased power
* Factory-fit models available
* Renewable fuel
|| 
* Poor availability
* Limited availability of vehicles
* Not cheap
|-
| [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_natural_gas Compressed natural gas] || 
* Works with diesel vehicles
* Similar economy to diesel
* Reduced emissions.
|| 
* Poor availability
* Limited availability for vehicle kits
|-
| [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel Hydrogen] || 
* No emissions

|-

* Zero Emissions
|| 
* Little range
* Slow charge times
|}

== Use and maintenance ==
Issues in current product are that they are too difficult to fix if they are broken, meaning that the whole thing needs to be thrown away, this is a waste. For more on this, see: [[A-level_Graphic_Products/Edexcel/Unit_3_:Designing_for_the_Future/Design_in_context/The_effects_of_technological_changes_on_society#Built-in_obsolescence|built-in obselecence]]

56- year-old man , a machinist referred from Injuries to the specialist's certificate due to a notified disease is osteoarthritis. The disorder is notified on 10.01.2008 due to congestive Shoulder impingement .

The effect described , in the case of repeated heavy lifting in 1982 , and the symptoms started around 2007. Has worked for many years with heavy lifting daily for height corresponding to the chest at a lathe in the workshop.

ALLERGIES
None known.

PREVIOUS DISEASES
Has almost always been healthy until the present , not in hospital .

TRANSACTIONS
No osteoarthritis or other ailments in general.

WORKING
Completed schooling in 1973 after the 9th grade.
1973-1979 trained as a machinist and then continue as an employee of Korsor prop, Norvangen 12 in Korsor that manufactures marine equipment .
1979-1982 as a skilled worker by Evopan ( closed) .
1982-2007 as a machinist at Korsor prop, which manufactures marine equipment .

Postponements at work on Korsor Propeller :
Was busy most of the time with work at the lathe and workshop. Manufacture of propellers, mainly up to 17-18 inches in diameter , where he could produce up to 30 pieces per day . It is that he picks the items on the material warehouse and run them on the hand truck into the lathe , where he promises piece in place with both hands so that the left arm in a horizontal static grip while he mounts the pieces. The number of propellers he performed variede to a few and up to 30 pieces a day . It is estimated that he used between half and 75% of working for the manufacture of propellers. The rest of working , he has used for other smaller or larger tasks lathe. In any case , he has used the same method to the subjects lifted into place and held with left arm raised to approx. 90 ° away from the body in a static grip. He estimates that he throughout the working hours used 50-75 % of working together in all the years as a machinist at this company.

Social consequences :
Current condition started around 2007 and reported as an occupational disease in 2008. He has been sick pretty much most of the time from 2007 until retirement in 2012 when after 2 working tests determined that he receives a disability pension. Has been in rehabilitation. This has had the impact that he has had difficulty sleeping at night because of pain and could not even make the ordinary everyday things in the home. Currently , he can not even mow . The economic impact has been that moment . has been on sick pay from 2007 to the granting of early retirement in 2012. Has been awarded a pension from the industry's Pension, which assessed that his work is reduced to 2 / 3rd The same goes for his own retirement , Danica, who has also been his earning capacity to be reduced to 2 / 3rd
Due . pain in the shoulder had to give up fishing and hunting.

Work from 1982-2007 , did have its 25th anniversary . He has worked with the same thing at Korsor Propeller . Worked as described by the rotation of the propeller , which has accounted for between 50% to 75 % of his working time. Have involved exertion of both the left shoulder and upper arm , but also on the right. As described were used large muscle strength by lifting and static fixation of the issues when installing the lathe. Moreover, when he must use the key to tighten the subject and fraspænde items in the lathe , use excessive force with both left and right hand.
This work has led to repeated work movements throughout the workday. Both the manufacture of the propeller , but also to production of other , ie . of the working week actually.
Worked involved awkward posture / movement of the shoulders and upper arms ? Yes it has it because he knows both retention of subjects and tightening these and dismantling of these have used the turning and twisting movements of both right and left arm. This has been true for 25 years , and in virtually all of the working day, with the exception of the time that has been used to retrieve the items and to keep them in place in the boxes. This means that the awkward postures and repetitive work movements have been at least 80% of working time throughout the year.
Is the shoulder has been moved forwards / upwards ? - Well, the shoulders have been brought forward and upward , as described in the assembly and dismantling of the items in the lathe .
Worked led to repeated lifting of the upper arms ? - Yes, it has , in the same way as described.
Worked resulted in static lifting of the upper arm ? - Yes, it has , as described by application and removal of the items.
Worked led to other significant loads? There were other significant loads , among others, the neck muscles , which he developed pain in regularly , at times constant.
The approximate cycle time of each job , estimated cycle time has been such that he has used from 5-10 min. with the static movements, and then have even machining if desired lasted 10-15 min . , virtually repeated throughout the day .

PRE- EXISTING CONDITIONS
Pt . have not been exposed to other illnesses or injuries that might affect the shoulder loads or disorders of the shoulder. There have been no frozen shoulder, no changes in the spine radiating to the shoulder joint , no precipitation of calcium in the rotator cuff tendons, and no osteoarthritis of arthrosis humeri scapularis detected a slight arthrosis of acromioclavicularis .

INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS
There is talk of the described work is labor-intensive processes in metallurgy, as even though pt . is a high and normal and heavily built , has been exceptional loads.

DISEASE COURSE
The symptoms started in early 2007 without there having been any special loads , but as part of their daily work. Debuting with stress -related pain in the left shoulder and arm. He was forced to offload the right shoulder and arm and then he also got symptoms on the right side . Physiotherapy had no good effect , only worsening the condition . 2008 Holbæk Hospital , surgery on the left shoulder , repeated the same year and again 2009.
Is surgery on his right shoulder in 2010 at Bispebjerg Hospital and the second time in 2011 the same place. He has also been examined by a specialist Otto Bangkok in 2008 and with Peter Lavard in 2010.
Neither physiotherapy or operations in the shoulders have had a particularly good effect. The diagnoses raya Hospital, Orthopaedic Surgery Outpatient Surgery is arthrosis primaria in other joints on the left side and shoulder disorder , unspecified .
Have gone to physiotherapy rehabilitation in the process, but without good effect. Does not that have been particularly good effect on the operations of the shoulders, to some extent on the right side .
The diagnoses raya Hospital, Orthopaedic Surgery Outpatient Surgery is arthrosis primaria in other joints on the left side and shoulder disorder , unspecified .
The diagnoses from Bispebjerg Hospital is laesio traumaticae tendinitis deltoidei ( rotator cuff , right-sided ) and afklemningssyndrom in the shoulder and arthrosis posttraumaticae in other joints.
The diagnoses from Bispebjerg Hospital is laesio traumaticae tendinitis deltoidei ( rotator cuff , right-sided ) and afklemningssyndrom in the shoulder and arthrosis posttraumaticae in other joints.
The current complaint is that he can not carry too many things at home without being able to look forward to a sleepless night because of the pain . These are impairments in virtually all the daily functions where he should meet for help from the family. Mention also that he was due to downturn in the economy had to buy an older car , where there was no power steering , which meant that he could not actually drive the car , and was again going to get a smaller car with power steering .

STRICT
On both skuldreled found decreased mobility and decreased muscle development. There is pain and tenderness on palpation of the front of the shoulder joint , no positive pain or drop arm. There are squeezing phenomenon by inward rotation when the arm is held horizontally in 40 ° abduction with their hands . The most pronounced on the left side , but also on the right side . In general, simply by lifting the lever up to more than 45 ° away from the body .
Movement : On the left side , he can keep his arm up to approx. 120 ° , set up inward and outward rotation of approx. half and extension and flexion of the shoulder joint is also reduced to approx. half .
On the right side is the movement of the shoulder joint is not so much reduced , but to approx. 75 % of the full .
Muscular : There is clearly muscular dystrophy on both bicepsmuskulaturer , the scale on the left side is 33 cm and 31 cm on the right side . He previously had much muscle development on both sides. At the forearm measures muskelfylden at its thickest point and 27 cm on the right side 26 cm . There is direct tenderness on pressure equal to subacromial bursitis and tenderness of the biceps tendon at the shoulder front surface on both sides. Sulcustest negative on both sides. Pt . are right-handed , your fingers can move freely and can be on both sides attached to the palm. There are normal movement of both wrists , on the right side scars after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome.
Muscular : On the left shoulder is seen clearly flattening of the deltoid muscle , greatest extent of the upper arm is 33 cm and 27 cm on the forearm . There are good muscle development of hand muscles on both sides. There are good circuit with clear pulse on both radial artery and no trophic disturbances.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Green Revolution==
The &quot;[[Green Revolution]]&quot; is the name given to the most successful agricultural improvement program ever undertaken in the tropics. Funded initially by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], it aimed to improve [[maize|corn]], [[rice]], and other [[cereal]] cultivators – [[Plant breeding|breeding]] plants that would produce more grain for the same amount of effort.

From that point it expanded out to improved basic farming practices, particularly for rice farmers.  The growth of crop yields was such that agriculture was able to outstrip population growth — per capita production increased every year following 1950 - with Asia leading the way. One of the more remarkable aspects of the Green Revolution is that the total cost of the program by 1990 was approximately US$100 million, less than what a single [[Boeing 747]] airliner cost in 2005.

It can be concluded that the [[Green Revolution]] was a success, with only a minor flaw: although the crops gave more yield, they were more subject to disease since this was not a primary concern of the program.

In order to address this problem together with an approach to more small-scale farming crops, there is today substantial interest in creating a second Green Revolution, based on [[Sustainable agriculture|sustainable]] agricultural practices and geared towards (small-scale) farmers with limited [[financial]] resources.

==Plant propagation==
Many tropical food plants are propagated by [[cutting]]s. Seeds are necessary for plant [[embryo]]s to survive the winter and other harsh conditions such as [[drought]]. However, where the weather is normally conducive to growth year-round, it is often advantageous for plants to [[reproduce]] through means other than seeds. By bypassing the seed stage plants can greatly accelerate their [[reproductive cycle]]. Despite this, anyone who wishes so, may still grow tropical crops (e.g. fruit, ...) from seed. To do so, some [[Sowing#Pre-treatment_of_seed_and_soil_before_sowing|special seed germination techniques]] to germinate it more quickly may be best used.

==Plant defenses==
A particularly good description of plant defenses can be found at [http://www.wischik.com/marcus/essay/def.html How and why do plants defend themselves?] that states in part:

:&quot;Plants are faced with a dilemma; while they need to attract beneficial pollinators and seed dispensers, they must also minimize the damage caused by the marauding army of herbivores. Without some form of protection the trees would be stripped bare and smaller plants would be completely devastated, and because plants stand still, they cannot run away. This is as true in Amazonian rainforest as it is in Northern coniferous forest.&quot; - Marcus Wischik.

Many (tropical) plants use [[toxin]]s to protect themselves. [[Cassava]], one of the most important tropical [[food crop]]s, produces [[cyanide]] upon [[ingestion]] unless processed to remove/reduce the cyanide content. Other plants are high in [[oxalate]]s (the agent that binds [[calcium]] to form [[kidney stone]]s); [[castor bean]]s are the source of [[ricin]], one of the most powerful [[poison]]s in existence; and [[Mucuna pruriens|velvet beans]] contain 7-10% [[L-DOPA]]. The list of toxic plants is long, but toxicity does not always mean a particular plant should be avoided, the knowledge needed to render toxic plants safe to use already exists in most communities.

==Slash/mulch==
The contents of a bag of [[commerce|commercial]] [[fertilizer]] is described in terms of NPK -[[nitrogen]] (N), [[phosphorus]] (P) and [[potassium]] (K); with nitrogen being the main component of most commercial fertilizers.

[[Oxygen]] is only a [[ Atmosphere of Earth | small part]] of the air; the largest component of air is nitrogen. Nitrogen is the main building block of [[protein]]; [[muscle]] in [[mammal]]s and plant [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] in plants. If the level of nitrogen in the [[soil]] is increased, plant growth can be significantly increased. [[Legume]]s are a group of plants that interact with [[bacteria]] ([[rhizobia]]) in the soil to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] from the air, and deposit the nitrogen into the soil where it is available for other plants to use. The nitrogen deposited by legumes can be readily converted into larger harvests.

[[Green manure]]s are plants grown to improve the soil, suppress [[weed]]s, limit [[erosion]], and &amp;mdash; when legumes are used &amp;mdash; to increase the nitrogen content of the soil. The most common type of green manure used in the tropics is [[Velvet bean]]. It produces a thick [[blanket]] of [[vine]]s and [[leaves]] that in addition to infusing the soil with nitrogen also smother most weeds. In addition it has reasonable tolerance to drought, low soil fertility, and highly [[acid]]ic soil. Alternatives to the Velvet bean include the [[Lablab bean]], the Jack bean, and for use above 500 m altitude, the [[Scarlet runner bean]].

Once the blanket is several centimeters thick, it is chopped down with a [[machete]], and the vines are chopped up. This produces thick [[mulch]] on top of the ground that both inhibits weed growth and adds vital [[nutrient]]s to the soil. Corn or other crops are then planted directly into this mulch.

Slash/mulch is popular in southern Mexico, [[Guatemala]], and [[Honduras]]; and in recent years has gained a following in many areas of the tropics, from Brazil to central Africa. Where it has been embraced it has pushed aside [[slash and burn]] agriculture, and allowed farmers to utilize the same land continuously for many years.

[[Cornell University]] has taken a leading role in [[research]]ing the effects of mulches and slash/mulch practices in the tropics.[http://ppathw3.cals.cornell.edu/mba_project/moist/home2.html]

== Small-scale irrigation ==
In most places in the tropics sufficient [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs to grow enough food to feed the local population; however, it may not fall in a timely or [[convenient]] manner. Making maximum use of the water that does fall is an ongoing challenge.

Water is a particularly important issue in [[dryland farming]]. The ability to collect and store water at a low cost and without damaging the environment, is what opens up deserts and other [[arid]] regions to farmers. When it rains in dryland areas, the rain storms are normally heavy, and the soil unable to absorb the large amounts of rain that comes down. This leads to excessive surface run-off that needs to be captured and retained.

Commercial farms growing cash crops often use irrigation techniques similar to or identical to what would be found on large scale commercial farms located in temperate regions; as an example, the Israeli drip-irrigation lines.

===Water harvesting pits===
One of the simplest forms of [[irrigation]] - the farmer digs [[bathtub]] sized pits into his fields and lines them with plastic sheets to collect rainwater. Then once the [[dry season]] sets in the farmer uses the collected water to irrigate his crops. The technique is especially useful in mountainous areas, where rapid [[Surface runoff|run-off]] otherwise occur.

During years with normal precipitation the growing season can be increased by an extra month or more by using harvesting pits. An extra month in many places means an extra crop can be grown. For instance if the local [[growing season]] is 5 months long, and the farmers main crop takes 3 or 4 months to grow, an extra month may be enough time to grow a secondary crop. During times of drought, what rain does fall can be collected in the pits and used to secure the farmer's main crop.

===Bucket drip irrigation===
An irrigation system consisting of a [[bucket]] hung from a [[Utility pole|pole]], with a [[hose (tubing)|hose]] coming out of the bottom, and holes punched into the hose. The bucket is filled, and [[gravity]] feeds the water to the plants. As a rule about 40 litres of water per day are needed for every 100 plants, although this can vary depending upon what is being grown.

===Treadle pumps===
The [[treadle pump]] is a human-powered pump designed to lift water from a depth of seven metres or less. A treadle is lever device pressed by the foot to drive a machine, in this case a pump. The treadle pump can do most of the work of a motorized pump, but costs considerably less to purchase, and needs no [[fossil fuel]] as it is driven by the operators body weight and leg [[muscle]]s. It can lift five to seven cubic metres of water per hour from [[Water well|wells]] and [[borehole]]s up to seven metres deep and can also be used to draw water from lakes and rivers. Most treadle pumps used are of local [[manufacture]], as they are simple and inexpensive to build.

Standard treadle pumps are [[suction]] pumps, and were first developed in the early 1980s in [[Bangladesh]].  Most treadle pumps manufactured in Africa are [[pressure]] treadle pumps; a modification to the original design that means water is forced out of the pump under pressure. Pressure treadle pumps are more versatile as they allow farmers to pump water uphill, or over long distances, or fill elevated tanks.

==Pest control==

===Crop rotation===
[[Crop rotation]] is the cornerstone [[pest control]] in the tropics. When a single crop is planted repeatedly in the same soil, [[insect]]s and [[disease]]s that attack that crop are allowed to build up to unmanageable levels, greatly reducing the farmer's [[harvest]].

The most basic form of crop rotation is also the simplest: never plant the same thing in the same place twice. This results in naturally breaking the [[Biological life cycle|cycles]] of [[weed]]s, insects and diseases that attack food crops. Rotations are used to prevent or at least partially control several pests and at the same time to reduce the farmer's reliance on chemical [[pesticide]]s. Crop rotations often are the only economically feasible method for reducing insect and disease damage.

Crop rotation replaces a crop that is [[susceptible]] to a serious pest with another crop that is not susceptible. Each food crop comes with its own set of pests that attack that particular crop. By planting a different crop each time, the farmer is able to starve out those pests. Often a set of three or four crops are planted on a rotating basis, ensuring that by the time the first crop is replanted, the pests that attack it are substantially reduced.

Another side benefit of crop rotation is it improves the soil. Constantly growing the same crop in the same location will strip the soil of the [[nutrient]]s that particular crop requires. Rotating to a different crop will reduce the pressure placed on the soil. Or if a green manure is used as part of the rotation sequence, the soil can actually be improved.

===Integrated pest management===
[[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM) was developed as an alternative to the heavy use of chemical pesticides. Eliminating all insect pests requires the extensive use of chemical pesticides, which over time can become self-defeating. Farmers end up using more and more chemicals with diminishing effect as pests quickly adapt –while at the same time natural [[predator]] insects are eliminated from the farm. Under IPM chemicals should be a secondary line of defense, while building up the number of natural predators on a farm is the main goal. The IPM approach calls for keeping the pest populations below the levels at which they cause economic injury, not total eradication.

IPM in its pure form is extremely complex, and beyond the ability of most farmers to manage; however, the underlying principals have gained widespread acceptance in the tropics, with most governments sponsoring IPM educational programs.

==Pioneering crops==
Pioneering crops are used in places where the land has been striped bare, and the [[topsoil]] has been entirely lost to erosion, or where [[desertification]] has started. The intent is not to grow food or cash crops, but to [[repair]] and reinvigorate the soil in order to prepare the way for the later planting of food or cash crops. [[Nitrogen fixing]] plants and trees normally form the basis of such a [[land reclamation|reclamation]] project.

==Hunger season==
The hunger season is that period of time when all the food from the previous [[harvest]] has been consumed, and the next harvest is still some time away. Even in normal years, many households face an [[Year|annual]] reduction in the amount of food they have available. Typically the hunger season will coincide with the start of [[planting]] the new crop, or shortly thereafter. So farmers are faced with a shortage of food at the very time they are expected to perform their heaviest labor.

One way of mitigating the effects of the hunger season is growing some non-seasonal crops close to the family home, such as [[banana]]s in humid areas, or cassava where it is arid. As an example, a family that has ten banana plants producing fruit during the hunger season is unlikely to experience excessive hardship. [[Sweet potato]], [[pigeon pea]], and [[Moringa oleifera]] should also be considered.

==Major constraints==

===Mild winters===

Winters are mild in the tropics; there is no frost, no snow, and no ice, so the insect population flourishes year-round. In temperate areas winter eliminates most insect pests prior to the emergence of new crops, so plants coming up in the spring have a chance to take hold and grow prior to being attacked. In the tropics plants enter a world already full of hungry adult insects.

===Acidic soils===
Soils in the humid tropics are normally highly acidic and nutrient poor; [[decomposition]] is rapid because of high temperatures, high [[humidity]], and frequent heavy rains. Heavy rains, especially monsoon rains, lead to rapid nutrient [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], and [[chemical weathering]] of the soil. Standard temperate [[strategies]] for improving nutrient poor soil, such as [[composting]], have limited application in such an environment due to rapid leaching.

[[Aluminum]] is the most common metal found in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. It is found in all soils and in all environments, from temperate to tropical. In a [[soluble]] state it is highly [[toxic]] to plant life, as it inhibits [[root]] growth; however, in [[pH|neutral]] and [[alkaline]] soils common to the temperate zones it is [[insoluble]] and therefore [[inert]]. Soil [[fertility]] is directly influenced by how acidic it is, as the more acidic the higher the level of aluminum toxicity; in areas where the [[pH]] drops below 5, aluminum becomes soluble and can enter into plant roots where it accumulates.

Approximately a third of all tropical soils are too acidic to support traditional food crops. These highly acidic tropical soils represent the largest untapped [[arable land]] left in the world, and therefore more productive utilization of these lands is key to expanding the world [[food supply]].

Winrock International states &quot;In the humid tropics, the relative importance of acid soils is greatest in Latin America (81%), but also significant in Africa (56%) and Asia (38%)&quot; [http://www.winrock.org/forestry/FACTPUB/AIS_web/AIS10.html].

Traditionally on commercial farms aluminum toxicity is countered by adding [[Agricultural lime|lime]] to the soil, which neutralizes the acid and renders the aluminum inert. However, many small land holders and resource-poor farmers cannot afford lime, and instead rely on slash-and-burn agriculture. As the original plant life is burnt, the ash acts to neutralize the acidic soil and makes the area acceptable for food plants. In time acidity increases and only [[wiktionary:native|native]] plants will grow, forcing the farmer to move on and clear a new area.

Soil color in humid areas is related to the level of [[oxidation]] that has occurred in the soil, with red soil being the result of [[iron]] oxidation, and yellow soil being the result of aluminum oxidation.

===Salinization===
[[Salinization]] occurs naturally in arid areas where not enough rain falls to wash soluble salts down and out of the root zone.  Irrigation makes the situation worse, since surface water and groundwater contain more salt than rainwater does. Salt tends to build up in the soil as water is added through irrigation. As water is used by plants and [[evaporates]] from the soil surface, the salt in the water [[concentrate]]s in the soil. The high temperatures and low humidity in arid regions means that salinization often accompanies irrigation.

===Day-length sensitive plants===
Some plants have a photoperiod ([[photoperiodism]]) requirement for a certain number of hours of daylight before they will grow, [[flower]], or produce [[fruit]]. Without this they will not complete their [[biological life cycle|life-cycle]] and will not produce fruit and seeds. For this reason seeds brought from the temperate zones may not perform as expected, or at all in the tropics. Some plants are genetically keyed to only start producing when a certain number of hours of daylight is reached, the same number of hours as is found in their native habitat. With the shorter daylight hours experienced in the tropics, that switch never gets thrown.

===Low economic input in Africa, constraining the export of tropical crops===
In Africa, there are very few registered African companies that sell their products through a commercial distributor' into Supermarkets. This phenomenon can be clearly seen if one walks into a supermarket (not a normal market, where this isn't the case); almost all products come from Western companies. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Although tropical crops have high value at supermarkets, most crops are not sold at all or have very limited supply because of the small amounts and fluctuating supply. At normal markets (not supermarkets), these food items are available, but only local crops within season. Of course because the availability meets demand in these places, prices are lower and the returns are lower than they would be in the West.

===Availability of inexpensive Western crops and food===
Western food, as it is subsidized by the [[European Union|EU]] and the USA, is for certain products, such as chicken, cheaper than its counterparts in the developing world. Besides the matching food products being cheaper, the availability of Western surrogates for certain food has also proven disastrous. At least in certain continents as Africa, Western surrogate foods are thought to be 'better' and more modern by African people, who thus switch from their traditional ingredients and meals to Western counterparts (see article below).

This availability of inexpensive foreign food is not only damaging to the indigenous economy, but also for the [[health]] of the people themselves (sparking obesity, heart problems, and a lack of certain vitamins and minerals). This is believed to be because certain Western food (not only hamburgers but also the main staple food) is not qualified for them (as strange as it may seem). Because of these problems, the traditional African food is again slowly being distributed within the continent (e.g. in [[Nairobi]], the Tusker [[Supermarket]]).

==Vulnerability to climate change==

A combination of factors make the tropics one of the world's most vulnerable regions to the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture. These include:

* High population density across much of the tropics&lt;ref&gt;Cohen JE, Small C (1998). [http://www.pnas.org/content/95/24/14009.full.pdf Hypsographic demography: The distribution of human population by altitude]. Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences 95:14009-14014&lt;/ref&gt;
* High proportion of developing nations with high incidence of poverty and underdevelopment&lt;ref&gt;Sachs JD (2001). [http://www.nber.org/papers/w8119.pdf?new_window=1 Tropical Underdevelopment] Working paper 8119, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Large percentage of population in these countries highly dependent on agriculture for their livelihood
* Dependence on rain-fed agricultural systems, especially in the arid/semi-arid tropics
* Shortening of growing seasons and increases in temperature beyond the extremes already experienced in some areas&lt;ref&gt;Battisti DS, Naylor RL (2009). [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5911/240.abstract?ijkey=8ba06f7da4d1d0c8c835f9f78e032936a69c926e&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha Historical warnings of future food insecurity with unprecedented seasonal heat] Science 323(5911):240-244.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Projected decrease in crop yields at low latitudes in contrast to high latitudes&lt;ref&gt;Easterling WE, Aggarwal PK,  Batima P, Brander KM, Erda L, Howden SM, Kirilenko A, Morton J, Soussana JF, Schmidhuber J, et al. (2007). Food, fibre and forest products. In Solomon S, Qin D, Manning M, Chen Z, Marquis M, Averyt KB, Tignor M, Miller HL, eds, Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, and New York, pp 273–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that climate change and temperature increases are expected to negatively affect crop yields in the tropics could have troublesome implications for poverty and food security, mainly because populations in the area are so dependent on agriculture as their only means of survival. A study by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security matched future climate change &quot;hotspots&quot; with regions that are already suffering from chronic poverty and food insecurity to pinpoint regions in the tropics that could be especially vulnerable to future changes in climate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regency.org/news_august11_2.html &quot;Climate change threatens world food supply&quot;] (2008).

CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

First versions of the SQL standard used a variable called SQLCODE to flag special processing situations like exceptions, warnings or regular termination. SQLCODE is no longer part of the standard and is replaced by SQLSTATE.

SQLSTATE values consist of 5 characters where the first two denotes a '''class''' and the following three a '''subclass'''. The following table lists such values of SQLSTATE which are part of the standard. Implementations usually use much more values than those defined by the standard.

SQLSTATE values belong to one of four '''categories''': &quot;S&quot; denotes &quot;Success&quot; (class 00), &quot;W&quot; denotes &quot;Warning&quot; (class 01), &quot;N&quot; denotes &quot;No data&quot; (class 02) and &quot;X&quot; denotes &quot;Exception&quot; (other classes).

__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;


In the chapter [[../SELECT: Grouping|Grouping]] we have seen that the key word GROUP BY creates groups of rows within a result set. Additionally [[../SELECT:_Predefined_Functions#Aggregate_functions|aggregat functions]] like &lt;code&gt;SUM()&lt;/code&gt; computes condensed values for each of those groups. 

As GROUP BY can work for more than one single column there is often the requirement to compute such condensed values also for 'super-groups', which arise by omitting successive one column after the next from the GROUP BY specification.

== Example Table ==
To illustrate the situation we offer an example table and typical questions to such kind of tables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE car_pool (
  -- define columns (name / type / default value / nullable)
  id           DECIMAL      NOT NULL,
  producer     VARCHAR(50)  NOT NULL,
  model        VARCHAR(50)  NOT NULL,
  yyyy         DECIMAL      NOT NULL CHECK (yyyy BETWEEN 1970 AND 2020),
  counter      DECIMAL      NOT NULL CHECK (counter &gt;= 0),
  CONSTRAINT   car_pool_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
--
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES ( 1, 'VW',     'Golf',    2005, 5);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES ( 2, 'VW',     'Golf',    2006, 2);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES ( 3, 'VW',     'Golf',    2007, 3);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES ( 4, 'VW',     'Golf',    2008, 3);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES ( 5, 'VW',     'Passat',  2005, 5);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES ( 6, 'VW',     'Passat',  2006, 1);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES ( 7, 'VW',     'Beetle',  2005, 1);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES ( 8, 'VW',     'Beetle',  2006, 2);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES ( 9, 'VW',     'Beetle',  2008, 4);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES (10, 'Toyota', 'Corolla', 2005, 4);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES (11, 'Toyota', 'Corolla', 2006, 3);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES (12, 'Toyota', 'Corolla', 2007, 2);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES (13, 'Toyota', 'Corolla', 2008, 4);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES (14, 'Toyota', 'Prius',   2005, 1);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES (15, 'Toyota', 'Prius',   2006, 1);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES (16, 'Toyota', 'Hilux',   2005, 1);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES (17, 'Toyota', 'Hilux',   2006, 1);
INSERT INTO car_pool VALUES (18, 'Toyota', 'Hilux',   2008, 1);
--
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the table there are two different car producer, 6 models and 4 years. Typical questions to such tables are:
:* Number of cars per producer or per model.
:* Number of cars per combination of some criterias like: producer plus model or producer plus year.
:* Total number of cars (without any criteria).

== ROLLUP ==
As we have [[../SELECT: Grouping|seen]], the key word GROUP BY offers condensed data for exactly one grouping level, ''producer'' plus ''model'' in this case.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT producer, model, sum(counter) as cnt
FROM   car_pool
GROUP BY producer, model
ORDER BY producer, cnt desc;
--
Toyota	Corolla	13
Toyota	Hilux	3
Toyota	Prius	2
VW	Golf	13
VW	Beetle	7
VW	Passat	6
&lt;/source&gt;

In such situations one would like to know also the corresponding values for upper groups: per ''producer'' or for the whole table. This can be achieved by submitting slightly different SELECTs.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT producer, sum(counter) as cnt
FROM   car_pool
GROUP BY producer
ORDER BY producer, cnt desc;
--
Toyota	18
VW	26
--
--
SELECT sum(counter) as cnt
FROM   car_pool;
--
44
&lt;/source&gt;

In principle it is possible, to combine such SELECTs via UNION or to submit them sequentially. But because this is a standard requirement SQL offers a more elegant solution, namely the extention of the GROUP BY with the ROLLUP key word. Based on the results of the GROUP BY it offers additional rows for every superordinate group, which arises by omitting the grouping criterias one after the other.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT producer, model, sum(counter) as cnt
FROM   car_pool
GROUP BY ROLLUP (producer, model);  -- the MySQL syntax is: GROUP BY producer, model WITH ROLLUP
--
Toyota	Corolla	13
Toyota	Hilux	3
Toyota	Prius	2
Toyota		18   &lt;-- the additional row per first producer
VW	Beetle	7
VW	Golf	13
VW	Passat	6
VW		26   &lt;-- the additional row per next producer
		44   &lt;-- the additional row per all producers
&lt;/source&gt;
The simple GROUP BY clause creates rows at the level of ''producer'' plus ''model''. The ROLLUP key word leads to additional rows where first the ''model'' and then ''model'' and ''producer'' are omitted.

== CUBE ==
The ROLLUP key word offers solutions where a hierarchical point of view is adequate. But in data warehouse applications one likes to navigate freely through the aggregated data, not only from top to bottom. To support this requirement, the SQL standard offers the key word CUBE. It is an extention of ROLLUP and offers additional rows for '''all possible combinations''' of the GROUP BY columns.

In the case of our above example with the two columns ''producer'' and ''modell'' the ROLLUP has created rows for '''producer''-only' and 'no criteria' (= complete table). Additional to that, CUBE creates rows for &amp;apos;''model''-only'. (If different ''producer'' would use the same ''model''-name, such rows will lead to only 1 additional row.)

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT producer, model, SUM(counter) AS cnt
FROM   car_pool
GROUP BY CUBE (producer, model);  -- not supported by MySQL
--
Toyota	Corolla	13
Toyota	Hilux	3
Toyota	Prius	2
Toyota	- 	18
VW	Beetle	7
VW	Golf	13
VW	Passat	6
VW	- 	26
- 	Beetle	7        &lt;--
- 	Corolla	13       &lt;--
- 	Golf	13       &lt;-- additional rows for 'model-only'
- 	Hilux	3        &lt;--
- 	Passat	6        &lt;--
- 	Prius	2        &lt;--
- 	- 	44
&lt;/source&gt;


If there are tree grouping columns c1, c2 and c3, the key words leads to the following grouping.

{| style=&quot;margin-left: 1em&quot;
|GROUP BY: || (c1, c2, c3)
|-
|GROUP BY ROLLUP: || (c1, c2, c3), (c1, c2), (c1) and ()
|-
|GROUP BY CUBE: || (c1, c2, c3), (c1, c2), (c1, c3), (c2, c3), (c1), (c2), (c3) and ()
|}

'''INTRODUCTION'''

A 56- year-old man , a machinist referred from Injuries to the specialist's certificate due to a notified disease is osteoarthritis. The disorder is notified on 10.01.2008 due to congestive Shoulder impingement .
The effect described , in the case of repeated heavy lifting in 1982 , and the symptoms started around 2007. Has worked for many years with heavy lifting daily for height corresponding to the chest at a lathe in the workshop.

'''ALLERGIES''' 

None known.
'''
PREVIOUS DISEASES''' 

Has almost always been healthy until the present , not in hospital .

'''FAMILY DISEASES''' 

No osteoarthritis or other ailments in general.

'''WORK HISTORY''' 

Completed schooling in 1973 after the 9th grade. 

1973-1979 trained as a machinist and then continue as an employee of Korsor prop, Norvangen 12 in Korsor that manufactures marine equipment . 

1979-1982 as a skilled worker by Evopan ( closed) . 

1982-2007 as a machinist at Korsor prop, which manufactures marine equipment .

Postponements at work on Korsor Propeller : Was busy most of the time with work at the lathe and workshop. Manufacture of propellers, mainly up to 17-18 inches in diameter , where he could produce up to 30 pieces per day . It is that he picks the items on the material warehouse and run them on the hand truck into the lathe , where he promises piece in place with both hands so that the left arm in a horizontal static grip while he mounts the pieces. The number of propellers he performed variede to a few and up to 30 pieces a day . It is estimated that he used between half and 75% of working for the manufacture of propellers. The rest of working , he has used for other smaller or larger tasks lathe. In any case , he has used the same method to the subjects lifted into place and held with left arm raised to approx. 90 ° away from the body in a static grip. He estimates that he throughout the working hours used 50-75 % of working together in all the years as a machinist at this company.
Social consequences : Current condition started around 2007 and reported as an occupational disease in 2008. He has been sick pretty much most of the time from 2007 until retirement in 2012 when after 2 working tests determined that he receives a disability pension. Has been in rehabilitation. This has had the impact that he has had difficulty sleeping at night because of pain and could not even make the ordinary everyday things in the home. Currently , he can not even mow . The economic impact has been that moment . has been on sick pay from 2007 to the granting of early retirement in 2012. Has been awarded a pension from the industry's Pension, which assessed that his work is reduced to 2 / 3rd The same goes for his own retirement , Danica, who has also been his earning capacity to be reduced to 2 / 3rd Due . pain in the shoulder had to give up fishing and hunting.

Work from 1982-2007 , did have 25th anniversary at Korsor Propeller . 
Worked as described by the rotation of the propeller , which has accounted for between 50% to 75 % of his working time. Have involved exertion of both the left shoulder and upper arm , but also on the right. As described were used large muscle strength by lifting and static fixation of the issues when installing the lathe. Moreover, when he must use the key to tighten the subject and fraspænde items in the lathe , use excessive force with both left and right hand. This work has led to repeated work movements throughout the workday. Both the manufacture of the propeller , but also to production of other , ie . of the working week actually. Worked involved awkward posture / movement of the shoulders and upper arms ? Yes it has it because he knows both retention of subjects and tightening these and dismantling of these have used the turning and twisting movements of both right and left arm. This has been true for 25 years , and in virtually all of the working day, with the exception of the time that has been used to retrieve the items and to keep them in place in the boxes. This means that the awkward postures and repetitive work movements have been at least 80% of working time throughout the year. Is the shoulder has been moved forwards / upwards ? - Well, the shoulders have been brought forward and upward , as described in the assembly and dismantling of the items in the lathe . Worked led to repeated lifting of the upper arms ? - Yes, it has , in the same way as described. Worked resulted in static lifting of the upper arm ? - Yes, it has , as described by application and removal of the items. Worked led to other significant loads? There were other significant loads , among others, the neck muscles , which he developed pain in regularly , at times constant. The approximate cycle time of each job , estimated cycle time has been such that he has used from 5-10 min. with the static movements, and then have even machining if desired lasted 10-15 min . , virtually repeated throughout the day .

'''PRE- EXISTING DISEASES'''

Pt . have not been exposed to other illnesses or injuries that might affect the shoulder loads or disorders of the shoulder. There have been no frozen shoulder, no changes in the spine radiating to the shoulder joint , no precipitation of calcium in the rotator cuff tendons, and no osteoarthritis of arthrosis humeri scapularis detected a slight arthrosis of acromioclavicularis .

'''INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT OF WORK LOADS''' 

The described work is labor-intensive processes in metallurgy, as even though the pt is strong built , has been exceptional loads.

'''DISEASE COURSE''' 

The symptoms started in early 2007 without there having been any special loads , but as part of their daily work. Debuting with stress -related pain in the left shoulder and arm. He was forced to offload the right shoulder and arm and then he also got symptoms on the right side . Physiotherapy had no good effect , only worsening the condition . 2008 Holbæk Hospital , surgery on the left shoulder , repeated the same year and again 2009. Is surgery on his right shoulder in 2010 at Bispebjerg Hospital and the second time in 2011 the same place. He has also been examined by a specialist Otto Bangkok in 2008 and with Peter Lavard in 2010. Neither physiotherapy or operations in the shoulders have had a particularly good effect.

The diagnoses from Bispebjerg Hospital is laesio traumaticae tendinitis deltoidei ( rotator cuff , right-sided ) and afklemningssyndrom in the shoulder and arthrosis posttraumaticae in other joints. The current complaint is that he can not carry too many things at home without being able to look forward to a sleepless night because of the pain . These are impairments in virtually all the daily functions where he should meet for help from the family. Mention also that he was due to downturn in the economy had to buy an older car , where there was no power steering , which meant that he could not actually drive the car , and was again going to get a smaller car with power steering .
STRICT On both skuldreled found decreased mobility and decreased muscle development. There is pain and tenderness on palpation of the front of the shoulder joint , no positive pain or drop arm. There are squeezing phenomenon by inward rotation when the arm is held horizontally in 40 ° abduction with their hands . The most pronounced on the left side , but also on the right side . In general, simply by lifting the lever up to more than 45 ° away from the body . Movement : On the left side , he can keep his arm up to approx. 120 ° , set up inward and outward rotation of approx. half and extension and flexion of the shoulder joint is also reduced to approx. half . On the right side is the movement of the shoulder joint is not so much reduced , but to approx. 75 % of the full . Muscular : There is clearly muscular dystrophy on both bicepsmuskulaturer , the scale on the left side is 33 cm and 31 cm on the right side . He previously had much muscle development on both sides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA''' 

Asthma is ‘occupational’ when it has been caused directly by an agent encountered at work – usually an airborne allergen. Repeated inhalation causes a respiratory hypersensitivity in some people, which is similar to ordinary allergic asthma in response to house dust mites or cats. Risky jobs Around 400 workplace agents have been reported to cause occupational asthma. Fortunately, most of these are rarely encountered and about three-quarters of all the cases in the UK are attributable to only a handful of exposures https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_asthma

'''Identifying occupational asthma'''

Ask every asthma patient of working age
what they do for a living, with details. ‘I work for a supermarket’ isn’t adequate. It is also
worth asking whether their symptoms are
better when they are not at work and whether
there is anything at work that sets symptoms
off. Be especially alert to patients whose
asthma has begun – or relapsed – shortly
after starting a new job. Also, remember that
occupational asthma is often accompanied
by occupational rhinitis. Patients may
attribute this to hayfever or a cold. See the
box, right, for a case history.

'''Implications of a diagnosis for the patient'''

It is usually recommended that patients with
occupational asthma avoid further exposure
to the causative agent. Even very small
exposures will provoke continuing symptoms,
and so it is often difficult for patients to avoid
the asthmagen while remaining in the job.
For example, wearing a face mask is seldom
sufficient even if it is tolerable. Large, wellrun
firms will attempt to find the employee
alternative work in the organisation. Where
this is impossible, as is often the case with
smaller companies, your patient is likely to
lose their job.

'''For the employer'''

Employers are required by law to report cases
of occupational asthma in their workforce to
the Health and Safety Executive. This usually
results in a formal, external inspection that can
be expensive for a business. And the patient
will lose any anonymity they might have
had, potentially making it an uncomfortable
experience. For all of these reasons, it is
easy to see why a false positive diagnosis of
occupational asthma is potentially disastrous.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Occupational medicine is the branch of clinical medicine most active in the field of occupational health. The aim of the book is to improve the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of occupational diseases. The handbook will be edited mainly by the occupational medical members of the SALTRA Panamá group. SALTRA (Salud del trabajo Centroamerica) was founded in 2003 in order to develop national and regional capacities in Central America for the prevention of occupational risks and support sustainable production in order to reduce and prevent poverty in the region. Hopefully the handbook will be indispensable for all family doctors, doctors at the hospitals and the Social Security in Panama (Caja Seguro Social). also we hope the book will be useful in the postgrade courses for family doctors in occupaitonal medicine and it willbe their companion in practice. It is the intention to develop the handbook gradually over the next many years. We also want to invite all other occupational medical physicians and other occupational health professionals from Central America and other tropical countries. The intention is to create a dynamic developing handbook that will be the most useful companion for the Family doctors and for the training and education in occupational medicine in tropical countries . Today very few medical doctors are formally specialised in occupational medicine in Panamá and most other tropical countries. The occupational medicine is practised mainly be the family doctors with some sparse traning in occupational medicine. Another important part of occupational medicine is practised by the psychiatrists in the hospitals. It is the hope that the handbook can help also to point out the gaps of research will inspire all occupational professionals to start research groups and develop a culture for reading and producing scientific litterature. Thereby to establish the fundament for the evidence based occupational health research (under development and should not be deleted!).</text>

'''INTRODUCTION'''

A 56- year-old man , a machinist referred from Injuries to the specialist's certificate due to a notified disease is osteoarthritis. The disorder is notified on 10.01.2008 due to congestive Shoulder impingement .
The effect described , in the case of repeated heavy lifting in 1982 , and the symptoms started around 2007. Has worked for many years with heavy lifting daily for height corresponding to the chest at a lathe in the workshop.

'''ALLERGIES''' 

None known.
'''

It is that he picks the items on the material warehouse and run them on the hand truck into the lathe , where he promises piece in place with both hands so that the left arm in a horizontal static grip while he mounts the pieces. The number of propellers he performed variede to a few and up to 30 pieces a day . It is estimated that he used between half and 75% of working for the manufacture of propellers. The rest of working , he has used for other smaller or larger tasks lathe. In any case , he has used the same method to the subjects lifted into place and held with left arm raised to approx. 90 ° away from the body in a static grip. He estimates that he throughout the working hours used 50-75 % of working together in all the years as a machinist at this company.
Social consequences : Current condition started around 2007 and reported as an occupational disease in 2008.

'''INTRODUCTION'''

A 56- year-old man , a machinist referred from Injuries to the specialist's certificate due to a notified disease is osteoarthritis. The disorder is notified on 10.01.2008 due to congestive Shoulder impingement .
The effect described , in the case of repeated heavy lifting in 1982 , and the symptoms started around 2007. Has worked for many years with heavy lifting daily for height corresponding to the chest at a lathe in the workshop.

'''ALLERGIES''' 

None known.
'''
PREVIOUS DISEASES''' 

Has almost always been healthy until the present , not in hospital .

'''FAMILY DISEASES''' 

No osteoarthritis or other ailments in general.

'''WORK HISTORY''' 

Completed schooling in 1973 after the 9th grade. 

1973-1979 trained as a machinist and then continue as an employee of Korsor prop, Norvangen 12 in Korsor that manufactures marine equipment . 

1979-1982 as a skilled worker by Evopan ( closed) . 

1982-2007 as a machinist at Korsor prop, which manufactures marine equipment .

Postponements at work on Korsor Propeller : Was busy most of the time with work at the lathe and workshop. Manufacture of propellers, mainly up to 17-18 inches in diameter , where he could produce up to 30 pieces per day . It is that he picks the items on the material warehouse and run them on the hand truck into the lathe , where he promises piece in place with both hands so that the left arm in a horizontal static grip while he mounts the pieces. The number of propellers he performed variede to a few and up to 30 pieces a day . It is estimated that he used between half and 75% of working for the manufacture of propellers. The rest of working , he has used for other smaller or larger tasks lathe. In any case , he has used the same method to the subjects lifted into place and held with left arm raised to approx. 90 ° away from the body in a static grip. He estimates that he throughout the working hours used 50-75 % of working together in all the years as a machinist at this company.
Social consequences : Current condition started around 2007 and reported as an occupational disease in 2008. He has been sick pretty much most of the time from 2007 until retirement in 2012 when after 2 working tests determined that he receives a disability pension. Has been in rehabilitation. This has had the impact that he has had difficulty sleeping at night because of pain and could not even make the ordinary everyday things in the home. Currently , he can not even mow . The economic impact has been that moment . has been on sick pay from 2007 to the granting of early retirement in 2012. Has been awarded a pension from the industry's Pension, which assessed that his work is reduced to 2 / 3rd The same goes for his own retirement , Danica, who has also been his earning capacity to be reduced to 2 / 3rd Due . pain in the shoulder had to give up fishing and hunting.

Work from 1982-2007 , did have 25th anniversary at Korsor Propeller . 
Worked as described by the rotation of the propeller , which has accounted for between 50% to 75 % of his working time. Have involved exertion of both the left shoulder and upper arm , but also on the right. As described were used large muscle strength by lifting and static fixation of the issues when installing the lathe. Moreover, when he must use the key to tighten the subject and fraspænde items in the lathe , use excessive force with both left and right hand. This work has led to repeated work movements throughout the workday. Both the manufacture of the propeller , but also to production of other , ie . of the working week actually. Worked involved awkward posture / movement of the shoulders and upper arms ? Yes it has it because he knows both retention of subjects and tightening these and dismantling of these have used the turning and twisting movements of both right and left arm. This has been true for 25 years , and in virtually all of the working day, with the exception of the time that has been used to retrieve the items and to keep them in place in the boxes. This means that the awkward postures and repetitive work movements have been at least 80% of working time throughout the year. Is the shoulder has been moved forwards / upwards ? - Well, the shoulders have been brought forward and upward , as described in the assembly and dismantling of the items in the lathe . Worked led to repeated lifting of the upper arms ? - Yes, it has , in the same way as described. Worked resulted in static lifting of the upper arm ? - Yes, it has , as described by application and removal of the items. Worked led to other significant loads? There were other significant loads , among others, the neck muscles , which he developed pain in regularly , at times constant. The approximate cycle time of each job , estimated cycle time has been such that he has used from 5-10 min. with the static movements, and then have even machining if desired lasted 10-15 min . , virtually repeated throughout the day .

'''PRE- EXISTING DISEASES'''

Pt . have not been exposed to other illnesses or injuries that might affect the shoulder loads or disorders of the shoulder. There have been no frozen shoulder, no changes in the spine radiating to the shoulder joint , no precipitation of calcium in the rotator cuff tendons, and no osteoarthritis of arthrosis humeri scapularis detected a slight arthrosis of acromioclavicularis .

'''INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT OF WORK LOADS''' 

The described work is labor-intensive processes in metallurgy, as even though the pt is strong built , has been exceptional loads.

'''DISEASE COURSE''' 

The symptoms started in early 2007 without there having been any special loads , but as part of their daily work. Debuting with stress -related pain in the left shoulder and arm. He was forced to offload the right shoulder and arm and then he also got symptoms on the right side . Physiotherapy had no good effect , only worsening the condition . 2008 Holbæk Hospital , surgery on the left shoulder , repeated the same year and again 2009. Is surgery on his right shoulder in 2010 at Bispebjerg Hospital and the second time in 2011 the same place. He has also been examined by a specialist Otto Bangkok in 2008 and with Peter Lavard in 2010. Neither physiotherapy or operations in the shoulders have had a particularly good effect. The diagnoses raya Hospital, Orthopaedic Surgery Outpatient Surgery is arthrosis primaria in other joints on the left side and shoulder disorder , unspecified . Have gone to physiotherapy rehabilitation in the process, but without good effect. Does not that have been particularly good effect on the operations of the shoulders, to some extent on the right side . The diagnoses raya Hospital, Orthopaedic Surgery Outpatient Surgery is arthrosis primaria in other joints on the left side and shoulder disorder , unspecified . The diagnoses from Bispebjerg Hospital is laesio traumaticae tendinitis deltoidei ( rotator cuff , right-sided ) and afklemningssyndrom in the shoulder and arthrosis posttraumaticae in other joints. The diagnoses from Bispebjerg Hospital is laesio traumaticae tendinitis deltoidei ( rotator cuff , right-sided ) and afklemningssyndrom in the shoulder and arthrosis posttraumaticae in other joints. The current complaint is that he can not carry too many things at home without being able to look forward to a sleepless night because of the pain . These are impairments in virtually all the daily functions where he should meet for help from the family. Mention also that he was due to downturn in the economy had to buy an older car , where there was no power steering , which meant that he could not actually drive the car , and was again going to get a smaller car with power steering .
STRICT On both skuldreled found decreased mobility and decreased muscle development. There is pain and tenderness on palpation of the front of the shoulder joint , no positive pain or drop arm. There are squeezing phenomenon by inward rotation when the arm is held horizontally in 40 ° abduction with their hands . The most pronounced on the left side , but also on the right side . In general, simply by lifting the lever up to more than 45 ° away from the body . Movement : On the left side , he can keep his arm up to approx. 120 ° , set up inward and outward rotation of approx. half and extension and flexion of the shoulder joint is also reduced to approx. half . On the right side is the movement of the shoulder joint is not so much reduced , but to approx. 75 % of the full . Muscular : There is clearly muscular dystrophy on both bicepsmuskulaturer , the scale on the left side is 33 cm and 31 cm on the right side . He previously had much muscle development on both sides. At the forearm measures muskelfylden at its thickest point and 27 cm on the right side 26 cm . There is direct tenderness on pressure equal to subacromial bursitis and tenderness of the biceps tendon at the shoulder front surface on both sides. Sulcustest negative on both sides. Pt . are right-handed , your fingers can move freely and can be on both sides attached to the palm. There are normal movement of both wrists , on the right side scars after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome. Muscular : On the left shoulder is seen clearly flattening of the deltoid muscle , greatest extent of the upper arm is 33 cm and 27 cm on the forearm . There are good muscle development of hand muscles on both sides. There are good circuit with clear pulse on both radial artery and no trophic disturbances.

'''1. Job description ''' 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple
Citation from the pages ('''locked for edition without permisison due to threat of destruction!!''') Three-quarters of pineapples sold in Europe are grown in Costa Rica, where pineapple production is highly industrialised. Growers typically use 20 kg of pesticides per hectare in each growing cycle,a process that may affect soil quality and biodiversity. The pesticides – organophosphates, organochlorines and hormone disruptors – have the potential to '''affect workers' health and can contaminate local drinking water supplies.'''  Many of these chemicals have potential to be carcinogens, and may be '''related to birth defects.'''

Because of commercial pressures, many pineapple workers – 60% of whom are Nicaraguan – in Costa Rica are paid low wages.European supermarkets' price-reduction policies have lowered growers' incomes.One major pineapple producer contests these claims.

==Definition==
A snakebite is an injury caused by a bite from a snake, often resulting in puncture wounds inflicted by the animal's fangs and sometimes resulting in envenomation. Although the majority of snake species are non-venomous and typically kill their prey with constriction rather than venom, venomous snakes can be found on every continent except Antarctica. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakebite

==Epidemiology of snakebites==

'''Panama''' has the greatest incidence of snakebites in Latin America, while El Salvador has the lowest (mostly because B. asper is not found in this country).The total number of snakebites in Central America is estimated to be 4,000 to 5,000, although as in other regions of the world, snakebites are probably underreported. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_snakebites Epidemiology of snakebites]
Estimated incidence of snakebites in Panama is 80 per 100.000 inhabitants and the lowest incidence in Central America is 0,8 in El Salvador. There might be underreporting in both countries. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3973843/pdf/1678-9199-20-7.pdf%20%20 Gutiérrez 2014]

==Research needs==
The incidence of snakebites in Panamá is the highest in the region. For the prevention there are some important research needs as proposed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3973843/pdf/1678-9199-20-7.pdf%20%20 Gutiérrez 2014] There is a need to know more about the cases: who, where, when and how did it happen? What happended to the victims ?
Most of the snakebites are treated (prehospital) in the local health centres and the patient records contain important information, useful for the research

This appendix deals with whetting your appetite for something more, why only this much(?) hunger.

Here, I am going to list complete exercises which would be dealt in while studying German.

Few starting exercises have very simple language examples, as to make the student understand the matter, and thus get into flow. The exercises post those are to make the students grow the fluency at a rapid stage.

'''''There are certain exercises which deal in higher level of study materials. These exercises should be dealt only when the person has reached the requisite level of understanding and should also be ready to complete the exercises most of it without any assistance of the English Language.'''''

&lt;b&gt;Best of luck. :)&lt;/b&gt;

===Notes===
*In the infinitive most German verbs end in '''-en'''. A few end in '''-n'''. The part of the verb where ending is added is called ''stem''. '''geh-''', '''komm-''', '''lern-''', etc., are the stems of '''gehen''', '''kommen''', '''lernen''', etc.
*When the subject is '''ich''' most German verbs end in '''-e'''.
*When the subject is '''er''', '''sie''', '''es'''; a singular noun; '''wer''' or '''was''' -- most German verbs end in '''-t'''.
*When the usbject is '''wir''', all German verbs end in '''-en''' or '''-n''', like the infinitive.

*The German verb has no special emphatic or progressive forms. Thus: '''ich lerne''' = I learn, I 'do' learn, I 'am' learning; '''er kauft''' = he buys, he 'is' buying, he 'does' buy, etc.

Following are given some very simple words in order to practice pronunciation, so as to get a grip with the daily words to be used. The English pronunciation are also provided for ease of the same. However, first read the words aloud of the German language as many times as required to get the base upped.

===Notes===
*'''alphabets in the bracket''' are actually spoken with a shortened tone, and with a small hiss.
*'''alphabets in the inverted comma''' are spoken in half silence.
*Some of the words have a intonation inbuilt, and thus can be pronounced as are done in the English Language.
*While speaking the German words, ensure that you speak aloud each and every word properly, and that if you miss out on any, then start all over again, as in the new steps, it takes time to remember what was the last word spoken.
*Almost all of the words are similar in the pronouncing stages, while the pronouncing alphabets may differ though.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Woman's History&quot;: I'm of two minds about this. On the one hand it does bring in figures who are unrepresented in this current version of the text. On the other, it seems dismissive and patronizing. Phillis Wheatley and Margaret Brent are important as historical figures, and not just in some specialized Woman's History. Some texts would use color-coding: but that isn't part of the Wiki palette, and introduces unnecessary complication. What do ye think?

== The relationship between anthropometrics and ergonomics ==
=== Ergonomics ===

=== Anthropometrics ===
These are measurements that are based around human measurements like shapes and sizes. Anthropometric data uses the largest amount of users in order to get the highest accuracy. When people design a product they base their product on 90% of the population and this is based off of this anthropometric data; these product miss out on the low and high end of the spectrum, from the 5th percentile to the 95th percentile, a total of gap of 90%.

==== Sources and Applications of anthropometric data ====
In Britian, these measurements are obtained by the British Standards Institute (BSI). They have measurements for men, women and children for clothing. Additionally there is extra anthropometrics for disabled people that take into account for wheel chairs. The anthropometrics for one country will be different than anthropometrics in others.

== Key ergonomic factors for the designer ==

== The interaction between user, products, systems and environments ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a guide that should help you on your way to becoming a game developer, no matter what which path you want to take. This book should either help you through each aspect, or redirect you to a place that can. This book has been designed to be 'straight' and 'to the point' to allow you to make the most of your time. If you have found a section of the book that's lacking and you feel like you know enough to write about it, feel free to edit it, it will also help you get a better understanding of the topic.

== Please categorise new pages ==

{{tmbox|type=notice|text='''Please use our [[WB:CAT|category system]] to help people find new pages and books.''' Every page in a book should include {{tl|BookCat}} or a book navigation template. A book's main page should include {{tl|subjects}} with a few [[:Category:Subject|subjects]] that reflect the book's specific scope. You can read [[Using Wikibooks]] to learn more about [[WB:WIW|Wikibooks]], or ask questions in the [[WB:HELP|Assistance Reading Room]]. Thank you }}

== Signature ==

Hello.
:I noticed you created the discussion pages of some of your book contributions. Whenever you are in any &quot;Talk&quot; page or &quot;Discussion&quot; page, it is recommended to add your signature at the end of the discussion. This assists in 2 ways:
# Shows who is the User of the stated discussion.
# Shows the date and time when the same was posted for future references.

This is also required as per the talk page norms. I understand you already know how to do so.

Do note, that only sign for discussion pages and not on the &quot;Book&quot; itself.

Danke Schôn. [[User:Harrybrowne1986|Vishal]][[User Talk:Harrybrowne1986| Bakhai]] - [[Special:Contributions/Harrybrowne1986|Works]][[Image:Flag_of_India.svg|15px]] 18:02, 31 May 2014 (UTC)

== The Subjects Template ==

Hello, the {{tlx|Subjects}} template is only used on the main page of books, not on the sub-pages. It is used to put a whole book into a Subject - for example, to include a book on the C programming language in [[Subject:Computer programming]] - not to describe the subject of a particular page of a book (e.g., like &quot;joystick&quot; in your example). Therefore, I've removed the template from the sub-pages of your book. If this doesn't make sense, let me know - [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 08:27, 4 June 2014 (UTC)

== Page Moves ==

Hello, I've moved your book to the new name for you. Admins have access to move a page and all of its subpages as one action, so I was able to move it without breaking the links or having to manually move all the subpages. If you ever find yourself needing to do this again, please ask in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] and an admin will do it for  you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Physiology''' 
The word physiology has Greek origin, is the study of how organisms perform their vital functions. An example is the study of how a muscle contracts or what kind of forces contracting muscles exert on the skeleton.
== Types of human physiology ==
Human physiology is the study functions of the human body that can be divided into the following types:. 

'''Cell physiology'''

This is the cornerstone of human physiology; it is the study of the functions of cells. 

'''Special physiology''' 

This is the study of the functions of special organs. For example, renal physiology is the study of kidney function.

'''Systemic physiology'''

It includes all aspects of the function of the body systems, such as cardiovascular physiology, respiratory physiology, reproductive physiology etc.. 

'''Pathophysiology''' 
It is the study of the effects of diseases on organ or system functions (pathos is the Greek word for disease).

== Level of organization ==
Different levels of organization

'''Atom:''' 
An atom is defined as the smallest particle of an element [carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), etc.]. 

'''Molecule:''' 
A molecule is defined as a particle composed of two or more joined atoms (carbon dioxide CO2, water H2O).
 
'''Macromolecule:''' 
A macromolecule is defined as a large molecule (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids).
 
'''Organelles:''' 
An organelle is defined as a small organ of a cell, which performs a particular function (cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus)

'''Cell:''' 
The cell is defined as the basic unit of structure and function of living organisms. 

'''Tissue:''' 
A tissue is defined as a group of similar cells that performs a specialized function (epithelia, connective, muscle and nervous).

'''Organ:''' 
An organ is defined as a structure consisting of a group of tissues that perform a specialized function (skin, heart, brain, etc…). 

'''System:''' 
The system is defined as a group of organs that act together to perform a specialized function. 
Human body: 
An organism is the most complex level of organization. It consists of all systems


'''The seven characteristics of life'''

1. '''Cells:''' All living organisms have cells; cells are the building blocks of life. 

2. '''Metabolism:''' All living organisms eat, drink, breathe and excrete. 

3. '''Growth:''' All living organisms take in material from the environment to enlarge. 

4. '''Reproduction:''' All living organisms are able to produce a copy of themselves. 

5. '''Irritability:''' All living organisms are able to react to a change in their environment. 

6. '''Adaptation:''' All living organisms are able to compete with each other for food and space to survive. 

7. '''Movement:'''  All living organisms are able to move.

== Cells physiology ==

Cells are not all the same but all cells share general structures
 



Cells are organized into three main regions: Nucleus, cytoplasm and plasma membrane.
 
'''The nucleus'''
Control center of the cell because it contains genetic material (DNA). It contains three regions: Nuclear membrane, nucleolus and chromatin
 
'''Nuclear membrane'''
Nuclear membrane serves as a barrier of nucleus. It consists of a double phospholipid membrane and contains nuclear pores that allow for exchange of material with the rest of the cell.
'''Nucleolus'''
Nucleus contains one or more nucleoli. It functions as sites of ribosome production. Ribosomes then migrate to the cytoplasm through nuclear pores.
'''Chromatin'''
They are composed of DNA and protein scattered throughout the nucleus. Chromatin condenses to form chromosomes when the cell divides.
'''Plasma membrane'''
Barrier for cell contents. It consists of double phospholipid layer and monolayer of protein scattered around phospholipid layer. Other materials in plasma membrane such as cholesterol and glycoproteins.
 
'''Cytoplasm'''
It represents the material outside the nucleus and inside the plasma membrane. It consists of 
'''Cytosol''': Fluid that suspends other elements
'''Organelles:''' That  perform the metabolic activity of the cell

Cytoplasmic organelles

'''Ribosomes'''
They  represent sites of protein synthesis in the cell. They are found at two locations: Free in the cytoplasm and attached to endoplasmic reticulum.
'''Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)'''
Fluid-filled tubules for carrying substances. There are two types of ER
'''Rough endoplasmic reticulum:''' Carry ribosomes that  represent sites where proteins are synthesized 
'''Smooth endoplasmic reticulum:''' Functions in cholesterol synthesis and breakdown, fat metabolism, and detoxification of drugs.

'''Golgi apparatus'''
Their functions are modified and packaged proteins, secrete vesicles, plasma membrane components and lysosomes.

'''Lysosomes'''
They contain enzymes that digest nonusable materials within the cell 

'''Peroxisomes'''
Membranous sacs of oxidase enzymes. The detoxify harmful substances and break down free radicals.
 
'''Mitochondria'''
They represent powerhouse of the cell. They can change shape continuously. They also carry out reactions where oxygen is used to break down food to provide ATP for cellular activities.

'''Centrosome''' 
The centrosome is composed of two  centrioles surrounded by an amorphous mass of protein. Centrosomes are associated with the nuclear membrane during prophase of the cell cycle. In mitosis the nuclear membrane breaks down and the centrosome can interact with the chromosomes to build the mitotic spindles.

'''Centrioles:''' 
Centrioles are self-replicating organelles made up of nine bundles of microtubules. They appear to help in organizing cell division, but aren't essential to the process.
Cytoskeleton
Network of protein structures that extend throughout the cytoplasm. It 
provides the cell with an internal framework. Fore example, microfilaments and microtubules.

'''a-Microfilaments''' 
Microfilaments are solid rods made of proteins called actin. These filaments are an important supports of the cytoskeleton.

'''b-Microtubules'''
These straight, hollow cylinders are found throughout the cytoplasm of all human cells and carry out a variety of functions, ranging from transport to structural support.

      <text xml:space="preserve"> Octavian Sarbatoare, scriitorul iubirii perene, a lansat un nou volum &quot;Mesagerii iubirii&quot;


Scriitorul australian de origine română Octavian Sarbatoare isi continua periplul romantic cu un volum recent publicat in Australia - &quot;Mesagerii iubirii&quot; -, care se adauga la opera-i formatoare de constiinta.

Ileana Speranta Baciu, directorul Editurii &quot;Flori Spirituale&quot; din Deva, cea care publica in Romania toate cartile autorului, a realizat un interviu cuprinzând gandurile lui Octavian Sarbatoare despre cartea sa, cu perspectiva ce i se contureaza si cu nazuinta de a face ca floarea iubirii perene sa infloreasca pe meleagurile natale. Redam integral acest dialog.

I. In ce fel ati putea defini volumul recent &quot;Mesagerii iubirii&quot; publicat in Australia in ianuarie 2009?
R. Noua carte inregistrata la National Library of Australia, &quot;Mesagerii iubirii&quot;, este o dezvoltare fireasca a subiectelor zugravite de mine in &quot;Iubire in India&quot;, proza romantica ce constituie filonul de baza pertinent iubirii indiene. In &quot; Romania, &quot;Iubire in India&quot; a aparut la Editura &quot;Flori Spirituale&quot; din Deva in anul 2007, cu ocazia omagierii lui Mircea Eliade la centenarul nasterii sale.
I. Ce ii este caracteristic? De ce il considerati o dezvoltare fireasca a subiectului zugravit in &quot;Iubire in India&quot;?
R. &quot;Mesagerii iubirii&quot; are valoare de anticipatie aplicativa, aduce ideea iubirii perene din cadrul indian in cel romanesc. Acesta ar fi un prim aspect al specificitatii cartii. Este scrisa in cea mai mare parte sub forma epistolara, o corespondenta electronica intre autorul cartii &quot;Iubire in India&quot; si cititorii ei. Cei care au parcurs proza romantica isi exprima astfel opiniile despre ea si prezinta modalitatile in care ii aplica ideile in viata lor. Titlul &quot;Mesagerii iubirii&quot; are ca subtitlu &quot;Ecouri la proza romantica &quot;Iubire in India&quot;&quot;. Acesta identifica exact ce-mi propun sa prezint cititorilor.
I. Putem prin urmare spune ca toate aceste scrisori constituie un &quot;manual aplicativ&quot;.
R. Mai precis, este un &quot;fel&quot; de manual aplicativ si in acelasi timp o modalitate de inspiratie. Volumul contine 12 capitole, fiecare tratand opinii, intrebari ale cititorilor si raspunsuri ale autorului. Exemplele oferite sunt aspecte paradigmatice ale iubirii perene. Cititorii prozei romantice &quot;Iubire in India&quot; isi deapana momente din viata. Ei descopera cum, cand si unde pot constientiza si aplica iubirea perena in existenta proprie.
I. Dar ceea ce infatisati sunt subiecte majore ale vietii de zi cu zi.
R. Este tocmai ceea ce am intentionat prin a scrie &quot;Mesagerii iubirii&quot;: ofer solutii de a folosi proza romantica &quot;Iubire in India&quot; ca inspiratie pentru iubirea dintre un barbat si o femeie. În contextul prezentat de mine tangentele romantice capata valori perene. Iubirea nu este un sentiment care se iveste si dispare pe parcursul vietii, ci o inlantuire de trairi intre sufletele ingemanate care isi schimba doar corpul in care se manifesta, esenta iubirii ramanand mereu aceeasi.
Ati mentionat anterior aducerea iubirii perene in contextul romanesc. in ce consta?
Precum stiti proza romantica &quot;Iubire in India&quot; are cadrul dominant de desfasurare India, tara protagonistei principale, Sangita. In volumul &quot;Mesagerii iubirii: Ecouri la proza romantica Iubire in India&quot;, arena majora este Romania. Deci, in noul teren, cititorii, care aplica in vietile proprii iubirea perena, pe care autorul a trait-o in India, aduc filonul de idei in tara celuilalt protagonist principal, romanul Cezar Augustin.
I. Ilustri scriitori romani in proza lor fantastica si filosofica au transfigurat iubirea creand personaje care traverseaza timpul sub diverse
identitati.
R. Da. Liviu Rebreanu in romanul &quot;Adam si Eva&quot; a zugravit remarcabil transmigrarea sufletelor perechi, infatisand iubirea ca pe un sentiment peren. Metempsihoza a fost prezentata in proza fantastica si filosofica a lui Mihai Eminescu si Mircea Eliade. &quot;Avatarii faraonului Tla&quot; scrisa de Eminescu si &quot;Noaptea de sanziene&quot; a lui Eliade sunt exemplele cele mai concludente.
I. Care este aportul dumneavoastra in acest domeniu?
H. Drumurile sunt deja deschise in acest sens. Subliniez ca perenitatea iubirii, din cele doua scrieri ale mele, contribuie la formarea unei noi constiinte a iubirii. Proza romantica &quot;Iubire in India&quot; este mai mult elaborarea unei metodologii privind manifestarea sufletelor care se iubesc, iar &quot;Mesagerii iubirii&quot; aplicarea acestei metodologii. impreuna formeaza un tot al tematicii iubirii perene, cea marcata de constientizarea existentei metempsihozei.
I. Ganduri de viitor in zugravirea acestei iubiri, care renaste persistent, mereu si mereu din aceeasi radacina viguroasa?
R. Proza romantica &quot;Iubire in India&quot; se incheie cu convingerea personajului principal Cezar Augustin, Ramdas, ca a gasit calea. Apare inerent faptul ca el se va angaja pe drumul nou descoperit.
I. Deci planuiti un nou volum. Cand si unde?
R. Cartea cred ca o voi scrie in vara anului 2009, atunci cand voi fi in Romania. Nu pot anticipa ce va contine, dar pot spune cu certitudine ca va fi o creatie interactiva, intre cititorii prozei &quot;Iubire in India&quot; si mine, autorul ei. Desigur ca li se va pastra anonimatul. Ma voi hotara ulterior la titlul ei.
I. &quot;In ce mod volumul &quot;Mesagerii iubirii&quot;va putea fi la indemana cititorilor din Romania?
R. Poate apare de sine statator, asa cum s-a intamplat in Australia sau impreuna cu proza romantica &quot;Iubire in India&quot;. Aceasta datorita faptului ca exista o legatura inerenta intre cele doua titluri: cartea &quot;Mesagerii iubirii&quot; serveste &quot;Iubire in India&quot;. Cititorii sunt cei care vor beneficia cel mai mult de volumul integral.

      <comment>% changed to 75 as the joystick section is incomplete</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The 'perfect game' should allow you to have different input types: keyboard &amp; mouse, gamepad/controller and joystick.

== Keyboard &amp; Mouse ==
=== Ability to rebind all keys ===
* When rebinding keys, allow one gameplay action to be bound to two or more keys
* Some games have one key allowed to be linked to multiple actions
* Allow for rebound keys to not only go to keys, but to mouse movement and mouse buttons if they have a custom mouse.
* Allow them to bind 'double-tap' functionality
* Set-ups for different game modes:
** When on-foot
** When in a car
** Etc
* Default presets:
** Default 1 right-handed
*** Typical preset for a [[w:First_person_shooter|FPS]] would be:
**** Forward - '''W'''
**** Backwards - '''S'''
**** Left - '''A'''
**** Right - '''D'''
**** Jump - '''Space'''
**** Run - '''Left Shift''' or Double-tap '''W'''
**** Crouch - '''Left Ctrl''' or '''C'''
**** Reload - '''R'''
**** Use - '''E'''
**** Grenade/Throwing item - '''G'''
**** Flash light - '''F'''
**** Throw item - '''Q''' or '''\'''
**** Chat - '''T''' or '''Enter'''
**** Team Chat - '''Y'''
**** Weapon Select - '''1'''-'''9''' or '''Mouse Wheel'''
**** See player/scores - '''TAB'''
** Default 2 right-handed
** Default 1 left-handed
*** Typical preset for a [[w:First_person_shooter|FPS]] would be:
**** Forward - '''I''' or '''Arrow-Up''' or '''Numpad-8'''
**** Backwards - '''K''' or '''Arrow-Down''' or '''Numpad-5''' or '''Numpad-2'''
**** Left - '''J''' or '''Arrow-Left''' or '''Numpad-4'''
**** Right - '''L''' or '''Arrow-Right''' or '''Numpad-6'''
**** Jump - '''Space'''
**** Run - '''/''' or '''Right Shift'''
**** Crouch - 
**** Reload - 
**** Use - 
**** Grenade/Throwing item -
**** Flash light - 
**** Throw item - 
**** Chat -
**** Team Chat -
**** Weapon Select - 
**** See player/scores -
** Default 2 left-handed
** Allow them to save configuration pre-sets (Custom 1)
*** This would be useful if two people played the game

=== Mouse Sensitivity ===
* Change normal look-around sensitivity
** Different sensitivity in the '''x-axis''' to the '''y-axis'''
* Change aim-down-sight sensitivity
** Maybe also change aim-down-&lt;u&gt;scope&lt;/u&gt; sensitivity
* When set to 100%, it should be the same as their desktop mouse sensitivity (no mouse acceleration/deceleration)

=== Invert mouse ===
* Invert in the '''y-axis'''
* Invert in the '''x-axis'''
=== Have quick access modes ===
* Quick save (could be F5)
* Quick load (could be F9)

== [[w:Gamepad|Gamepad/Controller]] ==
When a gamepad/controller is connected, the game should automatically switch the input to the gamepad/controller (without going into the options menu); this means that the main menu won't say something like &quot;press '''Enter''' to continue&quot;, instead it will say something like, &quot;press '''A''' to continue.&quot;
=== Button bindings ===
* Have a few pre-sets of buttons bindings
* Allow for custom button layouts 
=== Controller vibration ===
* On
* Off
* Custom vibration strength
=== Invert gamepad joystick ===
* Invert left joystick in both the '''x-axis''' and the '''y-axis'''
* Invert right joystick in both the '''x-axis''' and the '''y-axis'''
* Invert d-pad in both the '''x-axis''' and the '''y-axis'''
** ''This would rarely be used''
=== Joystick/Thumbstick sensitivity ===
* Different sensitivity in the '''x-axis''' to the '''y-axis''' for both joysticks on the gamepad.

== [[w:Joystick|Joystick]] ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note that in this section, you should only give examples along the Chang Jiang and in Hong Kong. Nobody is interested in the Huang He, the Nile or the Amazon.

Fluvial landforms are classified into erosional and depositional landforms. Most erosional landforms are concentrated on the upper course; most depositional landforms are concentrated on the lower course.

{{Robox|theme=4|title=Deposition: The 'principle' process in the lower course??}}
Do not be misled into thinking that deposition is the most important process in the lower course. It only occurs in specific parts of the lower course, such as inner banks, estuaries, lakes, etc., or under specific situations, such as dry season.

Hello.

I see that the book is being started keeping in mind a good aspect. There are few things which you might need for betterment:
# Try and keep the front page as small and as explorer friendly as possible. This can be achieved by placing chapter links in a template and placing those templates at the end of each chapter. You can even try to use headers.
# Try and add as brief matter about the book on the front or home page. Also, try and give some lead or basic idea about the book, so that a reader can get a fair knowledge of the usage of the same.
# You can try and check the template formats of some of the earlier books, like [[German]], or [[French]]. [[Spanish]] book templates I find at times a bit tough to be added and not too reader or even user friendly.

Anyhow, it would be a better way to present your book to the readers.

All the best. :) Just shout (ask) if you require any assistance.

Danke Schôn. [[User:Harrybrowne1986|Vishal]][[User Talk:Harrybrowne1986| Bakhai]] - [[Special:Contributions/Harrybrowne1986|Works]][[Image:Flag_of_India.svg|15px]] 18:36, 31 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note to self and all who read this: This template is for use at the bottom of the main page.  The templates linking to de. and ro. versions of WJ Europe, the PDF version and the link to WP were all on top of each other.  It looked ugly but I had no idea how to get them properly alligned from left to right.  So I decided to make the template.  And ended up with the exact same problem.  Wikimedia really need to make a proper effort to sort out the software and make it even slightly accessible for the average user.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_the_Isle_of_Mann.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:31, 31 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Pedro Pietri''' &lt;big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

=== Brief Biography ===
Pedro Pietri was born on March 21, 1943 to Francisco and Petra Pietri. He would be one of five children that the family had. Pietri died aboard a plane going to New York from Tijuana where he had been seeking treatment for a fatal illness that he had contracted after serving in the military during the Vietnam War. Pietri is well known for “Puerto Rican Obituary” and The Masses Are Asses. Pietri was Part of the Young Lords movement that took place in Spanish Harlem during the 70’s, he was an active member of this movement although it was suppressed by the police for fear that it would create a large uprising. Pietri was a strong independista who believed that Puerto Rico should break off of the United States and govern themselves.


=== Place in Latina/o Literature ===
Pedro Pietri was part of the 20th century Nuyorican movement. He was also the co-founder of the Nuyorican Poets Café.


=== Analysis of Specific Texts ===
'''&quot;Puerto Rican Obituary&quot;:'''  This poem touches on the difficulties of speaking two languages simultaneously Pietri’s Puerto Rican Obituary speaks on the indifference with which the Puerto Ricans are regarded. It also touches on the theme of struggle and dreams. The women and men in this poem live their lives working for a misery and dreaming of better things but die without having achieved their dreams and goals. Small things like better pay and winning the lottery are some of the goals that these people had. The American dream was not what they had hoped it would be making the struggle much more personal to them. It was also a critique on the war and his opposition to it.  


=== Comparison to Other Latina/o Authors ===
'''Pedro Pietri and Tato Laviera:''' Just like “El Spanglish National Anthem” the new generation Latinos in “AmeRican” all have dreams and want to make a name for themselves, however they do not know where they fit in. They wanted to break away from the mainland but they did not fit with the mainland or with Americans so they felt out of place and their struggle shows how Puerto Ricans took a long time to find their voice in this country. The American dream was not what they had hoped it would be making their struggle much more personal to them. Both narrators miss living in Puerto Rico and one-day hope to return to Puerto Rico.

==== Brief Biography ====

One of the most unknown facts of the famous poet, William Carlos Williams is his Latino background. Williams was born on September 17th, 1883 in Rutherford, New Jersey to William George Williams and Raquel Helene Rose Hoheb. William Carlos Williams’s father was born in Great Britain but grew up in various islands on the Caribbean while his mother was from Puerto Rico. In the Williams household, English, French and Spanish were the primary languages spoken. Williams’ attachment to his Latino culture stemmed from his appreciation of the Spanish language. Williams’ attended school in Europe and completed high school in New York City. After that, he attended the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in 1902. Williams became a pediatrician and opened a rather successful practice in his hometown of Rutherford where he lived with his wife, Florence Herrman and their two sons. Williams is best known for being one of the most prominent American Modernists but Williams was also heavily involved in the Latino Literary Tradition. His Latino descent allowed him to create poems and essays to expresses his admiration and interest in the struggles Latinos face. Williams’ interest becomes evident in much of his work where you often used Spanish titles as well as Spanish words and included various diverse references of the Latino culture.


==== Place in Latina/o Literature ====
William Carlos Williams is known for being a leader of the American Modernists movement, but was also majorly involved with the Latino Literary Tradition. As a modernist, Williams had a desire to break from past traditions of literature. He and other modernist rejected any literary traditions that seemed outdated, and diction that appeared to be too genteel. As a participant of the Latino Literary Tradition, he was a pioneer. Williams was able to use his words to describe the difficulties, the history and successes of both Puerto Rican and Latino culture.


==== Comparison to Other Latina/o Authors ====
&lt;u&gt;'''William Carlos Williams and Pedro Pietri:'''&lt;/u&gt; In “Libertad! Igualdad! Fraternidad!” William Carlos Williams displays the struggles of the immigrant workers constantly working in order to get by. The characters in the poem discuss their reasons for dreaming and come to the realization that the American Dream they strive for, is nearly impossible to attain. Yet, dreaming is the only thing they can do. Dreaming is what keeps them working because there is nothing wrong with a dream to help one get through a day of strenuous labor. This theme of the unattainable American Dream is also displayed in the work of many other Latino authors including Pedro Pietri. Pedro Pietri was an imperative poet in the Nuyorican movement. His poetry made powerful statements about the struggles of Puerto Ricans who move to the United States hoping to escape poverty and struggle. Like Williams, Pietri identified as a Puerto Rican. His poetry discusses assimilation and the transition from the island of Puerto Rico, to the United States. In the poem “Puerto Rican Obituary,” Pietri proves, like Williams, that the American Dream is just that, a dream. The poem starts, “They worked/They were always on time/They were never late” (Pietri 1). These lines show that these Puerto Ricans were hard workers who did that they had to do like Williams does in his poem with the lines, “you force me into the mud/with your stinking ash-cart” (2). In both poems, the American dream is discussed. Pietri states in his poem, “These dreams/These empty dreams/from the make believe bedrooms/ their parents left them/ are the after-effects of television programs/about the ideal white american families” (110). These lines focus on how these Puerto Ricans were so caught up on the dreams they saw on television, which were usually portrayed as the life for a typical American family. Williams also focuses on the difficulties that come with dreams, he states “It is dreams that have destroyed us” (8). Both poets critique the American Dream in ways that can resonate with Puerto Ricans and Latinos as well.

==== Analysis of Specific Texts ====
&lt;u&gt;'''&quot;Libertad! Igualdad! Fraternidad!&quot;'''&lt;/u&gt; The poem “Libertad! Igualdad! Fraternidad!” Is about two brothers involved with strenuous labor. One brother dreams of being rich and living a life where they wouldn’t have to work as hard as they do while the other brothers argues that impossible dreams as such are just that, impossible dreams. He argues that such dreams are what hurt them because they give them false hope. The brothers understand that there is no pride in the field of labor in which they’re in and they know they are stuck doing nothing but working and thinking of their difficulties. The more positive brother argues that even though life is difficult, dreams are not the worst thing we can do because keeping our hopes up for more positive things, are the only things that keep us going.

No origin of this poem has been found but it is included in the Norton Anthology of Latino Literature and is featured in various collected works of Williams. The title of the poem is what the motto for the French Revolution was causing one to believe that Williams believed it was time for a revolution amongst the working immigrants struggling to attain the American Dream. 


&lt;u&gt;'''&quot;Apology&quot;'''&lt;/u&gt; The poem “Apology,” touches on the difficulties faced by people whose only way to survive is to work. The poem serves to portray the everyday life of the working class citizen who has to constantly work. In the poem, the narrator is questioning his reason for even writing the poem, but when he sees the women of color working both day and night in order to live; he knows that is his reason for writing. The narrator stressed the importance of the hard workers and compares it to the work of those who are supposed to be hard workers, “leading citizens---,” but those in the field set to lead, such as politics, have done nothing compared to the time and effort put into the work of the “colored women, day workers--,” the title is simple to apologize for excessive work they partake in, in order to strive.

The poem “Apology,” was original published in the poetry magazine, Poetry: A Magazine of Verse on November 2, 1916. The poem was published alongside other works by Williams. At the time, the editor of this magazine was Harriet Monroe. Williams’s first poem published in this magazine was in 1913 and he continued to contribute to the magazine until about 1922. 


==== Literary Criticism ====
Lisa Sanchez Gonzalez, a professor at UCONN and an expert in Boricua Literature, discusses how both William Carlos Williams and Arturo Schomburg were essential components to molding what Latino literature is today. Gonzalez starts by introducing readers to Williams often unknown Latino past. She mentions how his mother was born in Mayaguez, a place in Puerto Rico and though his father was born in England, he was shaped by Caribbean culture. Gonzalez focuses on Williams “critical appropriations of historical documentation in efforts to revise the master narratives of colonization in the Americas’ history”&lt;ref&gt;González, Lisa Sánchez. “Modernism and Boricua Literature: A Reconsideration of Arturo Schomburg and William Carlos Williams” American Literary History 13. 2 (Summer,2001), 243.&lt;/ref&gt; She focuses on major themes evident in Williams’ work like racism, genocide and colonialism. Much of Williams work served as critique to pre and post-colonial times. Gonzalez also states, “Williams approaches history as a mélange of affective correlatives that he culls from extant and imaginary historical sources, which together in this text represent the possibility of a sort of coeval empathy in fiction.”&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 246.&lt;/ref&gt; In this literary criticism, Gonzales wants to prove that Williams way of writing kept historical events as real as possible. Williams words explain the past as it was, leaving no gruesome details out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Miguel Piñero'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; ==


=== Brief Biography ===
Miguel Piñero was a Puerto Rican playwright, poet, actor and Co-founder of Nuyorican Poets café. He was born in Guarabo Puerto Rico on December 19, 1946 to Miguel Angel Gomez Ramos and Adelina Piñero. He died June 16, 1988 due to liver cirrhosis. At a very early age, he moved to “Loisaida” also known as the lower east side, where his father abandoned their family whiles his mother was pregnant with his fifth sibling. Piñero started stealing food for his family by age eleven and by age fourteen he joined a gang called the Dragons and started hustling on the street.

In 1972, Piñero was incarcerated at age twenty five in Sing Sing prison for an armed robbery. One of his first literary works was written while serving time in prison. He wrote the play “Short Eyes” as part of a writing workshop held in the prison. When he left Sing Sing due to parole in 1973, he was capable to present “Short Eyes”, which comes from the slang for child molesting, &quot;short heist.&quot; The play is based on his experiences in prison and portrays life, love and death among prison inmates. The play was nominated for six Tony Awards and won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award and an Obie Award for the &quot;best play of the year&quot;. The play catapulted Piñero to literary fame and became the first play written by a Puerto Rican to be put on Broadway.

In the 1970s, Miguel Piñero was the Co-founder along with Miguel Algarin of Nuyorican poets’ café, which is a nonprofit organization in Alphabet city, Manhattan. The café is a place to perform heartfelt poetry and real life experiences of Nuyorican lifestyle, Puerto Ricans in New York.

Piñero died on June 16th, 1988 in New York City and his ashes were scattered across the Lower East Side of Manhattan considering his poem “A Lower East side poem”. His life was made into a movie, titled “Piñero” played by Benjamin Bratt. 


=== Place in Latina/o LIterature ===


=== Analysis of Specific Texts ===
'''&quot;A Lower East Side Poem&quot;:''' ''Outlaw: The collected works of Miguel Piñero'' included “A lower east side poem” which is one of the most favored literary works of all times by Miguel Piñero. As a child of the streets, who engaged with gangs, fights and drugs at an early age Piñero represents the proud aspects of being raised in the lower east side. Its shows Pinero's love and pride for his neighborhood and his community, despite the criminal activities taken place.


=== Comparison to Other Latina/o Author ===
Miguel Piñero and Piri Thomas were influential authors in the Nuyorican literary movement who wrote short poems and stories of real life experiences, using a mix of American and Latino heritage. Both artists focus on the cultural and intellectual movement involving other poets, writers and musicians who are Puerto Rican living in New York City. These works of art primarily focus on the experiences of the poor, lower class, working families who suffered from discrimination and poverty amongst Latino neighborhoods and strived for a better future.

==Apache Ant==

&lt;u&gt;''''''Apache Ant'''''' (&lt;/u&gt;or simply Ant) is an [[XML]]-based build scripting language used heavily by the Open Source community.  Ant automates tasks such as compiling source code, building deployment packages and automatically checking dependencies of what items need to be updated in a build set.

== Background ==
This wikibook was based on a presentation created by [[Dan McCreary]] for the Minnesota [http://josug.org/ Java Open Source User Group].  Dan felt strongly that a gentle introduction to Ant was necessary for new people to easily learn Ant.  The existing Ant documentation, although useful for advanced Ant users, did not meet the needs of most beginners.  For example in the Apache documentation, advanced concepts such as token filters were placed directly in the introduction for beginners.  The introductory material also did not contain full examples with complete sample build files and expected output.  Something else was needed.  At the same time the introductory material assumed that the reader was familiar with XML.  This material covers some of the material you need to know about XML to build Ant scripts.

This Wikibook is also designed to work with other XML-related programming wikibooks such as [[XML Schema]] and [[XForms]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to the plate tectonics theory, the lithosphere is cracked into many segments as they have been torn apart by internal forces constantly generated from the asthenosphere and exerted onto the lithosphere. Each piece is a '''tectonic plate''' or simply '''plate'''.

Plates have highly irregular shape, varying thickness and varying size. Plates where oceanic crust is dominant are called oceanic plates. Plates where continental crust is dominant are called continental plates. Some plates only carry oceanic crust, but not plates carry only continental crust.

== Plate movement ==
(Unimportant background knowledge) 200 million years ago, all continents formed a huge landmass, a supercontinent called Panagaea. Convection currents in the asthenosphere caused Panagaea to split into different continents. They drifted apart, resulting in the present locations of the seven continents. This is called continental drift.

(This is important) The theory of plate tectonics was later developed. As the core of the earth is very hot, magma at the bottom of the mantle is heated. This magma has lower density, so it rises up to form a rising current. It is then cooled down and sinks to form a sinking current. It rises and falls repeatedly, forming convection currents. This is mantle convection.

Plates lie and float on the asthenopshere. Mantle convection causes plate movement. Plates move at several centimetres a year.

== Plate boundaries ==
The narrow zone between two adjacent plates is called a plate boundary. Plate boundaries are classified into three types.

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|  width=&quot;72&quot; | 
|  width=&quot;72&quot; | Constructive plate boundaries
|  width=&quot;72&quot; | Destructive plate boundaries
|  width=&quot;72&quot; | Conservative plate boundaries
|- 
| Convection currents which are
| Rising/Diverging
| Sinking/Converging
| /
|- 
| cause plates to
| Diverge from each other
| Converge/collide into each other
| Slide past each other
|- 
| and create
| Tensional force
| Compressional force
| Shear/lateral force
|}

== Slab pull, ridge push ==
At destructive plate boundaries, gravity pulls the denser plate towards the subduction zone. This is slab push.

At constructive plate boundaries, magma wells up to new crust at the opening. It cools and solidifies, forming a ridge. The new crust pushes the two sides of the plate away from it. This is ridge push.

==Charge and Current==
===Current===
'''Current''' is the flow of charged particles around a circuit. The electrons are usually the particles that flow. Metals are good conductors because they have '''free electrons''' that are able to flow. 
The SI unit for charge is '''Amperes (A)'''
===Charge===
'''Charge''' is a property that particles can have which are either positive or negative. The charge can act like an inter-molecular force between the particles either repelling or attracting. This is something you will need to be aware of for the A2 syllabus. 
The SI unit for charge is '''Coulombs(C)'''
===Electron Flow===
Before it was known that it was electrons that were the '''charge carriers''', it was believed that current flowed from positive to negative. This became convention and is still used under the name '''Conventional Current''' even after the discovery of free electrons. 
We now know that electrons have a negative charge. This means they are repelled from the negative terminal and is attracted to the positive terminal.

Remember this - Electron flow is always opposite to conventional current.
===Elementary Charge===
Charged particles have a charge in coloumbs. An electron is a charged particle and has the charge of appoximately &lt;math&gt; 1.6 \times 10^{-19} &lt;/math&gt;. This is known as the '''elementary charge''' and is represented with an '''e''' symbol. Protons also have an approximate charge of e. The difference being is that electrons are negatively charged so strictly speaking they have a charge of '''-e''' and protons have a charge of '''+e'''.
===Drift Velocity===
When electrons flow in a circuit, they have a velocity. we have an equation that relates this velocity and current together
  &lt;math&gt;I = Anev&lt;/math&gt;
From this equation we know that the current is affected by '''the cross-sectional area of the wire, A''' as well as the '''number density, n''' of electrons. This is just the number of electrons per unit volume. The number of electrons are as many as there are atoms. Current also is dependent on '''elementary charge, e''' and the '''mean drift velocity, v'''
If we rearrange the top equation we can see a relationship between the values. 
  &lt;math&gt; v = \frac{I}{Ane}&lt;/math&gt;
We can then deduce these three relationships.
  &lt;math&gt; v \propto I &lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;math&gt; v \propto \frac{1}{A} &lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;math&gt; v \propto \frac{1}{n} &lt;/math&gt;
The elementary charge, e is constant. 
==Kirchoff's First Law==
{{Dbox|Kirchoff's First Law| The sum of the currents entering any point is equal to the sum of the currents leaving that same point.}}
==Equation==
===&lt;math&gt; \Delta Q = I \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;===
{{Dbox|Charge | Current passing a point in a given time.}}
{{Dbox|1 Coulomb| Current of 1 Amp passes a point in the time of 1 second.}}
===&lt;math&gt;I = Anev&lt;/math&gt;===
{{Dbox|Current | Current of a cross-sectional area depends on the mean drift velocity of the charge carriers and on their number density in the material.}}</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">As we save in [[KoBo Toolbox/KoBoForm/Creating a Form|Creating a form]], when we create a new form, the first question, which is called '''QuestionA01''' is already created for us.

We will begin by editing '''Question text''', which is the text that the enumerator will read to the interviewee. Do to so, in the left pane, click '''QuestionA01'''. The content of '''QuestionA01''' is now displayed in the right pane. The selected text should say '''QuestionA01''', since our survey is about pets, we will change the text to:

    What type of pet do you have?

The result should look like the image below.
[[File:KoBoForm-PetType.png|thumb|right|What type of pet do you have?]]

KoBoForm supports different question types, the question that was automatically created for us when we created the form is of the type '''single select'''. A single select question is a multiple choice question, in which only one option can be chosen. This is made clear to the user by a round selection indicator (also know as the radio button, after pre-programmed frequency buttons on old radios) before the different options which are available. The single-select question is useful if we are asking the interviewee a question to which the answers are '''mutually exclusive'''. An example of such a question could be:

    Is it currently raining where you are?

The answers to these questions could be:

    1. yes, it is currently raining where I am
    2. no, it is currently not raining where I am

The point of a mutually exclusive question, is that both answers cannot be correct at the same time, in this case, it cannot both be raining, as well as, not be raining, at the same time, in one location.

In addition to mutually exclusive, this question was also '''collectively exhausting''', which is to say that if '''option 1''' is not true, than '''option 2''' has to be true. However, this is not a necessary property for single-select questions, since we can add an option other, as will be discussed below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;background:#FFFFFF&quot;

|- id=&quot;ACID&quot; 
| ACID || An acronym for the 4 properties ''atomicity'', ''consistency'', ''isolation'' and ''durability''. Any [[#Transaction|transaction]] must conform to them. ''Atomicity'' means that either all or no data modification will take place. ''Consistency'' ensures that transactions transforms the database from one valid state to another valid state. ''Isolation'' requires that transactions will not affect each other, even if they run at the same time. ''Durability'' means that the modifications will keep into the database even if the system crashs immediately after the transaction. q.v.: [[w:en:ACID|ACID]]

|- id=&quot;Attribute&quot;
| Attribute || A set of properties (name, datatype, size, ...) used to characterize the data items of [[#Entity|entities]]. A group of attributes constructs an [[#Entity-type|entity-type]] (or [[#Table|table]]), i.e.: all [[#Value|values]] of a certain [[#Column|column]] must conform to the same attributes. Attributes are optionally complemented by [[#Constraint|constraints]].

|- id=&quot;Block&quot; 
| Block || Aggregation of one or more physical blocks of a mass device. Usually a block contains numerous [[#Row|rows]] of one or more tables. Sometimes one [[#Row|row]] is distributed across several blocks. q.v.: [[#DirtyBlock|dirty block]]

|- id=&quot;Clause&quot; 
| Clause || A certain language element as part of a [[#Statement|statement]]. E.g.: the ''WHERE clause'' defines seach criterias.

|- id=&quot;Column&quot;
| Column|| A set of [[#Value|values]] of a single [[#Table|table]] which resides on the same position within its [[#Row|rows]].

|- id=&quot;Constraint&quot; 
| Constraint || Similar to [[#Attribute|attributes]] constraints define rules at a higher level, data items must conform to. E.g.: nullability, primary and foreign key, uniqueness, default value, user-defined-criterias like &lt;code&gt;STATUS &lt; 10&lt;/code&gt;.

|- id=&quot;Cursor&quot; 
| Cursor || A cursor is a mechanism by which the [[#Row|rows]] of a [[#Table|table]] may be acted on (e.g., returned to a host programming language) one at a time.

|- id=&quot;Database&quot; 
| Database || A set of [[#Table|tables]]. Those tables contain user data and the [[#Data Dictionary|Data Dictionary]].

|- id=&quot;DBMS&quot; 
| Database Management System (DBMS) || A set of computer programs that controls the creation, maintenance and usage of the [[#Database|database]]. q.v.: [[w:en:Database_management_system|DBMS]]

|- id=&quot;Data Dictionary&quot; 
| Data Dictionary (DD) || A set of predefined [[#Table|tables]] where the [[#DBMS|DBMS]] stores information about all user defined objects (tables, views, constraints, ...).

|- id=&quot;DCL&quot; 
| Data Control Language (DCL) || A class of [[#Statement|statements]] which defines the access rights to data, e.g: &lt;code&gt;GRANT ..., REVOKE, ...&lt;/code&gt; . 

|- id=&quot;DDL&quot; 
| Data Definition Language (DDL) || A class of [[#Statement|statements]] which defines logical and physical design of a [[#database|database]], e.g.: &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE ...&lt;/code&gt; .

|- id=&quot;DML&quot; 
| Data Manipulation Language (DML) || A class of [[#Statement|statements]] which retrieves and manipulates data, e.g.: &lt;code&gt;SELECT ..., INSERT ..., UPDATE ..., DELETE ..., COMMIT, ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt;.

|- id=&quot;DirtyBlock&quot; 
| Dirty Block || A [[#Block|block]] whose content has changed in memory, but is still not written to disc.

|- id=&quot;Entity&quot; 
| Entity || An identifiable object like an ''employee'' or a ''department''. An entity is an instance of an [[#Entity-type|entity-type]]. Usually there are many instances of a certain [[#Entity-type|entity-type]]. Every entity is stored in one [[#Row|row]]. Entities of same [[#Entity-type|entity-type]] are stored in [[#Row|rows]] of the same [[#Table|table]]. So entities are a logical construct and [[#Row|rows]] a physical implementation.

|- id=&quot;Entity-type&quot; 
| Entity-type || A group of [[#Attribute|attributes]] describing the structure of [[#entity|entities]]. As [[#entity|entities]] of same entity-type are stored in [[#Row|rows]] of the same [[#Table|table]] it can be said, that an entity-type describes a [[#Table|table]]. (Many people tend to use the term [[#entity|entity]] as a synonym for entity-type.)

|- id=&quot;Expression&quot; 
| Expression || A certain language element as part of a [[#Statement|statement]]. It can produce either scalar [[#Value|values]] or a [[#Table|table]].

|- id=&quot;Foreign key&quot; 
| Foreign key || A [[#Value|value]] used to reference a [[#Primary key|primary key]]. It can point to any primary key in the database, whether in its own [[#Table|table]] (eg: bill of materials) or another table. It can point to its own row.

|- id=&quot;Index&quot; 
| Index || An index is a construct containing copies of original values and backreferences to their original rows. It's purpose is the provision of a fast access to the original data. To achieve this, an index contains some kind of collocation.&lt;br /&gt;
Remark: Indexes are not part of the SQL standard. Nevertheless they are part of nearly every DBMS.

|- id=&quot;Junction table&quot; 
| Junction table || If more than one row of table T1 refers to more than one row of table T2 (many-to-many relationship) you need an intermediate [[#Table|table]] to store this relationship. The [[#Row|rows]] of the intermediate table contains the [[#Primary key|primary keys]] of T1 and T2 as [[#Value|values]]. q.v.: [[w:en:Junction_table|Junction_table]]

|- id=&quot;Normalization&quot; 
| Normalization || [[#Table|Tables]] should conform to special rules - namely ''First-'', ''Second-'' and ''Third-Normal Form''. The process of rearranging columns over tables is called ''normalization''.

|- id=&quot;NULL&quot; 
| NULL || If '''no''' [[#value|value]] is stored in the [[#Column|column]] of a [[#Row|row]], the standard says, that the ''null value'' is stored. As this ''null value'' is a flag and not a real value we use the term ''null marker'' within this wikibook. The ''null marker'' is used to indicate the absence of any data. For example it makes a difference whether a temperature is measured and stored as 0 degrees or whether the temperature is not measured and hence not stored. One consequence of the existence of the ''null marker'' is that SQL must know not only the boolean values TRUE and FALSE but also a third one: UNKNOWN.

|- id=&quot;Predicate&quot; 
| Predicate || A language element which specifies a non arithmetic condition. E.g: [NOT] IN, [NOT] LIKE, IS [NOT] NULL, [NOT] EXISTS, ANY, ... .

|- id=&quot;Primary key&quot; 
| Primary key || A [[#Value|value]] or a set of [[#Value|values]] used to identify a single row uniquely. 

|- id=&quot;Query&quot; 
| Query || An often used [[#Statement|statement]] which retrieves data from the database. It is introduced by the keyword SELECT and usually contains a [[#Predicate|predicate]].

|- id=&quot;Relationship&quot; 
| Relationship || A reference between two different or the same [[#entity|entity]]. References are not implemented as links. They base upon the [[#Value|values]] of the entities.

|- id=&quot;RelationalModel&quot; 
| [[w:en:Relational model|Relational Model]] || A method (and a mathematical theory) to model data as tables (relations), the relationships among each other and all operations on the data.

|- id=&quot;Row&quot; 
| Row || One record in a [[#Table|table]] containing information about one single [[#Entity|entity]]. A row has exactly one [[#Value|value]] for each of its columns - in accordance with ''First Normal Form''. This [[#Value|value]] may be [[#NULL|NULL]].

|- id=&quot;Statement&quot; 
| Statement || A single command to be executed by the [[#DBMS|DBMS]]. Statements are terminated by a semikolon. There are 3 main classes of statements: [[#DML|DML]], [[#DDL|DDL]] and [[#DCL|DCL]].

|- id=&quot;Table&quot; 
| Table (=Relation)|| A set of [[#Row|rows]] of a certain [[#Entity-type|entity-type]], i.e. all [[#Row|rows]] of a certain table have the same structure.

|- id=&quot;3VL&quot; 
| Three Valued Logic (3VL) || SQL knows three boolean values: TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN. See: [[#NULL|NULL]].  q.v.: [[w:Three-valued logic|trivalent, ternary or three-valued logic (3VL)]].

|- id=&quot;Transaction&quot; 
| Transaction || A logical unit of work consisting of one or more modifications to the database. The [[#ACID|ACID criterium]] must be achieved. A transaction is either saved by the &lt;code&gt;COMMIT&lt;/code&gt; statement or completely canceled by the &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt; statement.

|- id=&quot;Value&quot; 
| Value || Implementation of a single data item within a certain [[#Column|column]] of a certain [[#Row|row]]. (You can think of a cell within a spreadsheet.)

|- id=&quot;View&quot; 
| View || A virtual [[#Table|table]] containing only its definition and no real data. The definition consists of a [[#Query|query]] to one or more real [[#Table|tables]] or views. [[#Query|Queries]] to the view are processed as [[#Query|queries]] to the underlying real [[#Table|tables]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:&quot;comparisons are slower than differences, because they imply a branch&quot;

This is bunk. &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; if a branching construct, because of its short-circuiting, not the comparison itself. In a tight loop, it can pay to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; instead; the code stay readable that way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:&quot;As further optimization, you can count, in typical runs, the actual number of times every case is chosen, and sort the cases from the most frequent to the less frequent.&quot;

I'd like to see benchmark figures for this (or for any other claim in this book, for that matter). The whole idea of a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; is that it can be compiled into a &quot;computed goto&quot; that uses the switch expression to determine how far to jump. The fastest switches are those for which all the cases are contiguous integers, i.e. without gaps as in:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
switch (i) {
  case 0:
    // whatever
  case 1:
    // whatever
    // note: case 2 missing
  case 3:
    // whatever
}
&lt;/source&gt;

... because in this case, the compiler needs to generate a check that &lt;code&gt;i != 2&lt;/code&gt;. [[User:Qwertyus|Qwertyus]] ([[User talk:Qwertyus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Qwertyus|contribs]]) 14:19, 3 June 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">No country in the world records or compensates all occupational injuries or work-related
diseases; injuries are better recorded than diseases, but still not satisfactorily. Reported acci
dent and disease statistics are often incomplete, since under-reporting is common, and official
reporting requirements frequently do not cover all categories of workers – those in the informal
economy, for example. The collection, recording and notification of data on occupational acci
dents and diseases are instrumental in their prevention, and it is important to identify and study
their causes in order to develop preventive measures.

This constraint can be easily misread as &quot;all chars take on values&quot; etc., which is not true on platforms with signed char. Maybe UINT8_MAX is actually easier, but it won't work on Microsoft's old C++98 compilers.

** Higher quality than MHBAO
* SSAO
** Screen space ambient occlusion
** Some people don't like this and would prefer not to have it

[[File:Anti-aliasing.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anti-Aliasing]]
* [[w:Supersampling|SSAA]]
** Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing
*** Resolves colours
**** Example: (White + White + White + Green)/4 = Light Lime
* [[w:Multisample_anti-aliasing|MSAA]]
** Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing
* FXAA
** Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing
** A lot of people prefer not to use this
* [[w:Temporal_anti-aliasing|TXAA / Temporal Anti-Aliasing]]
** Nvidia GPUs only
* [[w:Spatial_anti-aliasing|SMAA]]
** Minimizes the distortion artifacts known as aliasing when representing a high-resolution image at a lower resolution&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is going to be a little bit vague as it depends on the type of gameplay that it is.

* Difficulty
** Easy, Medium, Hard, Impossible (give them a challenge, they'll get more gameplay from it)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;To use this page, go the the section which best describes your skill level.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

== Complete Beginner to programming ==
'''When you've never done any sort of programming.'''

Select a beginner language to learn:
* [[Guide_to_Game_Development/The_Programming_Language/VB.NET|Visual Basic.Net]]
::: Windows/Microsoft only
::: Allows for creation of '''console applications''', '''forms''', '''Windows modern/metro apps''' and '''Windows Phone apps'''

* [[Guide_to_Game_Development/The_Programming_Language/Xojo|Xojo]]
::: Mac only
::: Console &amp; Form design

* [[Guide_to_Game_Development/The_Programming_Language/Java|Java]]
::: Windows, Mac and Linux
::: Output streams, forms

* [[Guide_to_Game_Development/The_Programming_Language/Python|Python]]
::: Windows, Mac and Linux
::: Scripting language - Best suited for output stream only, but can have other capabilities.

== Know basic programming, but have never made a game before ==
You have a few options:
* Learn [[Guide_to_Game_Development/The_Programming_Language/C++|C++]], most games are made with this language
** C++ can be used on all desktop platforms and most mobile platforms.
** Can program on Windows, Mac and Linux!
** Once you know C++, try integrating it with [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Rendering_and_Game_Engines/OpenGL|OpenGL]]
:::: For this, I'd also recommend that you use [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Rendering_and_Game_Engines/OpenGL/GLUT|Glut]] to help with you link the game to the OS (e.g. placing the graphics onto the form).
* If you know [[Guide_to_Game_Development/The_Programming_Language/VB.NET|VB]] or [[Guide_to_Game_Development/The_Programming_Language/C-Sharp|C#]], then you can use [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Rendering_and_Game_Engines/OpenGL/OpenTK|OpenTK]] (an [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Rendering_and_Game_Engines/OpenGL|OpenGL]] library for .Net) to create a 3D graphics.
* If you know [[Guide_to_Game_Development/The_Programming_Language/Java|Java]], then you can use [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Rendering_and_Game_Engines/OpenGL/LWJGL|LWJGL]] (an [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Rendering_and_Game_Engines/OpenGL|OpenGL]] library for Java)

== Made a game/simulation with a programming language, but not a game engine ==
For this, I'd recommend that you try out using a game engine like the [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Rendering_and_Game_Engines/Unreal_Development_Kit|Unreal Development Kit (UDK)]].

Alternatively, if you wish to mix your knowledge of programming with a light-weight engine, then try out: [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Rendering_and_Game_Engines/Unity|Unity]]

== Made a game/simulation with a game engine, but not a pure programming language ==
For this, I'd recommend that you try making a game with programming language, if you don't know any programming languages, then see: [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Introduction/Where_do_I_begin?#Complete_Beginner_to_programming|Complete Beginner to programming]]

Else, if you know a programming language then see: [[Guide to Game Development/Introduction/Where do I begin?#Know_basic_programming.2C_but_have_never_made_a_game_before|Know basic programming, but have never made a game before]]

== None of the above apply to me ==
In which case you can either ask about what to do in the [[Talk:Guide_to_Game_Development|discussion]], or just have a look around the book and see what interests you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Vatican City=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first meter was installed in early 1933 and used by the newspaper I’Illustrazione Vaticana. No other meter was used in the Vatican until 1942.
* All Vatican City meter franks contain “POSTE VATICANE”. Town marks contain “CITTA’ DEL VATICANO” or “POSTE VATICANE”. Some town marks also include the postal code or the user's identification at the bottom.

* The stamps of are grouped according to the appearance of the frank and usage:
:: A – Small upright frank with papal seal at top
:: B – Frank with side panels containing three vertical lines
:: C – Frank with side panels containing leaf design 
:: D – Frank with side panels containing non-representational ornaments with blank space above and below
:: E – Frank with side panels containing two parallel wavy lines
:: F – Scalloped outer frame, without side panels, papal seal at top
:: PO – Stamps generated only by meters used in the Vatican Post Office

* For specialized information about the meter stamps of the Vatican, see ''Repertorio – Catalogo delle Affrancature Meccaniche della CITTA del VATICANO'', 1998, Barberis, Consolini and Rassu, AICAM Publication no. 201.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Patty is in the business of transporting human organs for transplant in City. She is paid
only upon timely delivery of a viable organ; the delay of an hour can make an organ
nonviable.
David transports gasoline over long distances in a tank truck. Recently, he was hauling
gasoline through City. As David was crossing a bridge in City, his truck skidded on an
oily patch and became wedged across the roadway, blocking all traffic in both directions
for two hours.
Patty was delivering a kidney and was on the bridge several cars behind David when
the accident occurred. The traffic jam caused Patty to be two hours late in making her
delivery and made the kidney nonviable. Consequently, she was not paid the $1,000
fee she would otherwise have received.
Patty contacted Art, a lawyer, and told him that she wanted to sue David for the loss of
her fee. “There isn’t a lot of money involved,” she said, “but I want to teach David a
lesson. David can’t possibly afford the legal fees to defend this case, so maybe we can
put him out of business.”
Art agreed and, concluding that he could not prove negligence against David, decided
that the only plausible claim would be one based on strict liability for ultrahazardous
activity. Art filed a suit based on that theory against David on behalf of Patty, seeking
recovery of damages to cover the $1,000 fee Patty lost. The facts recited in the first
three paragraphs above appeared on the face of the complaint.
David filed a motion to dismiss. The court granted the motion on the grounds that the
complaint failed to state a cause of action and that, in any event, the damages alleged
were not recoverable. It entered judgment in David’s favor.
David then filed suit against Patty and Art for malicious prosecution.
1. Did the court correctly grant David’s motion to dismiss on the grounds stated?
Discuss.
2. What is the likely outcome of David’s suit for malicious prosecution against Patty and
Art? Discuss.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello. I am a user catalan, born in Barcelona but currently reside in Madrid (I do not like football or politics xD). In Wikipedia in spanish I make all sorts of tasks, from creating, translating or perfection articles even the most basic maintenance. I also have a mentoring program where I try to help novice users and my main hobbies are &lt;s&gt;sleeping&lt;/s&gt; architecture and astronomy. 

I have thousands of followers on social networks, but no one gives me money so, sadly, I have to keep working (I'm very lazy) :/ 

Not wanting to work more (did I say that I'm very lazy?) add [[w:es:Usuario:Rauletemunoz|this link]] to my user page in spanish and you do everything else.</text>

* Programmer
* Game designer
* [[/My programming and game development history/]]
* Will hopefully be going to the University of Lincoln to do [http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/course/cgpcmpub/ Games Computing]

=== How I like the structure wikibooks ===
* Bullet points (when appropriate)
* Indentation (when appropriate)
* Not blabbing on and going straight to the point; this saves both the writer and the reader time.

== Contributions ==
* '''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;[[Guide_to_Game_Development|Guide to Game Development]]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;
* '''[[A-level Graphic Products/Edexcel|A-level Graphic Products/Edexcel]]'''
* '''[[Opengl|OpenGL]]'''
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

== Favoured Windows Phone apps ==
* &lt;big&gt;'''[http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/store/app/1-toolkit/1639c502-4896-4167-a77a-0ad46ff11223 #1 Toolkit]'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;
** Ruler, Compass, Protractor, Spirit level
** Flash light, mirror, magnifier, all in one phone settings panel
** Unit Converter, NFC writer
** Noise meter, Recorder
** Timer, Stopwatch, world clock, system info
:::: Any one of these can be pinned to start.
&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;big&gt;'''[http://www.windowsphone.com/en-in/store/app/calculator/80ab181f-e01b-483c-8bca-66b302a77df6 Calculator²]'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;
** Basic Calculator

== Inside jokes ==
===Mortimus Prime&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Benjamin.doe#Mortimus_Prime&lt;/ref&gt;===
FIZIKZ N MATH BRIAN
===Absolute error of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;===
Using the formula: &lt;math&gt;Absolute Error = |targetNum - closestNum|&lt;/math&gt;

I've calculated that the '''absolute error''' of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is: &lt;math&gt;0.34159265358979323846264338327\dots&lt;/math&gt;

* Most stamps show a License number (L#) rather than a Meter number (M#).
* The stamps are grouped according to appearance and function as follows:

:: A - Commercial use designs, inscribed “CORREOS”
:: B - Commercial use designs, inscribed “IPOSTEL”
:: OO - Official government use
&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A Good Research Question'''
‘A research project should in some way enlarge our understanding of a subject or
problem. In simple terms, research is about asking a good question, finding an
answer, and arguing your case.’
Your research hinges on a good question. A good idea and a good interest is not
enough. ‘Without the articulation of a good question you are travelling
blind’ (O’Leary 2010:47)

'''Dropbox''' is a file hosting service operated by Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California, that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software. Dropbox allows users to create a special folder on each of their computers, which Dropbox then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder (with the same contents) regardless of which computer is used to view it. Files placed in this folder also are accessible through a website and mobile phone applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Balanced processing (alpha = 0.81) ==
=== Description ===

Scales were developed and validated for four dimensions of authentic leadership: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Self-awareness|self-awareness]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Relational transparency|relational transparency]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Internalized moral perspective|internalized moral perspective]], balanced processing.

=== Definition ===

The authors define authentic leadership as &quot;a pattern of leader behavior that draws upon and promotes both positive psychological capacities and a positive ethical climate, to foster greater self-awareness, an internalized moral perspective, balanced processing of information, and relational transparency on the part of leaders working with followers, fostering positive self-development&quot;.

Balanced processing refers to &quot;leaders who show that they objectively analyze all relevant data before coming to a decision&quot;.

=== Items ===

*Solicits views that challenge his or her deeply held positions.
*Listens carefully to different points of view before coming to conclusions.

The authors reported two sample items of this scale only.

=== Source ===

*[http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0149206307308913 Walumbwa et al. (2008): Authentic Leadership: Development and Validation of a Theory-Based Measure? Journal of Management, Vol. 34, No. 1, pp. 89–126]

=== Description ===

Scales were developed and validated for four dimensions of authentic leadership: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Self-awareness|self-awareness]], relational transparency, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Internalized moral perspective|internalized moral perspective]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Balanced processing|balanced processing]].

=== Definition ===

The authors define authentic leadership as &quot;a pattern of leader behavior that draws upon and promotes both positive psychological capacities and a positive ethical climate, to foster greater self-awareness, an internalized moral perspective, balanced processing of information, and relational transparency on the part of leaders working with followers, fostering positive self-development&quot;.

Relational transparency refers to &quot;presenting one’s authentic self (as opposed to a fake or distorted self) to others&quot;.

=== Items ===

*Says exactly what he or she means.
*Is willing to admit mistakes when they are made.

The authors reported two sample items of this scale only.

=== Description ===

Scales were developed and validated for four dimensions of authentic leadership: self-awareness, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Relational transparency|relational transparency]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Internalized moral perspective|internalized moral perspective]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Balanced processing|balanced processing]].

=== Definition ===

The authors define authentic leadership as &quot;a pattern of leader behavior that draws upon and promotes both positive psychological capacities and a positive ethical climate, to foster greater self-awareness, an internalized moral perspective, balanced processing of information, and relational transparency on the part of leaders working with followers, fostering positive self-development&quot;.

Self-awareness refers to &quot;demonstrating an understanding of how one derives and makes meaning of the world and how that meaning making process impacts the way one views himself or herself over time&quot;.

=== Items ===

*Seeks feedback to improve interactions with others.
*Accurately describes how others view his or her capabilities.

&lt;br /&gt;

SQL consists of statements which start with a key word like SELECT, DELETE or CREATE and terminate with a semicolon. Their elements are case-insensitive with the exception of fixed character string values like 'Mr. Brown'.

[[File:SQL ANATOMY wiki.svg|frame|left|An example of a complete statement with several of its language elements.]]
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

* ''Clauses'': Statements are subdivided into clauses. The most popular one is the WHERE clause.
* ''Predicates'': Predicates specify conditions which can be evaluated to a boolean value. E.g.: a boolean comparison, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL, IN, SOME/ANY, ALL, EXISTS.
* ''Expressions'': Expressions are numeric or string values by itself, or the result of arithmetic or concatenation operators, or the result of functions.
* ''Object names'': Names of database objects like tables, views, columns, functions.
* ''Values'': Numeric or string values.
* ''Arithmetic operators'': The plus sign, minus sign, asterisk and solidus (+, –, * and /) specify addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
* ''Concatenation operator'': The '||' sign specifies the concatenation of character strings.
* ''Comparison operators'': The equals operator, not equals operator, less than operator, greater than operator, less than or equals operator, greater than or equals operator ( =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;= ) compares values and expressions.
* ''Boolean operators'': AND, OR, NOT combines boolean values.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The average person can understand General Relativity.  Some of the ideas are actually quite simple, even if the details are complex.  The key ideas are,

* Invariance
* Curvature

Invariance is the idea that a quantity, from the real world will have a value that does not depend on how we measure it.  This is an abstract idea, but a fairly simple one.

The other idea is curvature. For curvature think of a sphere, like the world we live on.  The surface of the sphere is curved.  This is easy to picture.  The essence of General Relativity is that curvature is the source of gravity, and that mass creates curvature.

This is hard to picture.  A couple of points to clarify.  The curvature being discussed is intrinsic curvature.  It is the distortions that appear when you are actually in the dimension.  In the example given with the sphere it is the distortions the ant would see walking on the sphere.  Here the surface is 2 dimensional.  But for General Relativity the curvature is in a 4 dimensional space (3 dimensions of space and one of time).  General Relativity says that this universe we live in is curved by mass, causing gravity.

When we think of curvature we think of the surface of an object being curved.  We can see that the surface is curved from outside.  But mathematics allows the curvature to be detected from within the space, by measuring distances and angles.  This is the curvature described by General Relativity.

This is hard for anyone to understand physically.  But is is easy to see that the sphere is curved, and by analogy we can think about the universe being curved.

Curvature will be dealt with later.  Lets start with looking at invariance.

==Shadows of reality==

We perceive the world through our senses.  It is always tempting to think that what we sense is actually reality, but it is not.  What we think of as reality is an interpretation of the data we receive through our senses.

The way we come to this interpretation is through learning.  Learning is finding simpler and simpler models of our world that are consistent with the data provided by our senses.

What we aim to do is to discover the fundamental reality of the world, as facts about the world that are always true.

Consider the sense of vision.  It is not a 3 dimensional sense.  It is a 2 dimensional grid of pixels received through the camera lens of our eyes.  Out of this 2 dimensional world we form our 3 dimensional world model.

My aim is to take you back to this 2 dimensional world and show you how the 3 dimensional world emerges out of it by considering invariance.  Then when later I claim that time is simply another dimension which emerges by considering another invariance, it will not seem so shocking.

Our eyesight is complicated by problems of perspective that complicate the matter unnecessarily.  Consider instead instead shadows cast by objects from a light source very far away (e.g. the sun).  Ignore the complications of the fussy edges of shadows.  Lets pretend that the shadows have crisp edges.  They are ideal shadows.

==The shadow box==

There is a shadow box.  We do not see directly inside the box.  We only see the shadows of the objects inside the box.

The box has two buttons that rotate the objects.  One button rotates the objects that go around in circles on the screen.  One rotates them so that they appear to tumble over each other.

[[File:General relativity - 01 - right triangle.png|200px|right|The shadow of an object whose shadow appears as a right triangle.]]
By chance (or authors caprice) one object appears as a right angle triangle with a point at the center of rotation.  As the button  that rotates the object around the center is pushed we see the triangle rotate around the center.  Using a ruler the lengths of the sides of the triangle could be measured in each position.  The lengths of the sides do not change.  They are invariant.

The concept of angle may then be introduced.  The angles at the corners of the triangle are defined to be the same if the ratio of the lengths of the sides is the same.

[[File:General relativity - 01 - pythagorous.png|200px|right|The right triangle rotated, demonstrating Pythagorous.theorem]]
By considering similar triangles, this leads to [[w:Pythagorous theorem|Pythagorous theorem]].  By considering the ratios of sides,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{C} \frac{A}{C} + \frac{B}{C} \frac{B}{C} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
or,
:&lt;math&gt;A^2 + B^2 = C^2&lt;/math&gt;

Pythagorous Theorem may then be used to give a measure of the distance between any two points in a co-ordinate system.  A co-ordinate system is a way of identifying positions on the screen, by laying out a grid of parallel lines at right angles to the axis.  Positions on the axis are then numbered with.  A pair of numbers then identifies a position on the screen,
:&lt;math&gt;x = (x_1, x_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Here the position named x is identified by a pair of numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;.  The co-ordinates are numbered, 1 and 2.  We do not call the co-ordinates ''x'' and ''y'', as is sometimes done, because there is going to be more co-ordinates later (eventually 4, for General Relativity).  Writing the co-ordinate axis as a subscript will greatly simplify the notation later.

For two points,
:&lt;math&gt;x = (x_1, x_2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = (y_1, y_2)&lt;/math&gt;

then the distance measure between two points is,
:&lt;math&gt;|x - y| = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_1 - y_1)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

The notation may be simplified by allowing summing over the co-ordinates.  For example the the above distance measure formula may be simplified using a sum over co-ordinates as,
:&lt;math&gt;|x - y| = \sqrt{\sum_\mu (x_\mu - y_\mu)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

The use of Greek letters is nothing to worry about.  Mathematicians use Greek letters to broaden the set of letters they can use for variables.  Mathematicians don't usually declare there variables with types, as is done in computer science.  But none of this anything to worry about.

Now as shapes are rotated by pushing the first button (the one that appears to rotate the objects around the center of the screens) the lengths of sides remains unchanged.   In other words the length is invariant.  If we measure the same sides after rotations which we will name &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_\mu (x^\alpha_\mu - y^\alpha_\mu)^2 = \sum_\mu (x^\beta_\mu - y^\beta_\mu)^2&lt;/math&gt;

These rotations may also be considered co-ordinate transforms.  Actually a co-ordinate system is defined by us in examining the world, which is somewhat hard to think about.  It is easier, at least to start with, to think about the world being rotated around our fixed co-ordinate system.  But later we must get used to the idea of different co-ordinate system.

Because co-ordinate systems are compared so often in relativity, instead of using alpha and beta we will often refer to the primed and un-primed co-ordinate system.
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_\mu (x_\mu - y_\mu)^2 = \sum_\mu (x'_\mu - y'_\mu)^2&lt;/math&gt;

In understanding mathematical notation, we will often see that the goal of the mathematician is the simplest most concise notation possible (even if it is somewhat un-intuitive).  Mathematics arose long before computers, and everything had to be written by hand.  We will need to get use to this mathematical notation.  But however it is dressed up mathematical notation usually means something that is essentially simple.

===The dot product===

The dot product is needed.
:&lt;math&gt;x \cdot y = x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2&lt;/math&gt;

Or more generally,
:&lt;math&gt;x \cdot y = \sum x_\mu y_\mu&lt;/math&gt;

The dot product may be used to express the measure of distance,
:&lt;math&gt;(x-y) \cdot (x-y) = |x-y|^2&lt;/math&gt;

The distance from the will be written,
:&lt;math&gt;x \cdot x = |x|^2&lt;/math&gt;

===The Euclidian metric===

A metric is a matrix of data required to measure distance.  It is represented as ''g'' in,
:&lt;math&gt;|x|^2 = \sum_{\mu, \nu} g_{\mu \nu} x_\mu x_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing this with,
:&lt;math&gt;|x|^2 = \sum_\mu x_\mu^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;g = \delta&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is called the Kronecker delta, defined as,
:&lt;math&gt; \mu \ne \nu \implies \delta_{\mu \nu} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta_{\mu \nu} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;\delta = g&lt;/math&gt; gives,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mu, \nu} \delta_{\mu \nu} x_\mu x_\nu = \sum_\mu x_\mu x_\mu = \sum_\mu x_\mu^2 = |x|^2&lt;/math&gt;

The metric will be important later when we consider curved space.  Then &lt;math&gt;g \ne \delta&lt;/math&gt; and may vary with position.

===Rotation in the third dimension (the second button)===

When the second button is pushed the shapes change, and appear to tumble over each other.  Small rotations allow us to track objects as they change shape, but distances change.

Everything we had when pushing the first button disappears.  Distances are no longer invariant.  This would be quite a shock if previously we had only known about 2 dimensions.

A simple generalization of the distance measure resolves the problem,
:&lt;math&gt;|x-y|^2 = (x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 - y_3)^2 = \sum_\mu (x_\mu - y_\mu)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Then by assuming this distance is invariant it is possible to assign distances to objects that are consistent with the apparent changing of shape of the objects.  What this shows is that the shadows we see are not the reality.  The reality is that the shadows are images of an object in 3 dimensions displayed in 2 dimensions.

==The special relativity shadow box==

Around the 1900s physics, which had been doing very well in explaining the world, started to have a few problems.  The behavior of fast moving electrons did not seemed to make sense.  They behaved as if there length had been contracted in the direction of movement.

Physics had also met problems in another area.  Maxwell's equations of electo-magnetism had unified the electric and the magnetic fields and even explained light.  But they also describe a wave, and as we all know, waves need a medium to travel through.  The physicists named this medium was named the ether.

The earth is travelling fairly fast through the universe, so if the ether was stationary, it should be possible to detect the motion of the earth through the universe.  What you would expect is that the speed of light would be different if measured in different directions.  Michelson and Morley set up an experiment to test this result using an incredibly accurate device called an interferometer.

But, to there surprise, there results were negative.  Whichever way they looked the speed of light was stubbornly the same.  This seemed to defy the laws of logic because how can the speed of something be the same, no matter how fast you are going relative to it.

===Minkowski metric===

What if the 3 dimensional space we see is a shadow box, of a 4 dimensional structure?  The Michelson, Morley experiment takes us straight to the fundamental result.  It says that the speed of light is invariant, no matter how you measure it.

Then in a 3 dimensional co-ordinate system, with time, if a beam of light is omitted from the origin and received at a point ''x'' some time ''t'' later, then.
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_\mu x_\mu^2 = c^2 t^2&lt;/math&gt;

Or,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_\mu x_\mu^2 - c^2 t^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and this will be true even in any co-ordinate system no matter co-ordinate system moving at uniform speed relative to each other.  Then,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_\mu x_\mu^2 - c^2 t^2&lt;/math&gt;

may be thought of as a generalized distance in space time.  The time ''t'' is then identified as a dimension in ''x'' and is called &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The metric is then given by,

:&lt;math&gt;g_{0, 0} = -c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu \ne 0 \implies g_{\mu, \mu} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu \ne \nu \implies g_{\mu, \nu} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Hopefully the Michelson Morley result is not so shocking in light of the shadow box experiment.  The invariance it represents is a deeper order in the universe, showing the interrelation of space-time as a single four dimensional co-ordinate system, with its own metric.

===Lorentz transformation===

???? work in progress - lot of tidying up to do - not going very smoothly ????

We say a frame of reference is inertial if it is moving with a constant velocity to another.  How do positions in one frame of reference transform into another frame of reference?  

The assumptions are,
* The two axis of the reference frames are parallel.
* The transformation between frames depends only the velocity.
** The transformation from frame to the primed frame uses a velcoity ''v''.
** The transformation from primed frame to the frame uses a velcoity ''-v''.
* The speed of light as measured in the two frames is constant.
** The difference in position divided by the difference in time of a light particle recorded at two positions is always the constant ''c''.
* In the transformation, each component in the reference frame is a linear combination of the components in the primed frame.

The last condition is expressed as,
:&lt;math&gt;x_\mu = \sum_\nu m_{\mu,\nu} x'_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_{\mu,\nu}&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the transformation matrix.

One approach would be two put this transformation into the Minkowski metric,
:&lt;math&gt;(\sum_\mu x_\mu^2) - c^2 t^2 = (\sum_\mu (x'_\mu - v_\mu t')^2) - c^2 t'^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\sum_\mu (x_\mu + v_\mu t)^2) - c^2 t^2 = (\sum_\mu x'^2) - c^2 t'^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This is mathematically difficult.  See [[w:Derivations of the Lorentz transformations#Hyperbolic geometry|Hyperbolic geometry]].

====Derivation====

The usual approach is to assume that the frames move relative to each other along one co-ordinate axis.  This approach is described at [[w:Derivations of the Lorentz transformations|Derivations of the Lorentz transformations]].  These derivations are simpler in some ways, but also more confusing in other ways.  They rely on understanding the physical situation, where as I want a derivation that puts all the facts in to the formula, and arrives at the result.  Each step should be a simple no-brainer, even the derivation is a bit longer.

To make the derivation more understandable take &lt;math&gt;t = x_0&lt;/math&gt; and let the indexes go from 1 to 3 (missing out 0).  Then,
 
:&lt;math&gt;x_\mu = m_{\mu,0} t' + \sum_\nu m_{\mu,\nu} x'_\nu&lt;/math&gt; (Equation 1)
:&lt;math&gt;t = m_{0, 0} t' + \sum_\nu m_{0,\nu} x'_\nu&lt;/math&gt;  (Equation 2)

====Distance and the moving frames====
 
The two reference systems are moving with a relative constant velocity ''v'' in a direction '''e''' (given by a unit vector).  So at, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = (0, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}' = v t' \mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;.  This equation may be written,
:&lt;math&gt;x'_\nu = v t' e_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

Note: There is an assumption here that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}'&lt;/math&gt; are the same.  This assumes that the co-ordinate axis are parallel.

(Equation 1) which applies for any &lt;math&gt;x'_\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  The general formula may be applied to describe the origin of the co-ordinate systems.  Substituting,
:&lt;math&gt;x_\nu&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x'_\nu&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;v t' e_\nu&lt;/math&gt;
in (equation 1) gives,
:&lt;math&gt;0 = m_{\mu,0} t' + \sum_\nu m_{\mu,\nu} v t' e_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to,
:&lt;math&gt;0 = m_{\mu,0} + v \sum_\nu m_{\mu,\nu} e_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

and then,
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{m_{\mu,0}}{v} = \sum_\nu m_{\mu,\nu} e_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

This suggests a more natural constant for &lt;math&gt;(\mu,0)&lt;/math&gt;. Define, &lt;math&gt;n_{\mu,0}&lt;/math&gt; as, 
:&lt;math&gt; n_{\mu,0} = -\frac{m_{\mu,0}}{v}&lt;/math&gt; (definition 1)

then,
:&lt;math&gt; n_{\mu,0} = \sum_\nu m_{\mu,\nu} e_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

Then define &lt;math&gt;n_{\mu,\nu}&lt;/math&gt; as,
:&lt;math&gt;m_{\mu,\nu} = n_{\mu,0} n_{\mu,\nu} &lt;/math&gt; (definition 2)

then,
:&lt;math&gt;n_{\mu,0} = \sum_\nu n_{\mu,0} n_{\mu,\nu} e_\nu = n_{\mu,0}  \sum_\nu n_{\mu,\nu} e_\nu&lt;/math&gt;
gives,
:&lt;math&gt;1 = \sum_\nu n_{\mu,\nu} e_\nu&lt;/math&gt; (equation 3)

Substituting the (definition 1) and (definition2) into (equation 1) gives,
:&lt;math&gt;x_\mu = n_{\mu,0} (-v t'  + \sum_\nu n_{\mu,\nu} x'_\nu)&lt;/math&gt; (equation 4a)
:&lt;math&gt;x'_\mu = n_{\mu,0} (v t  + \sum_\nu n_{\mu,\nu} x_\nu)&lt;/math&gt; (equation 4a)

====Distance and the constant speed of light====

Two reference frames are moving relative to each other in a direction '''e''' with a velocity ''v''.

A light particle moving from the origin to a point '''x''' in the direction of '''e''' will always be measured to have a velocity c,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = c t \mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;

The same light particle will appear to travel from the origin to ''x''',
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}' = c t' \mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations may be written as,
:&lt;math&gt;x_\mu = c t e\mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x'_\mu = c t' e\mu&lt;/math&gt;

These equations represent another specific situation which the general equations must satisfy.  Substituting,
:&lt;math&gt;x_\mu&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;c t e\mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x'_\mu&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;c t' e\mu&lt;/math&gt;
in (equation 4a) and (equation 4b) gives,
:&lt;math&gt;c t e_\mu = n_{\mu,0} (-v t' + \sum_\nu n_{\mu,\nu} c t' e_\nu)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c t' e_\mu = n_{\mu,0} (+v t + \sum_\nu n_{\mu,\nu} c t e_\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

which may be simplified as,
:&lt;math&gt;c t e_\mu = t' n_{\mu,0} (-v + c \sum_\nu n_{\mu,\nu} e_\nu)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c t' e_\mu = t n_{\mu,0} (+v + c \sum_\nu n_{\mu,\nu} e_\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

But (equation 3) is,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_\nu n_{\mu,\nu} e_\nu = 1&lt;/math&gt;

so,
:&lt;math&gt;c t e_\mu = t' n_{\mu,0} (c + v)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c t' e_\mu = t n_{\mu,0} (c - v)&lt;/math&gt;

multiplying each side of each equation gives,
:&lt;math&gt;c^2 e_\mu^2 = n_{\mu,0}^2 (c + v)(c - v)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_{\mu,0}^2  =  \frac{e_\mu^2}{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; as,
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha  =  \sqrt{\frac{1}{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

then, 
:&lt;math&gt;n_{\mu,0} = e_\mu \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

and,
:&lt;math&gt;x_\mu = e_\mu \alpha (-v t'  + \sum_\nu n_{\mu,\nu} x'_\nu)&lt;/math&gt; (equation 5a)
:&lt;math&gt;x'_\mu = e_\mu \alpha (v t  + \sum_\nu n_{\mu,\nu} x_\nu)&lt;/math&gt; (equation 5a)

====Time and moving reference frames====

As before the two reference systems are moving with a constant velocity ''v'' in a direction '''e''' (given by a unit vector).  So at, &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}' = v t' \mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;.

From (equation 2) setting &lt;math&gt;x'_\nu = v e_\nu t'&lt;/math&gt; gives,
:&lt;math&gt;t = m_{0, 0} t' + \sum_\nu m_{0,\nu} v e_\nu t'&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to,
:&lt;math&gt;t = t'(m_{0, 0} + v \sum_\nu m_{0,\nu} e_\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

From (equation 2) by the principle of relaticity
:&lt;math&gt;t' = m_{0, 0} t - \sum_\nu m_{0,\nu} x_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

Setting &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = (0, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt; gives,
:&lt;math&gt;t' = t m_{0, 0}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving both equations for &lt;math&gt;t/t'&lt;/math&gt; gives,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{m_{0, 0}} = t/t' = m_{0, 0} + v \sum_\nu m_{0,\nu} e_\nu &lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{m_{0, 0}} - m_{0, 0} = v \sum_\nu m_{0,\nu} e_\nu &lt;/math&gt;

and then,
:&lt;math&gt;m_{0, 0}(\frac{1}{m_{0, 0}}^2 - 1) = v \sum_\nu m_{0,\nu} e_\nu &lt;/math&gt;

Let,
:&lt;math&gt;m_{0,\nu} = m_{0, 0} n_{0,\nu} &lt;/math&gt;

then,
:&lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{m_{0, 0}}^2 - 1) = v \sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} e_\nu &lt;/math&gt; (equation 7)

and,
:&lt;math&gt;t = m_{0, 0} (t' + \sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} x'_\nu)&lt;/math&gt; (equation 8)

====Time and the constant speed of light====

The constancy of the speed of light allows us to instantiate,
:&lt;math&gt;x = c t \mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x' = c t' \mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;

In (equation 2) giveing,
:&lt;math&gt;t = m_{0, 0} (t' + \sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} c t' e_\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to,
:&lt;math&gt;t = t' m_{0, 0} (1 + c \sum_\nu m_{0,\nu} e_\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

and from the principle of relativity,
:&lt;math&gt;t' = t m_{0, 0}(1 - c \sum_\nu m_{0,\nu} e_\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying both sides of the two equations gives,
:&lt;math&gt;1 = m_{0, 0}^2(1 - c^2 (\sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} e_\nu))^2&lt;/math&gt;

and by dividing  both sides by &lt;math&gt;m_{0, 0}^2&lt;/math&gt;, and subtracting 1,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{m_{0, 0}}^2 - 1 = -c^2 (\sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} e_\nu))^2&lt;/math&gt;

(Equation 7) gives another expression for &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{m_{0, 0}}^2 - 1&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{m_{0, 0}}^2 - 1 = v \sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} e_\nu &lt;/math&gt;

So,
:&lt;math&gt;-c^2 (\sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} e_\nu))^2 = \frac{1}{m_{0, 0}}^2 - 1 = v \sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} e_\nu &lt;/math&gt;

Which simplifies to,
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} e_\nu  = -\frac{v}{c^2} &lt;/math&gt; (equation 9)

This expression may be substituted in (equation 5) giving,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{m_{0, 0}}^2 - 1 = -v \frac{v}{c^2} = -\frac{v^2}{c^2} &lt;/math&gt;

This equation may be re-arranged as,
:&lt;math&gt;m_{0, 0}^2 = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \alpha^2 &lt;/math&gt; 

so
:&lt;math&gt;t = \alpha (t' - \sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} x'_\nu)&lt;/math&gt; (equation 10)

A simple expression that satisfies (equation 9) is,
:&lt;math&gt;n_{0,\nu} = \frac{v}{c^2} e_\nu &lt;/math&gt; (equation 11)

???? This result is not derived here. ????
  
substituting in,
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} e_\nu  = -\frac{v}{c^2} \sum_\nu e_\nu^2 &lt;/math&gt;

But '''e''' is defined as a unit vector so,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_\nu e_\nu^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Giving,
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_\nu n_{0,\nu} e_\nu  = -\frac{v}{c^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Which gives,
:&lt;math&gt;t = \alpha (t' - \frac{v}{c^2} \sum_\nu e_\nu x'_\nu)&lt;/math&gt; (equation 12)

====Lorentz transform====

:&lt;math&gt;x_\mu = \alpha (x'_\mu - v t' e_\mu)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = \alpha (t' - \frac{v}{c^2} \sum_\nu e_\nu x'_\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

But this is what I am expecting ???? how ????
:&lt;math&gt;x_\mu = \alpha e_\mu (x'_\mu - v t') + (1 - e_\mu) x'_\mu &lt;/math&gt;

Using &lt;math&gt;t = x_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_\mu = \alpha (x'_\mu - v x'_0 e_\mu)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = \alpha (x'_0 - \frac{v}{c^2} \sum_\nu e_\nu x'_\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

===Equivalence of mass and energy===

:&lt;math&gt; E = m c^2&lt;/math&gt;

==The inevitability of curvature==

Einstein had no choice but to consider a curved universe because, curvature is an inevitable consequence of general relativity.

===Light gaining energy, and so changing frequency===

:&lt;math&gt;E = f v&lt;/math&gt;

Photon gains energy as it falls.  So frequency increases.  Time speeds up.

===Rotating planet===

Different parts moving at different speeds.

==Gravity and mass==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is gameplay3d? ==

The gameplay3d project is an open-source, cross-platform, 3D framework that is aimed at supporting indie game developers who want to develop desktop and mobile games. The primary development language is C++, although Lua scripting is also supported.

A major motivation behind gameplay3d is to allow developers to make their games available on as many platforms as possible. It is platform-specific only where necessary, which maximises the possibility for code re-use across different platforms.

Gameplay3d is also designed to allow fast iterating and prototyping, which enables developers to realise and test ideas quickly and easily.

== Prequisites ==

=== Hardware ===

Your hardware will need to support:

* OpenGL 3.2 (desktop); or
* OpenGL ES 2.0 (mobile)

=== Knowledge ===

A strong grasp of C++ is required in order to use gameplay3d, as is an understanding of 3D graphics principles.

Some knowledge of the OpenGL API and the GLSL shader language is very helpful, although not strictly necessary to get started using gameplay3d.

Similarly, familiarity with Lua is helpful if one wishes to use gameplay3d's Lua scripting support (although use of Lua scripting is entirely optional).

Some useful links for learning about C++, 3D graphics, OpenGL and Lua can be found in [[../Links to other useful resources/]].

== Using this book ==

If you are completely new to gameplay3d, we recommend that you begin by reading the first 4 chapters of this book (i.e. this chapter, [[../An Overview of the Game Class/]], [[../gameplay3d Design Concepts/]] and [[../Creating a Scene/]]) to get an overview of how gameplay3d works. After that, feel free to skip around as required!

== Installation ==

Regardless of which platform you are using, you will '''first''' need to get hold of a copy of the gameplay3d repository, which is hosted at https://github.com/blackberry/GamePlay

=== Windows ===

The simplest way to clone the gameplay3d repository is to:

* click on the &quot;Download ZIP&quot; icon on the gameplay3d GitHub page; and
* extract the files to a folder of your choice.

Alternatively, if you have git installed and want to take advantage of the version control features it offers, you can:

* open git bash in a folder of your choice; and
* run the command &lt;code&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/blackberry/GamePlay.git&lt;/code&gt;.

The '''second''' step is to install the external dependencies on which gameplay3d relies. This is done by running the &lt;code&gt;install.bat&lt;/code&gt; script.

The dependencies which gameplay3d uses are as follows:

* bullet - for physics
* freetype2 - for font conversion
* glew - for loading OpenGL extensions
* lua - for scripting
* oggvorbis - for compressed audio
* openal - for positional audio
* png - for image decompression
* tinyxml2 - for XML parsing
* zlib - for data decompression

The '''third''' step is to make sure that you have Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop installed, which is free to install and use.

After cloning the repository, installing the dependencies and installing VS2013, you are ready to open the gameplay solution (i.e. &lt;code&gt;gameplay.sln&lt;/code&gt;). Before you run any of the samples for the first time, you will need to build the gameplay3d library, which in VS2013 can be done as follows:

* Build &gt; Build Solution (F7)

=== Mac ===

=== Linux ===

This section demonstrates how to install gameplay3d on Ubuntu Linux.

'''First''', make sure you have GIT installed. This can be done either through the Ubuntu Software Centre or by typing the following from the terminal:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
sudo apt-get install git
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

'''Second''', there are a number of other software packages that you need to have installed. To install these, type the following from the terminal:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc cmake libglu1-mesa-dev libogg-dev libopenal-dev gtk-2.0-dev curl libpcrecpp0:i386
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

This installs the following packages (to the extent that they are not already installed):

'''Third''', if you haven't done so already, use git to clone the gameplay3d repository in your desired location.

'''Fourth''', run the following command-line from the top-level directory of your gameplay3d repository, which installs the external dependencies listed in [[#Windows]] above:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
./install.sh
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

This script requires curl.

'''Fifth''', build the gameplay3d library by running the following from the top-level directory of your gameplay3d repository:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

=== Android ===

=== Blackberry ===

== Trying out the samples ==

Gameplay3d comes with a generous selection of samples. Between them, they demonstrate most of the concepts and classes found in gameplay3d. We strongly recommend that you familiarise yourself with all of the samples (particularly the &quot;samples-browser&quot; sample) and borrow/adapt the code in these samples in your own projects.

=== Windows ===

* Right click the sample you want to run
* Set as StartUp Project
* Debug &gt; Start Debugging (F5)

=== Mac ===

=== Linux ===

In order to run a sample (here the &quot;sample-browser&quot; sample is used as a demonstration), run the following from the top-level directory of your GamePlay repository:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
cd build/samples/browser
./sample-browser
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

=== Android ===

=== Blackberry ===

== Creating your first gameplay3d project ==

=== All platforms ===

To create a new cross-platform game project, run the script newproject from the repo root:

* '''newproject.bat''' (on Windows)
* '''newproject.sh''' (on Mac or Linux).

The following is an example of running the newproject.bat script:

&lt;code&gt;
   1. Enter a name for the new project.
   
      This name will be given to the project
      executable and a folder with this name
      will be created to store all project files.
   
   Project name: test
   
   2. Enter a game title.
   
      On some platforms, this title is used to
      identify the game during installation and
      on shortcuts/icons.
   
   Title: Test
   
   3. Enter a short game description.
      
   Description: Test Game
   
   4. Enter a unique identifier for your project.
   
      This should be a human readable package name,
      containing at least two words separated by a
      period (eg. com.surname.gamename).
   
   Unique ID: org.gameplay3d.test
   
   5. Enter author name.
   
      On BlackBerry targets, this is used for
      signing and must match the developer name
      of your development certificate.
   
   Author: My Company
   
   6. Enter your game's main class name.
   
      Your initial game header and source file
      will be given this name and a class with
      this name will be created in these files.
   
   Class name: TestGame
   
   7. Enter the project path.
   
      This can be a relative path, absolute path,
      or empty for the current folder. Note that
      a project folder named test will also
      be created inside this folder.
   
   Path: samples
   
       1 file copied.
       ...
&lt;/code&gt;

== Adding and running the new project ==

=== Windows ===

* Add the Visual Studio project to the existing gameplay.sln solution;
* Set the &quot;gameplay&quot; project as a dependency (right-click on the new project, click &quot;Project Dependencies…&quot;, and select the &quot;gameplay&quot; project)
* Build and run.

=== Mac ===

=== Linux ===

* Open the terminal and navigate to the &quot;build&quot; folder contained inside your new project folder.

* Run the following commands:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
cmake ..
make
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

* Run the newly-created executable file, which will be found in &lt;code&gt;[projectname]/build/bin/linux/&lt;/code&gt;.

      <comment>/* Using binary bundles */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter provides an overview of some of the fundamental design principles underlying the gameplay3d framework.

== Managing shared objects ==

Unlike certain other programming languages (e.g. Java), C++ does not have any automatic garbage collection. Accordingly, it is necessary to keep track of dynamically created objects and delete them when necessary. Difficulties can arise when more than one part of the code refers to the same object, i.e. when there are 'shared objects'.

For example, consider the following pseudocode:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// Create a boss enemy and aim the camera towards it
GameObject* pBossEnemy = new BossEnemy;
cutSceneCamera.setTarget(pBossEnemy);

//... some code ...

// Some time later, the boss is destroyed
delete pBossEnemy;

//... some more code ...

// Ooops, cutSceneCamera now references a dangling pointer!
cutSceneCamera.updateOrientation();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Gameplay3d's approach to dealing with this problem is to use '''reference counting'''. The basic aim is to ensure that (i) an object is not destroyed while any part of the code is still using it; and (ii) once the object is no longer being used, it is deleted. This aim is achieved by storing a reference count inside the object. Every time the object is shared, the reference count is incremented, and every time a part of the code stops using the object, the reference count is decremented. When the count reaches 0, the object is no longer being referred to by anyone and is therefore destroyed.

=== The Ref base class ===

Reference counting is implemented in gameplay3d by using classes which inherit from the '''Ref''' class. The relevant parts of the source code (which can be found in its complete form, together with comments, in Ref.h and Ref.cpp) are as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Ref
{
public:
    void addRef(); // Increments the reference count
    void release(); // Decrements the reference count
    unsigned int getRefCount() const;

protected:
    Ref();
    Ref(const Ref&amp; copy);
    virtual ~Ref();

private:
    unsigned int _refCount;
}

void Ref::addRef() {
    ++_refCount;
}

void Ref::release() {
    if ((--_refCount) &lt;= 0) {
        delete this;
    }
}

unsigned int Ref::getRefCount() const {
    return _refCount;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

=== Creating objects in practice ===

In most cases, you will not need to call addRef() directly. Instead, you will create objects by calling static functions whose names begin with create* (e.g. ''Mesh::createMesh()'', ''Font::create()'', ''Scene::create()'' etc.). These functions return an instance of a class inheriting from Ref, with the reference count for that object set to one. Accordingly, it is necessary to call release() on the object when it is no longer being used. Usually, the best way to do this is to make use of gameplay3d's '''SAFE_RELEASE()''' macro, which both calls release() and sets the pointer to NULL.

You should also be aware that certain gameplay3d functions which take an object as an argument increase that object's reference count. Intuitively, this is because the object being passed in as an argument is now being shared with another part of the code. Examples of this are:
* the '''Model::create()''' method, which takes a '''Mesh*''' as a parameter. (This returns a pointer to a Model with a reference count of one and also increases the reference count of the Mesh by one.)
* the '''Texture::Sampler::create()''' method, which takes a '''Texture*''' as a parameter; and
* the '''setMaterial()''' member function in the '''Model''' class, which takes a '''Material*''' as a parameter.

An very simple example (taken from CreateSceneSample.cpp in the sample-browser project) showing how gameplay3d's reference counting system works in practice is as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

void CreateSceneSample::initialize()
{
    // Create the font for drawing the framerate.
    _font = Font::create(&quot;res/ui/arial.gpb&quot;);

    // Create a new empty scene.
    _scene = Scene::create();

    // ... omitted code setting up camera and lights ...

    // Create the cube mesh and model.
    Mesh* cubeMesh = createCubeMesh();
    Model* cubeModel = Model::create(cubeMesh);
    
    // Release the mesh because the model now holds a reference to it.
    SAFE_RELEASE(cubeMesh);

    // ... omitted code setting up the material for the cube model ...

    // Add a node to the scene, then attach the cube model to it
    _cubeNode = _scene-&gt;addNode(&quot;cube&quot;);
    _cubeNode-&gt;setModel(cubeModel);
    _cubeNode-&gt;rotateY(MATH_PIOVER4);

   // Release the model because the node now holds a reference to it.
    SAFE_RELEASE(cubeModel);
}

void CreateSceneSample::finalize()
{
    SAFE_RELEASE(_font);
    SAFE_RELEASE(_scene);
}

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

=== Using the DebugMem build configuration to avoid memory leaks ===

Finally, it is worth noting that gameplay3d's '''DebugMem''' build configuration provides a useful way of checking whether you have successfully remembered to deallocate all Ref objects. On exiting your program, any failures to deallocate Ref objects will be reported in the Debug Output window, as well as any other memory leaks arising from your code.

== Data-driven design ==

A basic principle underlying data-driven design is that '''code is a poor location for behavior that needs to be changed frequently'''. One way of dealing with this problem is to move game behavior out of code and into data files. This should result in a more efficient process for tweaking content and gameplay.

Gameplay3d supports data-driven design by allowing certain game configuration data to be loaded from text-based data files. These files include:

* ''game.config'' file(s) for high-level settings such as screen resolution, Lua script settings, default UI theme etc.;
* ''.scene files'' for overall scene layout (these will generally contain cross-references to other data files);
* ''.physics'' files for configuration of physics objects;
* ''.material'' files for configuration of materials;
* ''.theme'' files for UI themes;
* ''.form'' files for UI forms (which use a UI theme);
* ''.animation'' files for animation details (e.g. configuration of named animation &quot;clips&quot; which can be used in-game); and
* ''.lua'' forms for Lua scripts.

More detail regarding the structure of these data files, and how to write your own, will be given in the chapters regarding the subject matter to which they relate.

== Platform abstraction ==

The basic idea behind platform abstraction is, as far as possible, to '''separate platform-independent code from platform-specific code in order to maximize code re-use'''.

Gameplay3d is designed so that it uses platform-specific code '''only''' where necessary. Obvious areas in which platform-specific code is required include:

* window creation;
* OpenGL initialization;
* the message pump; and
* input handling.

However, because gameplay3d either handles these tasks automatically, or allows the user to handle these tasks through its platform-abstracted API, '''it is generally possible to avoid using platform-specific code in your own projects'''.

To the extent that you wish to review (or amend) the platform-specific code, most of this is tucked away neatly in the following source code files:

* gameplay-main-android.cpp
* gameplay-main-blackberry.cpp
* gameplay-main-ios.mm
* gameplay-main-linux.cpp
* gameplay-main-macosx.mm
* gameplay-main-windows.cpp
* PlatformAndroid.cpp
* PlatformBlackberry.cpp
* PlatformiOS.mm
* PlatformLinux.cpp
* PlatformMacOSX.mm
* PlatformWindows.cpp

== Creating and importing assets ==

=== Overview ===

While gameplay3d does not currently include any GUI-based content creation tools (other than the particle editor in the &quot;sample-particles&quot; project), it supports various existing industry-standard file formats, which means that you can create assets in existing content creation packages and import these into your gameplay3d project.

Certain assets can be imported directly into gameplay3d, whereas other formats are required to be converted into the documented gameplay bundle format (.gpb) using the gameplay-encoder executable. The reason for requiring this extra conversion step is that, although these formats are popular and have the widest support in tooling options, they are not considered efficient runtime formats. Converting them into binary format ensures that the assets will load as quickly as possible and at the highest quality within the platform hardware limitations.

The supported external file formats which '''do not''' require conversion into '''.gbp''' format are as follows:

* '''.ogg''' for audio;
* '''.wav''' for audio (although it is recommended that the the compressed .ogg format be used when releasing your game title);
* '''.png''' for image files;
* '''.dds''' and '''.pvr''' for compressed textures; and
* '''.lua''' for Lua source code.

The supported external file formats which '''do''' require conversion are as follows::

* '''.fbx''' (Autodesk) for creating 3D scenes and models; and
* '''.ttf''' (TrueType Font) for fonts.

=== Converting assets into .gbp format ===

Assets can be converted into .gbp format using the gameplay-encoder tool. The gameplay-encoder executable tool comes pre-built for Windows 7, MacOS X and Linux. They can be found in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;gameplay-root&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt; folders. The general usage is:

Usage: &lt;code&gt;gameplay-encoder [options] &lt;file(s)&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

You can display a list of the supported options by running gameplay-encoder with no arguments.

=== Building gameplay-encoder ===

Even though the gameplay-encoder tool comes pre-built, you may want to customize it and build it again yourself. To build the gameplay-encoder project, open the gameplay-encoder project in Visual Studio or XCode and build the executable.

=== The content pipeline ===

The content pipeline for fonts and scenes works as follows:

* Identify all required TrueType fonts and FBX scene files.
* Run the gameplay-encoder executable passing in the font or scene file path and optional parameters to produce a gameplay binary version for the file (.gpb).
* Bundle your game and include the gameplay binary file(s) as a binary game asset.
* Load any binary game assets using the &lt;code&gt;gameplay::Bundle&lt;/code&gt; class.

=== Using binary bundles ===

Use the &lt;code&gt;gameplay::Bundle&lt;/code&gt; class from your C++ game source code to load your encoded binary files as bundles. The class offers methods to load both fonts and scenes. Scenes are loaded as a hierarchical structure of nodes, with various entities attached to them. These entities include things like mesh geometry or groups of meshes, and cameras and lights. The &lt;code&gt;gameplay::Bundle&lt;/code&gt; class also has methods to filter only the parts of a scene that you want to load.

== Overview of the scene graph ==

A '''scene graph''' is a data structure that defines the spatial (and often also logical) relationship of a graphical scene for efficient management and rendering of graphics data.

It is typically represented as a hierarchical structure, which contains a collection of nodes including a top-level &quot;root&quot; node, a number of '''parent nodes''' each of which can have any number of '''child nodes''', and a set of '''leaf nodes''' each of which has no child nodes and which therefore serve together as the bottom layer of the tree.

In gameplay3d:

* the scene graph is represented by the '''Scene''' class;
* instances of the '''Node''' class can be attached to a scene object;
* further instances of the '''Node''' class can be added as children of existing nodes; and
* various other attachments (such as models, lights, cameras, physics objects) can be attached to any node; and
* an operation performed on a parent node affects all of its children.

[[File:Gameplay3d scene graph.png|thumb|A schematic diagram of a gameplay3d scene graph]]

An example of creating a scene, adding two nodes and attaching a camera and a light programatically (i.e. not using a .scene file) is as follows. The example is taken from &quot;CreateSceneSample.cpp&quot; in the &quot;sample-browser&quot; project:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

// In your game class's initialize() method

// Create a new empty scene.
_scene = Scene::create();

// Create the camera.
Camera* camera = Camera::createPerspective(45.0f, getAspectRatio(), 1.0f, 10.0f);
Node* cameraNode = _scene-&gt;addNode(&quot;camera&quot;);

// Attach the camera to a node. This determines the position of the camera.
cameraNode-&gt;setCamera(camera);

// Make this the active camera of the scene.
_scene-&gt;setActiveCamera(camera);
SAFE_RELEASE(camera);

// Move the camera to look at the origin.
cameraNode-&gt;translate(0, 1, 5);
cameraNode-&gt;rotateX(MATH_DEG_TO_RAD(-11.25f));

// Create a white light.
Light* light = Light::createDirectional(0.75f, 0.75f, 0.75f);
Node* lightNode = _scene-&gt;addNode(&quot;light&quot;);
lightNode-&gt;setLight(light);

// Release the light because the node now holds a reference to it.
SAFE_RELEASE(light);

// Rotate the camera downwards.
lightNode-&gt;rotateX(MATH_DEG_TO_RAD(-45.0f));

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Generally, when making a game in gameplay3d:
* you will begin by loading/building a large scene representing all the components needed in the game level. This is done once during &lt;code&gt;Game::initialize()&lt;/code&gt;;
* during each call to the &lt;code&gt;Game::update()&lt;/code&gt; method, your code will update changes to the nodes, and attached components, based on events such as user input;
* during each call to the &lt;code&gt;Game::render()&lt;/code&gt; method, your code will traverse the scene and render the parts in the scene that are visible from scene's active camera; and
* on exit, the &lt;code&gt;Game::finalize()&lt;/code&gt; method will be called, during which you will release any outstanding dynamically-allocated resources (see [[../gameplay3d_Design_Concepts#Managing_shared_objects]]).

== Nodes ==

The following components can be attached to the &lt;code&gt;gameplay::Node&lt;/code&gt; class:

&lt;table border=1&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Components which can be attached to the &lt;code&gt;gameplay::Node&lt;/code&gt; class&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Component&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;gameplay::Model&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Used to represent the mesh/geometry in the scene.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;gameplay::Camera&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Used to represent a view/perspective into the scene.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;gameplay::Light&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Used to hold lighting information that can affect how a Model is rendered.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;gameplay::PhysicsCollisionObject&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Used to define the basic physics dynamics that will be simulated.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;gameplay::ParticleEmitter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Used to represent smoke, steam, fire and other atmospheric effects.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;gameplay::Terrain&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Used to represent a height map based terrain.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;gameplay::AudioSource&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Used to represent a source where audio is being played from.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;gameplay::Form&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Used to represent a user interface that can be in a scene.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Creating Scene Assets in Modeling Software ==
You can use any modeling software capable of creating FBX files. Support for Collada files was removed in gameplay 2.0.0 owing to the relatively poor level of support for the format by some 3d modelling packages, but may be added back in future if adoption improves.
=== Creating Scene Assets with Maya ===
=== Creating Scene Assets with Blender ===
Blender can export FBX (and Collada) files. We recommend using at least version 2.70. The upcoming version 2.71 has an improved FBX export capability including tangents and binormals.
==== Exporting an FBX file ====
Blender has a built in FBX exporter. Version 2.70 works. Do take note of these two important notes, particularly if you have animations:
* Blender and Gameplay have a different up axis. When exporting FBX file, select the up axis to be  Y axis and the forward axis to be Z axis. Without this animation will be totally distorted
* The FBX exporter can create empty animation channel. You have to use the &lt;code&gt;-oa&lt;/code&gt; option to transform the file for gameplay

=== Encoding your asset to .GPB ===
Now that your model has been exported to a known format, there is one more step to complete in order to get it ready for use. Your model needs to be converted from the exported interchange format .FBX into an efficient binary bundle format that the gameplay framework can use. To do this run gameplay-encoder with the required parameters.

==== Encoding from FBX (.FBX) ====

To encode your FBX scene file(.fbx) into the gameplay binary format (.gpb), run the following command:

 gameplay-encoder -oa -g HIKCharacterNode_boy_Reference animations &quot;../../gameplay-samples/sample-character/res/boy.fbx&quot;

Let's take a look at some of the extra parameters passed into the encoder.

The &lt;code&gt;-g&lt;/code&gt; parameter says that you want to group all animations on HIKCharacterNode_boy_reference, and its children node into an animation called 'animations'. The  &lt;code&gt;-oa&lt;/code&gt; option says that you want optimize the animations. This is important if you import complex file from Blender as it otherwise may lead to unreadable files due to empty animation channels.

This encoding is necessary because the FBX, or, in the case of fonts, TrueType files are really just interchange formats, and are huge ascii files that are not recommended for runtime format. Encoding them packs them into a more efficient binary bundle and only takes the data that is needed by the gameplay framework.

== Working with .scene files ==

In order to assemble a scene in gameplay3d using a .scene file, there are two main steps:

* create a .scene text file describing your scene; and
* load the scene in your game code by calling the &lt;code&gt;Scene::load()&lt;/code&gt; static method.

=== Creating your .scene file ===

=== Loading the scene in your game code ===

The scene file can be loaded into your game as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// Load the scene
_scene = Scene::load(&quot;res/myscene.scene&quot;);

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Handling input in your gameplay3d game is easy - the &lt;code&gt;gameplay::Game&lt;/code&gt; class, from which your game inherits, contains a number of &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; methods which are called whenever there is any input to be handled, so all you need to do is to override these methods in your game.

&lt;code&gt;Game::mouseEvent()&lt;/code&gt; is called when a mouse event occurs. The function signature for the mouseEvent() method is as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
virtual bool mouseEvent(Mouse::MouseEvent evt, int x, int y, int wheelDelta);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

where:
* &lt;code&gt;evt&lt;/code&gt; represents the mouse event that occurred and is one of the following &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; values defined in Mouse.h:
** &lt;code&gt;MOUSE_PRESS_LEFT_BUTTON&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;MOUSE_RELEASE_LEFT_BUTTON&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;MOUSE_PRESS_MIDDLE_BUTTON&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;MOUSE_RELEASE_MIDDLE_BUTTON&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;MOUSE_PRESS_RIGHT_BUTTON&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;MOUSE_RELEASE_RIGHT_BUTTON&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;MOUSE_MOVE&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;MOUSE_WHEEL&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is the x position of the mouse in pixels. (Left edge is zero.)
* &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is the y position of the mouse in pixels. (Top edge is zero.)
* &lt;code&gt;wheelDelta&lt;/code&gt; is the number of mouse wheel ticks. (Positive is up/forward, negative is down/backward.)

Mouse events that are not consumed will be interpreted as a touch event. You can consume a mouse event by overriding &lt;code&gt;Game::mouseEvent()&lt;/code&gt; and returning true. This gives you the option to uniquely handle mouse events from touch events. &lt;code&gt;Game::mouseEvent()&lt;/code&gt; returns false by default.

Note that some mobile devices can use a Bluetooth mouse.

You can enable or disable &quot;mouse capture&quot; using the &lt;code&gt;Game::setMouseCaptured()&lt;/code&gt; method, which takes a boolean value as an argument. On platforms that support a mouse, when mouse capture is enabled, the platform cursor will be hidden and the mouse will be warped to the center of the screen. While mouse capture is enabled, all mouse move events will then be delivered as deltas instead of absolute positions.

&lt;code&gt;Game::setCursorVisible()&lt;/code&gt;, which also takes a boolean value, can be used to show (true) or hide (false) the mouse cursor.

== Keyboard ==

&lt;code&gt;Game::keyEvent()&lt;/code&gt; is called when a keyboard event occurs. The function signature for the &lt;code&gt;keyEvent()&lt;/code&gt; method is as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
virtual void keyEvent(Keyboard::KeyEvent evt, int key);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

where:
* &lt;code&gt;evt&lt;/code&gt; represents the key event that occurred and is one of the following enum values defined in Keyboard.h:
** &lt;code&gt;KEY_PRESS&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;KEY_RELEASE&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;KEY_CHAR&lt;/code&gt; - this is used for textual characters and is therefore not triggered by pressing keys such as &lt;code&gt;Ctrl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Shift&lt;/code&gt;, the arrow keys, &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;End&lt;/code&gt; etc.
* &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; - If &lt;code&gt;evt&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;KEY_PRESS&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;KEY_RELEASE&lt;/code&gt; then key is the key code from &lt;code&gt;Keyboard::Key&lt;/code&gt;. If evt is &lt;code&gt;KEY_CHAR&lt;/code&gt; then key is the unicode value of the character.

A full list of the different key codes in the &lt;code&gt;Keyboard::Key&lt;/code&gt; enum can be found at [https://blackberry.github.io/GamePlay/api/classgameplay_1_1_keyboard.html#af3cf4d9d49adf589737a724e77938c19 this] page in the gameplay3d API reference, or in the Keyboard.h source file.

You can call &lt;code&gt;Game::displayKeyboard()&lt;/code&gt;, which takes a boolean value, to show (true) or hide (false) a virtual keyboard for platforms that support it.

== Touch ==

=== Basics ===

&lt;code&gt;Game::touchEvent()&lt;/code&gt; is called when a touch event occurs. The function signature for the &lt;code&gt;touchEvent()&lt;/code&gt; method is as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
virtual void touchEvent(Touch::TouchEvent evt, int x, int y, unsigned int contactIndex);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

where:
* &lt;code&gt;evt&lt;/code&gt; represents the touch event that occurred and is one of the following enum values defined in Touch.h:
** &lt;code&gt;TOUCH_PRESS&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;TOUCH_RELEASE&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;TOUCH_MOVE&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is the x position of the touch in pixels. (Left edge is zero.)
* &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is the y position of the touch in pixels. (Top edge is zero.)
* &lt;code&gt;contactIndex&lt;/code&gt; is used to differentiate multiple touch contacts where multi-touch is enabled, and represents the order of occurrence for multiple touch contacts starting at zero. However, do not assume that the &lt;code&gt;contactIndex&lt;/code&gt; values are sequential.

Some platforms may allow you to touch outside the bounds of the screen, so negative &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; values are possible.

You can enable multi-touch using &lt;code&gt;Game::setMultiTouch()&lt;/code&gt;, which takes a boolean value. The default is disabled (false).

=== Gestures ===

Some platforms support gestures. &lt;code&gt;Game::isGestureSupported()&lt;/code&gt; can be used to determine which gestures are supported.

The gestures you can check for are defined in the &lt;code&gt;GestureEvent&lt;/code&gt; enum in Gesture.h and are as follows:
* &lt;code&gt;GESTURE_TAP&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;GESTURE_SWIPE&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;GESTURE_PINCH&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;GESTURE_LONG_TAP&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;GESTURE_DRAG&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;GESTURE_DROP&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;GESTURE_ANY_SUPPORTED&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Game::registerGesture()&lt;/code&gt;, which takes a GestureEvent value as an argument, is used to register for a type of gesture.

Once a gesture is registered, you will receive callbacks via the following virtual methods. See the function declarations in Game.h for details of the parameters:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
virtual void gestureTapEvent(int x, int y);
virtual void gestureSwipeEvent(int x, int y, int direction);
virtual void gesturePinchEvent(int x, int y, float scale);
virtual void gestureLongTapEvent(int x, int y, float duration);
virtual void gestureDragEvent(int x, int y);
virtual void gestureDropEvent(int x, int y);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Materials, Techniques, Passes and Effects ==

As you may recall, a '''Model''' in gameplay3d is a specific instance of a '''Mesh''', which consists of one or more '''MeshParts'''.

In order to render a &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; in gameplay3d, each of the &lt;code&gt;MeshParts&lt;/code&gt; in that &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; must have an associated '''Material'''. Since each &lt;code&gt;MeshPart&lt;/code&gt; can have a different &lt;code&gt;Material&lt;/code&gt;, this allows different parts of the &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; to be rendered in a different way. For example, if you have a character that is wearing armor, you could apply a metallic material to that armor while applying simple texturing to the remaining parts of the &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt;.

A &lt;code&gt;Material&lt;/code&gt; contains one or more '''Technique(s)'''. The idea behind having &lt;code&gt;Techniques&lt;/code&gt; is to permit the easy switching of render techniques at runtime, without setting an entirely new material on the &lt;code&gt;MeshPart&lt;/code&gt;. As an example, you may have a &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; to which you apply a bump mapping &lt;code&gt;Technique&lt;/code&gt; when it is near the camera, but you switch to a simple texturing &lt;code&gt;Technique&lt;/code&gt; when it is further away in order to improve performance.

Each &lt;code&gt;Technique&lt;/code&gt; can have one or more '''Pass(es)''', each of which corresponds to a single OpenGL draw call. In order to use multipass rendering techniques, you would add more than one &lt;code&gt;Pass&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;Technique&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;Passes&lt;/code&gt; contain:
* an '''Effect''', which basically represents an GLSL shader program (i.e. vertex and fragment shader);
* various information regarding the render state (e.g. the blend function to be applied, whether depth test is enabled etc.);
* a '''VertexAttributeBinding''', which either encapsulates (or simulates, if you hardware doesn't support it) an OpenGL VAO (vertex attribute object), and sets out how the &lt;code&gt;Mesh's&lt;/code&gt; data relates to the inputs in the GLSL shader program.

Phew! That may seem like a long list of things to remember, but you should find that this system provides a lot of flexibility for arranging your rendering behavior in a neat and orderly fashion.

== Creating materials ==

== Setting material parameters ==

== Working with the built-in shaders ==

== Help! I can't see my model... ==

Here are some common reasons why you may not be able to see your model (or it shows up all in black):

* '''You have not set all the required uniforms used by your shader.''' Have you remembered to call one of the following functions for '''every''' uniform used in your shader?:
** &lt;code&gt;material-&gt;getParameter([uniformName])-&gt;setValue([uniformValue])&lt;/code&gt;;
** &lt;code&gt;material-&gt;getParameter([uniformName])-&gt;bindValue([insert arguments])&lt;/code&gt;; or
** &lt;code&gt;material-&gt;setParameterAutoBinding([uniformName], [autobinding name])&lt;/code&gt;.

* '''The mesh used in your model does not contain all the attributes (i.e. per-vertex data) required by your shader.''' If your model was generated in a 3D modelling program, did the program export all necessary per-vertex data (e.g. tangents and binormal data for bump mapping) required by your shader? Note that the gameplay-encoder can generate tangent and binormal data for an FBX model that does not contain them by using the &lt;code&gt;-tb&lt;/code&gt; option. 

* '''Your mesh data is corrupt.''' This may be a problem if you have created your mesh procedurally, or if there is a bug in the FBX exporter in your 3D modelling program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==

Gameplay3d supports 3D audio (using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openal OpenAL], the specification for which can be found [http://www.openal.org/documentation/openal-1.1-specification.pdf here]). The basic principles behind using sound in gameplay3d are as follows:

* Your game can have one or more &lt;code&gt;AudioSource(s)&lt;/code&gt;, which can, if desired, be attached to a &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; and positioned in 3D space;
* Non-positional audio, such as music, is achieved by creating and playing an &lt;code&gt;AudioSource&lt;/code&gt; which is not attached to a &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt;; and
* Your game has one &lt;code&gt;AudioListener&lt;/code&gt; which receives the sound from the &lt;code&gt;AudioSources&lt;/code&gt;. By default, the &lt;code&gt;AudioListener&lt;/code&gt; is bound to the active camera of the scene, but can be attached to another camera or positioned manually if desired.

== Supported audio formats ==

Gameplay3d currently supports the following formats:

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg '''.ogg''' vorbis audio], which is a free and open-source ''compressed'' audio format specification; and
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wav '''.wav''' files], whichis a Microsoft and IBM ''uncompressed'' audio format.

Using .ogg files is recommended for release versions of your game, as they are compressed and therefore use less memory.

== Creating an AudioSource ==

&lt;code&gt;AudioSources&lt;/code&gt; can be created from an audio sample file as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
AudioSource* wheelsSound = AudioSource::create(&quot;res/explosion.wav&quot;);
AudioSource* backgroundMusic = AudioSource::create(&quot;res/music.ogg&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;AudioSources&lt;/code&gt; can also be created and configured from a &lt;code&gt;.audio&lt;/code&gt; file - see below for further details.

== Positioning the AudioSource ==

An &lt;code&gt;AudioSource&lt;/code&gt; can be bound to a Node in your scene using &lt;code&gt;Node::setAudioSource()&lt;/code&gt;. The position of the audio source is automatically updated when the node is transformed.

For example, we could use the following example to position an &lt;code&gt;AudioSource&lt;/code&gt; emitting a bird sound:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// Create and configure the AudioSource
AudioSource* audioSource = AudioSource::create(&quot;res/birdsound.ogg&quot;);
assert(audioSource);
audioSource-&gt;setLooped(true);

// Create a new node and set the AudioSource
Node* birdNode = _scene-&gt;addNode(&quot;bird&quot;);
birdNode-&gt;setAudioSource(audioSource);
SAFE_RELEASE(audioSource);

// Position the node (high up in the trees), add it to the scene and play the sound
birdNode-&gt;setTranslation(10.0f, 100.0f, 30.0f);
_scene-&gt;addNode(birdNode);
birdNode-&gt;getAudioSource()-&gt;play();
SAFE_RELEASE(birdNode);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

== Playing and controlling the AudioSource ==

To play an audio source:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
audioSource-&gt;play();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Other member functions controlling playback are &lt;code&gt;pause()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;resume()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;stop()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rewind()&lt;/code&gt;.

We can ''configure'' the sound as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
audioSource-&gt;setLooped(true); // - Play the sound in a loop.

audioSource-&gt;setGain(0.5f);   // - Set the gain/volume of the audio source. 1.0 means that the sound is unattenuated.
                              //   Gain larger than one (i.e. amplification) is permitted for source and listener.
                              //   However, the implementation is free to clamp the total gain (effective gain per-source
                              //   multiplied by the listener gain) to one to prevent overflow.

audioSource-&gt;setPitch(2.0f);  // - 1.0 equals identity. Each reduction by 50 percent equals a pitch shift of -12
                              //   semitones (one octave reduction). Each doubling equals a pitch shift of 12
                              //   semitones (one octave increase). Zero is not a legal value.

audioSource-&gt;setVelocity(1.0f, 0.0f, 15.0f);   // - Velocity is taken into account by the OpenAL driver to synthesize the
                                               //   Doppler effect perceived by the listener for each source, based on the
                                               //   velocity of both source and listener (and the OpenAL Doppler-related
                                               //   parameters).
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

== Positioning the AudioListener manually ==

The &lt;code&gt;AudioListener&lt;/code&gt; can be positioned manually (in this case at the scene's origin) as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
AudioListener::getInstance()-&gt;setCamera(NULL);
AudioListener::getInstance()-&gt;setPosition(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;AudioListener&lt;/code&gt; can be attached to a specific camera (e.g where multiple viewpoints are onscreen simultaneously) as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
AudioListener::getInstance()-&gt;setCamera(mainCamera);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

== .audio files ==

The following example illustrates how to set all of the AudioSource properties using a .audio file.

Add the following in your &lt;code&gt;.cpp&lt;/code&gt; file:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
AudioSource* source = AudioSource::create(&quot;res/game.audio#fireball&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Add the following in your &lt;code&gt;game.audio&lt;/code&gt; file:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
audio fireball
{
    path = res/audio/fireball.wav
    looped = false
    gain = 0.7
    pitch = 0.5
    velocity = 0.5 0.0 1.0
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

      <comment>/* Drawing text with a Font */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Importing fonts into gameplay3d ==

Gameplay3d supports TrueType fonts, but these must first be converted to a gameplay bundle file (see [[../gameplay3d_Design_Concepts#Creating_and_importing_assets]]) before use in your project.

Use the following steps to import a font into your project:

* Find or create a TrueType font file (.ttf).
* Pass the .ttf file to the gameplay-encoder command line tool and specify the size you want. A pre-compiled version of gameplay-encoder is available under GamePlay/bin:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
gameplay-encoder -s 28 myfont.ttf
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
* The gameplay-encoder will output a .gpb file.
* Copy the .gpb file to your game's resource directory. (The .ttf file does not need to be included.)
* Import your font into your project as follows:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// Create a font from the gpb file
Font* _font = Font::create(&quot;res/myfont.gpb&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

== Drawing text with a Font ==

To render using a font:
* first, call &lt;code&gt;Font::start()&lt;/code&gt; on your font instance to start text drawing;
* second, call &lt;code&gt;Font::drawText()&lt;/code&gt; to draw some text at a defined location. There are four different overloads for this function, the parameters for which can be found in Font.h; and
* finally, call &lt;code&gt;Font::start()&lt;/code&gt; to finish text batching for the relevant font and render all drawn text.

Here is an example of loading a font and using it to render the game's frame rate on the screen.

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void MyGame::initialize()
{
    // Create a font from the gpb file
    _font = Font::create(&quot;res/myfont.gpb&quot;);
}

void MyGame::render(float elapsedTime)
{
    // Clear the frame buffer
    clear(CLEAR_COLOR_DEPTH, Vector4(0, 0, 0, 1), 1.0f, 0);

    // Draw the text at position 20,20 using red color
    _font-&gt;start();
    char text[1024];
    sprintf(text, &quot;FPS:%d&quot;, Game::getFrameRate());
    _font-&gt;drawText(text, 20, 20, Vector4(1, 0, 0, 1), _font-&gt;getSize());
    _font-&gt;finish();
}

void MyGame::finalize()
{
    // Use built-in macros to clean up our resources.
    SAFE_RELEASE(_font);
}

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

== Batching ==

It is possible to call &lt;code&gt;Font::drawText()&lt;/code&gt; multiple times between &lt;code&gt;Font::start()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Font::finish()&lt;/code&gt; in order to draw different text in different places with the same font.

== High-quality text using distance fields ==

Since version 2.0.0, gameplay3d supports distance field fonts. You can read more about distance field fonts in the Valve paper [http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf Improved Alpha-Tested Magnification for Vector Textures and Special Effects] but, in short, distance fonts look a lot better than bitmap fonts, particularly at high magnification!

To create a distance field font, use the &lt;code&gt;-f:d&lt;/code&gt; option parameter when running gameplay-encoder, e.g.:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
gameplay-encoder -s 50 -f:d myfont.ttf
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==

The &lt;code&gt;gameplay::ParticleEmitter&lt;/code&gt; class defines all the information needed to simulate and render a system of particles. Particle emitters can be used to represent a multitude of visual effects, such as smoke, steam, fire and explosions; and other atmospheric effects, such as rain and lightning. Once created, the emitter can be set on a &lt;code&gt;gameplay::Node&lt;/code&gt; in order to follow an object, or it can be placed within a scene.

== Creating a particle emitter ==

Use the &lt;code&gt;ParticleEmitter::create()&lt;/code&gt; method to create a particle emitter.

There are 3 overloads of this function, but the one which you are likely to use most commonly is the overload for creating a particle emitter from a .particle file, which has the following function signature:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
static ParticleEmitter* create (const char *url);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

If you want to create a particle emitter programmatically, you can use the following overload, which creates an uninitialized &lt;code&gt;ParticleEmitter&lt;/code&gt;. The new particle emitter can then be configured using member functions in the [https://blackberry.github.io/GamePlay/api/classgameplay_1_1_particle_emitter.html#a3c2a530ca2dd1100be4cabd9e900c02e &lt;code&gt;ParticleEmitter&lt;/code&gt;] class.

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
static ParticleEmitter* create (const char *texturePath, TextureBlending textureBlending, unsigned int particleCountMax);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

== Controlling a particle emitter ==

== .particle files ==

The following is a commented example of a .particle file created with the &quot;sample-particles&quot; example project, which is a useful particle editor packaged with gameplay3d.

Given the number of fields which need completing in a .particle file, and because it is helpful to see a visual representation of the particle emitter while you are editing it, the &quot;sample-particles&quot; project is probably the easiest way to get started creating and configuring particle emitters.

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;

        path = smoke.png        // A path to the image to use as this ParticleEmitter's texture.

                                                  is slightly more expensive than the default cuboid domain.)

*Generally, you should prefer pre-computed mipmaps (e.g. DDS format) over runtime mipmap generation for the following reasons:
** load times are likely to be faster; and
** the quality of the mipmaps will be higher and more consistent across different GPUs.

* Use compressed texture formats (i.e. PVRTC, ATC, ETC, DXT) where possible. This reduces storage space and improves loading times, as well as saving GPU memory bandwidth, which leads to better performance.

* Use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas texture atlases] to minimize OpenGL state changes, which are costly for performance.

You can experiment with GLSL fragment shaders (and learn a few tricks from the experts) at:

* https://www.shadertoy.com/

* https://glsl.heroku.com/

Do note, however, that many of the techniques used in these shaders are too computationally expensive for real-time use in games. Nevertheless, they can be useful for getting to grips with the GLSL language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Trending Toward The Invisible: Dana Lynn===

In response to the scientific fragmentation of HCI and the blending of software engineering and human factors there is no doubt that the field is experiencing a renaissance. As we move toward more ambient technology and invisible computing the intersection between humans and computers is less oblique and more transparent. Human-centric computer interaction design is where the computer is actually interacting with humans rather than vice versa. Innovative companies such as Google are proving this theory with products like Google Glass and Google’s self driving car. These examples are seemingly light-years from the boxy calculators and clunky PC’s that are shelved in the technology archives of places like Hewlett Packard and Apple computer.

The constraints and limitations of human and computer interaction are practically non-existent if not invisible. HCI however is progressively going beyond computational thinking. 

“Computational thinking is about engaging with what the computer can and cannot do, and explicitly thinking about it.” 

“If Computational Thinking involves, for example, understanding the power and limits of digital representations, and how those serve as metaphors in thinking about other problems, then those representations have to be visible.” 

Humans no longer have to think about how they interact with computers. Computers are embedded into the fabric of our existence and have become acutely aware of the human presence. 

If companies need to rethink their approach to human centered design, then the science of HCI should undergo the same litany. With computers being complex and human needs articulated through simple gestures or interactions, the two are like oil and water. They don’t mix. Ubiquitous computing seems to be the current trend and HCI needs to catch up. Technologies that are anticipatory, responsive and adaptive to the needs of human interaction are soon to become natural in form.

===Human Meets Machine - We are the Metaphore (Eric Andren)===

Relating human to machine provides a great way to explain technologies on a level familiar to our being. It also provides a wonderful outlet for the connection of technology and nature and the expansion of technology into a direction better informed by the systems observed in nature each day.

By relating and realizing that the technologies or machines we create are more or less reverse engineered low functioning version of natural phenomenon we can allow the development of newer technologies to follow and be informed by these physical systems and increase usability.

We use metaphors in interface such as windows and other iconic representations like the file or trashcan. Metaphors are used to increase familiarity to make the user more comfortable and make the interface reach a higher level of usability. What would be more comfortable than an interface that reflected the systems we are influenced by since the moment we are conceived?

Tapping into this emotional outlet can create a marriage between human and system that reaches a level of unity provided by the phenomenon that created humanity and that we are slowly gaining a greater understanding of and infusing into our technologies.</text>

== [[Cross-Platform Game Programming with gameplay3d/Working with 2D]] and many other new pages created ==

Hi, I've noticed all of the new pages you've created.  Here on Wikibooks it is best not to create new pages unless you are going to add content.  Empty pages with just a few headings is not useful for readers.  It is better to leave pages as red links until somebody is ready to create the page.  The pages you created may be deleted within the next 7 days unless content is added.

{{Use categories}}

{{closed|reason=No interest after more than one year.  only one user bothered to make a contribution.  Closed as not done}}

This linguistic book looks at false friends (words which are similar in two languages but with a different meaning) of Slavic languages.  It dates from 2006 and was started earlier elsewhere before arriving on Wikibooks.  It may not be the most visually attractive book but it is pretty much complete - the only red links relate to false friends between languages which have very few speakers (Kashubian being a minor language of Poland, for example).  The book is extremely detailed and uses quite sophisticated templates.  It has also received contributions from a range of editors and anonymous editors.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:10, 14 January 2013 (UTC)
:Very sophisticated structure and content. '''support''', except I'm not too sure about the title. According to WP, a Slavist is someone who studies Slavs. Maybe the title can be changed to [[False Friends of the Slavic Languages]]?

* &lt;font size=3&gt;With a few exceptions meter stamps used in North Vietnam and South Vietnam during the Civil War (1960-1973) are indistinguishable from each other except for the town names. Accordingly we have not separated the stamps into North and South groups. Those designs known or thought to have been used exclusively in the North or the South during the War are identified in the descriptions.
* Meter stamps inscribed with the country name first appeared in 1953. For earlier issues see FRENCH INDOCHINA.
* Some post-war identification numbers and prefixes were assigned without regard to manufacturer or meter model. The numbers appear to have been assigned sequentially by town or according to some other variable.
* Many if not most of the stamps listed are from Post Office machines although there is no certain way of proving this. Those that can be verified as Post Office stamps are identified in the descriptions. No specific group for Post Office stamps was used since it would give the false impression that stamps not included are not Post Office stamps.

* The stamp are grouped according to inscription:
:: A - “VIET-NAM”
:: B - “VIET-NAM” and “CONG-HOA”
:: C - “VIET-NAM” and “BUU-CHINH” at top
:: D - “VIET-NAM” or “VIET NAM” at top, “BUU-CHINH” or “BUU CHINH” at bottom
:: E - “BUU-CHINH” at top, “VIET NAM” or “VIETNAM” at bottom 
:: F - Franks without country identification

      <text xml:space="preserve">Special relativity is OK in un-accelerated reference frames.  But it does not apply in accelerated reference frames.  And we saw that there are difficulties with the way gravity effects light that indicate the curved nature of space time.

We need to consider in general how to convert between reference frames.  This theory is called tensor calculus.

In general tensor calculus applies in ''N'' dimensional space.  The formulas apply in ''N'' dimensional space, but it is hard to imagine ''N'' dimensional space.  By setting up the theory, we do not actually have to.  The mathematics can do the work, and we can think in whatever spaces we are comfortable with.

==Converting between co-ordinate systems==

Suppose there are two co-ordinate systems ''x'' and ''y''.  Then each point in space may be identified in either co-ordinate system.  Then ''y'' is a function of ''x''.

: &lt;math&gt;x = x(y)&lt;/math&gt;

Or in components,
: &lt;math&gt;x^\mu = x^\mu(y)&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider a small displacement vector &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt;.
: &lt;math&gt;dx = dx(y)&lt;/math&gt;

Or,
: &lt;math&gt;dx^\mu = dx\mu(y)&lt;/math&gt;

Then calculus tells us that,
: &lt;math&gt;dx^\mu = \sum_\nu \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial y^\nu} dy^\nu&lt;/math&gt;

The displacement vector &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; is a direction in the co-ordinate system.  Now suppose that there was a force being applied in that direction, or the wind was blowing in that direction.  All these vectors are called contra-variant vectors and they transform in the same way as a displacement vector.

So suppose there is contra variant vector ''V'' (a vector that represents a magnitude and direction at a point in space).  Its co-ordinates in the ''x'' system are represented by, &lt;math&gt;V_x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; and in the ''y'' system by, &lt;math&gt;V_y^\nu&lt;/math&gt; and,
: &lt;math&gt;V_x^\mu = \sum_\nu \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial y^\nu} V_y^\nu&lt;/math&gt;

==Interaction of multiple vectors==

Suppose there now two contra variant vectors ''A'' and ''B'' interacting together to form a matrix where the components are multiplied.
: &lt;math&gt;A_x^\mu B_x^\nu = \sum_{\alpha,\beta} \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial y^\alpha} \frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial y^\beta} A_y^\alpha B_y^\beta&lt;/math&gt;

Then the product is called a contra variant tensor of rank 2, represented by,
:&lt;math&gt;T_x^{\mu \nu} = A_x^\mu B_x^\nu &lt;/math&gt;

and,
: &lt;math&gt;T_x^{\mu \nu} = \sum_{\alpha,\beta} \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial y^\alpha} \frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial y^\beta} T_y^{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

==Einstein summation convention==

The Einstein summation convention is to drop the the summation symbol when there is a repeated index that appears where one term is a multiplier, and one term is a divisor.  Later this definition will be extended to co-variant vectors.

So the above tensor transformation may be written,
: &lt;math&gt;T_x^{\mu \nu} = \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial y^\alpha} \frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial y^\beta} T_y^{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

This notation works because the distributive law allows us to move all the summation to the start.  For example,
:&lt;math&gt;(\sum_i m_i) (\sum_j n_j) = \sum_{i, j} m_i n_i &lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Developing a researchable question is one of the tasks a researcher encounters when initiating a research project. Both, unanswered issues in current clinical practice or when experiences dictate alternative therapies may provoke an investigator to formulate a clinical research question. The PICO method is widely used for clinical research questions (population, intervention, control, and outcomes) criteria in framing a research question.
A researchable question is an uncertainty about a problem that can be challenged, examined, and analyzed
to provide useful information.[1] A successful research project depends upon how well an investigator
formulates the research question based on the problems faced in day-to-day research activities and clinical
practice. The underlying questions of a research project provide important information to decide whether
the topic is relevant, researchable, and significant. A well-formulated research question needs extreme
specificity and preciseness which guides the implementation of the project keeping in mind the
identification of variables and population of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Sorted Container Types =

Python does not provide modules like C++'s set and map data types as part of its standard library. This is a concious decision on the part of Guido, et al to preserve &quot;one obvious way to do it.&quot; Instead Python delegates this task to third-party libraries that are available on the Python Package Index. These libraries use various techniques to maintain list, dict, and set types in sorted order. Maintaining order using a specialized data structure can avoid very slow behavior (quadratic run-time) in the naive approach of editing and constantly re-sorting. Several implementations are described here.

* [http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/ Python SortedContainers Module] - Pure-Python implementation that is fast-as-C implementations. Implements sorted list, dict, and set data types. Testing includes 100% code coverage and hours of stress. Documentation includes full API reference, [http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/performance.html performance comparison], and contributing/development guidelines.
* Python rbtree Module - Provides a fast, C-implementation for dict and set data types. Based on a red-black tree implementation.
* Python treap Module - Provides a sorted dict data type. Uses a treap for implementation and improves performance using Cython.
* Python bintrees Module - Provides several tree-based implementations for dict and set data types. Fastest implementations are based on AVL and Red-Black trees. Implemented in C. Extends the conventional API to provide set operations for dict data types.
* Python banyan Module - Provides a fast, C-implementation for dict and set data types.
* Python skiplistcollections Module - Pure-Python implementation based on skip-lists providing a limited API for dict and set data types.
* Python blist Module - Provides sorted list, dict and set data types based on the &quot;blist&quot; data type, a B-tree implementation. Implemented in Python and C.

==A Note By &quot;Rahul Jaykar Ehsaas&quot;==
[[File:Rahul Jaykar Ehsaas.jpg|thumb|right|RJ Ehsaas, Indian Poet]]
&quot; A poet is a person who writes poetry. A poet's work can be literal, meaning that his work is derived from a specific event, or metaphorical, meaning that his work can take on many meanings and forms. Poets have existed since antiquity, in nearly all languages, and have produced works that vary greatly in different cultures and time periods. Throughout each civilization and language, poets have used various styles that have changed through the course of literary history, resulting in a history of poets as diverse as the literature they have produced. The English word &quot;poet&quot; is derived from the French poète, itself descended from the Latin first-declension masculine noun poeta, meaning &quot;poet&quot;. The word &quot;poetry&quot; derives from the Latin feminine noun poetria, meaning not &quot;poetry&quot; but &quot;poetess&quot;. &quot;A poet makes himself a visionary through a long, boundless, and systematized disorganization of all the senses. All forms of love, of suffering, of madness; he searches himself, he exhausts within himself all poisons, and preserves their quintessences. Unspeakable torment, where he will need the greatest faith, a superhuman strength, where he becomes all men: the great invalid, the great criminal, the great accursed—and the Supreme Scientist! For he attains the unknown! Because he has cultivated his soul, already rich, more than anyone! He attains the unknown, and, if demented, he finally loses the understanding of his visions, he will at least have seen them! So what if he is destroyed in his ecstatic flight through things unheard of, unnameable: other horrible workers will come; they will begin at the horizons where the first one has fallen!&quot;

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
[[Category:Introduction]]
Management is not a new subject. It existed since the dawn of humanity. People have been managing agriculture land, families and civilization. This subject is an interdisciplinary subject. Which simply means it is a mixture of different subjects. Managers have to worry about many things at one time. They have to worry about budgets, motivation, goals and objectives, finance and so forth. For example when the Egyptian were building the pyramid they were also following some principles of management.
This book would also be dealing with the subject of mangement but from a business organization perspective. First, we have to define what management really is.
Definition
Different authors have given different definitions. The following are some of them:-
•	Management is coordinating work activities so that they are completed efficiently and effectively with and through other people. Robbins
•	Management is the art and science of decision making and leadership. Donald J. Cough
•	To manage is to forecast, to plan, to organize, to command, to coordinate, and to control. Henry Fayol
In this manual, we would be using the following definition

The key word in the above definition is “Process “. At the end of the day, a manger should only focus on Processes. Unfortunately in todays time manager are more focus on results. This is because getting the right result always leads to the promotion. The problem of becoming result oriented we lose our focus on ethical issues and end up doing more harm than good. 

Understanding Process
Process is basically a sequential steps taken to achieve a goal. These sequential steps have to have two basic characteristics. They have to be effective and efficient. 
This is one of the reason a good manager has to updated so that they can improve the processes. The most important aspect about process, is that it has to be written. 
 
CHALLENGES OF PAKISTANI MANAGERS
One of the biggest challenges of Pakistani mangers is that they are trained on management theories based on western capaitalism. These theories were deisgned for a different society with different values. Pakistani society is different so there managerial style would also be different. 
If Pakistani managers have to be successful they have to develop a managerial style which reflect the society and values they live by. A perfect example was the south east asian countries. There managerial style is the refelection of their religion. It is a known fact that their business processes are heavealy influenced by buddhism, shintoism and confuciousism. The question we have to ask what is the managerial style of a pakistani. 
A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO ISLAMIC MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE
By now we know that management is a process of reaching ones goals and objectives. Islamic management is quiet different from rest of the managerial theories. 
•	The criteria of success is different
•	The criteria of decsioins making is also different
•	Even the goals set by the mangers have a different criteria
Lets briefly discuss these three aspect:
Criteria of Success
As a muslims the criteria is not limited to worldly material gain. In order for a Muslim to be succesfull he/she have to perform 4 tasks. These 4 task are described in Surah Al Asr. As a Muslim he/she have to work on his Emaan, do good deeds, call people to the truth and have patience. Every Muslim have to perform these 4 task in order to become successful. 
Criteria of Decisions
Each  decsions should be according to the Quran and the sunnah. 
Goals
As a manager his/her goal should not be limited to the market orhis organization. It should also include the hereafter.


MODEL OF ISLAMIC MANAGEMENT
The managers in the Muslims world need a simple model, which they can relate to, and they should be able to find meaning in it. For this purpose a simple model is proposed in which any managerial task can be performed. The only conditioned applied is that the task in hand should be within the realm of Islam.  
The following is a graphical image of a managerial process in Islam. By understanding these four concepts any given task can be done with excellence. The following would be a brief explanation of the Islamic Management Process. 
 
1.	Shura
Shura is an Arabic word simply meaning consultation. The concept of shura is to consult with the people of knowledge. This process is highly recommended in Islam.  It brings about opinions of others when making any sort of decisions. Even the Prophet of Islam (Pease Be Upon Him) use to consult his companion, even though he uses to get divine revelation from God.  It is further claim that Quran specifically mentions that all decisions should be based on Shura. 
In an Islamic Management Process decision-making should not be dependent on a single person. Nevertheless, in fact everyone should be consulted before moving forward. With the help of Shura any organization would improve on communication. It would provide a strong sense of ownership. In addition to that it would also improve the leadership style of the mangers.
2.	Taqwa
Taqwa is one of those words that are not easily translated in the English language. It is due to this reason many translators struggle to bring about the real meaning of Taqwa. The essence of this word suggests that one should be mindful of his/her relationship with God.  Like any other relationship this relationship takes time to mature. It is sort of a long time commitment. In order to achieve Taqwa an individual have to cautious by not indulge in unlawful act, constantly asking for forgiveness from God and encouraging good acts.
Taqwa as a managerial process should be used for controlling unethical behavior in an organization. Employees should be trained that they can dodge your supervisor but you cannot dodge God, since He is aware of all seen and the unseen. This act would definitely increase the ethical standard of the organization.
3.	Itqan
This Arabic word is used to indicate the quality of work. One of the most appropriate translations of this word is to arrange and dispose of things in a scientific and artistic manner to produce the best results. Itqan is also used as a quality related term used by the Prophet of Islam (Pease Be Upon Him). It is the term word used for continually improving performances by an individual or a group in any task, activity or function. At the end of the day the concept of Itqan would discourage employees from performing careless and halfhearted activities (Pasha, 2010).
4.	Ihsaan
 Ihsaan implies of doing goodness and behaving in a goodly manner. The word also implies perfecting something or doing something in an excellent manner. Therefore, a person following the principles of Ihsaan has to aim for excellence in all dimensions. He/she have to perform their duties in an excellent manner and behave in an excellent manner when dealing with their fellow human beings.  Therefore, Ihsaan is a very comprehensive terminology. Its application affects a Muslim lifestyle ranging from to personal to professional. 
The concept of Ihsaan can really uplift the culture of any organization. This concept would instill excellent behavior among the employees.</text>

The Greek letter Delta (&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;) in its capital form means 'Change in...'.

A line above a variable(&lt;math&gt;\overline{A variable}&lt;/math&gt;) means the 'Mean' or the 'Average' (same thing).
