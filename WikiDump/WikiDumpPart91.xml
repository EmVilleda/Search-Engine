== Transwiki ==
If you are importing articles in large number from Wikipedia you should consider requesting an import so edit histories can be kept at least there is a requirement to give attribution of the content to Wikipedia (see [[Wikibooks:Requests for Import]]), you probably weren't aware of this so I'm calling your attention to this possibility.&lt;br&gt;
This post was prompted by a discussion on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance#General_relativity.2FBKL_singularity Administrative Assistance] regarding possible issues of missing attribution. That as since been solved and closed.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:53, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
::Thanks for turning my attention to this discussion. Maybe I should have requested trans-wiki but I didn't know that such exists so I mostly copied and adapted manually the text from [[:w:BKL singularity]] which was essentially made by myself (the contributions of other users are mainly in adding to the list of references). I explained in more detail in [[:w:Talk:BKL singularity]] the reasons for having two articles: one in Wikipedia and one in Wikibooks. The main reason is that the article in Wikipedia became too long and too technical. I decided to shorten and make more accessible the Wikipedia article while providing the more advanced readers with the option to look for math and proofs in the Wikibooks article which I intend to expand and give intermediate calculations. --[[User:Lantonov|Lantonov]] ([[User talk:Lantonov|talk]]) 17:20, 12 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

a distress flare is fired vertically in the aire from a boat at sea. the height in metres of the flare t seconds after firing is given by h=122.5t - 4.9t²

calculate the maximum height reached by the flare.
how do you do this. please she working i really need help &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:125.239.27.59|125.239.27.59]] ([[User talk:125.239.27.59|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/125.239.27.59|contribs]]) 23:30, 24 Apr 2007  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

: First you need to calculate the time at which the rate of change of position (as a function h of t) is equal to 0.    To do that, calculate the derivative of h(t) and solve t for h'(t)=0.  Then plug the value you get back into the formula h(t)=122.5t - 4.9t².  Good luck!  --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 23:35, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

: Well, good luck with that, and there is an alternate way as well, considering that the function you have provided is just a simple parabola of the type y = ax^2 + bx + c. This parabola can always be written as y = a[x+ (b/2a)]^2 - (b/2a)^2 + c. Now, if a&gt;0, Y will be minimum when the only term containing x (the variable) is 0. While, if a&lt;0 y will be maximum when the term is 0. Corresponding to the minimum/maximum, the value of x is then -(b/2a).

: Alternatively, compare the equation you have given with ut + (1/2)at^2. It is simply a manipulation of this equation of uniform accelerated motion, with u=122.5 m/s and a=9.8 (m/s)/s. You do know the value of the initial velocity. When the object in question reaches its maximum height, its velocity will be 0, otherwise if non zero the object would rise higher not making that point the highest point. So, find the time when the velocity is 0 using v = u + at, and then, put this value of time in your given equation.

: Note - You'll find that on substituting 0 in the last equation mentioned, it morphs into the same equation that is obtained by putting h'(t)=0.

: Oh, and well, sorry for my lack of easy language. This reply was written in a haste.

== How to down load a book from wikibooks. ==

Dear Sir / Madam,

Can you please guide as how to download a book from WIKIBOOKS, are all the books can be downloaded in PDF or any other format.

Reply back on apurvsawant@yahoo.com.

Thanks.

Hi, some books have PDF versions, in which case they have a template which signifies that the book has one. If it doesn't it's somewhat time consuming to make one, but if they have a &quot;Print Version&quot; which contains all of the pages in a book, you can open that and then save it as whatever you want (including a PDF, but printing it to PDF may mess up the formatting so beware.

: IIRC, a TOC is not generated until you have N or more headers (N is something like 5).  You can force a TOC by including &lt;nowiki&gt;__FORCETOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the page (which I have done for you).  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 02:06, 22 June 2007 (UTC)

I am completely new to this technology and am diving in head-first to arctic waters! Can anyone provide me with any information about how they use this technology as an educator in the classroom?

:I'm not sure how often Wikibooks are used in the classroom (it would be hard to collect data on this though such data would surely be useful), however, there have been several [[Wikibooks:List of class projects|class projects]], in which students work together to ''write'' a wikibook. Many of these have gone on to become featured books. As far as prospects for the future, I myself contribute because I hope that it will help low-income students become educated, and I think that (as long as the low-income people have access to a computer) it has the capability of helping in that regard.

I have a little problem with the limit of the function mentioned below

&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{x\rarr 0} \frac{2\tan x - 2\sin x - (x^3)}{x^5}
&lt;/math&gt;

By writing tanx as sin/cos I am able to get a finite answer, which is 0.5. However, the answerbook says the answer is 0.25. I am unsure how this is so, but I have double checked the problem. If anyone of you here confirms that the answer is indeed 0.5 It'll be a good enough cross check! Thanks!

:Initially I thought as &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\cos x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; tends to 1 as x tends to 0, the &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;2 \tan x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; would cancel with the &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;2 \sin x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, giving &lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;. 

:However, from the Taylor series we have:

::&lt;math&gt;\tan x = x + \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{2 x^5}{15} + \frac{17 x^7}{315} + ... &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^5}{120} - \frac{x^7}{5040} + ... &lt;/math&gt;

:Substituting in the original formula gives:

::&lt;math&gt;
\frac{2\tan x - 2\sin x - (x^3)}{x^5} = \frac{30}{120} + k x^2 +...
&lt;/math&gt;

:i.e. As x tends to 0, the higher terms can be ignored giving a result of 0.25.  [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:09, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

hi everyone,
           

I am doing a project on classical and modern design of control systems, I have got a very basic doubt as to why we always consider the degree of denominator greater that or at-most equal to the degree of numerator(i.e why is always the number of poles should be greater than or at-most be equal to zeros for any general transfer function).Please help me out to answer this question in detail.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__[[File:GIMP-Toolbox-Tools-Default.png|thumb|10000px|right|Toolbox from GIMP 2.6]]

GIMP provides a comprehensive toolbox in order to quickly perform basic tasks. Toolbox is fully customizable, this means that you can add/remove any tool you want. Just go to ''&quot;Windows &gt; Dockable Dialogues &gt; Tools&quot;'', and select any tool you want. 

By default not all tools are shown - GEGL operation tool and colour tools are omitted. All tools can also be accessed by opening the ''&quot;Tools&quot;'' menu. To switch the window to toolbox, you can use '''Ctrl + B'''. Note that shortcuts wrote here are the default values - you can change them any time you want in ''&quot;Edit &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts&quot;''

== Tools ==
These tools are available by default in toolbox.

== Tool options ==
[[File:GIMP-Toolbox-ToolOptions-All.png|thumb|right|10000px|]]

By default, activating any tool, will have the effect of showing its options under the toolbox. Each tool has its own set of settings and any changes to them are kept through the current session. There are also four buttons under any options.

:* [[File:GIMP-Toolbox-ToolOptions-SaveOptions-Icon.png]] '''Save options to...''' - save options of the current tool
:* [[File:GIMP-Toolbox-ToolOptions-RestoreOptions-Icon.png]] '''Restore options from...''' - restore options from saved file
:* [[File:GIMP-Toolbox-ToolOptions-DeleteOptions-Icon.png]] '''Delete saved options...''' - delete saved options
:* [[File:GIMP-Toolbox-ToolOptions-ResetOptions-Icon.png]] '''Reset to default values''' - reset the settings to default values.

You can hide them by clicking on the arrow next to the tool name and deselecting '''Show Button Bar'''. You can also access these from the same menu under '''Tool Options Menu'''.

== Colour, Indicator and Active Image area ==
[[File:GIMP-Toolbox-Colour-Indicator-ActiveImage-Area.png|thumb|right|10000px|Colour, Indicator and Active Image areas respectively.]]
Below the toolbox can be placed these three areas. This is set in ''&quot;Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Toolbox&quot;'' and any of the three can be hid there.

=== Colour area ===
Shows current foreground and background colour. Clicking on either will bring up the colour editor dialogue.

Clicking on the symbol in the lower left corner resets the colour to their defaults. The '''D''' key has the same effect.

Clicking on the symbol in the upper right corner swaps the foreground and background colours. The '''X''' key has the same effect.

=== Indicator area ===
Shows currently selected brush, pattern or gradient. Clicking on any of these allows you to change it.

=== Active Image area ===
Displays a thumbnail of the active image. Clicking on it will bring the Images dialogue up, allowing you the select an image.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &quot;competition&quot; that adults add to this children's game is sickening. I think the BSA should put the decals and paint into the same box as the car and simply the rules to a standard: Only what comes in this box. No Weights, no axle modifications, no rolling ball bearings, no dry lubricant. Maximum weight set to 2.5 ounces as weighed on a USPS standard calibrated scale. Any adult shows up with any car in violation of the rules is asked to leave the BSA and never return - the child can stay - the parents need to leave.

:Good luck with that. The best you are going to do is a clear set of rules and, no matter what they are, shared information, tools, and time so that there isn't a split between those in the know and those not. The kids are happy if their cars are fast and the races are close, even if they don't win. The goal of this book is to help packs define clear rules, help scouts and their parents understand the rules and the associated &quot;tricks,&quot; and reveal the secrets so that every cub has a competitive car and a good time at the race. --[[User:Kkmurray|Kkmurray]] ([[User talk:Kkmurray|talk]]) 16:06, 6 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">So, you want to create a planet? Whether it is for a game or just for geofiction, as part of a larger [[Conworld]] or alone, a planet is a good place to start building your setting. Starting with the planet gives you the ability to set up your world from the big to the small, from the large-scale setting to the tiny details. You can build the environment, then the various lands and places, the climate, weather, and down to the cultures, languages and characters of the world.

In this Wikibook, we'll get started on the construction of a conplanet. We'll be working from the general rules and guidelines of building a planet down to the details of climate and geography.You can skip steps if they don't seem to fit your particular world, or focus on one area more than another. Do whatever works best for the particular world ''you'' are creating.


Planets are complicated things. To build them, you must understand them. So, to begin: Some planet basics. All that follows assumes laws of physics that do not differ from those of our universe. The farther you get into the realm of fantasy, the less you need stick to these guidelines.

{{TOC}}









===The Basics===

Planets are ''round''. This is the simple bit. Any fictional planet that you construct will be round (roughly spherical) for the simple reason that all planets are, by definition, round.

All planets are round because, as [[w:Planet|Wikipedia]] says, a planet is &quot;massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity.&quot; So, any constructed planet must be '''[[w:mass|massive]]''' enough to become rounded by its own gravity. You can play around with non-planet celestial bodies (e.g. a giant oblong object floating in space) as the basis of your setting, but if you do you will not be dealing with an actual planet.

A planet must be massive enough to be round, but it '''cannot be too massive'''. If, for example, you create a planet that is as big as Earth's Sun, you will have a big problem. Past a certain point, the planet becomes so massive that it begins to cause thermonuclear fusion. Then your planet becomes a sun.

A planet must be massive, but not too massive; round; and also '''orbiting'''. The word &quot;planet&quot; comes from a Greek word (gr) which means &quot;wanderer.&quot; Wikipedia puts it very nicely; a planet must be &quot;a celestial body that is or was orbiting a star or stellar remnant.&quot; 

So, any planet that you will invent must be massive enough to be round, not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and orbiting a star. Any setting that you create that does not fit this basic description is not a planet. Which is OK. Sometimes breaking the rules a little, exploring the edges of the &quot;normal,&quot; is exactly what you need to do to give your constructed world a little flare.

== Things to Consider ==


A great number of events had to occur in order for Earth to become habitable to complex, multi-celled life, including humanity. While science-fiction for the past 60 years has been filled with a seemingly endless line of aliens from all sorts of strange and amazing worlds, our current understanding of planets and what requires from them in order to exist means that life is likely to be fairly similar in chemical composition and biology. We know that life is possible in galaxy because it's happened once before: on Earth. What scientists don't know for certain is just what are the minimum requirements life has. If you are planning on creating a truly imaginary alien race and are not that concerned with scientific accuracy, then you don’t have too much to worry about. You can skip this part and get stuck into your writing. For everybody else, it's probably best for us to begin by discussing our own planet's history and what allows us - humanity - to exist.

As a bare minimum, for a planet to be naturally habitable by any organism more complex than a single-cell, we first need a star of the right age (probably quite similar to our own sun, or Sol) so it has enough of the heavy elements needed for planet formation. Then those elements need to be transferred to the rocks and debris circling the star as those rocks begin to form a planet. The planet has to form within the so-called Goldilocks' (or habitable - HZ) zone where liquid water can form and for that HZ to remain constant over millions of years. The star's luminosity is responsible for the HZ position and if it varies, even by a tiny amount, life may not develop. Once the planet forms, it will require tectonic plates to maintain the planet's temperature and volcanism to allow new crust to be created. It should be noted here that water boils at 100c but no life form, single-celled or otherwise has ever been discovered on Earth that can survive anything above 50c. Therefore, the planet must cool down even if it is in the HZ. The planet also requires a moon, to induce axial tilt. This creates seasons and stimulates biological growth. However, the axial tilt cannot be so severe that the temperature difference between summer and winter kills life. Likewise, the planet will also probably require a day-night cycle but not one overly long so life is also wiped out by the cold of the night and heat of the day. Assuming all this occurs, the next hurdle for life to overcome is the one of actually developing. As yet, science is still unsure as to what caused life to first appear in Earth's oceans all those millions of years ago and even if life does appear, there are no guarantees it will be intelligent. Evolution doesn’t have a &quot;goal&quot; as such. There are countless millions of animal species on this planet and only one has intelligence. 

Once an intelligent species appears, it will then have to create civilization which can both survive the natural world and develop technology to grow, while all the time hoping that it doesn’t fall victim to any of the deases and natural disasters a planet can throw at it. 

There are things we can say for certain about an alien life form. Firstly, it will be organic, meaning it will have emotions and a survival instinct. If an organism is individualistic in nature, like humanity, it will require resources to survive (heat, food, water for example) and will take those items by force, if necessary. Therefore, said species are likely to have wars throughout their history. Some form of bartering system, giving a relative value to a resource is also likely. Unless the organism possesses some form of empathy or &quot;hive-mind&quot; linking each individual unit, separate groups will form communiaties and may eventually become nations.

type=Spell (curse)|
features=Causes inability to speak|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]}}

== Overview ==

The '''''Tongue-Tying Curse''''' causes the subject's tongue to roll up in his mouth, preventing speech.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

While it is similar to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Langlock|Langlock]] jinx, the Tongue-Tying Curse has a different physical effect: Langlock causes the subject's tongue to stick to the roof of his mouth, rather than curl upon itself.

There is suggestion in the books that the Tongue-tying curse may have a more permanent effect, preventing the subject from speaking of a particular topic, but this is never confirmed.

== Analysis ==

The Tongue-Tying Curse is left on the entrance to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], when the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] forces them to abandon the use of that house as Headquarters. Theoretically, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] could at that point reveal the presence of Headquarters to anyone he chose, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], as Dumbledore's death has left him a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Secret-Keeper]]. We are told by other members of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]], however, that Moody left spells that would prevent Snape doing that. As the curse's action on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] when he enters the house is quite brief, it could not prevent Harry from speaking of Grimmauld Place; the only way it could deter Snape would be if there was a long-term effect that was not immediately apparent.

While it is never explained exactly how long the Tongue-Tying curse's effect may last, the author may have introduced it as a means to deflect readers' probing questions about Snape's loyalty, which remains unknown until the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. If Snape had been a traitor, then it would seem logical and probable that he would have revealed how to enter Grimmauld Place to Voldemort and the other Death Eaters. Following the demonstration of the Tongue-tying curse's effects on Harry, readers might assume that this was the reason for Snape's silence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Refrigeration: Power &amp; Energy==
This section of the assessment guide presents analysis tools and techniques that will be used later in analyzing different recommendations. Section 6 of this guide: &quot;Recommendations&quot;, outlines the required, procedures, and concepts. These equations and calculations are referred to in analyzing the different recommendations.

'''&lt;u&gt;Motor Power&lt;/u&gt;'''
Motor input and output power are not equivalent. Calculate input power from voltage, current, and power factor. Output power requires motor efficiency or direct measurement of work performed.

Calculate input power with line-to-line voltage, line current, and power factor. The cubed root of three in the equation is for balanced three-phase power, and is applicable for wye or delta power systems (pf = power factor)

* Energy = Power times Operating Hours

'''&lt;u&gt;Condenser Fan Use Factor&lt;/u&gt;'''
Estimate a Use Factor (UF) to calculate energy use for motors that cycle on and off. For example, condenser fans with on-off control cycle to maintain refrigerant discharge pressure. UF represents the fraction of time the fan operates for each bin temperature. For variable-speed fans, UF represents the percentage of maximum speed at which the fan operates.

Calculate fan UF for each bin temperature by comparing the condensing minimum approach temperature difference (MATD) to the difference between the minimum condensing (Tm) and the bin temperature (BTi). Fans operate more (UF increases) as ambient (bin) temperatures increase. This is represented below for each bin temperature:

* Use Factor = minimum approach temperature difference / (min condensing temp - bin temp)

The above equations will yield confusing results in a few cases. If a use factor is calculated to be greater than one or less than zero, set UFi to one (100%). Such a situation occurs when ambient (bin) temperature is greater than the minimum condensing temperature minus MATD. Physically the outside temperature is high, the fans run continuously and the discharger pressure rises to maintain MATD to the ambient temperature.

The annual fan use factor is normalized sum of the each bin temperature.

* Total Use Factor = sum of (bin use factor x (operating hours / total bin hours))

'''&lt;u&gt;Condenser Fan Energy Use&lt;/u&gt;'''
''4a. On-off fan energy use''
Calculate fan energy for each bin temperature with fan power, use factor, and the bin hours. Sum the energy for each bin temperature, normalized with operating hours, for total fan energy.

* Fan Energy = sum of (bin hrs x use factor x fan power_ x (operating hours / total bin hours)

''4b. Adjustable speed fan energy use''
Estimate energy for each temperature with fan power, percent capacity, bun hours, and the following cubic relation. The cubic relation shown is curve fit based on measured fan data that relates the fan percent power to the bin specific use factor. Sum energy for each bin temperature, normalized with operating hours for total fan energy.

* percent power = curve fit based on percent capacity
* fan energy = sum of (total power x % power x bin hrs) x (operating hours / total bin hrs)

The curve fit is based on data collected by a former OSU graduate student.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Summary:==
Compressor power decreases with pressure difference across the compressor. Reduce the minimum condensing temperature set point to save energy when outside temperatures are below the existing approach temperature.

==When to Apply:==
When the minimum condensing pressure setting results in condensing temperature (missing word) than 80 degrees F. The corresponding saturation pressure at this temperature is shown below for common refrigerants. Gauge pressures given in the table assume an atmospheric pressure of 14.7 psia.

''Saturated Condensing Pressure (psig)''

* R-12:
**60 degrees F: 57.6
**80 degrees F: 84.0
**100 degrees F: 117.0

*R-22:
**60 degrees F: 101.7
**80 degrees F: 143.7
**100 degrees F: 196.0

*R-134A:
**60 degrees F: 57.4
**80 degrees F: 86.7
**100 degrees F: 124.1

*R502:
**60 degrees F: 116.
**80 degrees F: 161.2
**100 degrees F: 216.2

*Ammonia (R-717)
**60 degrees F: 92.4
**80 degrees F: 138.4
**100 degrees F: 197.3

==Key Engineering Concepts==
* Compressor Power increases with compression ratio.
* Compression ratio (CR) is determined by condensing pressure (pd) and suction pressure (ps); CR = pd / ps.
* Decrease minimum condensing pressure / temperature settings to decrease compression ratio and compressor power.
* Condenser fan energy will increase to maintain the decrease in condensing temperature. Fan energy increase typically represents about 10-30% of compressor energy savings.
* Approach temperature difference is measured relative to wet-bulb temperature for evaporative condensers, and relative to dry-bulb for air-cooled units. Wet-bulb temperature is less than dry-bulb due to evaporative cooling effects.

==Preparation==
&lt;u&gt;Tools Required:&lt;/u&gt;

* Therometer
* Power Meter
* DMM
* Clamp-on Ammeter
* Refrigeration Data Sheets

&lt;u&gt;Data Required:&lt;/u&gt;

* Minimum condensing temperature (Tm) - (from condenser fan setpoints, pressure gauge or compressor display)
* Compressor power (CP) - (measure directly or volts and amps)
* Total fan power (FP) - (measure directly or volts and amps)
* Wet and dry bulb temperature
* Condensing approach temperature difference (minimum of approximately 10 degrees F) - (measure with all condenser fans on)

==Analysis Process:==
'''&lt;u&gt;1) Choose Target Minimum Discharge Pressure&lt;/u&gt;'''
Lower condensing pressure saves energy, by the minimum condensing pressure is limited by system requirements. Recommend that the equipment operator set an obtainable minimum  condensing pressure in the one of two ways; either experiment by dropping pressure slowly and observe reaction , or consult manufacturer's specifications.

Expansion valves require a minimum pressure difference to function properly. In adequate discharge pressure can limit refrigerant circulation through expansion valves, including the liquid injection expansion valve for compressor cooling the system won't function correctly, and the compressor won't be properly cooled if condensing pressure is too low. A minimum condensing temperature of 60 degrees is often achievable. 

Sometimes system modifications are required to lower condensing pressure. Following are some common problems and solutions:

* System pressure drop limits minimum condensing pressure.
&lt;u&gt;Problem:&lt;/u&gt; The expansion valve will not function properly unless the refrigerant passing through it is liquid. If excessive system pressure drop causes flash-gas after the condenser, the condensing pressure will rise until liquid is delivered to the valve.

&lt;u&gt;Solution:&lt;/u&gt; Use a centrifugal pump or suction gas to sub-cool liquid refrigerant after the condenser. Sub-cooling is achieved by increasing the liquid pressure. Open needle valves, replace orifices or valves to increase flow. These replacements generally cost must less than the compressor savings.

* Liquid-injection oil cooling limits minimum condensing pressure.

&lt;u&gt;Problem:&lt;/u&gt; Refrigeration injected into the compressor (for cooling) passes through an expansion valve. If the discharge pressure is not adequate, the expansion valve will not function properly and the compressor will not be adequately cooled.

&lt;u&gt;Solution:&lt;/u&gt; Refer to Recommmendation #3, Thermosyphon Oil Cooling. Another option is to install a centrifugal pump in the liquid injection line. This will not save as much energy as thermosyphon cooling, but will be better than a higher average condensing pressure.

* Undersized condensers limit condensing pressure
&lt;u&gt;Problem:&lt;/u&gt; Heat transfer form the condenser depends on the temperature difference, the physically determined coefficients, and the heat transfer surface area. A smaller area requires a larger temperature difference. 

&lt;u&gt;Solution:&lt;/u&gt; Install more condensers to increase the condensing surface area and decrease the minimum approach temperature difference. In general, condensers cost less than compressor savings, and the system performs better on hot days.

'''&lt;u&gt;2) Calculate Condenser Fan Use Factor&lt;/u&gt;'''
Condenser fans will operate longer or at higher capacity when the minimum condensing pressure is reduced. This is referred to as increased fan use factor. Bin data is used to model the increase in fan use factor with a decrease in minimum pressure. Calculate use factors for the fan at both existing and proposed conditions with the equations from section 5, Power &amp; Energy, Condenser Fan Use Factor.

'''&lt;u&gt;3) Calculate Condenser Fan Energy Use&lt;/u&gt;
Calculate fan energy for existing and proposed conditions. Refer to the proper calculation box, depending on the strategy, in section 5, Power &amp; Energy, Condenser Fan Use Factor, Condenser Fan Energy Use.

'''&lt;u&gt;4) Calculate Fan Energy Increase&lt;/u&gt;'''
A decrease in discharge pressure increases fan operating time. A larger overall heat transfer coefficient is required due to the decrease in average approach temperature difference (temperature difference between cooling medium and lower condensing temperature).

Total Fan increase is calculated below:

* Fan Energy Increase = proposed fan energy - existing fan energy
* FEI = FEproposed - FEexisting

'''&lt;u&gt;5) Calculate Compressor Energy Savings&lt;/u&gt;'''
Conservatively estimate 1% drop in compressor power for each degree condensing temperature is reduced. You can also calculate compressor power decrease with condensing temperature from compressor manufacturer's specifications. We do not calculate demand savings because peak demand will not change on hot days. Calculations shown are for a simple cycle.

Calculate the existing and proposed condensing temperatures for each bin temperature. Remember that the condensing temperature at the maximum refrigeration load can never be closer to ambient temperature than the minimum approach temperature difference (MATD). Condensing temperature (CT) will floar at MATD above ambient temperature until the minimum condensing temperature (Tm) is reached.

* Condensing Temperature = bin temperature + approach temperature difference

Calculate compressor energy savings for each bin temperature. Estimate 1% power (range 0.5%-1.5%) savings for each degree condensing temperature (Tm) is reached.

* Energy Savings % = (condensing temp change) x 1% x bin hrs x operating hrs / total bin hrs

Calculate total compressor energy savings (CES) from the sum of bin energy savings time existing compressor energy use (CE).

* Compressor energy savings = compressor energy x sum of (energy savings percentages)

'''&lt;u&gt;6) Calculate Cost Savings&lt;/u&gt;'''
Calculate cost savings using the energy cost from the utility bills and energy savings. Total Savings are compressor energy savings minus fan energy increase.

'''&lt;u&gt;7) Estimate Implementation Cost&lt;/u&gt;'''
There is essentially no implementation cost to change the pressure settings at the condenser. If system modifications are require, consider the cost of purchase and installation. Modifications may include adding more condensing capacity to decrease the minimum approach temperature difference, new pumps, or thermosyphon oil cooling.

'''&lt;u&gt;8) Simple payback period is implementation cost divided by annual cost savings. We neglect effects of interest, escalation, and discount rates over the period because we only estimate savings. These effects are small with short payback periods.

| '''Newbie Notice:'''&lt;br&gt;
Getting files over IRC is a waiting game that requires patience, a stable connection, and a decent IRC client.  It may also involve the use of some basic DOS / Bash like commands to search through different servers to find the file you want.
|-
| '''Still interested?'''&lt;br&gt;
If you are completely new to IRC, I suggest having a look at the [[/Some Notes for Beginners/]] section and the [[/Setting Up Your IRC Client for Downloading Files/]] section as well before going through the rest of this guide.  Reading them first may save you some trouble in the long run.

&lt;br&gt;

      <comment>/* What is a CTCP trigger? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== How do I access file servers? ==
To access a file server you need to have your IRC client [[Downloading Files from IRC/Setting Up Your IRC Client for Downloading Files|set up properly to receive files]] and you need the CTCP trigger for the file server you are trying to access.

== What is a CTCP trigger? ==
A CTCP (Client-To-Client-Protocol) trigger is a special type of message that is
sent between IRC clients usually in request for specific information. A CTCP
trigger usually looks something like &quot; &lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;/ctcp [nickname] [trigger]&lt;/span&gt;&quot;.
Basically a trigger is a message you send to another IRC user's client for
information about it. For example, if I wanted to know what IRC client
Danno123 was using, I would type &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;/ctcp Danno123 version&lt;/span&gt;&quot; and his
client would send me something like &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;mIRC v6.21 Khaled Mardam-Bey&lt;/span&gt;&quot; as an
automated response.

== How do CTCP triggers work in relation to file servers? ==
A file server CTCP trigger is a request sent to someone running a file server
for permission to access the list of available files they have for you to
download. When you type a file server's CTCP trigger, if it is online and not
being used by someone else, it will respond by trying to start a DCC chat
session with you to share the list of files it is serving. 

== How do I get the CTCP trigger for a file server? ==
To obtain a CTCP trigger you would type &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;!list&lt;/span&gt;&quot; in the channel window the file
server is in. After typing &quot;!list&quot;, all active file servers in the channel
responding to &quot;!list&quot; will send you a private message with their status and
CTCP trigger(s) to access them.

Here is an example of three file server ads that might be displayed after
typing &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;!list&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. 

&lt;font face=&quot;Fixedsys&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;-Danno- &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 153, 153); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; Trigger:[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;/ctcp Danno Dannos awesome
stuff!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;] Next

&lt;/font&gt; 

== Ok, I see the ads, but which ones the CTCP trigger? == 

The trigger is usually the text after &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;Trigger&lt;/span&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;Triggers&lt;/span&gt;&quot; contained between the
&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&quot; brackets. &lt;br&gt;
For example, the file server ad below:

&lt;font face=&quot;Fixedsys&quot;&gt;-TracerFX- &lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(153, 51, 153);&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;/ctcp TracerFX collection 2 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

style=&quot;color: rgb(153, 51, 153);&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

Has three different triggers you could use: 

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;/ctcp TracerFX
collection 1&lt;br&gt;
/ctcp TracerFX collection 2&lt;br&gt;
/ctcp TracerFX collection 3 &lt;/span&gt; 

== How do I use the trigger? == 
Simply type the trigger into the network server window (tab with the networks
name on it) and the file server should initiate a DCC chat session.

Example, I'd type:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;/ctcp TracerFX collection 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After typing the trigger, I would receive a DCC chat offer from TracerFX,
after that I would accept the offer and browse TracerFX's file server.

== How do I find out what is on a file server and how do I download from it? == 
There are two common types of files servers run on IRC, the most popular one
uses a command prompt style interface. The command prompt style interface
will probably look like gibberish to you at first if your are unfamiliar with
the DOS\UNIX command line. The second most common file server type uses a
number-letter style interface (and may also accept the command prompt syntax
as well). If you have ever used an automated voice messaging service (think
of a 1-800 style support line), you should not have too much trouble
understanding this type.

=== Command Prompt Style File Servers ===
After entering the trigger &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;/ctcp
TracerFX collection 1&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, as in the example above and accepting the DCC
chat offer, you would receive a message similar to this...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; -=SysReset 2.3=- FileServer&lt;br&gt;

&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; Minimum CPS is: 5000&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; Maximum CPS is: 10000&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Notice the line that says: &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;Use: cd,
clr_queue...&lt;/span&gt;&quot;? That is the list of available commands you can use with
this particular file server. The only ones you really need to familiarize
yourself with in order to download are &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, and &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;''': displays a list of
all files and sub-directories inside the current directory&lt;br&gt;
'''&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;''': change directory,
use this to enter (&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;sub-directory-name&lt;/span&gt;&quot;) and exit (&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;cd ..&lt;/span&gt;) sub-directories&lt;br&gt;
'''&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;''': request a filename
from a file server (&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;get
filename.extension&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
'''&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;''': disconnect from a
file server

'''Here is an example of these commands in use with the file server in the '''
'''example above:'''

To display the list of files I would type &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&quot; and the file server would
respond with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; ..&lt;br&gt;

&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; tutorial 2.avi 42.4 mb&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; End of list.&lt;/span&gt;

To enter the directory named &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;NIGHTLY BUILDS&lt;/span&gt;&quot; I would type &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;cd NIGHTLY BUILDS&lt;/span&gt;&quot; which would give me:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; SysReset 2.53&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; [\NIGHTLY BUILDS]&lt;/span&gt;

To find out what's in the directory named &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;NIGHTLY BUILDS&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, I would again type
&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&quot; which would give me:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; ..&lt;br&gt;

&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; Install Guide.txt 4 kb&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; End of list.&lt;/span&gt;

Since I do not want any of these files, so I would back to the previous
directory by typing &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;cd ..&lt;/span&gt;&quot; and
would get:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX SysReset 2.53&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX [\]&lt;/span&gt;

I can list the contents of this directory again by typing &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, which (yet again) displays:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; ..&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; LATEST STABLE BUILD&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; BETA BUILDS&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; NIGHTLY BUILDS&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; readme.txt 3 kb&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; tutorial 1.avi 25.3 mb&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; tutorial 2.avi 42.4 mb&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; End of list.&lt;/span&gt;

When I know which file I want to download, &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;tutorial 1.avi&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, I would tell the
file server to send it to me by typing:

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;get tutorial 1.avi&lt;/span&gt;

If the file server could send me the file immediately, I would see something
like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; DCC Send tutorial 1.avi (12.23.4.567)&lt;br&gt;
* TracerFX has offered tutorial 1.avi (25309024 bytes)&lt;br&gt;
* DCC RECV connection established to TracerFX [12.23.4.567:9001]&lt;/span&gt;

If the file server could not send me the file immediately (if someone else
was downloading something off of it) it would place me in its queue:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;TracerFX&amp;gt; Adding your file to queue slot 14. The file will send when
the next send slot is open.&lt;/span&gt;

And since the file server in this example only has one send slot (&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;Sends:[0/1]&lt;/span&gt;) I would have to wait
until the thirteen people in front of me finished downloading before it would
send me the file.

After I finished telling the file server what file I would like to download,
I would type &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&quot; or simply
close the window.

=== Number-Letter Style File Servers ===
Just like with the other file server, to gain access you enter the CTCP
trigger &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;/ctcp Danno Dannos awesome
stuff!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, but the DCC chat message will look a little different from
before:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; Ultra Protection Project v2.00 final - by KyD&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; Welcome [12.34.567.89], you are the [75th person] to access my

&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; Commands: cd, clr_fqueues, clr_queue, clr_queues, dir, failq,
find&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; get, help, my_queues, pwd, queues, quit, sends, stats, time,
who&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And as with the command prompt file server type, I type &quot;dir&quot; to bring up the
list of directories:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font face=&quot;Fixedsys&quot;&gt;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;: mega-collection&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;: more stuff&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;: much more stuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is where the likeness ends with the other file server type. Notice the
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;numbers-letter combinations&lt;/span&gt; in
front of the directories? Instead of typing &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;cd more stuff&lt;/span&gt;&quot; to see what the
directory has in it, all I would need to do is type the number letter combo
in front of it, &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;2d&lt;/span&gt;.

After typing the combo, I the server will list the contents of that
particular directory:

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt;
[more stuff]&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; 0D: ..&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; 1F: cooking with fire.mpg 96MB&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; 2F: fun with frisbees.txt 175MB&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; 3F: some neat clip 01.avi 180MB&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; 4F: release schedule.txt 17KB&lt;/span&gt;

Again, instead of having to type &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;get
some neat clip 01.avi&lt;/span&gt;&quot; to let the file server know what I wanted to
download, all I would have to do is type the letter-number combination in
front of it, &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;3F&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. After typing
the files combo, the server would send me a message confirming my choice:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; queuing [some neat clip 01.avi 180MB]. it has been placed in
queue slot [7], it will send when sends are available&lt;/span&gt;

To go back to the previous directory, I type the letter-number combination in
front of the line labeled&quot;..&quot; instead of &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;cd ..&quot;&lt;/span&gt;. In the above example it would
be &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;0D&lt;/span&gt;&quot;.

And again, I exit the the file-server by typing &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&quot; or closing the fservs DCC chat
window.

Note: You do not have to to leave the chat session open for your file to
download but many file servers do require that you stay in the same channel
that the file server is in until the download is finished. 

== How does the &quot;@find&quot; trigger work? == 
The syntax for this trigger is &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;@find&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;search-query-here&lt;/span&gt;&quot; where &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;search-query-here&lt;/span&gt;&quot; would be the
keyword(s) you are looking for. The &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;@find&lt;/span&gt;&quot; trigger works almost the same
as &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;!list&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, except only fserv's
serving files names with the terms you are searching for will respond. 

'''Example:'''

If I were looking for someone serving a file that contained either &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;potato&lt;/span&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;floss&lt;/span&gt;&quot; I would type:

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;@find potato floss&lt;/span&gt;

And an fserv that had a file with one of these two terms would in its name
would send me a PM with something like:

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt;
[@Find Results] -=SysReset 2.53=-&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; Found [2] files on Trigger:[/ctcp Danno Dannos awesome stuff!]
- Sends:[0/2] - Queues:[0/50]&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; File: [Teeth\Proper flossing technique.mkv] - Size [840.2MB]&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; File: [War\Potato Gun ATTACK.avi] - Size [30.7MB]&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt; End of @Find.&lt;/span&gt;

In the example above, I'm not only given the trigger to use to access the
file server &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;/ctcp Danno Dannos
awesome stuff!&lt;/span&gt;&quot; but the file location and name as well, [&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;Directory&lt;/span&gt;\&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;Filename.some-extension&lt;/span&gt;].

'''Keep in mind that &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;@find&lt;/span&gt;&quot; is
not always reliable as many file servers are not set up to respond to the
trigger and will not PM you even if they have a file with one of your
search terms in its name.'''

== What is with the &quot;Closing Idle connection in [time interval here]&quot; messages? == 
Most file servers owners have a limit to how many people can browse their
files via DCC chat at one time. This means that if the limit is reached, no
one else will be able to access their fserv. This is also why it is a good
reason to close\exit a DCC chat session when you have finished using it.
Also, keep in mind that some file servers owners may even ban you from their
fserv if you idle on it too long and never disconnect the DCC chat
connection. To help keep their file server open, many fserve runners will set
a time limit as to how long you can idle (not type any commands) on their
file server before the DCC chat connection is closed (you are disconnected
fro the file server).

For example, if I was connected to Danno's file server and received a message
like:

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Danno&amp;gt;
Closing Idle connection in 30 seconds&lt;/span&gt;

And did not use any commands for 30 seconds I would be disconnected and see
something like:

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;DCC CHAT to
Danno lost. Remote host closed socket.&lt;/span&gt;

== XDCC Browser ==

You can also use mIRC addons such as XDCC Browser http://www.XDCCBrowser.com
&lt;br&gt;The script has a built in file server dialog that shows can shows the file list in a graphical way, just like an FTP session .&lt;br&gt;
You can then just browse the file server, and double click on the files you want.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How do I download off of XDCC bots? == 
XDCC bots work using PMs (private messages) sent to the bot with a
request for a particular pack number. &lt;br&gt;
:The syntax is usually something like:

::&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;/msg [bot-name] xdcc send pack-number&lt;/span&gt;&quot;
::To request that the bot send you a pack, or: 

::&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;/msg [bot-name] xdcc info pack-number&lt;/span&gt;&quot;
::To request info from the bot about a particular pack

The pack number representing a file you would want to download from the bot. To find out what files a bot is carrying and what their pack numbers are, you have to obtain their packlists. Sometimes the packlist is stored on the bot itself as a text file (.txt), other times it may be on a website, sometimes both, it depends on the bot.

== Where do I find a bot's packlist? == 
XDCC bot packlists can usually be retrieved in one of four ways described below.

=== From the XDCC bot in the form of a PM ===
In file distribution channels where typing !list is acceptable, the bots may reply to it with an ad displaying a trigger&lt;br&gt;
As an example, after typing !list, one might receive a PM like:
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;-[CAT]Food-
(XDCC) Packs:(12) Trigger:(/msg [CAT]Food xdcc list) Sends:(1/1)
Queues:(33/100) Record:(76.3KB/s) Note:(Brought To You By ScientistsDiet)
=iroffer=&lt;/span&gt;

After Typing the trigger (&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;/msg
[CAT]Food xdcc list&lt;/span&gt;) the bot would simply PM the sender its XDCC list

=== From a website ===
&lt;!--It is ALWAYS a good idea to read the channel topic and &quot;on join&quot; notices BEFORE typing anything in the channel--&gt;
In a distro channel's topic a website with the XDCC list somewhere on it will usually be listed (usually in the forums) or when typing the bots trigger from its XDCC ad, &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;/msg [CAT]Food xdcc list&lt;/span&gt;, you would receive a reply back like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;-[CAT]Food- XDCC LIST Denied. For a Listing visit: &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;http://tasty.food.land/CatFood.html&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Where &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://tasty.food.land/CatFood.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; would be the location of the packlist.

=== From the XDCC bot itself in the form of a text file ===
Again, after typing !list in the channel window, and getting the XDCC bot's trigger ( &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;/msg [CAT]Food xdcc list&lt;/span&gt;, for example ) and typing it in the network window, you would get a response back like:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;-[CAT]Food- XDCC LIST Denied. For a Listing type: &quot;/msg [CAT]Food !blist&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
or
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;-[CAT]Food- XDCC LIST Denied. For a Listing type: &quot;/msg [CAT]Food xdcc send #1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Upon typing the trigger the bot messages you in reply, you would be sent a text file containing the packlist for the bot.

=== Timed message displayed in the main channel ===
The last but most popular method for displaying a bot's trigger to get it's packlist, or displaying the whole list itself is timed messages displayed in the channel window every 10, 15, or 20 (or whatever) minute time interval. All you to do is just idle in the channel, and the bot will display it's ad (or whole packlist in some cases) as a text message.

== All right, I can see the packlist, now what? == 
The packlist itself should have all the information necessary for downloading from the XDCC bot contained in the first few lines.

For Example, below is part of the [CAT]Food's packlist:

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
** #Cats-R-Us ~ For XDCC packlisting Type /msg [CAT]Food xdcc send #1 **
** 3 packs ** 0 of 13 slots open, Queue: 75/999, Record: 1792.7KB/s **
** Bandwidth Usage ** Current: 1276.4KB/s, Cap: 1500.0KB/s, Record: 3244.1KB/s **
** To request a file, type &quot;/msg [CAT]Food xdcc send #x&quot; **
** To request details, type &quot;/msg [CAT]Food xdcc info #x&quot; **
#1 97x [ 42K] [CAT]_Releases.txt
#2 22x [123M] [CAT]_Cooking_fish_howto_video.avi
#3 14x [123M] [CAT]_Meow_Mix_advertisement.avi
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

Packet number 2, for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;#2 22x [123M] [CAT]_Cooking_fish_howto_video.avi&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starts from the left side with the packet number (&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;#2&lt;/span&gt;), followed by the number of times
the pack has been sent so far (&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;22x&lt;/span&gt;), followed by the file size
(&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;[123M]&lt;/span&gt;), and finally the file
name for the pack (&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;[CAT]_Cooking_fish_howto_video.avi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If I wanted to download &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;[CAT]_Cooking_fish_howto_video.avi&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, I
would send request via private message to [CAT]Food for pack #2:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
/msg [CAT]Food xdcc send #2&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If the request successfully went through, it would send a private message
back to me:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-[CAT]Food- ** All Slots Full, Added you to the main queue for pack 2
(&quot;[CAT]_Cooking_fish_howto_video.avi&quot;) in position 118. To Remove yourself at
a later time type &quot;/msg [CAT]Food xdcc remove&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this case, all of the thirteen send slots (&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;3 packs ** 0 of 13 slots open&lt;/span&gt;) are full, and there are 117 people with pack requests in front of me. What that means is that I'll have to wait for 104 (117 in queue minus 13 send slots) packs to finish sending before the bot will send me the pack I requested.

== How do I find out what my &quot;slot&quot; number is and how long do I have to wait before the bot sends me the file? == 
Unfortunately, there isn't a way to manually access an XDCC bots to find out your position in the queue, however most XDCC bots will PM you your position after a certain amount of time automatically, depending on the bot's set-up.

For example, [CAT]Food has a time interval of 10 minutes, so after waiting in queue for 10 minutes the bot sends me a private message letting me know what my current position is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-[CAT]Food- Queued 0h3m for &quot;[CAT]_Cooking_fish_howto_video.avi&quot;, in position 118 of 119. 5h44m or more remaining.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Keep in mind the time remaining is only a ROUGH ESTIMATE, there is no guarantee the bot will start sending the file in 5 hours and 44 minutes, it depends the connection speed of the people in front of me.

== Why is the file I requested not the one being sent to me? == 
Occasionally, older files may be removed from a bot to make room for newer ones to be added and the bot's packlist is updated. When requesting a file off of a bot, make sure you are using an updated packlist. Also, delete any older copies of packlists you may have in your download folder before requesting a new one, sometimes newer packlists will not send properly if an older copy is in your download directory.

== mIRC XDCC Scripts ==

You can also use mIRC addon scripts such as [http://www.mruno.org/BX BeaST-XDCC Script] or XDCC Browser.
&lt;br&gt;The script will list the XDCC packets that are listed in the channels you're in, and display them in an organized fashion.&lt;br&gt;
It also has a search option that will allow you to search for packets that aren't necessarily on the networks and channels you're currently on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Where do the files download to? == 
By default, mIRC sends new incoming files to the:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;C:\Program
Files\mIRC\download&lt;/span&gt;&quot; directory.

== What is the number letters string (CRC) at the end of the filename for? == 
The random, 8 character, number letter string at the end of some filenames is
their CRC32 value. It is used to ensure that the file was transferred from one
person to another without being corrupted in the process.

For example, the file: &lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Fixedsys;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[CAT]_Cooking_fish_howto_video_[CA732D8B].avi &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Is suppose to have a CRC32 hash of &quot;&lt;span
style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255);&quot;&gt;CA732D8B&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. To ensure the copy I
downloaded hadn't been corrupted in the process, I would run a hash check on
the file and make sure its CRC32 value matches the one found in the file
name. Some good hash checkers you could use are:
*[http://rapidcrc.sourceforge.net/ RapidCRC] (Windows)
*[http://beeblebrox.org/software.php HashTab] (Windows)
*[http://web.archive.org/20031004132816/homepage.mac.com/julifos/soft/checksum/index.html CheckSum] (Mac OS X)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is meant to be a beginner's survival guide for using IRC, more of a quick summary of some important points than an in-depth guide. 

== Terminology ==
* '''IRC''' stands for '''I'''nternet '''R'''elay '''C'''hat
* '''IRC Channel''' a channel is a group (or chatroom) related to a particular subject matter, Channel names are preceded by the &quot;#&quot; sign, for example: #lounge
* '''Topic''' the text displayed when entering a channel, usually the channel's description
* '''On-Join message''' usually a welcome message or other text
* '''Op''' or '''Moderator''' a channel's boss, sets and enforces the channel rules and have the ability to kick and/or ban users from the channel.
* '''Idle''' to sit in the channel and not discuss anything. (this would probably describe what most IRC user's do....)
* '''Kick''' to remove someone from the channel
* '''Ban''' to remove a user's ability to rejoin a channel
* '''Bot''' a nick that is run by a script or program
* '''Nick''' the name you use to chat with

== Basic Etiquette ==
* When joining a channel, before you do anything, read the channel's topic and on-join messages, along with (if listed in the topic) any website and/or &quot;!rules&quot; trigger
* IRC started as a means for people to chat with one another in real time over the internet. A majority of IRC channels are still the same way today, as a means to chat with other people. IRC is not purely for downloading files.
* All IRC channels '''ARE NOT''' the same.  What might be acceptable in one channel may be completely off limits in another. This could include using certain triggers, idling and even the language used inside the channel, among other things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== This is is a mini-guide for beginners to set up an IRC client to receive files. ==

=== mIRC ===
* When mIRC is opened, the options menu should pop up:

[https://archive.is/20130707080657/img99.imageshack.us/img99/9440/mirc001wc7.jpg example]

* In the &quot;Category:&quot; window under &quot;Connect&quot;, click on &quot;Options&quot;, and put a check mark next to &quot;Reconnect on disconnection&quot;

[https://archive.is/20130802161954/img248.imageshack.us/img248/8060/mirc002yq2.jpg image]

* Next, click on the &quot;DCC&quot; category. And click on the &quot;\/&quot; to the right of &quot;If file exists:&quot; and select &quot;Resume&quot;. Also for &quot;On chat request:&quot;, select &quot;Auto-accept&quot; and check &quot;minimize&quot;

[https://archive.is/20130802163143/img248.imageshack.us/img248/5437/mirc003of7.jpg image]

* If your confronted with the &quot;Auto-Get Warning&quot;, click yes and enable the feature. Enabling auto-get does not mean viruses will takeover your computer, just don't be an idiot and open files sent to you that you didn't request.

[https://archive.is/20130707080345/img156.imageshack.us/img156/2931/mirc003bmf6.jpg image]

* Now click on the &quot;+&quot; sign next to &quot;DCC&quot; to open up the sub menu.

[https://archive.is/20130707081416/img88.imageshack.us/img88/1403/mirc004tg0.jpg image]

* Now we are going to click on the &quot;Ignore&quot; in the sub-category that just opened up and click on the &quot;\/&quot; to the right of &quot;Method:&quot;. Select disabled and un-check the box next to &quot;turn ignore back on in:&quot;

* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.

* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]

== General Chemistry ==

I see you have made many revisions and improvements.  Thanks!  The pictures really help.  In case you're interested, I've been working on this book a lot lately, trying to make it suitable for a &quot;Featured Book&quot; status on the front page. [[User:NipplesMeCool|NipplesMeCool]] ([[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]) 23:30, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

Cool, glad to see someone who is interested.  [[User:NipplesMeCool|NipplesMeCool]] ([[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]) 01:41, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

== Continued Interest in General Chemistry ==
I've been searching for any authors still interested in editing the General Chemistry book and was wondering if you were still interested in helping out with it. I'm looking to make the book into a college level text, let me know what you think. [[User:Btharper1221|Btharper1221]] ([[User talk:Btharper1221|talk]])</text>

== [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Model Railroad‎]] ==

Instead of engaging in an edit war, perhaps we should talk about whether it's appropriate to add an interwiki link to [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Model Railroad‎]].  This is a chapter in a book that I have been working on since 2005.  The book itself is intended to provide instruction for teaching or earning the Pathfinder honors, and this chapter is for the Model Railroad honor ([[w:Pathfinders]] is a scouting organization similar to the [[w:Boy Scouts of America]]).  I don't speak Dutch, but from what I have seen on the [[nl:Modelspoorwegbouw]] page, I don't think these two pages are at all equivalent.  In my opinion, if these two pages are not more closely related, we should not have the interwiki link.  Feel free to disagree, but please provide an explanation. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:09, 15 October 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Creative writing exercises can be a great way to practice your writing skills. Writing poetry, fiction, and memoir allows you to use your imagination and previous experiences, as well as practice your narrative, grammar, and punctuation skills. Though you may doubt yourself as a writer or feel unsettled at the idea of being creative, have confidence in yourself and know that you are already equipped to be a creative writer. You have a story to tell, and the following exercises will help discover and tell your personal stories. 


=Creative Writing=
While other forms of writing ask that you to find research in external source before you begin, creative writing does not require this of you. More often than not, creative writing projects only require you to use your memory and imagination to tackle your project.  This ability to just sit down and write without having to perform research allows you to practice writing whenever you want. You can try writing a poem on your coffee break or during a bus or subway ride. You can spend an afternoon writing a memoir about your favorite childhood pet, or you could begin to keep a journal where describe the events of your day, the weather,  the books you are reading, or television shows you like to watch. For creative and personal writing, the possibilities are endless.

Now you may be asking yourself if you have anything worth writing about, and the simple answers is yes you do! Every day provides an infinite number of topics to write about, whether that be having dinner with a friend, the taste of your coffee, or the beauty of a painting you saw in a museum. The activities in this section will help you jump-start your creativity, and before you know it you will have written some great poems, short stories, and memoirs.

== Poetry ==
More so than any other form of writing, poetry is known for its ability to express ideas and emotions or tell stories using very few words. Though some poems can be long, in general the best poems are those that help us appreciate mankind and nature by condensing  a scene or event into short poem full of specific details. With these poetry exercises, you will attempt to write poems that are short but specific. Like every other kind of writing, the most successful pieces of poetry help us clearly imagine what the poet is talking about by using concrete images or facts. The following exercises will also help you practice writing clear sentences, think about grammar, and practice using punctuation, but most of all have fun writing.

===Poetry Without Punctuation===
Have you ever got tired of having to use punctuation and wish you could write without having to worry about periods, commas, and quotations? Well many poets have become famous for writing pieces that do not use any punctuation to make their sentences clear. However do not be fooled, writing without punctuation can be just as difficult as writing with it. For this exercise, read Lucille Clifton's [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=176011 &quot;the garden of delight&quot;] and then write a poem about a garden or park you like to visit without using any punctuation. Keep in mind that you want the reader to be able to easily understand the poem, so like Clifton insert line breaks or spaces to help the reader understand how to read the poem.

Then on a separate piece of paper, try writing the same poem again, but this time use punctuation. Notice how the poem changes and the punctuation can help you. After you have written the second version of the poem, spend a few moments and journal about writing both poems. Which poem was easier to write? What made it easier to write? Do you like this poem better and why? Which do you think is easier for the reader to understand? Why? Be sure to have both poems in front of you when you journal so that you can easily compare them, noticing where you used punctuation in the second poem and how that might or might have clarified what you wrote in the first poem.

==Narrative and Memoir==
=== Defining ''Narrative'' and ''Memoir''===

* Narrative:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Simply stated, narrative is a style of writing that tells a story.  It can be fiction or nonfiction and is typically told from a first- or third-person point of view.  Narratives can be in the form of short stories, poetry, personal essays, novels, monologues, folktales, fables, legends, etc.  The characteristic hallmark of narrative is that there is a character or voice telling the reader or viewer &quot;what happened,&quot; as with the &quot;narrators&quot; of most novels and short stories, and many movies or television programs.  Well-known and popular TV examples of this would include the late 1980s/early 1990s drama, ''[http://imdb.com/title/tt0094582/ The Wonder Years],'' or more recently the prime-time shows ''[http://imdb.com/title/tt0285403/ Scrubs]'', and ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410975/ Desperate Housewives]''. A narrative may or may not have dialogue, depending on whether or not the event or action taking place is simply an observation from a distance (like the narrator of a nature documentary) or, for instance, a kind of ''I said'' or ''he/she said'' situation (like J.D. Salinger's ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher_in_the_rye The Catcher in the Rye]'' and F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Gatsby The Great Gatsby]'').  Some narratives have multiple narrators, or more than one character/voice, each of whom is responsible for either telling one part of a larger story, or who tell different versions of the same story.  Several narrative examples of the use of multiple narrators can be found in William Faulkner's novel ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_and_the_Fury The Sound and the Fury],'' Ernest J. Gaines's novel ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Gathering_of_Old_Men A Gathering of Old Men],'' and Akira Kurosawa's film ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/ Rashomon].'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Memoir:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Memoir is a specific type of narrative.  It is autobiographical in nature but it is not meant to be as comprehensive as biography (which tells the ''entire'' life story of a person).  Instead, a memoir is usually only a specific &quot;slice&quot; of one's life.  The time span within a memoir is thus frequently limited to a single memorable event or moment, though it can also be used to tell about a longer series of events that make up a particular period of one's life (as in Cameron Crowe's film memoir ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875/ Almost Famous]'').  It is narrative in structure, usually describing people and events that ultimately focuses on the emotional significance of the story to the one telling it.  Generally, this emotional significance is the result of a resolution from the conflict within the story.  Though a memoir is the retelling of a true account, it is not usually regarded as being completely true.  After all, no one can faithfully recall every detail or bit of dialogue from an event that took place many years ago.  Consequently, some creative license is granted by the reader to the memoirist recounting, say, a significant moment or events from his childhood some thirty years or more earlier.  (However, the memoirist who assumes too much creative license without disclosing that fact is vulnerable to censure and public ridicule if his deception is found out, as recently happened with James Frey and his alleged memoir, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Little_Pieces A Million Little Pieces].'') Furthermore, names of people and places are often changed in a memoir to protect those who were either directly or indirectly involved in the lives and/or event(s) being described.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Common Approaches ===

Below you will find some typical writing prompts that will allow you to begin writing a narrative or memoir. Remember to stay focused and to tell a story when writing in this genre. 

* &quot;Write about someone significant in your life.&quot;

* &quot;Write about the worst/best, most significant/exciting/boring day of your life.&quot;

* &quot;If you had a chance to talk with a historical/famous/legendary/etc. person, what would you talk about? Explain why.&quot;

=== Sample Assignment ===

There is not one right or best way to write a narrative or memoir. However, there are certainly better ways to write in this genre than others. Read the following short samples of an &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;needs a little work,&quot; and &quot;needs a lot of work&quot; narrative writing assignment! Because it should be a narrative, remember that the writer should be telling a story. All grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors should be cleared up when editing. See [[Basic Writing/Editing]] for more help. So the focus will be on content.

Assignment: &quot;Write about someone significant in your life.&quot; 

'''Needs a lot of work:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt; My mom is a significant person in my life. She has always taken good care of me. She looks after my family and does a lot of hard work. My family couldn't make it without my mom. I really love my mom a lot because of all she has done for me. She's a great person. I tell my mom everything. She is probably my closest friend. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This narrative needs a lot of work. There are very few specific details. Questions that need to be answered are: How does she take good care of you? What kind of hard work does she do? Why is she a great person? What kind of a person is she? What does she do with the information you give her? What kind of sacrifices has she made for the family? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answering these questions will really improve the writing. The audience wants to know as much interesting information as you can tell them about this topic. Think about all the details you see and hear in a movie or really good book. You don't need to reach that level, but that should be your goal. Giving some specific, personal examples will help the audience understand the writing and enjoy reading it. See the next example for a better response to this assignment. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Needs a little work:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt; When I was young, I didn't get along very well with my mom. We used to fight a lot and I just didn't understand her. She always seemed to be in my business and trying to snoop around. I've always had really dry eyes. Sometimes they water to compensate or get really red because they're so dry. My mom used to think I'd been crying and bug me to death asking me if someone had hurt my feelings at school! I was a teenager! &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But now me and my mom are best friends. I tell her everything and she tells me everything. Sometimes we still disagree, but we've learned to understand and repsect each other. We're very different people, but I don't know what I'd do without my mom. She has always supported me and stood behind whatever I've wanted to do or be. She's my biggest fan. In my mom's eyes, I could be the next great world leader, or a famous ballerina, or the first astronaut to live on Mars. It took me a while to realize just how significant my mom is to me, but now that I know, nothing will ever change the way I feel about her. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This narrative is better than the first one because it has more details and gives some specific examples regarding the writer's relationship to her mom. However, it still needs a little work because even more details could be provided to give the reader a clearer picture of their relationship.  For example, the reader doesn't know what has changed in this relationship that led to the two of them becoming like &quot;best friends.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Excellent:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt; When I was a teenager, I didn't get along very well with my mom.  It seemed like we fought on a daily basis and we rarely if ever understood where the other was coming from.  I felt so seperate from her and it was impossible to tell her about my problems because all she would ever do is freak out.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I remember one particular fight in perfect clarity.  We were having one of our good days - that should've been the first warning sign.  I was helping her weed the flower beds, telling her about a conversation that I had had with my boyfriend's mom the previous night.  When I was finished telling her about the advice that Janice shared with me about how to reconcile with a friend of mine, my mom grew very quiet.  I asked her if something was wrong but she continued to stare at a stubborn dandelion in the middle of her peony bed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Finally, she looked up at me.  Frustration and anger filled her face and tears spilled down her cheeks.  &quot;How come you never come to me anymore?&quot; she spat.  &quot;Why do you have to go to other moms to talk about your problems?  Am I not good enough?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I didn't really know what to say.  I tried to reason with her, explaining that it's normal for teenagers to talk to other parents about personal problems, but all she did was storm off.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That was the day that I realized how much my mom actually meant to me.  I knew from her reaction that she felt devalued and even though we had our issues, I also knew that I had a great mom.  She had always taken care of me, provided for me, and as a young child, she was my best friend. I wanted that back and from that day on, the two of us worked on communicating better and getting to know each other all over again.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an excellent example of a narrative because it provides necessary details to help the reader understand the relationship between the mother and daughter. In the &quot;needs a little work&quot; example, the writer did not explain how the mom and daughter became &quot;best friends.&quot; This is an important and significant detail. It is important to explain the important details as much as possible in a story. To continue this writing, the writer will probably give another example of how things were after they began to understand each other better. This will give the audience a clear picture of the progress of the relationship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Examples: ===
The following are example compositions written for an assignment where students were asked to write narrative descriptions about a day they consider to be one of their worst.  (Note:  Even though two of the following three examples have death as a theme, personal narratives and memoirs can just as easily be written about smaller, less dramatic events from one's life.)

'''Example 1:''' 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was the worst day of my life, and it was only 10:00am. Sitting in my dorm room sobbing into the phone, my mom tried to calm me down. But she couldn't erase the pain and misery, hurt and disappointment I was currently feeling. What had gone wrong? Why was everyone against me? How would I get through the rest of the day... the week with my injuries? Let me start from the beginning.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
It was a cold, blustery day at Evangel University. I had spent the last few days preparing for a presentation for my Children's Literature class, and I would soon go to the preschool just down the road to teach a lesson for the preschoolers. I had made beautiful little magnetic snowflakes that the students could take home with them. The snowflakes went along with the story I'd be reading in about an hour.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
I was completely prepared and had spent a lot of time thinking through the lesson and carefully paying attention to detail. As I was about to leave, I recognized how miserably cold it was outside and wondered if I could find a ride, even though the preschool was actually on campus. I asked my roommate if I could borrow her car, knowing there was little chance since it was a leased vehicle and her dad had forbidden her to let anyone drive it. But I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask. She turned me down. She also wasn't able to take me because she had to go to class herself. She apologized, but didn't seem too sympathetic. (What really irked me was that I found out later that she had let her boyfriend borrow her car for a much longer drive than the one I needed to take! I've since forgiven her... I think.)&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Next I tried to call my brother, but couldn't get a hold of him. He was probably in class as well. Due to the early hour, most everyone was in class, so no one else was around to ask either. So I bundled up in my warmest, flannel-lined overalls and fur coat and trekked down to the preschool. The snow swirled around me in fury and I was near to tears with my own inner-fury at my roommate who could have helped me avoid this situation.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Gladly arriving at the preschool, I barged in ready to teach my well-prepared lesson, only to discover that another classmate was there teaching her lesson. I couldn't believe it! I knew I had written down the correct date, but something went wrong. The regular teachers didn't have time to fill me in that day, so instead of teaching my beautifully created lesson, I left to trudge back up the hill in the angry snow. Tears streaming down my face, I arrived back at the dorm. I was wearing my clunky wooden clogs and ran up the stairs as I had done a thousand times before. But I slipped... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This example is a memoir because it's a slice of life as opposed to a complete autobiography. It shows a picture of one day in the life of this person. It is the emotional retelling of a story from the narrator's perspective. Notice that the narrator does not focus on relationships or events surrounding this one event, but just on the event itself. The focus is all of the details that caused this day to be the worst of this person's life. If other threads such as the relationship with the roommate or details about the Children's Literature class had been added, the focus would have been lost in the muddle of too many details. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a memoir, the focus must stay tight. Think of taking a picture with a camera. Think about what you want to be in the picture and what would distract from the picture. Have you ever taken a picture where there was a lot of white space at the top and what was supposed to be the focus: the people, are just tiny dots at the bottom? This is what happens to a story when the focus is too broad. See the [[Basic Writing/Invention]] section of this book wikitext for help on narrowing your topic. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Example 2:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;On my worst day I was supposed to get up early so I could get out to my folks’ house on account that my mama needed me to help her take our old dog to the vet.  My mama needed my help because she’s not a very big person and our dog is really big.  She also has a bad knee.  My mama, I mean, not the dog.  Well anyway our dog is one of them Great Pyrenees, a great big white monster of a thing, and she’s got arthritis in her hips and spine something bad.  So my mama had to make an appointment to have her put down because our dog couldn’t even stand to eat or pee anymore.  That’s how bad off she was, you see.&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
So here I was supposed to get up early to help my mama load the dog into her car and my alarm doesn’t go off.  Luckily I wake up on my own and I’m not all that late yet so I hurry up and get dressed and run out of the house to my truck.  Then I take off towards my folks’ house kind of fast because I’m already behind schedule and I’m about half way there when all of a sudden I get a flat tire.  Making matters worse is the fact that it’s raining outside, been raining all night in fact and I guess that’s why my alarm didn’t work.  So I pull half into the ditch because the road doesn’t have a shoulder and of course the flat tire is on the passenger side which means that I have to work in the mud.  Even worse my little bottle jack won’t lift the truck on account it keeps sinking into the ground.  Well lately I’d had some bricks in the bed of my pick-up but when I go to get them out they aren’t there.  Now I’m pissed because I’m late, I’ve got a flat tire, I can’t get the jack to work because it’s raining and the ground is too soft, and some jackass has stolen a handful of worthless bricks from the bed of my truck.  This on top of the fact that our old dog’s got to be put down and my mama needs me to be there.  Still determined to make it, I root around in the ditch till I find a couple of rocks I can put under the jack.  I finally get my tire changed but by then I’m soaked to the bone and covered in mud, which means that I get my seat all wet and muddy too.&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
Finally I make it out to my folks’ place and my mama is sitting in the front yard with our dog and holding an umbrella over her.  I can plainly see that she’s in pretty bad shape, worse than the last time I saw her.  The dog, I mean, not my mama, although she’s looking pretty down herself.  She doesn’t bother to ask why I’m all wet and muddy, so I know things are bad for sure.  When I try to pick our old dog up to put her in the back of my mama’s Jimmy she yelps real loud and snaps at me.  I decided then and there that getting her to the vet wasn’t going to work.  She was too heavy and in too much pain to be messing with.  So I went and got my old red wagon out of my dad’s shop and carefully my mama and me lifted her onto it.&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
My mama knew what had to be done and so she says her goodbyes to our old dog.  Then I roll her slowly around the house to where we’ve buried other pets in the past and I dig a fairly large hole.  When I am finished I sit on the ground beside the old red wagon and talk to our dog for a bit, tell her what she’s meant to me all these years and that I am going to miss her.  I’d rather not say what happened after that other than I like to believe she understood it all and that it came as a relief to her.&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
When I get back to my place later I realize that I’d left in such a hurry earlier that I’d locked myself out of the house.  It had stopped raining by then, though, so I just sit for a while in a lawn chair there on my porch.  Then I look over and see the bricks still lying there where I’d stacked them a few days before and forgotten.  Suddenly I start laughing then and can’t stop, keep laughing till tears run down my cheeks.  Looking back on it now that seems pretty weird since it had been such a terrible day. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This example, like the one above it, is also memoir.  It is similar in that it also describes a day in the writer's life and is necessarily limited only to those details that are relevant to the story and that move the narrative forward.  A good exercise, though, might be to examine how these two samples from the same genre are different.  Do both sound as if they are spoken by the same &quot;voice&quot;?  What details from each might you use to argue the speakers' gender?  Does either &quot;sound&quot; female/male?  Also note that Example 2 reads much more like spoken language--is that appropriate for this genre, or should the writer have written in a more academic or formal manner?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  

'''Example 3:'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was standing in the middle of Dollar Tree, leaning on my cart, when I said, &quot;What?&quot; to my mom telling me about my little black cat, Baby, being found dead a few days earlier.  &quot;Baby's dead, honey.&quot;  I couldn't say anything.  What could I say?  I had been the one to take her to the farm thinking that she would adjust and be happier as a farm cat.  Besides, I had too many cats, six actually, and Baby and Ginger had been the most logical choices to relocate. Both of them were unhappy living in such a small environment with four other cats.  Baby suffered from anxiety problems and Ginger just wanted more territory.  She was always so bitchy, hissing like she owned everything and everyone.  Adorable, yes, but incredibly bitchy.  Baby just wanted to be alone, or with me.  The only way I could get her to come out of hiding is if I'd sing to her - any song with her name in it.  Her favorite one was the one from the movie ''Dirty Dancing'' &quot;Ba-byyy, ohh-ohhh ba-byyy, my sweet ba-byyy, you're the one. . .&quot;  When I'd sing it to her, she'd roll 'round on the floor and rub against me as if to say, &quot;I reeeaaallly love you!&quot;  I'll never be able to listen to that song without missing her now.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Honey, are you alright?&quot; my mom asked quietly.  No, I'm not alright.  I knew something was wrong.  I had a feeling several days ago - one of those feelings that tell you something is wrong, but I chose to ignore it.  &quot;How did she die?&quot;  I ask, trying to keep my emotions under control.  It's no use though, tears start streaking my face and Dollar Tree customers are beginning to stare.  &quot;They found her dead in the cabin,&quot; mom said, her voice choking, &quot;I'm so sorry, hon.&quot;  &quot;She was still in the cabin?!&quot; I practically shout into the phone.  &quot;I thought Laura picked her up to take her to her house.&quot;  Mom grew quiet.
After a few moments she said, &quot;They never could catch her.  Dad said that they looked for her every day.  They moved the furniture and everything but they couldn't find her.  Now they think that maybe she might have climbed behind the fridge to hide.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I was livid, but I knew it would just kill mom and dad if I blamed them for this.  Despite this fact, I had to ask one last question, &quot;Mom, why didn't you guys call me and tell me that you were having problems with her?  I could've come home to take care of her.  I told you that I smelled natural gas or something on the day that we dropped her off at the cabin.  Why didn't someone call me?!&quot;  At this point I was hysterical and customers were steering their shopping carts way around me.  When my mom finally answered her comforting voice was gone. Replacing it was one of defense and insensitivity.  &quot;We did the best we could!  Dad's been so depressed lately and this almost pushed him over the edge.  He knows how much you love your cats and he's blaming himself.  It's not his fault and it's not yours either!  Do you hear me?&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
All I could do was cry.  I didn't want to hurt them, but I just couldn't understand why they chose not to call me.  And I do blame myself.  I knew that something was wrong, and knowing that she was alone in that cabin for two weeks, going through god knows what, thinking god knows what, well it just killed me inside.  I was filled with guilt.  I had rescued her as a baby, beaten and left for dead and now, seven years later I just pawn her off on someone else and she dies alone?  I don't even want to know how much pain she may have been in.  How in the world will I deal with the guilt of knowing that all of this could've been avoided?  How?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=#555555&gt;&lt;em&gt;This example is also similar to the above examples so the same comments apply.  It is a narrative memoir, however there are two elements within this memoir that set it apart from the above examples.  First of all, it includes dialogue which is somewhat tricky when writing.  The most important thing to remember is that dialogue should sound natural - like the voice of the person speaking.  Practice saying it out loud as if reading a script for an audition.  Also, when using dialogue make sure the reader can understand who is saying what.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Another element that was included in this example was a specific use of stylized writing during the recitation of Baby's favorite song and her response to that song.  This style of writing is becoming more popular in mainstream writing - especially comedic novels.  An example of this style of writing can be found throughout the novel, &lt;U&gt;The Nanny Diaries&lt;/U&gt;, by Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Social Groups==

==Types of Social Groups==
Social Groups can loosely be defined as people sharing the same social relation {{ref|Dictionary.com 2009}}. In depth, a social group is a group of people outside of the domestic unit relating on grounds other than kinship {{ref| James 2009}} although kinship relationships may exist.  There are two basic categories of groups, the primary group and the secondary group.  The primary group consists of people who interact with each other and know each other personally, while the secondary group consists of people who identify with each other on some common ground but who may never meet with one another or interact personally
There are several different types of social groups:

===Friendship===
Friendship is a term in which the meaning completely relies on the culture where the friendship exists. In Western cultures friendship is a term that’s used almost haphazardly. There are many different degrees of friendships, for example many college students react in a friendly manner to people they have only met a couple of times. While there are some deeper relationships as well, friendship seems to always come second to kin. In other cultures friendship is considered sacred and a ritual is utilized as a declaration of such. An example of this is the Bangwa of Cameroon. The Bangwa believe that friendships are more important than relations among kin {{ref|Schultz and Lavenda 2009}}.

===Clubs and Fraternities ===
[[image:Chico State's Kendall Hall.JPG|thumb|right|Chico State University]]  
A club is defined as a group of people organized for a common purpose, especially a group that meets regularly {{ref| James 2009}}. A type of club that exists on college campuses are fraternities/sororities. These social groups usually require some sort of initiation or “hazing” that can be beneficial socially and on the other hand potentially be dangerous. In 2005 Matthew Harrington died due to a hazing accident. He was a pledge to the Chi Tau fraternity at Chico State University in California, the fraternity members that conducted the hazing received felony charges, and in result strict hazing bans were placed into action at the university {{ref|Korry 2009}}. Although fraternities can cause many ill effects, they can also be used to gain political/career building advantages. Around one quarter of the chief executives on the Forbes 500 list were members of fraternities. During job interviews, the interviewer may make a better connection with someone they’re interviewing if they were members of the same fraternity {{ref|Dukcevich 2003}}.

===Counterculture Groups===
[image:Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-11929,_USA,_New_Yersey,_Ku-Klux-Klan.jpg‎|thumb|right|Ku Klux Klan in Atlantic City, New Jersey, 1931.]]
A counter culture group is a group of people that come together to oppose the dominant form of a social system. There are many different types of these groups, perhaps the most recognizable example of this would be the Ku Klux Klan. This group originated in 1866 in Tennessee. They would wear all white to play the dead of the confederates during the civil war. They represented “white- supremacy” and would mainly torture, kill, or harass African-Americans and any other minority {{ref|Columbia Encyclopedia 2008}}. 
Another notable major counterculture revolution occurred between the 1960's and 1970's, when many American youth began rejecting social norms, experimenting with drugs such as LSD, exploring new spirituality and sexuality, and supporting social movements such as civil rights, women's rights, and anti-war policies. Counter culture of the 1960s and 1970s was also characterized by a music and art scene which included psychedelic rock and pop art. &lt;ref&gt; Cliff's notes. http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/CliffsReviewTopic/The-Counterculture-of-the-1960s.topicArticleId-25238,articleId-25229.html &lt;/ref&gt;A more recent counterculture group is characterized by forms of body modification.  This group feels the connection because of their interest in permanently changing their body, such as through tattooing, branding, piercing, and cutting. Participants often interact online through websites such as Suicidegirls.com and BME.com.

===Work Groups and Cooperatives ===
These types of groups work together for the purpose of production. This relates to an autonomous work group where employees are assigned to a specific project and it is known who is assigned to what and who will be held responsible for each portion of the project {{ref|Business Dictionary 2009}}.  Cooperatives are a form of economic group with two key features, surpluses are shared among members and decision making follows the democratic principal of one person, one vote. Agricultural cooperatives are the most common followed by credit cooperatives and then consumer cooperatives.   

; Farmers' Cooperatives in Western India :
In an ethnographic study found in Cultural Anthropology by Barbara Miller, the farmers in India's western state of Maharashtra were studied and the sugar industry there was found to be largely owned and operated through farmer cooperatives.  While the sugar industry there is huge, near the size of the state's iron and steel industry, most shareholders are small farmers that produce just one or two acres of sugarcane but they are owned and managed cooperatively.  The reason the sugar cooperatives are so successful in this region is because the rural social stratification system in Maharashtra is simpler than in northern India.  They have strong local ties with each other because their marital arrangements are local and centralized and therefore have a better basis for cooperating with each other.  This example of cooperatives shows that the social stratification can help groups work together for the purpose of production.

===Secret Societies===
Secret society is a term loosely used to describe a fraternal group whose organization is kept secret and possess, or claims to posses, some form of secret. These societies may also include special rituals and oath taking. Sometimes secret societies are formed with political intentions, such groups are illegal in certain countries. One of the most notable secret societies is the Freemasons. Freemasonry is a fraternal organization with restricted membership dating back to 1390. Their membership includes many successful people from around the world including ex-presidents and kings. Another example of a secret society is the secretive Skull and Bones society of Yale. Every spring 15 Juniors of distinction are selected to become part of the Skull and Bones, among them have been both George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, whose nickname in the group was Temporary. 

===Self-Help Groups===
Are organized to achieve personal goals, and are becoming increasingly popular. Selfhelpgroups.org has a data base including 1,100 self help groups nationwide. The individuals in these groups have common problems and are there to support each other. Members often share experiences with their specific problem, and try to reach common goals.

===Online Communities===
A community of people from oftentimes many different cultures and regions meeting together to discuss something in common or to contribute work to various online projects. Some examples of this online are video game modding communities like www.moddb.com and www.fpsbanana.com. Aside from websites for video games the there are chat rooms and forums like www.4chan.org which is the largest English image board on the web as well as a place that many of the popular internet memes spring from.

Aside from traditional internet boards and sites there are online games that bring people together from across the world, [[w:Mmorpg|Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games]] like [[w:World of Warcraft|World of Warcraft]], [[w:Guild Wars|Guild Wars]], and [[w:Second Life|Second Life]], where the user is encouraged to play with others to better enhance their status proceed through an online “environment” and the more “solitary” [[w: Fps|First Person Shooters]] such as [[w:Counterstrike|Counterstrike]], [[w:Quake|Quake]] and [[w:Doom_(video_game)|Doom]] with its sequels.

[[Image:Sa Pa kiss.jpg|thumb|right|What internet dating services can provide.]]Another large internet community consists of online dating websites and databases. Essentially, having lost hope in one's own ability to go out and find a partner on their own, they turn to websites that match people based on the personal information that they provide. Some popular sites are [[w:eHarmony|eHarmony]], [[w:Match.com|Match.com]], and [[w:chemistry.com|chemistry.com]]. eHarmony, which is the most well known site, has been criticized for not matching gay individuals. The founder claims this is due to lack of information on gay-relationship compatibility.

===Gangs===
Gangs are comprised of individuals who identify as gang members and regularly associate, often in the pursuit of illegal activities, such as trafficking weapons and drugs. Street gangs carry out these activities in the cities and suburbs. Prison gangs often are responsible for handling contraband (drugs, alcohol) within prison and may participate in acts of violence against other prison members as a means of intimidation. Prison gangs may also have significant influence over organized crime on the streets, as leadership is oftentimes maintained by imprisoned members, who direct orders for street murders, drug trafficking, and other gang activities. Gang members released from prison are expected to continue participating with the gang. Notable prison gangs include the Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacy gang, and La Eme, or the Mexican Mafia.
Biker gangs, such as the Hells Angels, may range in size (Hells Angels being a large gang) and travel the United States on motorcycle. 

Gangs may practice ritual initiations, or follow the policy of blood-in blood-out in which an individual must commit murder to be accepted into the gang, and is killed upon attempting to disassociate from the gang. Gangs underline loyalty and often use clothing, tattoos, and gang signs to identify themselves and to identify fellow and rival gang members. Persons who have not gained entry to a gang but have gang tattoos may be killed - while small gangs often require members to know one another personally, large gangs, such as La Eme, depend on markers such as tattoos. 

Confrontation between rival gangs is often violent. A notable gang rivalry is between the Bloods and the Crips, street gangs from Los Angeles, who self-identify through the use of red clothing and blue clothing, respectively. The rivalry began in the 1970s, when the Bloods rose in competition with the Crips in crack production and distribution.

Gangs are often racially uniform. Sorenos, Nuestra Familia, and La Eme are predominately Latin American. The Bloods and Crips are predominately African American. Biker gangs are predominately white.&lt;ref&gt; Wikipedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang &lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Stratification, Power and Conflict ==
=== Social Stratification ===
Social stratification is when societies have a permanent hierarchy, in which a superior group has a disproportionate amount of power, money and prestige than the lower ranking groups. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification Social stratification] can be seen in western societies in social and economic classes; termed as lower, middle and upper class. Some anthropologists believe social stratification is necessary to keep a society functioning at its desired level of proficiency. [[w:Karl Marx|Karl Marx]] saw social stratification as similar to a caste system. Gender is part of the stratification system, gender ranks men above women of the same race and class (patriarchal society), but this is not always the only form of social stratification. In some societies, women are ranked above men; these societies are termed matriarchal. As Nancy Jay said: “That which is defined, separated out, isolated from all else is A and pure. Not-A is necessarily impure, a random catchall, to which nothing is external except A and the principle of order that separates it from Not-A.” In Western society, “man” is A, and “woman” is Not-A.&lt;ref&gt; Jay, Nancy. 1981. &quot;Gender and Dichotomy.&quot; Feminist Studies 7, 38-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Working classes were unlikely to move up in social economic power due to their means of production while the wealthy would continue their reign over the lower classes, maintaining a social status quo through manipulation and exploitation.
The degree of social stratification in a given society is dependent at least partially on what type of society it is.  For instance, in a hunter-gatherer society or a pastoral society, there is very little economic and social stratification, because everything is shared.  In an industrial or post industrial society, on the other hand, economic stratification is greater and social stratification grows partly out of that economic disparity.  The reason for economic stratification is that in the modern workplace, the amount of money that someone earns varies greatly based on location, education, competence, and luck.  The CEO of a large corporation might make millions of dollars each year, while the lower level employees of that same corporation might make minimum wage.  What makes social stratification based on wealth better than other forms of social stratification is that, although it might be very difficult, it is almost always possible for someone to change their status for the better.

==Ascribed Status==
Ascribed status is the position in society that is delegated to an individual at birth. Ascribed statuses that exist in all societies include those based upon sex, age, race, ethnic group and family background. In many instances, this status is a social construct already pre-determined before one is born into the specific culture.

One prominent example of ascribed status is seen in India's caste system, or varna. The varna system is broken into five parts. From highest to lowest status, they are:
:'''Brahman''' - priests
:'''Kshatriya''' - land owners
:'''Vaishya''' - merchants
:'''Shudra''' - artisans/agriculturalists
:'''Harijans''' - untouchables

It is nearly impossible to move up in ascribed status in this caste system, though jatis, or sub-castes, have the ability to change status over many generations through relocation or marriage.{{ref|Callaham &amp; Pavich}}

===='''Race'''====
While race is a social creation, it is also an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascribed_status ascribed status]. Race is determined without regard to an individual’s efforts or aspirations, but rather, by heritable, often external characteristics such as skin color, hair texture, or body type. Race is dealt to the individual, outside of their control, as a means of categorizing human beings by obvious characteristics. Race functions as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_status master status].  Through this, race has the capability of influencing an individual’s social perception and life possibilities.  This can have a damaging impact on races categorized as social minorities.  As a social creation, racial designations can change as people’s impressions change.[http://books.google.com/books?id=tUhrAal6LvEC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=ascribed+status+race&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WwWxmPBpOL&amp;sig=S8Yy4uJ2mzYshIzreuq2TIceLbc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3GysSai5DYnOsAOTm9THBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA168,M1] [[Image:Persecution_of_witches.jpg‎|right|thumb|Persecution of witches.|400px|]]

An ethnographic representation of ascribed status through racial identity is that of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch witch].  Several centuries ago in North America, the distinction of being known as a witch held negative social connotations.  The false notions connected to this important social grouping brought about witch burning.  However, no one, not even the ascribed witches, connected themselves with the erroneous characteristics in which they were affiliated.  While social identities are important to the foundation of cultures, in many cases, including that of witches, the outcomes of these beliefs are destructive.

=====Racism=====

Racism, by its simplest definition is the belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race. People with racist beliefs may resent certain groups of people according to their race. In the case of institutional racism, certain racial groups may be denied rights or benefits, or get preferential treatment. Racial discrimination typically points out taxonomic differences between different groups of people, even though anybody can be racialized, independently of their somatic differences. According to the United Nations conventions, there is no distinction between the term racial discrimination and ethnic discrimination. 

When looking at Racism there are two other important factors to consider, prejudice and discrimination. Racism does encompass both of these factors, but each show a different side to this overall idea. Prejudice is the attitude that the person posses about a certain group or category of people, for example a particular race or religious group, while discrimination is the actual act of racism towards that particular group or category of people. &lt;ref&gt; S. Dale Mclemore. Race and Ethnic Relations in America &lt;/ref&gt;

There are five main elements that define the minority group that help keep this group in a subordinate and oppressed by the majority group 1) They receive unequal representation and treatment compared to other groups in the political area. 2) The group is easily identifiable and devalued physical and or cultural traits. 3) The group have a sense of self consciousness, the knowing that they are different or stand out. 4)Membership is based on decent or hereditary. 5) Most marriage are pursued within the group with their own members. 
There are also five main elements that define the majority group that allows for them to stay in power. 1)Superior in the political arena 2) They have valued physical and/ or cultural traits 3) A lower sense of self consciousness, not aware that they are not the common man. 4) membership is also by decent 5) Marriage usually occurs within the group. &lt;ref&gt; S. Dale Mclemore. Racial and Ethnic Relations in America. &lt;/ref&gt;
These five major credentials for both groups allow for the social and political separation to occur and flourish in the United States. Especially since the membership is based on decent and marriage tends to stay within group. If these ideas and components are never to be overcame the inequality between the races will last for many years.

A prominent example of racism involves the Montgomery Bus Boycott and [[Wikipedia:Rosa_Parks|Rosa Parks]]. Parks, who was sitting in the section of the bus designated for whites, refused to give up her seat to a white man. She was arrested, and the Montgomery Bus Boycott was started. This was a prime example of the lower status that was given to black people in the 1950's and the time before Martin Luther King Jr. Another prime example is segregation in the secondary school systems throughout the southern states. By allowing legal segregation within the school system, which was inaccurately classified as separate but equal, it not only produced disheartened black children and kept them from experiencing equality under the law, but also opened the door to institutionalized racism. &lt;ref&gt; Joe R. Feagin. Systemic racism. http://books.google.com/books?id=z-v8_BkQ2n8C&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=systematic+racism+began+with+segregation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hcC8JhRupZ&amp;sig=Fktl3IP7gpQTZVsolPv9MUhzDGI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6Qr5SZbkOKWEtAO67onGCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===='''Ethnicity'''====

From an anthropological perspective, [[w:ethnicity|ethnicity]] can be defined as social classification used to create groups based on cultural features, such as religion, language, dress, food, family, and art.  Ethnicity is separate from race because ethnicity can be acquired while race is largely based on the biological and geographic characteristics of an individual of which they have little control.  Ethnicity develops as a result of the struggle between self-ascription (cultural insiders’ attempts to define their cultural identity) and other-ascription (cultural outsiders’ attempts to define the cultural identities of other groups).  This struggle often forms new ethnic groups that are not the identical to earlier ethnic groups. [6]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In an ethnographic report written by John Matthiasson, he explains the political importance of the ascribed names and culture of the Inuit in the Canadian Arctic.  As discussed above, ascription affects how a culture is viewed and how the culture views themselves.  Matthiasson reported that before 1970, the Inuit were referred to by others as well as themselves as &quot;Eskimos&quot;.  Following 1970, the origin of the word (which roughly translates to “eaters of raw meat”) was considered derogatory and nearly all of the Inuit stopped referring to themselves as Eskimos.  This account relates back to ethnic groups because as Matthiasson suggests, “the names by which we refer to ourselves or others can be used to manipulate our identity and to align with or isolate ourselves from others, as well as to rationalize our treatment of others”.  [6]

====''Caste System''====
[[Image:Beggar India.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Dalit's in Jaipur. An “untouchable” or Dalit is considered outside of the caste system. They are the lowest of the low in the Indian social stratification.]]
The [[w:caste system in India|caste system in India]] is a system of social stratification and ascribed status in which people are hierarchically organized by means of social and economic status. Although it is most commonly associated with the [[w:Caste System|Caste System]] country of India and the religion of [[w:Hinduism|Hinduism]], places such as Japan, China, Bali, Hawaii, and Europe also demonstrate caste-like systems. 

Abiding by the Caste System ultimately allows the people in the highest caste to control the rest of society and keep social barriers from being crossed. In India, the caste consists of five different levels. Ranging from highest caste to lowest they are named:

*Vedas(The Enlightened)
*Brahmins[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin]
*Kshatriyas[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kshatriya]
*Vaishyas[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishya]
*Shudras[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shudra]
Brahmans (priests and teachers), Kshatriyas (rulers and soldiers), Vaisyas (merchants and traders), and Sudras (laborers). Below these castes are the &quot;Untouchables&quot; or the Achuta  ([[w:Dalit|Dalit]]). Within these five levels are thousands of different castes (and sub-castes) known as jatis. When a person is born, they are placed into the caste that they will remain in throughout their life, during marriage, old age, and eventually death. 

The &quot;Untouchables&quot; are taught early on that they are born into their caste to pay for bad behavior in their previous lives. They are limited to jobs considered too gruesome for anyone else such as taking care of human waste.  Completely segregated from the rest of society, the &quot;Untouchables&quot; are treated worse than animals in extreme - but not rare - circumstances. Historically, there were advantages to being one of the dalits, such as the division of labor and cultural pride, but today the designation of &quot;untouchable&quot; is looked upon as tool to keep the oppressed and poor in their place.

Although this tradition and as well as it's social expectations that have deep roots in Indian society, slowly reform is happening. America frowns upon the caste system, due to the beliefs that all men are created equal and have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of success that drives this nation. But the real question is: Does the US's capitalist society inhibit the creation of a caste system? A division of economic class inevitably leads a caste system, as does having an upper-middle class or a lower-middle class or even people below the poverty line creates a caste?
For example, in a Bombay neighborhood some city workers must remove sewage waste. People with these occupations that are characterized as polluting are ranked at the bottom of the Hindu caste society. The social stratification results in the lower income workers having the &quot;dirty work&quot; and polluting occupations. Having these kinds of occupations continues the poverty because of how little they are paid for the less desirable jobs.

====''Religion''====
[[Image:Child baptism with water.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Baptism of a child by affusion]]
An individuals [[w:ascribed status|ascribed status]] can also be defined through one's religion.  People tend to identify with the religion that their family has chosen to follow.  Certain religions assign specific social norms for the followers of the religion, these norms may differ from those that a larger group of people choose to follow.  A family's religion has the potential to play a major role in the upbring in their children's lives, therefore they are ascribed a specific religious status.  Religion or lack of religion are both attributes of ascribed status.

Undergoing [[w:baptism|baptism]] or even just being born into a family that follows a specific religion gives a child an ascribed status based on that religion.  While a child may be born into a family who follows the religion of Christianity, this does not automatically determine the religious practices of the child. Often children will be raised with Christian principles, but as with most religions, it is time, coming of age, and over all life experiences that will ultimately determine their beliefs. It is a common practice of the Christian religion to dedicate and baptize young children as a public confirmation of that child's upraising through the particular social practices of the religion. However, some families choose to only confirm the child, allowing them to make the decision, when and if they so choose, to dedicate their own life through baptism. 

Religion comes with political inferences. These implications may entail critical practical and abstract problems. On an abstract level, both religion and politics are usually seen to be in opposition to one another in practice but many politicians advertise their religion in order to obtain votes. However, in day to day life, they interrelate. Religion and politics have always been the two main sources of power related laws and guidelines governing how people should live their lives. In recent times countries like the US have worked to keep them separate so that no religion is able to control powers that would allow for the exploitation of other religions; however, countries such as India have a political and social system, the caste system, based around their religious teachings. &lt;ref&gt;Raymond Firth 1981 Spiritual Aroma: Religion and Politics: American Anthropologist Volume 83. Issue 3. January (Pages 582 - 601) http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=0002-7294&amp;volume=83&amp;issue=3&amp;supplement=0&amp;article=10.2307_676754&amp;jstor=True&amp;error=infoAccessDenied&lt;/ref&gt;

===='''Gender Typing'''====
The [[w:ascribed status|ascribed status]] of an individual based on sex is known as gender typing. Most societies participate in this process. In gender typing, certain activities are reserved for males and others for females. Crossing the gender roles set forth by society is often frowned upon in communities that participate in the practice. The vast majority of gender typing is culturally generated and not a creation of inborn biological distinctions between the sexes.[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=gender+typing+definition&amp;btnG=Search&amp;cts=1236637543507]

An ethnographic example of gender typing can be observed in the early development of children in the United States. From birth, some U.S. parents set their children up for certain sexual categories by giving their babies gender distinct names, clothes, and environments. The gender roles ascribed by the parents lead to differences in intellectual and emotional development. For example, girls are provided with toys that encourage them to learn social rules and imitate behaviors. For example the Barbie toy encourages girls towards certain dress and hair styles. Also Barbies daily activities often include cleaning, cooking and shopping. In contrast, boys are given more active toys and encouraged to explore. Such as video games, play doctor kits, airplane model kits, etc. As a result of this early childhood gender typing, elementary school girls typically say they would choose lower paid, lower status careers such as, Nurse, teacher, or stewardess. Boys, because of their exposure to freedom of exploration, are more likely to obtain higher paid, higher status careers such as, pilot, architect, doctor, or lawyer. [http://books.google.com/books?id=-t3Ll3mkA20C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=ascribed+status,+sex&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6vMiAMXmYE&amp;sig=eikTO7fmJqYTZJ5pRUs8ZJ6Rld8]

==Achieved Status==
[[w:achieved status|Achieved status]] refers to social position that one earns throughout his or her life. These statuses may be earned based on one's skill level, potential, and determination. Many sociologists think that various factors such as education, employment, and income have a sufficient impact on achieved status.  Achieved status is the opposite of ascribed status, that is to say that it is a position in society that is not delegated to a person at birth.

One example of achieved status is the term &quot;pull yourself up by your bootstraps&quot;, essentially meaning work hard, and you will get places even if you start with nothing. This is perhaps the more respected and felt to be more deserved in many cultures including the United States.  An example of the high respect American's give to those who do &quot;pull themselves up by the bootstraps&quot; is the story of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Gardner Christopher Gardner], a man from San Francisco who hit rock bottom, eventually becoming homeless with his young son. Gardner had persistance and worked hard for months to gain a career as a stockbroker, and eventually became a millionaire. This is a story of real success and probably more interesting to many Americans than the stories about heiresses and heirs. Gardner wrote a book entitled, &lt;u&gt;The Pursuit of Happyness&lt;/u&gt; depicting his situation and in 2006 a feature film based on the book was released with the same title. 

Many state that this type of &quot;rags to riches&quot; story that exemplifies the &quot;American Dream&quot; is a rare occurrence.  This is referred to as the Horatio Alger Myth.  In actuality, evidence suggests that inequality is greatly increasing and social mobility is becoming more and more difficult in American society.  As class divisions increase, the likelihood of a person accomplishing what Chris Gardner was able to accomplish diminishes, and is replaced with a more realistic scenario in which the bright and talented are unable to escape poverty.   &lt;ref&gt; Paul Krugman:  The Death of Horatio Alger.  http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040105&amp;s=krugman &lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Education &amp; Employment===
In the workplace today, acquiring a college degree is an important part of either attaining or sustaining an achieved status. When a worker begins, they are easily replaceable. If they are to obtain a higher education, they become well qualified and are less likely to lose their job. Many today are not only working towards their [[w:Associate's Degree|Associate’s Degree]] but their [[w:Bachelor’s degree|Bachelor's]], [[w:Master’s Degree|Master's]] and more. Those who are knowledgeable well trained, and influential within their job are considered to have an “achieved status”.

===Income===

Those born within a lower class or start jobs with lower [[w:Income|incomes]] are more likely to acquire an “achieved status”. People who inherited power through family are considered to have an &quot;ascribed status&quot;. (Their income is likely to be high from the beginning).

===Cultural Example of Achieved Status===
American society possesses a number of examples of achieved status. In America, it is culturally acceptable (if you have the necessary resources) to begin life at the low end of the social ladder and to work your way up, by means of achieving a proper education, making useful social connections, and getting promoted within your career. Achieved status is not a position that a person is born into, but rather, it is attained through effort; this includes becoming an Olympic athlete, a doctor, or even a criminal. Although this struggle from the low end of the social ladder to the upper has become ingrained in the idea of America (The American Dream), the actual occurrence of someone rising from lower class to higher class is extremely rare.

===Types of Political Organization===
There are four types of political organization within groups and they are split between centralized or uncentralized political systems. The four groups are bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and states. States and chiefdoms are centralized while tribes and bands are uncentralized or also known as egalitarian groups. 

A [[w:band society|band society]] is a foraging group and is the smallest group of political organization ranging anywhere from 20 to 200 people but typically consisting of about 80 people. Most of the people within this group are relatives either by birth or marriage. Since a band is a foraging society they do not have a place of permanent residence because they are constantly moving around. The reason a band is referred to as egalitarian is because there is no distinction between an upper and a lower class but they do have a leader, but not in the traditional sense because they have no power, or influence over people.

The other uncentralized group is a [[w:tribe|tribe]] which falls somewhere between a band and one of the more centralized groups. They are comprised of several bands but their leadership is based on ascribed and achieved statuses, some tribes may have a chief, and their organization is based on kinship. A tribe is more reliant on horticulture and pastoralism rather than foraging like bands and are usually a larger group than bands. A sub division of a tribe is the “Big man” system and they have a very influential person as the leader of the group but this person does not have formal authority.

The [[w:Bushmen|Bushmen]] of South Africa are traditionally a society of people that are comprised of a band and thus egalitarian. Since they moved around a lot they had traditional gear that they wear which included a hide sling, blanket, and cloak in order to carry their food, firewood, a digging stick and even a separate smaller cloak to carry a baby. The woman gather and the men typically hunt in this society and the children do not have jobs.

In a [[w:Chiefdom|Chiefdom]], the people are led by one person known as a chief. The chief governs over a group of tribes which are related through blood or marriage. This centralized style of government has a social hierarchy and economic stratification unlike bands and tribes. On the other hand, a [[w:state|state]] is much more centralized than a chiefdom and has formal laws and authority. They have power to tax, maintain law and order, and to keep track of their citizens.

===='''Nation, Nationalities and Nation-State'''====
In the past, [[w:nations|nations]] came about when groups of people who were similar in ways such as language, appearance, religious beliefs, and history came together to form territories, [[w:nation-states|nation-states]], and eventually countries. Out of these nations came the sense of [[w:nationalities|nationalities]] and [[w:nationalism|nationalism]].
:'''Nation''': A group of people believed to share the same history, culture, identity and oftentimes ethnicity.
:'''Nation-State''': A political unit consisting of an autonomous state inhabited predominantly by a people sharing a common culture, history and language. [http://http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nation-state?qsrc=2888]
:'''Nationality''': The sense of belonging and loyalty to a particular nation that comes about through origin, birth or naturalization.[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nationality?qsrc=2888] Often, government officials will encourage citizens to feel loyalty and devotion for their nation-states; this is called nationalism.
::[[w:Nation-building|Nation-building]]: ''An effort to instill a sense of nationality into the citizens of a state.''

== Power ==
''Measure of a person's ability to control the environment around them, including the behavior of other people.''

&quot;Human beings actively work to reshape the environments in which they live to suit their own purposes.&quot; (Schultz&amp; Lavenda, &lt;u&gt;Cultural Anthropology&lt;/u&gt;) This quote is linked to the definition of ''power'' in its' cultural usage. If a human being's environment includes citizens then their power is measured by how much control they have over the masses. Political power is the most common form of power in the world. If one has a seat in the government then that person has a certain level of power over their subordinates. 
=== Types of Power ===
'''1. Money'''
Money, in many countries today, is the foremost source of power. In countries and societies where money is the main source of exchange, those that are more wealthy can often use it as power by using their wealth to their own benefit or to the benefit of their community. IOU's, the first form of currency, have been used for many centuries. The first actual currency was printed in 1685 and was given to men in the French military in Canada, and were then given value in an exchange market. (First printed Currency) Today there are over 178 currencies in use (CIA World Factbook), with most countries using the currency they produce themselves. Money in any form of currency can be exchanged for other types of currency, thus making the power of money worldwide.

'''2. Social Class'''
Social class is the hierarchy among members of a society. Often people are born into it. It is gained through money, or through education or career. In some cultures people must stay within their social class through life, and in other cultures it is allowable or even more respected if people work their way up the social ladder. The class a person belongs to is often associated with an identity or subculture within society. People of a higher class associate and have similar lives as people within that class, and the same goes for people of the lower or middle classes. One extreme example of class is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste caste] system in India which divides people into five different groups within society. The highest caste is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman Brahman], or “priest” and the lowest caste is the [[w:Harijan|Harijan]], or the “untouchables.” In this system people are born into their casts and usually marry others from the same group and remain a part of their cast for their entire lives. (Callaham, Tom).

'''3. Physical Force'''
Physical force is using physical coercion as a means to gain power and control over others. Physical force may be one country threatening another with its military, or perhaps a neighborhood bully asserting his/her dominance with beatings or threats based on his/her physical stature, like the saying goes,&quot;speak softly and carry a big stick&quot; (Theodore Roosevelt). This is also known as the power of free agency; or &quot;the freedom of self contained individuals to pursue their own interests above everything else and to challenge another for dominance.&quot; This form of power is typically seen as physical coercion, which has been used by civilizations for thousands of years in order to survive. Stateless societies typically had this form of power employed, where locals feared other powerful locals, not the king or figurehead of the country. 

An example of physical force being used for free agency is the Gulf War. Iraq used their massive army to intimidate and conquer Kuwait so they could gain more monetary power in the form of oil. Oil, however, is the lifeblood of many western nations, and for the first time in its history, the United Nations formed a coalition to make sure that the U.S. and Western European Nations would continue to receive cheap gasoline throughout the remainder of the 20th century.  This is free agency because Iraq was pursuing its own interests without worrying about how the world or Kuwait would respond. The world then responded in an efficient manner and evicted Iraq from Kuwait, basically telling Iraq that they couldn't do whatever they want just because they are bigger than another country. [[File:Merkava tanks in northern Israel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Israeli Tanks.]]
	
Force usually rest solely in the hands of a person in high position of power. They are able to make others do certain task, or make them stop practicing certain rituals[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cultural_Anthropology/Ritual_and_Religion]. Force is usually used by using violence, threats and by putting fear into those being controlled. Force can be used in various situations and places like countries, religious sanctuaries, in homes, between two people, and or groups of people. However many people try to resist force and try to retaliate, which can often lead to harm being done to one or both parties involved.
	 
A prime example of the way force is used as a type of power is in the current war on Iraq. The American military invaded Iraq, and is implementing American value systems consistent with those of a constitutional republic rather than the traditional Muslim value systems of the former Islamic Democratic Parliamentary Republic. The military uses various ways to enforce this value system change on the Iraqi people, by using weapons, threats of further action and by imprisoning and capital execution of dissidents that forcefully retaliate against the laws and rules that have been enacted by the new Constitution. Force is the main type of power being used by both sides in their efforts to sway people to their disparate belief systems at the present time.

Another example of a way force is used as a type of power is rape, when a person or persons force themselves sexually on another with out given consent. Usually with  threats on the other to cooperate if they do not want to be harmed. This typically involves the offender hurting the other in order for them to do what they want. 

In new era of nuclear weapons and WMD, a small sized country can now carry far more force.  This indicates a transition of the typical definition of force for warfare from manpower to widespread devastation.  With the potential for smaller countries to have a much larger power than their size every before dictated, there have been new restrictions, from the currently more powerful countries, on these new powerful weapons. This can be shown by the North Korean missile tests that were condemned by the US Great Britan, France, Russia, Canada, Germany and, The United Nations.

'''4. Persuasion'''
[[w:Persuasion|Persuasion]]:''Power based on verbal argument (Schultz-Lavenda, 244).''Persuasion is the act of influencing others into adopting an idea. This is usually done through speech and rarely through physical acts. The ability to persuade is highly coveted and is often associated with powerful people in many societies, because those who can persuade can be trusted to speak for their people. This is why persuasive speakers speak for those in their societies. For example, the [[w:Huichol|Huichol Indians]] of Northern Mexico have shaman that see themselves as being able to speak for all of the Huichol and are often involved in negotiations with other societies because of their persuasive abilities. (Shultz-Lavenda 244-245)

There are countless uses for persuasion. The art of persuasion can be used to get humans into bed or to get them to buy material goods. You might use it to sell an idea like a new computer architecture, the end of hunger, a sustainable ecology or that gay and straight humans should have strict equality. You might use it to persuade humans to give up some bad habit like smoking tobacco, abusing alcohol, an obsolete violent religion or cruelty to animals and children. Some professions like rely very heavily on their ability to persuade others, this is especially true for lawyers and car salesmen.

Some basic tips for being a good persuader are:
1. Lead with non-controversial statements&lt;BR&gt;
2. Humans reason mostly by analogy. The key is finding the right analogy and letting them reason it through for themselves.&lt;BR&gt;
3. In debate, concede as many points as you possibly can. Your opponents will then perceive you as eminently reasonable and stop fighting you so hard.&lt;BR&gt;
4. Keep your sense of humor at all times. It is the best weapon for disarming a harsh critic.&lt;BR&gt;
5. Use colorful language. Play on all the senses.&lt;BR&gt;
6. A pause or complete silence is often more eloquent than any words. It also gives a chance for others to take up the charge.&lt;BR&gt;
7. Be as ruthlessly honest as you can. Be willing to share any detail about yourself. That way humans can get a sense of who you really are. They need that before they can trust you.&lt;BR&gt;
8. Praise the desired behavior in anyone who exhibits it. The others will mindlessly model the behavior to get praise.&lt;BR&gt;
9. Don’t bother with the reasons why you want humans to do something. Get into their heads. Why would they want to do it? People are much more likely to trust you if you obviously like them and have their desires and well being in consideration.&lt;BR&gt;
( ''CITATION'': Some tips taken from: http://mindprod.com/ethics/persuasion.html )

'''5. Fame'''
Combine the two main sources of power and what do you get? Fame. To many, fame means money and a high social class. They would be correct. Many western cultures look to those who are famous almost as idols. Money and a high social class, whether gained or born into, are closely related to celebrities and socialites. Those who gain or inherit fame are given power almost automatically, as though being able to act and sing or having the luck of being born into a wealthy family gives them the right to have power over others. Does it give them the right to act this way? No, but society believes this power belongs to the famous. [[Image:JenniferAnistonFeb09.jpg|thumb|right|Jennifer Aniston at the ''He's Just Not That Into You'' permiere.]]

An ethnographic example of the power that comes with fame would be celebrities. In the United States, celebrities are fawned over by their fans, and in some cases receive special treatment over non-celebrities. For example, in the case of imprisonment, celebrities are able to get out of prison early for no apparent reason. One celebrity who was able to get out early was Nicole Richie. Her sentence was four days for driving the wrong way down a road while drunk and she served an entire eighty-two minutes.[https://archive.is/20130628113655/www.associatedcontent.com/article/364087/a_glance_at_recent_celebrity_treatment_pg3.html?cat=9] Not all of the special treatment stars get is from prison, sometimes it is from night clubs like Jennifer Aniston, car dealerships like Britney Spears, or even zoos like Shaquille O’Neal.[http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2004-06-07-celebrity-treatment_x.htm] The culture in the United States allows this special treatment to continue and so it will.

'''6. Tradition'''
The power of Tradition in a culture can be defined as the possession of control or command over others through a long established way of thinking. This type of power is most asserted through means of religion. Religions have long histories, which inevitably create traditional customs, laws, beliefs and ways of thinking or processing. Power of tradition can also be used through cultural beliefs. Certain cultures have traditional beliefs that grant power logically to one sex over the other, such as in patriarchal or matriarchal cultures. Another accustomed form of power through tradition is in the workforce. As aforementioned, tradition creates customs, laws, beliefs and ways of thinking.

In an ethnographic attempt to further explain the power of tradition, examine the status of women in Islamic religion. In Farnaz Fassihi’s book of her reporting in Iraq post Saddam Hussein’s fall, she states how her gender is a reoccurring problem when Iraq’s policies are being greatly influenced by its Islamic traditions and its Islamic religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Sistani. Fassihi explains, “I never had to tiptoe around my gender the way I do now…at offices of political parties or clerics, I am required to stand outside under the sweltering sun because the waiting room is designated for men…the entrances to the holy shrines in Karbala and Najaf now have segregated entries with a…police officer checking the attire of visiting female” (Fassihi 116). Fassihi is appalled at the way women are thought of and are treated, but it is the power of tradition that allows men to carry on this way. The power of tradition creates customs within cultures and religions. In the Islamic faith, it is customary for women to dress modestly, in this sense women wear head-covers (see [[w:Women_in_Islam|Women in Islam]]). Tradition can furthermore create beliefs, such as the belief that women should not look men in the eye if outside of their immediate family.

===Kinds of Social Power===
* '''Interpersonal Power''' : ''The ability of one individual to impose his or her own will on another individuals (Schultz-Lavenda, 233).''
In its broadest sense, interpersonal power refers to any cause of any change in the behavior of one actor, B, which can be attributed to the effect of another actor, A. It sometimes refers to the capacity to cause such change (Weber [1918] 1968), sometimes to actual use of that capacity (Dahl 1957; Simon 1953) but always to overcoming the &quot;resistance&quot; of B (Weber [1918] 1968), hence causing B to do something B would not otherwise do (Dahl 1957). Interpersonal power is therefore the power of one individual &quot;over&quot; another as opposed to an individual's power to do something, the capacity of an actor to attain some goal (IPES, BookRags).
* '''Organizational Power''' : ''Highlights how individuals or social units can limit the actions of other individuals in particular social settings (Schultz-Lavenda, 233).''
Organizational Power Politics is about how individuals can achieve their objectives in organizational work groups. Office politics or organizational politics, is a significant part of the life of everyone who works with others in formal or informal groups. These relationships are power-tinged, and success can be attained only as we use power effectively. Understanding what power is and how it can be used to gain personal or group objectives is the focus of the book. It provides readers with specific recommendations about the situations in which power use can be effective, and it identifies those tactics most effective in leading subordinates and superiors toward the achievement of our goals.
This work will be of interest to scholars and practicing managers seeking information on how better to use organizational politics to attain personal and organizational goals. It provides insight into power theory, as well as a practical model for power use, strategic orientation, and operational tactics (Choice, Greenwood).
* '''Structural Power''' : ''Organizes social settings themselves and controls the allocation of social labor (Schultz-Lavenda, 233).''
Winter and Stewart (1978) have provided a useful [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy taxonomy] of power-related constructs linking the organizational and individual levels. Power as an attribute of particular social roles (e.g., jobs) locates individuals in organizational roles that legitimize or require actual power behavior (actions affecting the behavior and emotions of other people) from the individual for effective role performance. The enjoyment of power satisfaction, regardless of social role, requires both feeling powerful as a result of successful power behavior and the capacity to find that feeling gratifying. Thus, power as a source of job satisfaction depends on opportunities for power behavior, frequent successful outcomes of power behavior, and the experience of feeling powerful. This should be more likely in jobs that provide structural power as an attribute of the occupational role (Bnet).

These social [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power powers] are often used in a political situation. Becoming the greatest political power cannot only be won through war but also techniques of social power. With such diverse ability dominance in social situations is inevitable and opposing groups or individuals are conquered.

===The Role of the State===

Many early political anthropologists assumed that in order for a civilization to be socially civilized, a state was absolutely necessary.  They drew on western ideas that without a state, there would only be anarchy and disorder. Anthropologists such as Lewis Henry Morgan proved that there could be successful societies where an actual state is not present.  Instead, different people will have different roles, and political power is dispersed among the people.  Order within a social group can be maintained without a state as long as the group has a traditional process to organize itself. 

==== John Locke ====
[[w:John Locke|John Locke]] (1632-1704) was a British philosopher.  He was revered as being among the greatest thinkers of [[w:The Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]].  Locke was a proponent of the [[w:social contract|social contract]] theory of government, a belief that people should give up some rights in exchange for the order and protection that government supplies.  But, he also advocated the separation of government power.  Even further, he thought that civil uprising was allowable under the right conditions, and imperative in severe situations. His thinking would greatly contribute to that of the founding fathers of the United States of America; the [[w:United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] and the [[w:United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] both embodied such ideals.[http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/4n.htm]

===!Kung===
Varying cultures deal with power distribution differently. In a [http://windward.hawaii.edu/facstaff/dagrossa-p/articles/EatingChristmas.pdf case study done by Richard Borshay Lee] in 1969 in the Kalahari (Lee, Christmas in the Kalahari 1969) he finds that a tribe of people referred to as the !Kung have a system very different from our own. When Christmas came around Lee decided he would do the people a favor and buy them a large cow to cook as a goodwill gesture for their celebration. After purchasing the largest bull he could find, all of the tribe set about telling him that his cow was much to thin and unhealthy and wouldn't come close to feeding everyone. This of course was not true because he had chosen the very largest animal available, but as Lee later finds out it is traditional for the !Kung to belittle anyone that does others or the whole tribe a service in order to keep everyone humble. The point of this practice is to keep the power hierarchy of the tribe balanced and fair. That way there are fewer problems that arise with power struggle and dominance issues.

== Conflict==

'''Conflict''' may be either perceived or actual, and is the result of oppression, opposition, or the disagreement of [[w:need|need]]s, [[w: value|value]]s and interests between individuals, groups, and even cultures as a whole. The concept of ''conflict'' can assist in gaining further insight into large-scale disharmony between cultures, or simply a brawl between two individuals. Conflict is a result of differences in interests, values, actions, or directions. A conflict can be internal or external.

As on the individual basis conflict may result as a component of an emotional upset. These emotional upsets can be perceived as behavioral, physiological, or cognitive in nature. &lt;br&gt;
:[[w: behavioral|behavioral]] is the expression of emotional experience and can be verbal, non-verbal, intentional, or unintentional. &lt;br&gt;
:[[w: physiological|physiological]] is the physical correspondence between the feelings given by emotions and personal identity. &lt;br&gt;
:[[w: cognitive|cognitive]] is the concept that on an individual basis an experience is given a specific level of relevancy. &lt;br&gt;


From the standpoint of cultures, engagement in conflicts is due to a variety of sources. More specifically, those within [[w:diplomacy|diplomacy]], [[w:economy|economy]], [[w:military|military]], and [[w:religion|religion]]. 
 

=== Types of conflict ===
* '''Diplomatic conflict:''' Diplomatic conflict arises when the interests of different countries are not compatible [http://jcr.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/10/3/272]. States or nation-states create plans and objectives to improve the welfare of the state or nation-state and/or its citizens. To satisfy an objective, a government sometimes demands resources from a neighboring government. Conflict becomes apparent when a government attempts to complete an objective even at the expense of a close nation or a nation involved in the objective. An objective of a government can range from increasing resources that another nation has possession of or security. 
::  An example of diplomatic conflict would be the [[w:Cold War|Cold War]]. This was a struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union including their allies to influence developing countries into adopting their political and economic ideologies. The conflict escalated to such a severe degree that it spawned the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The conflict began at the end of [[w:World War II|World War II]] and concluded at the beginning of the 1990's soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Cold War illustrates how conflicting objectives by powerful nation-states can affect such an extensive population, often to their detriment. Instead of a tangible resource, security and global dominance was objective of the conflicting nation-states.
* '''Economic conflict:''' Economic conflict occurs when there is a disagreement over the distribution of wealth of a state or nation-state [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=C5uYCmjn0DoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=economic+conflict&amp;ots=YGJ46NLUbD&amp;sig=3oPIteu8YthioxgE-oCLA8HWc08#PPA2,M1]. There is often conflict within a state when resources are scarce and must be rationed across its population. When resources become scarce, especially in wartime, the government or other special interests that have power in a state or nation-state control the distribution of wealth and resources in that state or nation-state. That is, the government has  the power to appropriate and distribute goods and/or services to the population as it sees fit. This leads to struggles by other minority interests such as labor strikes, litigation, and lockouts. Economic conflict is also an inherent problem in colonialism, and can often escalate into violent revolutions because of unbalanced resource distribution. In modern times, this same conflict can be seen in the globalization issue, with international corporations serving the role of resource controllers/distributors.

[[Image:crossingtherhine.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers in military conflict/war. Soldiers crossing the Rhine River.]]


* '''Military conflict:''' Military conflict generally occurs when two opposing nations revert to the use of violent force to dispute conflicts through fighting. The nation or state with the most powerful military uses the nation's military as leverage in negotiations to reach a compromise or understanding. 


:: [[w: war|War]] is the one of main consequence of military conflict if negotiations can not be resolved, and can generally be defined as armed-conflict between nation-states or large political groups. Although a [[w: civil war|civil war]] is an internal conflict between separate parties within the same state or nation.


* '''Religious-based conflict:''' Religious-based conflict occurs between two religious groups, often when a larger, more powerful group attempts to take over a smaller one. There are currently at least nineteen areas of major religious conflict going on throughout the world; the more notable ones include, but are not limited to, Israel and Iraq (Al-Qaida). Although, some of the world’s most gruesome wars have been fought on the basis of religion, religious-based conflict is not always violent. It is not uncommon for religious groups to be at odds with one another, directly or indirectly, due to the tendency of each religion to assume the position of being the sole truth.

[[Image:WaziriyaAutobombeIrak.jpg|right|thumb|2,464×1,632px|Bomb terror in Iraq]]

:: '''The Iraq War:''' One conflict that is prevalent today takes place between the Shiite and Sunni Muslims in Iraq. The Shiites [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shiite?qsrc=2888] are deeply motivated to make Iraq an Islam nation by Iraq’s neighbor, Iran, which has successfully converted to an Islam-led government. Under, Saddam Hussein (the former dictator of Iraq), Sunnis could practice their religion freely and attain political influence and power; the Shiites, however, were not favored by Saddam and therefore were not allowed such freedom. After the fall of the dictatorship, the Shiites quickly proceeded to take advantage of this opportunity for leadership of Iraq. With the combination of the loss of a stable leader and the American military occupation of the nation, chaos has ensued in the form of violent religious-based conflict. Religious radicals from both the Sunni and Shiite religions regularly hash it out with explosives and gunfire, and the fight is only exacerbated by the presence of the American military, while innocent civilians are inevitably caught in the crossfire.

== Reproduction and Kinship ==
Anthropologists study kinship because it is the relationship between people through marriage, family, or other cultural arrangements.  The two types of kinship which exist are consanguinial (related by blood) or affinal (related by law/marriage).  Through kinship there is a transmission of goods, ideas and behavior.  Kinship is defined as a sense of being related to a person or people through descent, sharing or marriage.  This provides the base for an examination of different styles of partnership, community and reproduction across the globe.  

==Sexuality==
=== Sexual Orientation ===
Sexual orientation is the pattern of sexual and emotional attraction based on the gender of one's partner.
[[w:Heterosexuality|Heterosexuality]] refers to the emotional and sexual attraction between men and women. In the contemporary American culture, heterosexuality is the only sexual orientation to receive complete social and legal legitimacy. {{ref|Strong, Yarber, Sayad, DeVault, 2008}} Though heterosexuality is viewed as the &quot;norm&quot; in the United States, many other cultures maintain a very diverse perspective on sexuality and sexual orientation. Various types of sexual orientation are defined below, and can be found in many different cultures across the globe.
* [[w:Homosexuality|Homosexuality]]: Being emotionally and sexually attracted to those of the same sex. [[w:Lesbian|&quot;Lesbian&quot;]] is used to refer to a woman being attracted to other women; [[w:gay|&quot;Gay&quot;]] is used to refer to a man being attracted to other men.
* [[w:Bisexuality|Bisexuality]]: Being both emotionally and sexually attracted to both males and females.
* [[w:Pansexuality|Pansexuality]]: The potential for attraction to people, regardless of their biological sex or gender. This includes a possibility for attraction to those who fall outside the [[w:gender binary|gender binary]] of male/female.
* [[w:Asexual|Asexual]]: One without sex-linked features, lacking any apparent sex or sex organs {{ref|Microsoft Encarta College Dictionary, 2001}} or one that does not experience or represses any sexual attraction. {{ref|Asexuality.org, 2012}}
* [[w:Transgender|Transgender]]: Not a sexual orientation, but the state of one's own gender identity not matching their assigned sex. Transgender people may identify as any sexual orientation listed above.

There is also the term [[w:queer|queer]], which is a term reclaimed by the [[w:LGBT|LGBT]] community. Queer is an umbrella term which refers to anyone who is outside of the [[w:heteronormative|heteronormative]] society. [[w:Questioning|Questioning]] is also used to refer to those who are not sure about their sexuality but wish to examine it further.
Although these terms are used to describe one’s sexual orientation, they may be offensive depending on the person. One person may identify themselves as queer and have no problem with the term, however, another person may find the term offensive and not identify as queer but instead homosexual. &lt;sup&gt;Superscript text&lt;/sup&gt;

==== Cultural Examples of LGBT Relationships ====

[[File:Marcha-orgullo-buenos-aires.JPG|thumb|2007 Pride parade in Buenos Aires with ''LGBT'' visible in a groups' banner (top right of image)]]

In other parts of the world, some cultures regard various sexual orientations very highly. Transsexuals and same-sex relationships are seen in some cultures as acceptable, normal, and even preferable and honored.

==== [[w:Two-Spirit|Two-Spirit]] ====
In many North American indigenous tribes, a person could be two-spirit. They were generally viewed to have two spirits within them: both masculine and feminine. They dress using both the male and female garments, and filled an essential and respected role in society. They generally took on this role around puberty. Male-bodied two-spirits could be gravediggers, conductors of rituals, nurses during war, craftspeople, storytellers, and other roles. Female-bodied two-spirits could be traders, warriors, chiefs, hunters, guides, and other roles. Both could be diviners or medicine people. It was generally accepted that two-spirits had special power. They could have relationships with people of any sex, and the relationship was viewed more as &quot;hetero-gender&quot; than specifically homosexual or heterosexual. In today's world, the role is being reclaimed by Native Americans who identify as such.

==== Lesbianism in Mombasa ====
Anthropologist Gill Shepherd explored female sexual relationships among Swahili Muslims in Mombasa, Kenya, and found that relationships between females were perfectly acceptable, as were relationships between men. Women are allowed to choose other women as sexual partners after they are married; so many such women also have a husband at home, or are widowed or divorced. Both sexes are open about their homosexual relationships, and it is considered normal. No one, unlike in Western culture, would think that homosexual relationships would damage a person's piety or moral fiber. Having a woman for a lover is less important than a woman's rank, and her being a good Arab and Muslim. A relationship may be set up in a number of ways: a young woman can go around to wealthy lesbian circles in order to find someone; a wealthy woman may not want her autonomy diminished by a husband and so establishes a relationship with another woman so that she may continue in her independence; a wealthy woman may set up a marriage of convenience with a man for a poorer woman, so that when they are divorced soon after the poorer woman will live with her lesbian benefactress; and any number of other ways. The relationships are not stigmatized and having a lesbian relationship, while less respectable than being married to a man, is nonetheless better than not being married at all. The relationships can or cannot include a sexual relationship, but a sexual relationship is more likely when one woman pays a bride-price and constructs her own compound.

==== Homosexuality in Nicaragua ====
In Nicaragua, the ideal for masculinity is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machismo &quot;machismo&quot;], and it is described as a man who is dominant, active, and violent. In the U.S., this is often viewed as a man dominating his female partner. However, in Nicaragua, this can also be applied to the sexual relationship between men. It is viewed as normal that men would have sexual attraction to another, and the act itself is not stigmatized. The &quot;macho&quot; dominates the other man, and he is therefore called a &quot;cochón&quot;. This role is made fun of, and is typically seen as passive and weak. Though the cochón is made fun of, he is never attacked for his role. There are no hate crimes against homosexual men, unlike in the U.S., probably because homosexual tendencies are seen as normal.

==== Ancient Greece ====
In Ancient Greece, same-sex relationships between men were considered the highest form of love; they were just as common and accepted as heterosexual relationships in America today. This male-male relationship was based on love and reciprocity, and typically called for the older man to initiate the relationship. He would give gifts to the younger man as a promise of love. The relationship between the lover (the older man) and the beloved (the younger boy) was thought to be of the highest form of love &lt;ref&gt; Stayskal, Byron. Ancient Greek Literature, WWU, Winter 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;. It showed that the men regarded furthering themselves in knowledge and intelligence rather than just a physical connection. Some who did not attempt to make this connection were seen as &quot;shallow&quot; The older man would become the mentor and lover to the younger man, and the two would form a close emotional bond. The youth would be taught his duties as a citizen, and skills to further his place in society by the older man, and once the youth reached adulthood, the sexual relationship between the two men evolved into a very strong friendship. As an adult, the youth would then marry a woman, and initiate a relationship with another adolescent. 

An exclusively homosexual relationship was discouraged however, and not considered a substitute for male-female marriage. Marriage, and the children that would be produced within it,was required to maintain the family and society. The wives were viewed by their husbands as domestics and child bearers.{{ref|Strong, Yarber, Sayad, DeVault, 2008}}. While the men were away with their young lovers, women raised children, and took care of the household. Women were discouraged from taking lovers outside of the marriage bed.

[[File:BattleofIssus333BC-mosaic-detail1.jpg|thumb|Alexander the Great.]]Examples of this highly regarded male-male relationship can be found all throughout Greek myth, and Greek history. One example is the story of Apollo and Hyacinthus; Apollo fell in love with a mortal boy, Hyacinthus, and became a mentor to the youth. He taught Hyacinthus the art of war and sports and visited him often (Hyacinthus died during a javelin accident, and from his blood the [[w:Hyacinth (plant)|Hyacinth]] was created). In another version, they were exercising one day throwing around a discus. Apollo threw it and Hyacinthus ran after the discus, but it hit the ground, bounced, and stroked the ground, killing Hyacinthus. He then became a purple flower with AI on the petals. Other Greek gods and Greek heroes have stories attributed to them about their same-sex relationships, Zeus and Hercules among them.

It has also been said, though not confirmed, that Alexander the Great, the renowned Greek conqueror of Persia, had homosexual relationships with his close friend Hephaestion.

==== Ritual Homosexuality of the Sambia ====
In 1981, the American anthropologist [[w:Gilbert Herdt|Gilbert Herdt]] described the pseudonymous &quot;Sambia&quot; people, a tribe located in [[w:Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]]. They are remarkable for their beliefs about human fertility cycles  and the rites of passage they constructed as a result.{{ref|Herdt, Gilbert 1981}}

The Sambia place the onus of reproductive vitality on the male, believing that the baby is formed in the mother's womb by the father's life-giving semen. The child then gets all nourishment from the mother's milk, which causes them to grow and develop in the early stage of life. At the onset of [[w:puberty|puberty]], however, it is believed that to develop any further the child must be reintroduced to the life-giving semen -- the male's analogue to milk. However, since they view semen as a highly scarce albeit necessary resource for development, it must be carefully distributed among their people.

Thus, from ages seven to ten, boys are taken from their mothers and initiated into highly secret and complex ritual associations whereby the boys are taught to [[w:fellatio|fellate]] older boys and bring them to [[w:orgasm|orgasm]], thereby ingesting their life-giving semen. It's thought that by doing this they will develop into strong and reproductively viable human beings. Around the ages of 14, the boys switch places and become the fellated, providing the necessary sustenance for the next generation to develop.

Interestingly, the cultural practices of secret initiation diminished across the 1980s and by 1990 the secret initiation rituals were no longer practiced &lt;ref&gt; Herdt, Gilbert 1991 Secrecy and reality. U Michigan Press p.74|http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/047209761X-ch3.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Homosexuality in Brazil====
As a country, Brazil has been home to probably just as many homosexuals as any other country. What sets them apart however is the promenience with which same-sex rights has been fought for in their culture. &lt;ref&gt; Richard Parker, Beneath the Equator: Cultures of Desire, Male Homosexuality, and Emerging Gay Communities in Brazil, http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=0094-0496&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=4&amp;supplement=0&amp;article=233857&amp;jstor=False &lt;/ref&gt; The first organized Homosexual group was called SOMOS, and they formed in 1979. Today there are over 70 groups that are interested in gay rights operating within the country. The São Paulo Gay Pride Parade is also one of the largest in the world, with over 2 million participants a year. Even the Brazilian President,Luiz Lula, has been fighting to pass a 'homophobia law' which would count criticizing homosexual behavior as a crime.

==== Family Rights of LGBT Couples ====  

There is a lot of debate on whether or not a same sex couple should be allowed to parent children, whether artificially implanted or adopted.  This debate has gone on for so long mainly because many religious groups believe that children can only be properly parented by a father and mother combination. This may be because they don’t believe in the union of same sex couples but they also believe that the child will suffer if parented by the same sex.   Many welfare agencies believe that if two people are competent caring adults they should be allowed to adopt regardless of gender.  This fact is based on the idea that heterosexual couples often have problems raising children, too.  &quot;Research has found no major differences in parenting or child development between families headed by two mothers and other fatherless families&quot;.{{ref|SSM}} In 2008, judge Cindy S. Lederman overturned a Florida state law that prevented homosexual couples from adopting children, stating no &quot;moral or scientific reason for banning gays and lesbians from adopting, despite the state's arguments otherwise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Judge Overturns Florida Ban on Adoption by Gays. 25 Nov 2008. 23 April 2009.&lt;http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/11/25/florida.gay.adoption/index.html?iref=newssearch&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hopefully, this will serve as an example other states will follow, including Arkansas which recently banned all unwed couples from adopting; a law aimed specifically at homosexual couples.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Gay Adoption Ban Passes in Arkansas.&quot; 6 Nov 2008. 23 April 2009. &lt;http://www.diversityinc.com/public/4727.cfm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflicting Views on Sexuality ===
Views on sexuality differ from culture to culture. Some cultures embrace sexuality, while others completely avoid it. This can even range considerably among industrial nations. A popular example is that breastfeeding in public in America is generally despised, whereas in Europe, it is accepted.

[[File:Breast feeding within minutes.jpg|thumb|In Europe breastfeeding in public is seen as entirely normal, while in the US it is generally looked down upon.]] The USA has a really taboo view on sexuality, it is definitely everywhere a person looks but somehow the USA has a really conservative look on sexuality.

For example I was at the mall not too long ago and I saw a woman feeding her infant in the food court. I was not surprised or disgusted in any way but the friend that I was with and many other people around us started to whisper give evil looks to the woman and some people even got up and left the food court. I was shocked, all the woman was doing was feeding her own baby, what was wrong with that? Apparently a lot my friend informed me. In my friend’s eye the woman was not only feeding her child but also trying to draw attention to her self by showing off her breasts. My friend had a disgusted look on her face and called the mother a whore. At that point I understood that my friend had just a different cultural view on feeding infants in public places than I did. I come from Europe and there feeding your child in a public place it is not a big deal.

==== Inis Beag ====

[[w:Inis_Beag|Inis Beag]] was a sexually inexperienced community off the coast of Ireland. In 1960, anthropologists visited this society to collect information on their customs. Inis Beag was considered to be people of the land. They grew potatoes, owned horses, sheep, cattle, and goats.
Members of Inis Beag knew practically nothing about sex. Anything sexual was considered a sin except in the case of post-marital reproduction. Children were never allowed to see anyone naked and the genders were usually kept separate. They were sponged-bathed and at an early age only their face, legs, neck, and arms were cleansed. Sex was never discussed so most girls did not know what to do when their first menstrual cycle occurred and they did not know what to expect on their wedding night. Although the men were not experienced either, they learned of intercourse through the teachings of older men and by viewing animals. Nudity was so abhorred that even clothes were not removed during sex. The women were expected to endure intercourse with the largest reluctance and it was considered a mortal sin to enjoy it by having an orgasm.

==== Trobriand Islands ====
[[en:Image:Paul_Avril_-_Les_Sonnetts_Luxurieux_(1892)_de_Pietro_Aretino,_1.jpg‎|thumb|A man and a woman engage in intercourse with a cupid like character in the background.]]

Unlike Inis Beag, the inhabitants of [[w:Trobriand Islands|Trobriand Islands]] are very open to sex. These Melanesians live on a group of 22 islands part of Papua New Guinea and they are not nearly as conservative when it comes to everyday dress. Premarital intercourse is universal in their culture and even children as young as three years old are permitted to explore their sexuality. Not much was known about their lives until Polish anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowksi studied them first hand from 1914-1918 and went on to write [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonauts_of_the_Western_Pacific Argonauts of the 
Western Pacific.]

== Reproduction ==
Reproduction is the biological process that produces new organisms.  Reproduction is a basic function of every organism on Earth and passes on the building blocks of life from one generation to another.  Every culture in the world has traditions, rules, and ceremonies which preside around reproduction.  These may range from sexual practices of Hawaiian nobility to the Supreme Court of the United States in legal disputes such as Roe v. Wade.  Reproduction is an ever present variable in anthropology and a prevalent force literally shaping the world.  

Almost all cultures have norms governing sex and reproduction [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premarital_sex premarital sex], these range from cultural universals such as the incest taboo to legal concepts such as [[w:child support|child support]]. However even these taboos are not found to be entirely universal. In many early cultures, such as the Hawaiians, royalty could only be passed down to the child of two royal family members, usually a brother and sister.
Different cultures each have individual expectations if the women regarding when they begin having children, how many they have, and what age they usually stop having children. For example, women in more male-dominated societies have less or no say in their reproductive processes and health.
Reproduction is the biological process by which new individual organisms are produced. Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. The known methods of reproduction are broadly grouped into two main types: sexual and asexual.
In asexual reproduction, an individual can reproduce without involvement with another individual of that species. The division of a bacterial cell into two daughter cells is an example of asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is not, however, limited to single-celled organisms. Most plants have the ability to reproduce asexually. However no human has been known to be able to reproduce asexually. Sexual reproduction requires the involvement of two individuals, typically one of each sex. 
[[Image:Pregnant_woman2.jpg|thumb|A pregnant woman nurtures her child in the womb for nine months before giving birth.]]

Before the 1970s in China it was very taboo to engage in premarital sex. However, in the 1980s the Chinese government began to make many rules regarding marriage and reproduction. They had a policy that each family was only allowed one child. They also had restrictions on the age people were allowed to get married. Women could not marry until they were 20 and men had to wait until they were 23. Couples also had to receive permission from their work place before they could be married. These restrictions led to the “engagement” becoming popular in China. The couple would travel to a nearby city to get their engagement photos taken and purchase items for the wedding. The couples would often go alone without parental supervision so they were able to engage in premarital sex.These Chinese couples had little to no idea how sex worked because their parents had not informed them yet; this was usually done right before the son or daughter was about to be married. This led to young couples looking to western porn as a type of &quot;transcript&quot; on how sex worked. This was obviously a big problem and led to more open talk about premarital sex. These practices lead to premarital sex becoming a less taboo subject in China.

=== Reproduction: An Anthropological Definition &amp; Focus ===
According to the Encyclopedia of Anthropology, human reproduction refers to &quot;the process by which new social members are produced-
specifically, the physiological process of conception, pregnancy, birth, and child raising. From a larger prospective, reproduction is what makes a whole society continue to thrive without becoming extinct. Power has come to be the central concern of reproductive studies since the power to control reproduction of large populations ultimately has power over the population. This is why, since the 1990's, anthropological studies of reproduction have mainly focused on the &quot;new reproductive technologies.&quot; These technologies have been designed to intervene in human reproduction. Examples of &quot;new reproductive technologies&quot; include intrauterine devices, birth control pills, artificial insemination, in-vitro fertilization, and anything else that can manipulate reproduction. 

==== Control of pregnancy ====
Women are thought to have control over fertility. Due to paternity uncertainty, men often construct cultures that inhibit the open transmission of this knowledge. In different environments, and depending on cultural factors, individuals control pregnancy in different ways. 
* Foragers: To reduce the chances of a pregnancy foragers will have a low fat diet, increase physical work, breastfeed (which increases the chances of [[w:en:Lactational amenorrhea method|lactational amenorrhea]]) and use induced abortion/[[w:en:infanticide|infanticide]] if previous methods do not work.  For foragers, children are not seen as much of a positive contribution to the family, because it often just means more mouths to feed. However foragers also understand that the new generation of children, who may not at first be able to help much, will not only be able to help hunt and forage in the future but the weight of that particular tribe will one day rest on their shoulders.
*Agricultural: Women will use pro-natal techniques and herbs (although usually in agricultural societies more children are preferable, as it means more workers).
*Industrial: Women use hormonal and chemical types of birth control. The pill, IUD and vaginal ring are common examples. The ortho-evra patch was a widely used form of birth control until the FDA announced higher risk of heart attack and stroke associated with this form of birth control.&lt;ref&gt; Ortho Evra Injury. http://www.orthoevrainjury.net/html/heart_attack_stroke.html &lt;/ref&gt; Condoms are also used as a barrier method to prevent pregnancy as well as transmission of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_Transmitted_Infection STI's]. 

==== Childbirth ====
[[Image:Umbilical-newborn.jpg|thumb|This infant is having its umbilical cord clamped using sterile procedure, a western biomedical practice that reduces the risk of tetanus infection.]]
Childbirth varies for women in all different kinds of cultures.  More industrialized societies, such as America, make such a big “to-do” when a woman has a baby, as opposed to many other cultures that handle it very differently.  Agricultural societies usually handle childbirth with midwives [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/midwives?qsrc=2888], and foraging cultures usually give birth individually. 
An example would be when an American woman goes into childbirth, she’s usually rushed to the hospital by whomever happens to be with her (usually the woman’s spouse), she is immediately taken to a sanitary environment where there are sometimes several people in the room assisting, either the doctor/nurse, and the woman herself.  Though in a sterile environment, the newborn infant is not entirely safe from disease.  Afterall, most western cultures consider it normal to give birth in the same building that houses all of society's sick as well. Western science sometimes lack the conventional wisdom of other cultures who have been  giving birth for thousands of years.  Complications do happen on a regular basis, but because of the high-pace environment, the complications can usually be resolved.  Now if one were to look at a foraging society, such as the Ache from Paraguay, when the women go into labor, they simply go into a more secluded area, squat, proceed to deliver their child by themselves, bite off the umbilical cord, put the newborn to breast, probably clean themselves and their baby, and go back to their people (hopefully to rest).  Complications are much more common in this situation; risk of infection, risk of excessive bleeding, and overall lack of medical attention.  Many other cultures (sometimes including American) use midwives for several different reasons; childbirth can happen in the home yet still have medical skill and experience to accompany them.  Women and their families choose this route either because of religious reasons, cultural purposes, or even lack of financial adequacy to pay hospital bills.{{ref| James 2009}}

==== Abortion ====
[[w:Abortion|Abortion]] is the action of terminating a [[w:pregnancy|pregnancy]].  To do this one must remove the embryo or fetus from a woman's uterus after conception.  There are several different ways to perform an abortion.  Induced abortions are different from spontaneous abortions (also defined as a miscarriage), because an induced abortion is usually done on purpose, where as a spontaneous abortion is usually unexpected.  There are a variety of ways to perform an induced abortion, some relatively safe and others extremely dangerous.  In more developed countries the use of Medical or Surgical abortion is used.  Medical abortion is preformed with the use of pharmaceutical drugs, which are only useful in the first trimester of a pregnancy.  Surgical abortion (also known as a vacuum abortion) is the most common method used.  To perform a surgical abortion one removes the fetus or embryo, membranes and placenta using a suction method with a syringe (this is called manual [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_aspiration vacuum aspiration] or MVA).  Another way to perform a surgical abortion is through the use of an electric pump (this is called electric vacuum aspiration or EVA).  Surgical abortion is usually preformed from the fifteenth week of pregnancy to the twenty-sixth. 

There are also other types of abortion that are not preformed medically or surgically.  These methods include the use of herbs and special diets as discussed above in the section control of pregnancy. There are also other ways that are not as safe.  One method of abortion is attempted from abdomen trauma or putting pressure on the uterus externally.  The amount of force upon the abdomen is extreme and does not always succeed in a miscarriage.  This form of abortion can result in internal bruising and can be harmful to the mother of the child.  The most unsafe methods of abortion are almost always self-induced through the insertion of non-medical tools into the uterus.  These tools can include wire clothing hangers or even knitting needles.  Self induced abortions are most dangerous because they can result in infection and lacerations of the uterus which could eventually result in death if not properly treated.  Overall the pain of a surgical abortion can be compared to less than a toothache but more than a headache or backache.

'''Abortion in the United States'''

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States#Abortion_before_Roe Abortion in the United States] is a very controversial issue.  There is quite a bit of political and ethical debate that underlies whether or not it should be legal.  In a legal sense in the United States the term abortion refers to induced abortion as opposed to spontaneous, because it is purposeful.  Currently in the United States abortion is legal but can be restricted by any state to varying degrees, as a result of the highly controversial 1973 case [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade Roe v. Wade] case.  These restrictions include prohibiting abortion after specific amounts of time during the pregnancy (i.e. after the second trimester), required parent notifications for minors, parental consent for minors, and the permission to perform the abortion after informing the patient of the risks prior to the procedure.  Before Roe v. Wade, abortion was illegal in over half of U.S. states and otherwise legal only in the case of rape or to protect a woman’s health.  It was legal upon request in four states.  In deciding the outcome of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruled that forbidding abortion except when necessary for a woman’s health was unconstitutional and that the issue of abortion fell under the constitutional right to privacy.  Today’s view on whether or not abortion should be legal is largely divided between those who are Pro-Choice and those who are Pro-Life.  Opinions are based on religion, gender, political party, region, and can vary depending on specific reasons for a woman having an abortion. In 1969, The Center for Disease Control began documenting legal induced abortions in the U.S. Unmarried women had the highest rate of abortion (82%), 55% were white women, and 51% were 25 years of age and younger. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5511a1.htm &lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. today it can cost between $300 and $600 for the first trimester and $500 to $5000 for the second trimester to perform a surgical abortion.{{ref|Feminist Women Health Center}}[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/06/opinion/06fri3.html]In May 2009, one of three late term abortion licensed doctors in the country, Dr. Tiller, was killed by an Pro-Life extremist. According to police reports Tiller's had been the victim of vandalism, shootings and bombings by radical anti-abortion groups. This crime continues to reinforce how the country remains divided on the issue.

'''Abortion in East Africa'''

Reproductive right is so important in an individual life in and especially to women. “Abortion is a necessity for millions of women worldwide, for their health, for their wellbeing, for their dreams of a better tomorrow.” I was raised in an east African country called Eritrea and abortion is illegal unless it’s medically necessary for the health of the mother. When young girls get pregnant unexpectedly and they don’t have doctor’s approval then they can’t abort legally. “The reality is that a woman will seek an abortion—legal or otherwise—almost instinctively and in self defense.” Rules do not stop these young girls from aborting and they would do it illegally if they really want to get rid of their pregnancy. I have heard of many girls that have died from illegal abortions. Therefore, I think abortion should just be legal even without doctor’s approval because if women don’t want to give birth, they will abort one way or another. (http://feminist.org/rrights/)

'''Abortion in Colombia''' 

Unlike in America, Colombia has much more strict laws regarding abortion. Colombia along with El Salvador, and Chile were the 3 countries in Latin America which completely prohibited any kind of abortion by law. 

On May 10th 2006, Colombia’s Constitutional Court ruled abortion legal only when pregnancy endangers the life or health of the mother, or results from rape or incest, or if the fetus is unlikely to survive. This ruling caused a large controversy between the Catholic Church and the doctors who perform the surgeries as well as the women who chose to have the abortion. 

The United States the right to choose an abortion is based on the women’s right to privacy. In contrast, Colombia’s ruling for abortion is based on the women’s right to heath, life and equality. In Colombia, it is estimated that on average women have more than one illegal abortion throughout their life. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Abortion Ruling in Colombia.&quot; New York Times. 24 May 2006. http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/opinion/24weds3.html &lt;/ref&gt;

==== Puberty ====

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty Puberty] is the onset of sexual maturity in humans that occurs at roughly the same time as the adolescent growth spurt. For most girls, growth spurt starts at age about 10 ½ and sexual maturation begins at about 9 to 11. Typically boys lag behind girls by 2 to 3 years; growth spurt starts at age about 13 and sexual maturation begins at about 11 to 12. Age, at which puberty begins, however, varies due to genetic and environmental factors such as nutritional state or social circumstances. Puberty is also a transition from childhood to adulthood. In females the reproductive cycle of ovulation and menstruation begins, pubic hair appears, and development of the breasts and other body contours takes place. Physical changes in males include production and discharge of semen, appearance of facial and body hair, and deepening of the voice. In many cultures, this transition is celebrated, seen as a positive and momentous event. In other cultures, it is seen as a negative change, one that presents “risk” of teenage promiscuity and pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease, etc..

An ethnographic example of a positive puberty ritual can be found in Navajo culture. When a Navajo girl reaches puberty, she undergoes a four day ceremony called Kinaalda which signifies her transformation from childhood into womanhood. The ceremony is centered around the Navajo myth of Changing woman [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessing_Way], the first woman on Earth who was able to bear children. The myth says that Changing Woman performed the first Kinaalda and that the ceremony gave her the ability to have children. Because of this, all Navajo girls must also undergo the ceremony so that they will grow into strong women who can also have children.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menarche#Cultural_aspects_of_menarche]

[[File:Bar Mitzvah Western Wall.jpg|thumb|A Bar Mitzvah taking place at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.]]Likewise, many Hispanic cultures celebrate a woman's coming of age with the Quinceañera(from the Spanish word &quot;quince&quot; meaning 15).  When a girl turns 15, it is traditional for her to celebrate both religiously and often socially with friends and family, showing that she has overcome puberty, reached adulthood, and is eligible for marriage, or more commonly today is ready to begin dating.  The celebration begins with a Thanksgiving Mass, or &quot;Misa de acción de gracias,&quot; which is attended by the close family, godparents, as well as up to seven damas(maids of honor) and 7 chambelanes (chamberlains). After the mass, many families choose to continue the celebration with an extravagant party, including fancy dresses, food, decorations, and often a live band playing music to dance to.  Some girls choose to go on a trip instead of having a party, but still just enjoying time with family and close friends to celebrate the transition from childhood to womanhood. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.mexconnect.com/en/articles/3192-la-quincea%C3%B1era-%E2%80%93-an-hispanic-celebration-of-budding-womanhood &lt;/ref&gt; 

In Judaism as well there is a transition into adulthood that takes place at the age of thirteen (whether or not this is meant to be synchronized with puberty is unknown to me). For a boy this is called a Bar Mitzvah and for a girl it's called a Bat Mitzvah. For the individual it is one of the most important traditions in Judaism, rivaled only by marriage.

==== Birthing Practices ====
There are 4 main types of birth:
* '''complete birth'''- entire separation of the infant from the maternal body (after cutting of the umbilical cord)
* '''multiple birth'''- the birth of two or more offspring produced in the same gestation period
* '''post-term birth'''- birth of an infant at or after 42 completed weeks (294 days) of gestation
* '''[[W: Premature birth|Premature birth]]'''- birth of an infant before 37 completed weeks (259 days) of gestation
The best position for the baby to be born is head first. The head first position poses the least amount of danger for both baby and mother. 
When a baby is breech (feet or buttocks first) it can cause many complications for both the baby and the mother. 

It should also be noted that there are three main methods of giving birth:

&lt;p&gt;'''1. Vaginal birth'''- the natural emergence of the baby from the mother's birth canal. This is the most preferred method of birth because of the personal connection the mother feels with her baby. This process starts with the onset of labor which consists of uterine contractions which starts the natural “pushing” of the baby down in the vagina for delivery. The natural pushing is the painful part of birth but it can be controlled with breathing exercises.  The birthing process is also practiced in many different types of pain management.  While pain management is often medical, there are types of natural birth that give women the choice to have a birth in a controlled and comfortable environment without the distraction or stress of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
*'''Types of Natural Birth:'''
**'''HypnoBirthing:'''&lt;p&gt;HypnoBirthing [http://www.hypnobirthingcolorado.com/whatishb.htm] was originally created in the United States by Marie Monogan who is the founder of The HypnoBirthing Institution.  The method was created for Marie Monogan's daughter who was interested in having a calm and stress free birth.  After the success of the method, it began to spread.  Doctors observed and began to back the practice and lend a hand to its &quot;fertility.&quot;  Shortly after 1993, the method spread to the UK, Canada, and Australia.  Now, hypnobirthing is taught in twenty-two countries and more people are becoming a part of it constantly.  It has been recognized on an international level and continues to make an impact on mothers all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hypnobirthing the mother undergoes self-hypnosis as a method of pain control.  Hypnosis is defined as a naturally induced state of concentration, a place where mind and body can communicate with the subconscious mind.  When in this state, communicating with the subconscious can help to control pain.  According to HypnoBirthing of Colorado [http://www.hypnobirthingco.com/what_is_hypnosis] the state of self-hypnosis while delivering can put the woman in a completely relaxed and daydreamy attitude.  The woman, however, will still feel in complete control and be able to sense her surges (also called contractions).  In hypnobirthing, one of the goals is to let the body's natural painkillers, endorphins, to take over the pain instead of letting stress enhance pain.  HypnoBirthing also can teach you how to work with your body to make giving birth a much calmer experience.  Another of its main goals is keeping the mother alert and aware of her body.&lt;/p&gt;

:*'''Advantages of Natural Childbirth through HypnoBirthing:'''
:**It can help to eliminate fear, tension, and pain before and after birth
:**It can greatly reduce the want and need for chemical pain killers
:**It can shorten the first stage of labor
:**It can get rid of tiredness during birth, giving the mother the energy she needs to have a successful birth
:**It can help to prevent hyperventilation
:**It can promote special bonding for mother, baby, other companions
:**It can lead to shorter postnatal recovery
:**It can help the mother to have a more calm and peaceful experience
:**It allows the birthing companion to take a more prominent role

*''There are 3 phases of vaginal birth:''
**'''1st phase:''' The opening of the cervix or dilation. This is when the doctor will perform internal examinations to check the orientation and health of the baby
**'''2nd phase:''' The cervix is fully dilated at approximately 10 cm. The mother helps the delivery by pushing. This phase can last up to 2 hours. The baby is delivered at the conclusion of this stage.
**'''3rd phase:''' Also known as the afterbirth. The placenta is delivered and the mother emotionally connects with her baby. 

'''2. Assisted birth'''- the use of medical technologies, such as [[W:Forceps|forceps]] to assist in delivering the baby from the mother's birth canal.

'''3. [[W: Caesarean Section|Caesarean birth]]'''-Is a method that uses a surgical incision made in the mother’s abdomen and uterus for the delivery of an infant. This method is often referred to as a C-Section. Although a vaginal birth is the most preferred, a Caesarean birth may be necessary if there are complications in the pregnancy, for example if the baby is not receiving enough oxygen (emergency c-section) or if the mother chooses the option (elective c-section). The elective C-Section is preformed a week or two before the actual due date. If the expectant mother is HIV-positive and blood tests done near the end of pregnancy show that you have a high viral load, and then a planned c-section would be the recommended birth plan by the doctor. It is equally important to have a planned c-section if the baby is expected to be extremely large and difficult to pass through the vaginal opening, (a condition known as macrosomia). This is particularly true if the expectant mother is diabetic or has had a previous baby of the same size or smaller who suffered serious trauma during a vaginal birth.&lt;ref&gt; BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board. http://www.babycenter.com/0_giving-birth-by-cesarean-section_160.bc?page=1&lt;/ref&gt; Most maternity units in the UK deliver between 10 and 20 per cent of babies by Caesarean section. [http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/health_advice/facts/childbirth.htm]

'''Multiple Births'''- If the woman were to have multiple births then it is possible she would have to get a C-Section to prevent permanent damage to herself.

'''Labor Stops''' - Over one third of all C-Sections performed are a result of Labor stopping.

'''Concern for the Baby''' - Complications concerning the baby such as the umbilical cord being pinched or the baby not receiving proper blood flow might result in the necessity of a C-Section.

'''Medical Conditions''' - Preexisting medical conditions in the mother such as diabetes or high blood pressure may also cause need for a caesarian section.

'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases Sexually Transmitted Diseases]'''
- If the mother has a disease such as HIV, then it is possible for the child to also get the disease as it passes through the vagina. In this case, a C-Section is needed. [http://www.pregnancy-info.net/reasons_for_c-section.html]

==== Birth in Japanese Culture ====

*In Japan, mothers are encouraged to eat traditional foods that will nourish the mother and baby during the labor. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mochi Mochi] and eggs are high in protein and carbohydrates which give the Japanese mothers strength and energy in the birthing process. Traditionally, the feelings of pain expressed through noises and verbal expression were considered acceptable but such extreme expressions were considered shameful. Mothers are expected to remain stoic throughout the delivery process. These traditional beliefs are still widely held in Japanese culture concerning birth. 
*Tradition also states that fathers would not present during the birth. Midwives and female relative were however allowed to be in the room with the mother in labor. [http://www.hawcc.hawaii.edu/nursing/RNJapanese03.html]

====Differences in Birthing Practices ====
'''Foraging Societies:'''

In many foraging ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_gatherer hunting/gathering]) cultures, such as in the Ache tribe, women give birth by themselves.  When a woman goes into labor and starts having contractions, she quietly goes off by herself into the forest to deliver her baby.  She will squat down, hold her hands out to grab her newborn, and usually, she will bite off the umbilical cord.  After that, she will nurse her baby, and return to the village with the child.  

'''Agricultural Societies:'''
In agricultural societies, midwives usually assist women giving birth.  Midwives are specially trained to deliver babies.  [[Image:Eucharius Rößlin Rosgarten Childbirth.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A woman giving birth on a birth chair, from a work by [[Eucharius Rößlin]].]]

'''Industrial Societies:'''
In many industrial societies, women in labor are given medication to help with the pain.  Also, Caesarean births (C-Sections) are common.  In parts of the U.S. and Brazil, 50% or more of births are C-Section births.  

'''Causes of Maternal Death:'''

Indirect Causes: 20%

Severe Bleeding: 24%

Infection: 15%

Unsafe Abortion: 13%

Eclampsia (unstable blood pressure): 12%

Obstructed Labor: 8%

Other Direct Causes: 8%

==== Cultural Meaning of Birthing Practices ====
Birthing practices vary greatly across the world. In several different cultures, such as the Yucatán, Holland, and Sweden, a midwife is enlisted to help in the birthing process. All births in Sweden take place in hospitals with the help of trained midwives. However, in the US, 95% of births take place in a hospital, where the mother and child are treated as patients. This contrasts sharply from the Maasi of Kenya where the &quot;mother gives birth in her own hut, and she remains there until her strength is recovered and she feels well again. During that time she is attended by the women of the village, or kraal &lt;ref&gt;Huntingford, George Wynn Brereton. 1953. “The southern Nilo-Hamites”. London: International African Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&quot; countries have also been seeing an increased rate of Caesarian sections performed in recent years. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3876/is_200606/ai_n17183857] Not only have medical technologies improved to make this practice more safe for the mother and child, but the industrial and post-industrial societies that make up developed countries today require individual participants to schedule everything into exact slots of time. Through this surgery, women are able to schedule the exact moment they give birth and can thus plan their return to society ahead of time.

Nevertheless, the different birthing practices all hold a cultural similarity in that they affect all aspects of social life in a culture. Childbirth affects the mothers because of all the potential differences in the meaning of childbirth, and can allow the woman to become closer to herself, her significant other, and her family. In no culture does childbirth go unnoticed, and the different birthing practices help establish the different cultural meanings of the birth.


Child birth in Kenya

Many African hospitals are expensive for the average family to afford to deliver their baby with medical attention. A Kenyan woman named Wanjiru shares her story “I remember going to the hospital in 2001. I was in pain, like most of the other women, but we were made to sit on a wooden bench and were not allowed to go into the labour ward without paying.” Because majority African hospitals are so overwhelmed by the number of pregnant woman that need help delivering their baby, they are usually not very polite. Wanjiru was told “You are asked to spread your legs ‘like you did for your husband.” According to a report, Failure to deliver, prepared by the Federation of Women Lawyers in Kenya and the Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR), there are numerous challenges facing women in Kenya’s health facilities, including suffering abuse and neglect before and during delivery.

====Infant Sleep====

[[Image:baby.jpg|thumb|A baby lying in infant bed]]
Infant sleep norms vary greatly across cultures. Different cultures have different views on what is considered normal for children’s sleep. In the United States, it is regarded as normal for infants to sleep in separate rooms from their parents. Technology, such as baby monitors, allow parents to stay connected with their children but still give them the independence our culture believes they need. It is also socially important for babies to sleep all through the night without arousal. Babies with high fat diets, specially from artificial formula are more likely to sleep soundly through the night than babies that are breast feed. 

Although in the United States separate rooms are common for infants, the majority of the world finds it more acceptable for infants to sleep either in bed with parents or in the same room. This is true for countries including Italy, China, and Korea. Most cultures believe that children still need to be close to their parents especially at night while sleeping.

In the [[Wikipedia:Maya civilization|Maya civilization]], mother-infant co sleeping is quite normal. Mayan mothers found it horrifying that the western culture finds it normal to separate infants from their parents during sleep. It is considered cruel to them to do that to the infant, since they are still so dependent on their parents.

====Breast Feeding====
[[Image:Breastfeeding-icon-med.svg|thumb|150px|[[w:International Breastfeeding Symbol|International Breastfeeding Symbol]]]]
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_feeding Breast Feeding] practices vary between cultures. A child should be breast feed for at least six months, and is recommended to be continued until two to four years of age. Breast milk carries many nutritional benefits to the child. Vitamins and antibodies that the mother carries are passed on to the baby to help build the immune system and developing body. Breast feeding is also critical for mother and child bonding. Hormones are exchanged in the breast milk and well as in the mother to promote nurturing feelings. During the breast feeding months, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactational_Amennorrhea_Method lactational amennorrhea] occurs which prevents the mother from conceiving again. In some cultures this is a method for birth control and is classified as natural family planning.

In The United States and other industrial societies, breast feeding practices may look different from foraging or agricultural societies. A mother may cut her time of breast feeding short in order to return to a career or job. Many mothers will pump their breast milk to feed the child when she may not be there or is out in public. Using artificial formula is also common, although the baby may suffer nutritionally and socially. In societies, such as The United States, breast feeding may also be cut short due to a socially constructed attitude of individuals being independent. A mother may be socially ridiculed for breast feeding her child too long and not promoting them to become nutritionally independent.

A 1999 research project done in Munich, Germany at the Institute for Social Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine did a study on the effects of breast-feeding and its relationship to childhood obesity. This study was comprised of 9,357 German children between the ages of 5 to 6. The study found that children who were breast fed for 3 to 5 months had a 35% reduced risk of being obese upon their entry into school. Breast-feeding has also been linked to an increase in cognitive intelligence. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/319/7203/147 a Institute for Social Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ludwig Maximilians University, Heiglhofstr 63, D-81377 Munich, Germany, b Dr von Haunersches Kinderspital, Ludwig Maximilians University, Lindwurmstr 4, D-80337 Munich&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reproductive Technologies ====

===== Artificial Insemination =====

Artificial insemination (AI) is the process by which sperm is placed into the reproductive tract of a female for the purpose of impregnating the female by using means other than sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination&lt;/ref&gt;.
From my personal reference, a family friend, artificial insemination has a greater chance of birthing more than one child. In my opinion, it makes sense that this is so because the funds that are required to perform such a process is so great that having two or more children at once is more affordable. Because of the risk that this wont work, the process can be costly. The family that I am referring to is of the Mormon faith and said that having children is a very important part of their religion in order to pass down traditions and values. They were willing to try this procedure as many times as possible in order to have at least one child. 

== Marriage ==
[[Image: Bride-groom-kiss.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bride and groom posing for a 'wedding kiss' photograph.]]
[[File:Mayian.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A [[w:Sikh|Sikh]] family during the Batna ceremony, the bride's female kin apply besan to the bride's body while singing traditional songs.]]Anthropologists recognize marriage as a way to “describe how different societies organize and understand mating and its consequences”. {{ref|Schultz and Lavenda 2009}} The Anthropological definition of a prototypical marriage highlights the general expectations and facets that form this social construct. Within various cultures marriage is symbolically represented through a range of very simple to elaborate weddings. A marriage generally transforms the roles and responsibilities of two individuals within society. For example, an individual’s expectation of personal finance may be transformed to support both him/herself and their spouse. Marriage also sets the implications of permitted sexual access, setting boundaries for what is acceptable and when. However, these implications are also set based on personal preference as well as cultural norms. 

Marriage is also a method in which cultural tradition is passed on to the children of the participants. Although the marriage relationship is a ‘traditional’ means for shaping a child’s standing and position in society, non traditional roles also serve as a valid means of raising children within cultural context. Marriage also serves as a means of creating extended families linking the Kin of the individuals. 

=== Monogamy and Polygamy ===
==== Monogamy ====
[[w:Monogamy|Monogamy]] is the practice of having only one spouse at one time. In some cases, monogamy means having only one spouse for an entire life span. 
Out of the different types of marriages, monogamy is the only
one that is legal in the United States and in most industrial nations. While Polygamy was once allowed in Utah
because it was part of the traditions of the Fundamentalist Mormons[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mormons?qsrc=2888] that were settled there, it is now illegal in the United States. There are several types of monogamy that are practiced throughout the world. They include social, sexual, genetic, martial, and serial monogamy.

* Social monogamy: Two persons/creatures that live together, have sex with one another, and cooperate in acquiring basic resources such as food, clothes, and money.
* Sexual monogamy: Two persons/creatures that remain sexually exclusive with one another and have no outside sex partners. 
* Genetic monogamy: Two partners that only have offspring with one another. 
* Marital monogamy: Marriages of only two people. 
* Serial monogamy: A series of relationships. One person has only one partner at a time, and then moves on to another partner after severing the relationship with the first. 
 
Although the American definition of monogamy forces a person to have only a single spouse, he or she can divorce that spouse and remarry as many times as is desirable. 

Monogamy is the most common type of practice in the United States.


Monogamy is a type of marriage practiced in many Christian countries around the world because Christians believe one man to one woman. According to the bible “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh, Genesis 2:24” Christianity is the dominant religion in the United States and this is one of the reasons why monogamy is largely practiced. “The monogamy idea was not popular in previous generations, not until its strong uprising in the last 150 years or so. Polygamy was still openly practiced in the last generation in non-western countries, and is today still practiced in modern societies, even though not so openly because of the outcry of the Western Feminism movement.” Many countries and cultures around the world are practicing monogamy not only for religious reasons but simply because they chose to.  
(http://www.patriarchywebsite.com/monogamy/mono-history.htm)

==== Polygamy ====
The term [[w:Polygamy|Polygamy]] is a Greek word meaning &quot;The practice of multiple Marriage&quot;. It is a marriage pattern in which an individual is married to more than one person at a time.  One example of a society in which Polygamy was prevalent was the Tiwi.  They are a group of hunter-gathers in North Australia.  However, the Tiwi have slowly adapted to a monogamous family structure. &lt;ref&gt; Gary Robinson Ethos Volume 25. Issue 3. Jan. 1997 http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=0091-2131&amp;volume=25&amp;issue=3&amp;supplement=0&amp;article=10.2307_640668&amp;jstor=True &lt;/ref&gt; There are two different types of Polygamy: Polygyny and Polyandry.

[[w:Polygyny|Polygyny]] is the practice of one man having more than one wife or sexual partner at a time. There is a specified difference between having multiple wives and sexual partners and the practice of having a sexual partner outside of the marriage, such as a concubine. Polygyny is the most common form of polygamy. There are religions that have historically allowed polygyny, for instance [[w:Mormonism|Mormonism]]. Polygamy began in this culture when its founder, [[w:Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith]], had a revelation from God that some Mormon men would be allowed to take multiple wives. The Mormon religion faced much persecution for practicing polygamy and was outlawed in many areas of the country. Consequently, this forced the religion and its leaders to move. After the death of Smith, the major body of Mormons followed [[w:Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] to Utah where they were free to practice polygyny. Eventually, Congress passed laws stating that polygamy was illegal in all U.S. states and territories.  Although polygyny and polygamy are illegal in the U.S., some fundamentalists [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints] still practice it today, most commonly in highly populated Mormon areas of Missouri and Utah where the state often turns blind eye to marriage practices of the individuals.

[[W:Polyandry|Polyandry]] is the less common of the two forms of Polygamy. Polyandry involves one woman having multiple husbands, within Polyandry there are many variations on the marriage style. One of the more common forms of polyandry is fraternal polyandry; this form has been known to be practiced among groups of Tibet and Nepal and occurs when a group of brothers marries one woman.  In this practice the oldest brother usually serves as the groom during the wedding but all brothers are recognized as married through this ceremony and all have sexual access to the woman. All brothers also assume a collective responsibility for the children produced from this marriage. This type of marriage also allows for land holdings in areas with scarce environmental resources to stay concentrated within the family and for the children produced by the woman to have many fathers supporting the family. Like all cultural practices fraternal Polyandry has a specific cultural importance within the communities in which it is practiced. Schultz and Levenda give the example of the Nyinba of Nepal Polyandry is deeply integrated within the social construct and history of their culture. Polyandry has historic significant to the Nyinba as their ancestors, who also practiced it, lead harmonious lives making the present practice logical within their cultural foundation. Fraternal polyandry also holds to an important ideal of kinship through the solidarity it creates among the participating brothers. Polyandry among the Nyinba People also plays a crucial role in the set up of their society as it aids in limiting the number of households within the village, thus concentrating resources and enhancing economic possibility. Another example of polyandry is ''secondary marriage''. This is found only in northern Nigeria and northern Cameroon. In secondary marriage, a woman marries one or more husbands while staying married to all the previous husbands. The woman lives with one husband at a time, but she has all the rights to return to the others. There is no divorce is secondary marriage though, you are married for life, but you can still have different husbands.{{ref|Schultz and Lavenda 2009}} 

===== Examples of Polygamy =====
On the islands of [[W:Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst]] and [[W:Melville Island (Northern Territory)|Melville]], which are located 100km north of the mainland of Australia, there is a society of former hunter-gatherers.  This aboriginal society is called the [[W:Tiwi people|Tiwi]], and they are known for their system of polygamy. In the Tiwi culture, it is believed that a woman a woman needs to be married for her entire life, therefore women are promised to an older man before they are even born.  The men of the society do not get married until they are in their thirties and at this point may have had many girls promised to him. Upon reaching adulthood, the woman would go live with her husband and his other wives. Though the Tiwi are known for polygamy, they no longer practice it, Catholic Missionaries put an end to the polygamy and pre-arranged marriages.  {{ref| http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=0091-2131&amp;volume=25&amp;issue=3&amp;supplement=0&amp;article=235496&amp;jstor=False}} 

Throughout the United States many families practice polygamy even though the United States Supreme Court defined it as a crime in 1878. Some 40,000 people in the US state of Utah live in illegal polygamous families in which a man takes more than one wife. A recent example of polygamy in the U.S. became public knowledge in April 2008 when Yearn for Zion Ranch outside of Eldorado, Texas, belonging to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was discovered. Here 416 children and 139 adult women were removed from the ranch; a teenage girl believing to be pregnant for the second time reported becoming the seventh wife of a 49-year-old man when she turned 15. Many of the girls, some as young as 13, were “spiritually married” to men who claimed several wives.&lt;ref&gt;Sky News. http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20080641312265&lt;/ref&gt;
These fundamentalist Mormons have now begun a campaign for a change in the law they regard as discriminatory and unfair. The issue is still a constant debate over the limits of marriage, privacy, religious freedom and unequal treatment under the law. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7953270.stm]  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints does not associate itself with 'The Fundamentalists' described in these cases and many feel that they  are NOT in any way associated with Mormons.

==== Serial Monogamy vs. Serial Polygamy ====
[[w:Monogamy|Monogamy]] is when a person is only with one person at a time.  To be a serial monogamist is a lifestyle consisting of repeated relationships with one partner.  More specifically, it’s described as going from being in a sexual relationship with one person to another.[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~thepress/read.php?id=967]  This is an example of modern day dating.  Many relationships involve being with one person, and then when that relationship ends, moving on.  

Serial monogamy also applies to people who get married and divorced more than once.  Conservative Christians sometimes refer to those who frequently get married and divorced as serial polygamists, because they see them as people who have many sexual partners.  Anthropologist don’t use this term because it’s a series of one person relationships.  They aren’t with different people at once.

==== Polygynous Families ====
[[Image:Sierra Leone village woman.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Mende woman in the village of Njama in Kailahun District]]
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[w:Polygyny|Polygynous]] families are families with husbands who have multiple wives. All of the wives interact with the husband at different times individually and as a whole. The wives also have relationships with one another as individuals and as a group. There is obviously jealousy involved no matter how long ones culture has been polygynous. For example, the first wives are known to be angry at first when their husbands take on a second wife.
Polygynous families also will have children from multiple mother and the same father. The connection between the children and the true mother and same mother siblings is always different and usually stronger than with the other children. This large family of mothers and children again leads to jealousy and competition for the husband or father. 
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The competition between co-wives usually focused on how many children each wife had and what these children are given in materials and education. The wives are usually ranked higher depending on who married first, and with the addition of the status of the families they came from. The husbands are supposed to avoid showing favoritism, especially when it is out of ranking or anger and jealousy can break out in the family. 
The rivalries between wives can lead to bitter feuds and divorces. The wives depend on their children to support them after the husband dies, so educated and the passing down of land or cash is crucial. Most husbands can only afford to send one or two children to school, which is why there can be such fierce competition.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;An example of a polygynous family is the [[w:Mende people|Mende]] of Sierra Leone. The Mende culture is patrilineal, patrilocal, and polygamous. They have multiple wives with multiple children from different wives. The wives are ranked in order or marriage to the husband and from the status of the family in which they first came from. Everyone works as a group and as individuals with the husband, which is also the perfect cooking pot for competition and feuds. The Mende's are a perfect example of polygynous families, but only one of thousands of cultures with such structures.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Another example are The Nayars, a warrior group of the Malabar coast of India. This tribe had the belief in which the woman was “married” to a man she rarely saw. He received a fee for this and was considered the official “father” of her children. From adolescence, she was free to copulate with several husbands, presented to her by her mother or uncle. Each husband would spend a few days at a time with her and the privilege of hanging his weapons on her door. As wars became less common among the Nayars, they moved toward monogamy.
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Marriage customs among the Nayars have caused much controversy in India among social scientists and jurists. The two kinds of marriage: ''talikettu kalyanam'' (tying ceremony); and ''sambandham'' (the customary nuptials of a man and a woman). The tali-tying ceremony had to be held before puberty and often the ceremony was held for several girls at the same time to save on expenses. The tali could be tied by a member of a linked lineage, by a member of a higher subcaste of Nayars, by one of the matrilineal Ambilavasi (temple servant) castes, or by a member of royal lineage. By the mid-1950s it became common for girls to have the tali tied by their mothers. This is still controversial to if this was even a ceremonial marriage or just an age-grade ceremony.[http://www.everyculture.com/South-Asia/Nayar-Marriage-and-Family.html]


==== Same-Sex Marriage ====   
[[Image:New York City Proposition 8 Protest outside LDS temple 20.jpg|thumb]]
In the United States, [[W:LGBT|LGBTQ]], (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, and Questioning) individuals have only just begun to be recognized as a legitimate part of society. There is still great prejudice against members of the LGBTQ community, and hate crimes are continuously prevalent. Even though the LGBTQ community has lived under this harassment for so many years they are still making huge strides in the United States to better the lives of everyone who identifies as part of the community. This is usually done through making same sex marriage legal on the state level. Five states recognize gay marriage: Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. Five states also recognize gay partnerships: Connecticut, New Hampshire, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Washington has increased the rights provided to domestic partner that include all those for marriages on 16 April 2009. Recently Iowa legalized same sex marriages at the beginning of April, 2009. {{ref|http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/07/AR2009040702200.html}}For a map with a legend regarding the status of same-sex marriages in the U.S., click here[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Samesex_marriage_in_USA.svg]. 
Although these seem to be huge strides for the United States, many other nations have recognized gay marriage since 2003. Canada, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, and Spain allow gay marriage.
The ever spreading institution of clubs that promote equality and awareness, referred to as G.S.A. ([[W:Gay-Straight Alliance|Gay-Straight Alliance]]) in schools is also a large factor in the ever rising awareness and acceptance of the LGBTQ community, and also lends a hand to the acceptance of gay marriage (which is different on the legal level than civil unions) through these groups joining together with communities to petition for change.

Those with politically conservative views are usually much less inclined to support same-sex marriage and may treat LGBT people differently.  Growing up in a conservative area I have experienced this.  When students at my high school attempted to form a G.S.A. ([[W:Gay-Straight Alliance|Gay-Straight Alliance]]) it was so controversial that it became the first club to ever be voted on.  It did not pass.

An example of same sex marriages in another culture is woman marriage among the Nuer in Sudan. In the Nuer culture, a woman can marry another woman, thus becoming the &quot;father&quot; of the children of the &quot;wife&quot;. As part of this woman marriage among the Nuer, there is a distinction between the pater and the genitor. The pater is the term given to the woman who takes on the &quot;husband&quot; role. The genitor is a friend, neighbor, or kinsman of the pater who is used to impregnate the wife of the pater, and help around the homestead with certain tasks deemed unfit for women. In order for the marriage to become official, the pater must pay a bridewealth payment to the wife's lineage as would happen if a man were to marry a woman. This bridewealth usually consists of cattle or livestock. Aside from specific tasks given to the genitor, the pater takes on almost all social roles of a man. If wealthy enough, the pater is able to marry as many women as she likes. Furthermore, she is able to collect damage payment if her wives engage in sexual activity without her consent. In addition to this, she receives the bridewealth that would traditionally go toward the husband if one of her daughters is to marry. In addition to this her children refer to her as &quot;father.&quot; 
&lt;ref.&gt; Schultz A. Emily, Lavenda H. Robert. Cultural Anthropology: A Perspective on the Human Condition.

==== Ghost Marriage ====
[[W:Ghost marriage|Ghost marriages]] take place when a wealthy or influential male member of a village dies without any living children.  A woman will then marry his &quot;ghost&quot; at a ceremony, usually with the brother of the deceased as a stand-in.  The wife is then said to be married to the ghost of the man, and can then have his children, using the brother to facilitate this.  These children, although not biological children to the deceased, serve as heirs to his heritage and can inherit both his property and his status in a society.  However, this means that the brother is usually left without any children of his own before he dies, and then he must have his children through a ghost marriage, creating a circle. These practices are most common in Sudan but is also practiced in China, where partnership has great value.In china ghost marriages also mean when a man is married to a deceased female, more likely currently due to the growing shortage of females, so that he maintains his status in this world. This can also help the deceased brides family from feeling the shame of an unwed daughter. 

In China a ghost marriage is called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minghun Minghun]. The practices of a Minghun are conditional to that of the Sudanese ghost marriage. In arranging a ghost marriage in China, families do not use a diviner or priest, but feel the groom is &quot;chosen&quot; for the deceased ghost-bride. A red envelope used for money or gifts are placed in the middle of the street where a stranger will come to pick it up. Meanwhile the family hides. At which time the stranger picks up the envelope the family reveals itself and announces that the stranger is the ghost-bride's groom.&lt;ref&gt; Wikipedia Ghost Marriage. http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minghun &lt;/ref&gt;

Among other cultures who practice ghost marriage are the Nuer of Nigeria. The Nuer believed that a man who died without male heirs would leave an unsatisfied angry spirit behind to trouble his family. A woman would then be chosen to marry a family member of the dead man and the children produced by these two would be thought of as belonging to the man who died.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levirate_marriage Levirate Marriages] are somewhat similar to ghost marriages.  A levirate marriage is when a woman marries one of her husband's brothers after her husband has died.  In some cases, this only occurs if the husband died without children.  Then, since the woman marries his brother, the family name carries on.  These marriages have mostly happened in places in Asia and the Middle East.

==== Arranged Marriage ====
[[w:Arranged marriage|Arranged marriage]] is a relationship established by the parents or other interested parties often without consent from the couple involved. There are 5 different types or levels of arranged marriages:

*Forced: Parents dictate whom their children will marry and the children have no say in the matter.
* Traditional-Limited Traditional-Limited choice type.  However, in this level individuals are given slightly more choice and this is therefore seen as more &quot;modern&quot; method.
* Modern with Courtship: Parents will say whom their child should marry, but the child is allowed a period of courtship to get to know their intended spouse.
* Introduction Only: Parents only introduce those involved to each other, and do not force their children to marry if they do not want to.  This is seen as more of a &quot;nudge&quot; than an arrangement.

Often an arranged marriage is seen not as a bond between a couple but as a promise/approval of a union between two families. Arranged marriages usually benefit the families more than the couple, as it strengthens economic and social ties between the two. A marriage to a cousin makes sure that wealth and rank stay within the family.

http://im.rediff.com/movies/2005/jul/01poster.jpg
[[:Image:]]
Parents can make sure that the arranged marriage goes through in several ways. They can not come to a wedding that they do not approve of, they can pay only for the marriage that they want, and in some countries, they can even impose legal sanctions on the undesired marriage.

Arranged marriages tend to last, because the people participating enter the marriage with lower expectations and no responsibility.  Often the two parties will grow together, and learn to accommodate one another's needs. The responsibility for the happiness of the marriage lies with the parents who put the two together. These marriages also tend to be more functional and stable, and they can be maintained with less effort than traditional Western marriages.  This however may be due to factors relating to the beliefs and traditions of the cultures in which arranged marriages are more common.

[[w:Unification Church|The Unification Church]] strongly believes in arranged marriages. Reverend Moon started the Unification church in 1954 in Seoul, South Korea. He is believed to be “the one who clarified the Truth.” And he believes that it is his job to unify the world through integrated marriages. This religion is present in over 150 countries and in 1982, 2000 couples in the U.S were married. Reverend Moon had arranged marriages for all of his followers, which he personally picked out. Now that the church has grown immensely, he has passed down the responsibility to the mothers. Many of them have arranged spouses for their daughters by the time they are 13. However the family waits to set them up until they graduate high school or sometimes college.

==== Residence Pattern ====
[[File:Chandigarh_marriage_traditions.jpg|thumb|400px|left|A wooden wagon (Doli) in which a bride is taken to her husband's home. Although this is a thing of past now, the administration of Chandigarh depicted this in its annual Chandigarh carnival 2005.]]
After getting married the couple needs to live somewhere. And where the couple ends up varies, depending on their culture. There are four major residence patterns, Neolocal, Patrilocal, Matrilocal, and Avunculocal.

# '''Neolocal Residence''' is most common with North American couples. This is where the couple finds their own house, independent from all family members.
# '''Patrilocal Residence''' is most commonly used with herding and farming societies. It’s where the married couple lives with the husband’s father’s family. By living with the husband’s family, it lets all the men, (the father, brothers, and sons) continue to work together on the land.
# '''Matrilocal Residence''' is most familiar among horticultural groups. It’s where the couple moves to live where the wife grew up; usually found with matrilineal kinship systems. 
# '''Avunculocal Residence''' is also related in matrilineal societies however in this case the couple moves to live with the husband’s mother’s brother. They live with the most significant man, his uncle, because it’s who they will later inherit everything from.

[[Image:Megwhal woman.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A Hindu Kush woman in the Northeastern part of India in the Himalayan Region.]]
There are two other forms of residence however they aren't as common. There's Ambilocal residence where the couple lives with one family for awhile and then moves to live with the other spouse's family. Eventually they have to decide who to live with permanently. And then there's Duolocal residence where lineage membership is so important to both the husband and wife that even though the couple is married they still live apart from one another and with their families. 

The division of labor by sex largely determines where a couple resides after marriage. If the male predominates in the division of labor than the couple's residence tends to be an Avunculocal and Patrilocal residence. However if the females predominates than they tend to live in matrilocal residence. And if neither sex predominates in the division of labor than their residence tends to be more ambilocal or neolocal residence.

In the mountains of the [[w: Hindu Kush|Hindu Kush]] Himalayan region the domination of society by males is prevalent throughout the region. And because the males are so dominate in this region, the main pattern of living is Patrilocal Residence. Once couples are married the women are forced to live with the husband and the rest of his family, in unfamiliar surroundings. Marriages are generally arranged by the parents, so the women have to learn to live with strangers, without any family support that she once enjoyed at home.

=== Marriage and Economic Exchange ===
[[File:Wedding_feeding_cake.jpg|thumb|450px|right|Eating special foods such as cake is a common part of many wedding ceremonies.]]
Often paired with marriage in many cultures, is a trade of symbolic or economic goods.  These types of exchanges can mainly be fit into two distinct camps, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowry dowry] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridewealth bridewealth].

==== Dowry ====
Dowry is a transfer of wealth, usually flowing from a woman’s parents or family when she is to be married in the form of money, land or other goods.  Often, the husband brings various forms of wealth to a newly created household, and a dowry is thought of as the wife’s donation, to the household or the husband.  Dowry can also be viewed as inheritance for the woman, though this is usually in cultures where both men and women are heirs.  In other cases, such as in socially stratified societies, a dowry gives a woman the security of knowing that after she is married she can still enjoy her usual lifestyle and in the case of divorce, avoid poverty and discomfort.If the husband and wife are to be divorced, the wife is able to get back the dowry that her parents had given. Usually, a woman with a greater dowry is able to find herself a rich husband, while a woman with a smaller dowry is able to only find herself a poor husband.  Dowry is mainly found in Europe and Asia's agricultural communities, but can also be found in Africa.  The types of goods that a dowry can consist of vary greatly from society to society, but some specific examples are:

* A dowry consisting of televisions, refrigerators and air conditioners in contemporary India.
* The Western-European tradition of a bride’s family paying for the bulk of their daughters wedding.  However, this is a greatly diffused example of dowry.
* The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajput Rajput] tradition of a solely transportable dowry, consisting of jewelry, clothing, money and household goods.
More specifically, in the society of the northern Indian Khalapur Rajputs, how well women marry, and more importantly how they are treated by their husbands family corresponds directly with the size of their dowries.  This is because woman normally marry into a higher social ranking. This process forces them to move to the their husband's village ([[w: Patrilocal residence|Patrilocal Residence]]), and assume the role of foreigner along side the family.  Prior to the late 1900’s, Rajput wives actions were completely facilitated by their mother-in-laws, who gave them household jobs, oversaw how much time they spend with their husbands, and controlled their dawries- a contradiction to the idea that a dowry is a woman’s inheritance from her parents.  In more contemporary India, however, dowries have been banned, though they are still quite regularly used.

==== Bridewealth ====
Bridewealth is the transfer of symbolic goods from the husband’s family to the bride’s family.  This form of economic exchange is most often found in agricultural and pastoral [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineality patrilineal] societies, though it is not limited those lifestyles.  Usually, bridewealth represents some form of compensation to the bride’s family from the husband’s family, for their loss of her labor and ability to bear them children.  This is because when a woman marries, she goes to live, produce children, and work with her husband’s family, leaving her own.  In many cases, bridewealth also serves to create a positive relationship between the families of the husband and wife.  When the wife's family receives the bridewealth, they use the goods they receive for their daughter to find her brother a wife.  Some examples of the goods which are exchanged in regards to bridewealth are:

* A bridewealth consisting of animals, such as cattle or goats, in east and South Africa.
* A bridewealth of cash in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

=== Different Cultural Reference Rules for Marriage ===
====Endogamy====
: [[w:Endogamy|Endogamy]] is the practice of marriage within a specific cultural group or social group based on custom or law. An example of endogamy is the marriage between those who are of the same faith or belief system.

The definition of endogamy is marriage within a defined social group.  Practicing endogamy requires that you reject marrying someone on the basis that they do not fit into your social group whether it is because of religious affiliations, social classes, ethnicities, etc..  Individuals that practice endogamy say that it unifies social groups and encourages bonding.  Some say the practice of endogamy allows for cultures to survive and maintain practices and beliefs when they move to an alien area.  Yet this very same idea of cultural survival through endogamy may also lead to the extinction of some social groups that refuse to intermarry, leading to a decrease in their population.  

One social practice that can identify with endogamy is [[w:Interfaith marriage in Judaism|Jewish marriages]].  Although not all Jewish people practice endogamy, 47% of Jews in the United States are in intermarriages.  Still many orthodox rabbis will not officiate at interfaith marriages because the three major branches of Judaism do not allow, or look down upon, people who want to be in intermarriages.  This long-standing belief that intermarriages should not be allowed in Judaism comes from the idea that women are sanctified to their husbands, and this sanction cannot happen if it is not between two Jews. Endogamy is practiced for many reasons, and it is a large part of Jewish culture, but as globalization occurs more and more people are beginning to become part of intermarriages and stopping the practice of endogamy.

====Exogamy====
: [[w:Exogamy|Exogamy]] is the practice of marriage outside of a specific cultural group or social group. Exogamy was said to have arisen as a way of avoiding kinship marriage or incest. Examples of exogamy groups include, but are not limited to, people from the immediate family, people whom are considered kin, and those of the same sex. A lot of times exogamy is less likely to occur in places where different races are of higher classes than others are. Such as in South Africa the whites are considered to be of a higher class than the full africans in the townships, so a parent would be against the exogamy of a white into the african community. Exogamy is often practiced in tribal communities, where a male from one tribe will marry a woman from a tribe outside of his own. Exceptions to exogamy, such as interracial or same-sex marriages can make a person a pariah in their own community.

====Hypergamy*====
: [[w:Hypergamy|Hypergamy]] is the practice of marrying into a social or cultural group that is equal to or higher than the caste that one was born into.Hypergamy deals with women marrying into a higher class. Hypergamy includes but is not limited to marring a person of higher education, financial status, as well as social status. Usually cultures that practice hypergamy have a very strong focus on class, finances to live a good life. Hypergamy involves a person of a higher class to be willing to marry someone of a lower class. Hypergamy in nature is visible in the sense many animals of the same species mate with a male of a better gene pool in the same species. This is due to the benefits of having stronger, more healthy offspring. Also the male can provide better for the offspring than would a male who is of lesser status. With human beings it is the same way, the females want a partner who can provide for them as well as their offspring.
:Hypergamy is visible in all societies where wealth or status is important, such as in the united states women are encouraged to marry “up”. To marry someone who is older, more stable in life, as well as more financial stability. The story of Cinderella put into a real life context would be scenario of hypergamy. A poor peasant woman who has no wealth to her name marries into a very wealthy royal family.

====Hypogamy==== 
Hypogamy is the practice of a man marrying a woman of a higher class or of higher social status than himself. This happens a lot more in countries where women have an equal opportunity to make more money, or be better educated than men are. Hypogamy is less commonly found in cultures where women have less rights then men. Some examples of this are the [[w:Islamic|Islamic]] and early American cultures.

====Isogamy====
: Isogamy refers  to a biological condition where sex cells, or gametes, are identical to each other.
Many fungi and plants have isogamous gametes.  In mammals though, the ovum (female reproductive cell) is larger and looks much different than the sperm cell (male reproductive cell).  This is called anisogamy.  This may also pertain to same sex relations, since monogamy means having a committed relationship with just one partner at a time.  Isogamy could also mean being in a committed relationship with the same sex.

== Divorce ==

[[W: Divorce| Divorce ]] is a legal process in which a judge legally ends a marriage. The result leaves the two individuals status as “single”. A divorce does not declare a marriage null and void, as in an annulment, but instead states that the marriage was unsuccessful for any of a variety of reasons and declares the two individuals as single.  When a divorce takes place there are many things that the judge will have to rule on ranging from the custody of the children to the sharing of property.  Western cultures have seen a sharp increase in divorces over the past fifty years.  A study by the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University found that only 63% of American children grow up with both biological parents.
Most cultures make it possible for individuals to terminate a marriage. In some societies the process is longer and harder, while in others it is almost impossible. 
There are many countries were divorce is illegal and taboo.

==== Divorce and Children ====

There are many types of problems that can arise in a family which can lead to a divorce, some of which is dysfunction.  Not only is the dysfunction a part of the cause of divorce but can also be a factor on the adjustment that children go through when a family separates. It is often said that about half of first marriages will be dissolved, however the number is actually closer to 40-45% and projected to reach 50%, while the divorce rate is typically higher with second and third marriages (around 60-68% and 73% respectively)&lt;ref&gt; http://www.divorcerate.org/&lt;/ref&gt;. Along with that concludes that there will be an estimated half of children will live in a single parent household, regularly that being with the mother of the child.  The many possible reasons behind such a high rate of divorce is: independence of women, declining earnings among men without college degrees, rising expectations for personal fulfilment from marriage, and greater social acceptance of divorce. (Amato R. P, 2000)


There are many recommend things that parents are advised do in order for the adjustment of the divorce to go smoothly with the child/and or children involved.  It is very important to be open to discussion with your child, reassurance is key in the adjustment of a new divorce.  Assure the parties involved that it is not their fault, and making sure continuous contact with the other parent is available.  Sometimes allowing the option for counseling is very important; it allows the child and/or children involved to talk with someone else in a safe space, where they can express their emotions and not feel obligated to take sides with a parent but just allow them to talk open and honest about how they are feeling.

:As a child from a divorced marriage too, I know first-hand the challenges and hardships a child can experience with divorced parents. I was 5 years old when my parents got divorced, my sister was 3, and I did not then know what it meant to have divorced parents, but I soon found out. In our society the woman is assumed to be the primary caretaker of the children, naturally, so my sister and I lived with our mother, while we saw our dad on the weekends and holidays. This arrangement was decided in court, and I know that there are different outcomes, such as the father only seeing the children once a month, or even less, so my sister and I were pretty fortunate. For the next 13 years I became accustomed to the life of a ‘divorced child’ and hearing my parents discuss which weekend was whose was the norm.  Although divorce affects the parents greatly, I truly believe that the kids are affected the most. It’s the kids that have to tell their friends why they can hardly see them on the weekends, because that’s when they get to see their dad, and it’s the kids that have to be separated from their parents and see their parents start families with new people.

:I too am a child of a divorced marriage understanding all too well the complications of an &quot;unclean break&quot;. My parents divorced when I was four years old, my brother was only two, my parents never made it any unknown fact that they despised one another and often used us children as a medium of communication between each other that made growing up feel like a constant tug a war contest. I wasn't fully aware of how my family was &quot;different&quot; until I started kindergarten. I didn't have any living memory of mom and dad living together. I honestly thought that is how everyone's families functioned and it came as an extreme shock when I discovered that this was far from the case. I came home with a lot of questions and hurt feelings I didn't play house right they said mommies lived with daddies, well mine didn't, why was that? I got two different answers from both my parents each belittling and blaming the other (it was a constant custody battle between my parents until I moved to Washington when I was 18. It wasn't until this year I discovered the truth behind my parent divorce 15 years after I initially asked. I'm almost 21 years old now and it still bothers me that I don't know what it's like to have one mom and one dad, one house, and one family life. When I moved here and lived with my Aunt and my Uncle I found I didn't even know how to live in a &quot;normal&quot; family setting. I was use to changing houses once a week, if one parent upset me I knew that I only had a few days and I'd see the other, I couldn't do that anymore I socially felt cheated and frustrated. I understand how deeply a divorce can affect the parents involved but I agree that it is the kids who suffer the greatest from the division. It's the children who have to cope with the battle line, who are cheated time with one parent for another because of a court order. Who can't have regular social lives because their schedules are double, their time decided between two parties, it's the children who have to witness the beginning of new families for possibly both parents. It's not easy, and if the adults handle it poorly as mine did it feels impossible and you grow up quick, you have too.

While divorce is often looked negatively upon, it sometimes is needed. To force a couple to stay together has the potential to cause more problems then if they were separated. People who have lived through a parents nasty divorce often see all the negative aspects but it's hard to see from another perspective when there is only anger and fighting around you. My parents only stay together because they can not afford to be separated, my Dad makes the most money. It's awful knowing that they don't love each other anymore, because they used to, and I remember what that was like. They're still married in the legal sense, but they act more like roommates than husband and wife. They're just staying together for the kids.

It is important also, as a child of divorced parents, to acknowledge that what happened between your parents was for the best. This then helps the coping process, whether young or old, and can reduces any blame a child feels for their parents. &lt;ref&gt;KS-childofdivorce&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Divorce in Islam ====
The Islamic world has accepted divorce reluctantly. Divorce in Islam is used only in the most “necessary” situations. Islamic societies do not want private affairs to become public in the court except in extreme circumstances. It is for this reason that court comes in as a last resort in the Islamic method for separation of husband and wife.
Islam does not like or recommend divorce, the Prophet of Islam has said:
&quot;Among lawful things, divorce is most disliked by Allah&quot; (narrated in the book of tradition of Abu Daud).

Divorce in Islam is focused on the reconciliation of the married couple whenever possible. Before the Divorce can be finalized there is a period of time, called the waiting time, where the husband is still in control of his wife (still married). This waiting time is used to reconcile the couple. During this time the wife must not be menstruating. If however the waiting period passes without reconciliation, they stand fully divorced. 
A Muslim male is allowed to change his mind up to three times. The male can divorce his wife three times and each time take her back, but when the third strike is in, the man can no longer have any contact with his ex-wife, she’s prohibited to him.

==== Divorce/Seperation among the Inuit ====
For the northwestern Iniut all relationships are permanent.  A husband and wife can move away from one another, but then they become &quot;seperated&quot; not divorced.  If they ever reunite, then their marriage is reactivated. If, however, the man and women both get remarried, then the two husbands become &quot;cohusbands&quot; of the wife, the two women would become &quot;cowives,&quot; and children from both families would become &quot;cosiblings.&quot; This is interesting because in this case divorces don't sever family ties, they increase them. Therefore the Inuit's relationships are often complicated and intricate{{ref|Schultz and Lavenda 2009}}


=== Divorce and The Catholic Church ===

Christianity as a general whole frowns upon divorce shading it as very negative. However, toleration among the different Christian domination's differs. The Roman Catholic Church for example expressly forbids divorce for any sacramental(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacraments) consummated (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consummate) marriage defining a couple as wed until the death of one or both of the spouses or unless an annulment is granted. If there is no annulment, then even if separated, they may not remarry and are not considered &quot;single&quot; as defined by the term divorce. The topic of divorce can be found bibliographically in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and the epistles of Paul. Paul addresses this issue forwardly in &quot;his First Epistle to the Corinthians chapter 7: &quot;Let not the wife depart from her husband...let not the husband put away his wife&quot; (1 Corinthians 7:10-11)&quot; and in &quot;his Epistle to the Romans stating:&quot;For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth...So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress&quot; (Romans 7:2-3)&quot;. Demonstrating clearly the Roman Catholic view on the topic of divorce and the biblical support in it's standing. {http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_divorce}}

==== Divorce and American Society ====

“If the family is the building block of society, then marriage is the foundation of the family. (Fagan)” Divorce in the US is estimated to, by the National Center for Health Statistics, to occur in 43% of all marriages (Divorce Rates&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Divorce Rates - Divorce Statistics Collection.&quot; Americans for Divorce Reform, Inc. 09 Mar. 2009 &lt;http://www.divorcereform.org/rates.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;). The effects of so many divorces have tremendous long-term impacts on both the divorcees and any children involved. And divorce will affect not only the current generation but is suggested by mounting social evidence to even affect future generations. This has severe impacts on the society as a whole, with so many divorces occurring. For example, it is estimated that families with children that were not poor before see their income drop by about fifty percent after a divorce; this then affects society as a whole when that family seeks financial assistance from the government. the US government spends $150 billion each year to subsidize and sustain single parent families compared to $150 million spent annually on programs to strengthen marriage. In other words, for every $1000 spent after a divorce only $1 is spent to help families sustain their marriage. In addition many families who experience divorce do not maintain the same religious practices they had while married, this can be for several reasons. However, religious practice of any kind has been linked to better health, longer marriages and a healthier overall family, thus the reduction in practice can worsen the effects of the divorce on the children and parents. Marriage is an important aspect of any society, and the US government should realize this and re-focus spending to help sustain this vital aspect to increase the health of its current people and those to come (Fagan&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Patrick F., and Robert E. Rector. &quot;The Effects of Divorce on America.&quot; Heritage Foundation. 05 June 2000. 09 Mar. 2009 &lt;http://www.heritage.org/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Kinship ==
[[w:Kinship|Kinship]] refers to the culturally distinct relationships between individuals who are most likely thought of having family ties. Societies use kinship as a basis for forming social groups or for classifying people into roles and categories{{ref|The Nature of Kinship}}. In anthropology, kinship includes people who are related by lineage and marriage. In many societies, kinship provides a way for transmitting status and property from one generation to the next. An ethnographic example of kinship would be in today's American culture, where the way in which kinship works can be seen when it comes to inheritance and the wills of the deceased. The closest in kin, such as the spouse or the children, tend to receive the inheritance before other, more distant, relatives do. An example of kinship in the Hindu religion is after the death of a family member, the rest of the family doesn't bath for sometimes ten or eleven days. After that period is up the family then meets for a ceremonial meal and many times will offer gifts to charity. &lt;ref&gt; Austin Cline, About.com. http://atheism.about.com/od/hindusandhinduism/a/IndiaRituals.htm &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Types of Kinship===

There are different ways kinship can be recognized. [[w:Affinity (sociology)|Affinity]] is a relationship created by marriage. For example, two close friends could become siblings, through the marriage of their parents. Ambilocal and avunculocal refer to types of residential affinity: where the married couple lives.  Ambilocal means the newly married couple lives with the parents of the husband or wife; avunculocal means the couple matrilineal brother of the wife. Bilocal is another residential affinity term referring to the couple alternating between the houses of the parents of the husband and the parents of the wife; patrilocal is when the couple resides in the home of the husband's father, and matrilocal in the wife's mother's home. Finally, uxorilocal refers to living with the wife's kin, and virilocal with the husband's. All of these terms describe the aspect of affinity that creates a new type of kin; by living with the parents or kin of ones husband or wife, it creates a new bond between the spouse and the parents. This is generally a positive experience, though the couples may end up living neolocally, or away from their parents.{{ref|MSU}}

Typically, ones kin is thought of as their [[w:Nuclear family|nuclear family]], or the family consisting of a husband, wife, and children (this is sometimes referred to as 'immediate family'). The biological father in this family is the genitor, and the mother the genetrix; usually, a nuclear family consists of those who are related biologically, or consanguine. This belief of ones nuclear family being their kin is due to the fact that there is a more intimate and comfortable environment among those with whom one lives. One develops habits and ways of acting that they would only exhibit in their home environment--eating habits, clothing, diction, etc. Within this environment, however, the relationships formed also form the general habits and behaviors of the individual. The family creates expectations for the way the individuals act toward their 'extended family'--aunts, uncles, grandparents--who are also members of their kin.

[[Image:Families US.png|thumb|300px|Family arrangements in the United States have become more diverse with no particular household arrangement representing half of the United States population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marriages, Families &amp; Intinamte Relationships&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom |year=2005 |title=Marriages, Families &amp; Intinamte Relationships |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston, MA |id=0-205-36674-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Though most of the residential arrangements consist of simply a nuclear family, it is becoming more and more diverse with adoption, families not willing to put their elders in nursing homes, and unemployment creating tough living situations for some; as kin, it is expected that we are willing to offer help, shelter, and monetary support to those to whom we are related. 

==== The Japanese Family ====
An ethnographic example of how a &quot;family&quot; is defined is the family structure in contemporary Japan. The contemporary Japanese family is much like that of the contemporary American family, usually consisting of a mother, father, and children living in the same household (nuclear family). Present family forms were developed from the traditional Japanese family, also known as the [[w:Ie (Japanese family system)|Ie]] (家) (pronounced 'e-ay'). This traditional system is unfamiliar to most Americans because it is more complex than what we are used to. The system consists of multigenerational households in which extended families, sometimes all the way up to great grandparents, all live together. The line of descent is patrilinial, or traced through the father. The children are expected to eventually leave the family to join another family and find their own way in the world with regard to a household, career, and the like. Rural families with more than one son typically send their second or third sons into the city to begin finding work in the more contemporary and industrial society.

However, the concept of primogeniture is a distinct aspect of the Japanese kinship system, but not unique to just Japan. Primogeniture is passing the entire estate of the family, social role, financial assets, occupation from father to usually the eldest son. This way, the family name and social status is passed patrilinially, as it is traditionally, and kept for the coming generations.

Historically, there was a different social cultural dynamic when it came to family roles. Presently, the family roles are, again, very much like those of the contemporary American family. The father generally goes to a job outside of the home, but there are many family owned businesses in Japan where family lives in the same building as the location of their business (in this case, there is not such a separation between the father’s home life and work life). Because the father is away for long hours nearly every day of the week at work, this creates Japanese family dynamic: the father has less time to spend with the children. This puts stress on the mother, who oversees children’s education, and manages finances. Because she must be in charge of all of this, and keeping the household in order, the intimate relationship that usually exists between a mother and her children is essentially non-existent; rather, the relationship is very strained.{{ref|Columbia U}}

With all kinship, the behaviors and closeness of relationships, the traditions created within families, the way we refer to our relatives, and the rules of residency all depend on familial descent.

==== Different Types of Descent ====

;Unilineal Descent
: Unilineal decent groups can be found in many different places around the world. This principle is based on the fact that people believe that they are related to their kin through either their mother OR father, not both.  They base this descent of the belief that the parent-child relationships are more important than any other type of relationship.
Unilineal descent groups that are made up of links from the father's side of the family are patrilineal; and descent groups that are made through links of the mother's side are matrilineal. {{ref|&quot;Cultural Anthropology&quot; Schultz/Lavenda. 2009.}}


;Patrilineal Descent
[[Image:Male.svg|thumb|The shield and spear of the Roman god Mars, which is also the alchemical symbol for iron, represents the male sex.[[w:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male#Symbol|male symbol]]]]
: In the patrilineal system the child is linked with the group through male sex links only; the lineage of his/her father. This is found among 44% of all cultures. Within this type of descent it is the men who own the property, have political power, and hold status even though their livelihood depends on the women of their society for children. Daughters are often discriminated against within their own families because any investment made in them by the family will be lost when she is married. In most cases the daughters of a lineage will marry into another lineage and be exchanged for a [[w:bridewealth|Bride price]]. The [[w:Nuer|Nuer]] are a good example of patrilinear descent: the clans are linked and separated by patrilineal ties which determined their &quot;ancestors and symbols, corporate rights in territory, and common interests in cattle&quot; {{ref|SL}}[[Image:Female.svg|thumb|The hand mirror and comb of the Roman goddess Venus is often used to represent the female sex.[[w:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female|female symbol]]]]


;Matrilineal Descent
: The child of a matrilineal system is linked to the group through the lineage of their mother. This is found among 15% of all cultures. Contrary to Patrilineal descent, Matrilineal descent is not a monarchy. Within this type of descent it is the women who own the property and hold social power however it is men who work with the land by farming or animal husbandry.  It is the husbands who marry into the wives lineage and work her land. Matrilineal decent is common within a horticulturally based mode of production and less common within an agriculturally based one; it does not work with increased wealth, differentiation, or inequality. {{ref|Douglas}} Markumakkathayam is an example of matrilinear descent: &quot;It was one of the few traditional systems that gave women some liberty, and the right to property... the family lived together in a Tharavadu, which comprised a mother, her brothers and younger sisters, and her children. The oldest male member was known as the karanavar and was the head of the household and managed the family estate. Lineage was traced through the mother, and the children &quot;belonged&quot; to the mother's family. All family property was jointly owned. An example is the former princely state of Tiruvitankoor, where the royal lineage passes from the king to his nephew, rather than his son.&quot;{{ref|MD}}


;Bilineal Descent
: Bilineal decent is most familiar to the western cultures.  This particular group links individuals with the lineage of both the mother and father (relatives). For example, I would trace my family line through my Father's side of the family, as well as my Mother's, with both having equal importance to myself. 
Anthropologists also refer to bilineal descent as ''bilateral descent'', which is the principle that a descent group is formed by people who believe they are related to each other by connections made through their mothers and fathers equally. Another form of bilineal descent is the ''bilateral kindred.'' This group is much more common and consists of the relatives of one person or group of siblings and is the kinship group that most European and North Americans are familiar with. This type of group forms around a particular individual and includes all the people linked to that individual through kin of both sexes. These people refer to themselves as relatives to one another.  {{ref|&quot;Cultural Anthropology&quot; Schultz/Lavenda. 2009.}} 


;Ambilineal descent
: Individuals are descended from both parents, but are able to choose from which group they would like more affiliation. For example, in Jewish culture, it is said that the children are Jewish if their mother is Jewish; on the other hand, if the father (only) is Jewish, the children can make a choice as to whether or not they want to belong to the Jewish faith as well.


===== Household Forms =====

==== The Definition of a Family ====
A family is a primary social group, a small community, in any society, typically consisting of a man and a woman, or any two individuals who wish to share their lives together in a long-term committed relationship with one another, raising offspring and usually resides in the same dwelling. However, anthropologist and feminist have debated whether or not an adult male has to be presence to be considered a family.  Because of this anthropologist have come up with different terms to distinguish between these different types of families. A [[w:conjugal family|conjugal family]] is one where a family is based on a marriage, a husband and wife, and their children. In most societies in the conjugal family, the spouse lives in the same dwelling, along with their children, though there are still some where the husband does not live with the wife and kids, but frequently visit them. A non-conjugal family also known as matrifocal family consists of just a woman and her children where the husband/father may be occasionally present or even completely absent. From my own experience with single woman I have observed that the woman in this particular example of a family is to focus on her children and making their lives as easy as possible. I have also experience this, for my mother raised my two older brothers and three older sisters all by herself and has always put us first trying to give us the best live possible. When a woman is left with minimal resources, in most cases, these resources are spent on the children. Non conjugal families cross culturally are usually infrequent, however, in the United States non-conjugal families have become increasingly more frequent. Family is the main building block of a community or any given society and it is where one develops values and traits necessary to live an honorable life. 

Families in the West  [[File:Family trip to Oregon.jpg|250px|right]] &lt;br&gt;
Families in the west are commonly referred to as nuclear families, to refer to a conjugal family, with the only difference being nuclear families having relatively close ties with the [[w:kindred| kindred's]]. A study was done on the family discourses in L.A, California and Rome, Italy. The families from L.A seemed to set apart time for isolated time with their children, leaving their communities outside. However, the Roman families tend to include the outside communities in their family bonding time.These two different family discourses could be the result of many years of oral traditions and the different varieties of the communities around them. This example of family discourses can help one to understand the impact the outside communities can have on the relationship between a family. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=0091-2131&amp;volume=36&amp;issue=3&amp;supplement=0&amp;article=235775&amp;jstor=False &lt;/ref&gt;. Having an extended family is also very common in the United States. An extended family refers to a consanguinal family and also kindred who do not belong to the conjugal family. A kindred family is an egocentric network of relatives that extends beyond the domestic group. Therefore, an extended family are people such as grandparents, great aunts/uncles, 2nd&amp;3rd cousins etc.  In the early 16th and 17th century, a family consisted between a man and a woman, with strictly-defined gender roles. The man typically was the support and brought in the income while the woman was to take care of family and home matters. Now in the 21st century, gender roles are no longer expected and nuclear families have become less common and single parent families are becoming more frequent. Size has also changed over the years. It was very common to have large families back in the day. Many religions encouraged many children resulting in large families. Now days, increases and knowledge about family planning, concerns of over population as well as the economic downfall have decreased the size of families.

==== Single Parent ====
In the Single parent Household form, there is only one parent caring for the children of the house without the help of the other parent in the home setting. This single parent style of parenting can happen as a result of a several reasons. In many instances, single parenthood happens by choice of the parents. Two parents can choose to divorce. Or a single person can choose to adopt a child, or use artificial insemination. Women can also choose to be surrogate mothers or have an extramarital pregnancy. Single parenting can also happen by the death of a parent or abandonment by one of the parents. According to a Census done in 2007 by the U.S Census Bureau, about 9%, (12.9 million) of families in The U.S are run by single parents. 10.4 million of those families are run by single mothers and 2.9 million are single-father families. [http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/families_households/009842.html]

==== Single Person ====
This household form consists of only one person living by themselves. According to the U.S. census bureau, this is the fastest growing household form since 1980; especially in large cities such as New York City. Despite New York City's massive population, Manhattan has the highest percentage of single person households out of any place in the world. [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/09/03/census_says_manhattan_first_in_single_person_households/]

==== Nuclear ====
The term nuclear family is used to refer to a family and household setting that consists of a father, a mother, and their children. Nuclear families can be any size as long as long as the family can support itself and there are only 2 parents. If there is more than 2 parental figures in the family then it goes from being a nuclear family to an [[w:Nuclear Family|extended family]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_family]
The Nuclear family is a symbol that is deeply rooted into western culture. Historical studies in western family life  have shown that this household form has been extremely common as far back as history reaches, especially in the Northwest part of Europe in countries like England, Holland, Northern France, and Belgium. [http://family.jrank.org/pages/1222/Nuclear-Families.html]

==== Extended Polygamous ====
A Polygamous family is one where there is one father and multiple wives. In this type of family, the first or oldest wife is typically the head of the household when the husband is away.  Her children are usually the heirs of the man's wealth.  If, however, the first wife dies, then the children must fight the next oldest wife for their right as heirs.  An extended family is where there is a nuclear family with added family members such as grandparents or relatives.
The Polygamous household form is most preferred by 80-85% of world societies. This type of living situation is most common in places where women do most of the work or there is a shortage of males. [http://ksuanth.wetpaint.com/page/Marriage+Family+and+Household+Discussion?t=anon]

==== Divorce and Remarriage ====

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce Divorce]and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remarriage remarriage] is becoming more common in today’s societies around the world. Divorce is the separation of a married couple allowing them to become remarried to someone else. The process of divorce can be long and difficult depending on the society. Another complication can be added in societies that involve bridewealth. This happens when a man who divorces his wife expects some of the bridewealth back causing a whole clan of marriages to be possibly broken up. In other societies it is easier to acquire a divorce. Depending on the culture, quarreling, cruelty, or adultery may be cited the cause for a divorce. Commonly, mutual consent is all that is necessary. Also, if there are children involved with the divorce, majority of the time custody will go to the child’s mother in most societies. It is also starting to become common for both parents to receive co-custody of the child. If the parent that receives the custody remarries and brings the child with them to the new family, the family may resemble the dynamics of polygynous families. This may cause the relations between the children and relations with their parents to become complex and negotiated over time. 

http://clobbergirl.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/divorce-decree1.jpg Image of divorce document.

Divorce and remarriage in the U.S. culture is very common in today’s society. Over 50 percent of marriages end with divorce in this era. With so many people getting divorces, many times the people will get remarried and it isn’t uncommon for this to occur. Although this is not unusual, it still can be very devastating for everyone involved. I have seen the effects of parents getting a divorce on many of my friends and it can create a very difficult situation.  Also, if the parents where to marry someone else then this can cause some awkwardness for the kids involved, towards the new family. Even though many couples are getting divorces and remarrying in this culture, it still can take a toll on the people involved no matter how common it has become.

==== Individualism ====

Even though kinship is most often termed as family ties, the view of individualism within a culture affects kinship interactions.  [[W:Individualism|Individualism]] has been perpetuated in American culture as a positive attribute to posses.[[Image:RWEmerson2.jpg‎|thumb|Ralph Waldo Emerson]] Authors of great works in American culture such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Nathanial Hawthorne, and F. Scott Fitzgerald all in some way or another stressed the importance of individualism, and the importance of retaining one’s own particular identity despite the pressures of society or other people to conform. In a good number of American families it is not uncommon to be separated for most of the day. Children go off to school or daycare while parents go off to work, often for long hours. When they reunite at home, often it is only for a short time to catch up on the day’s news before they all separate to their own parts of the house for their alone time. Alone time is greatly valued as a time to relax from a busy day. Family members might even be in the same room, yet engaging in different activities. Nevertheless, if one asked these people if they loved their family, they would most likely say they did.  In other cultures, this long separation between families might sound unloving and very strange. In a culture where there is a collective effort to survive, for example, there is an incentive to work together and never venture off alone. This creates a bond that a family needs each other to survive in more pertinent terms than in American culture. In these kind of cultures and others there is no separation of alone time and family time. A sign of individualism means something different according to different cultures, and is reflected in how people choose to spend their time.

== Genealogy ==
[[Image:900-158 Ahnentafel Herzog Ludwig.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Herzon Ludwig family tree]]
Genealogy which stems from the Greek words [[W:logos|logos]] and [[W:genea|genea]] meaning descent knowledge is the study of family’s lineages through history. [[W:Genealogy|Genealogists]] strive to learn when, where, and how certain people lived. Their subjects are usually their ancestors, particular small groups, or an important or famous person.

Genealogy was traditionally used in Western societies to determine the blood rights of nobles and kings. The ruling class used genealogy and recorded their lineage because being a noble or royalty gave them certain privileges. Genealogy is now mainly used by hobbyists, who easily use resources on the internet to track their family history. One site commonly used for this is http://www.genealogy.com/index_r.html.

Genealogy is not the same as kinship.  Genealogy is the study of tracing a family's lineage all the way back to the earliest ancestor, whereas kinship is based around the feeling of relatedness to people through descent, sharing, or marriage.

== Friendship ==

A dictionary definition of friendship is &quot;one joined to another in intimacy and mutual benevolence independent of sexual or family love.&quot; Friendship is the &quot;unofficial&quot; bonds that people construct for others. As ties to kinship transform the importance of friendship increases. This brings about the emergence of new forms of friendship.{{ref|Schultz and Lavenda 2009}}

=== Examples of Friendship ===

==== Friendship within the Family ====

Even though Western societies try to separate friendship and kinship, in practice they are usually connected. This is best seen in husbands and wives consider themselves &quot;best friends&quot; or siblings considering each other their best friends.

Many parents in Western societies encourage their children to be friends. Throughout childhood parents are constantly trying to get siblings to get along. From the time as young children and sharing toys, to teenagers and having the older sibling drop the younger one off at places. From a young age Americans are taught to love, respect, and be kind to their other siblings.

==== The Bangwa ====

The Bangwa of Cameroon value friendship above kinship. Friendship is valued more because within kinship there are the inequalities of age and status, whereas friends spend long hours together and rely on one another in politics. Friendship aids in balance out the defects and limitations of kinship. {{ref|Schultz and Lavenda 2009}}

==== American College Students ====

In college friends are chosen companions free of outside influences. In these friendships you express your true self. The downfall of this friendship is that it is invisible and there is no clear declaration of the friendship. {{ref|Schultz and Lavenda 2009}}

====Roman Friendship====

The Romans believe that, for a friendship to exist, the two people must be completely and entirely honest and truthful with each other.  It is not considered a true friendship if this is not the case.  Romans also believe that a friend should be able to do something for the other without any thought whatsoever of a sort of repayment.  If a friend is going to do something against your morals, it is your obligation as their friend to talk them out of it and show them the error of their ways.

Hi Veronica It looks like this image cannot be used,  I looked at the source page you have referenced (a blog) and there is not much info on it. My father has spent a fair amount of time in N.

== [[Basic Writing/Transitions]] ==

Hi Sunjoodo,

I noticed that you uploaded two files, [[:File:Logicaltransitions.jpg]] and [[:File:Logicalconnectors.JPG]] which seem to be duplicates just with different size. Note that the Mediawiki software which Wikibooks runs actually resizes images so you won't need to upload every size you wish to use.

Secondly, before uploading images, it is good practice to check if there are any images already available, either on Wikibooks itself, or on [[Commons:|Wikimedia Commons]], a great media repository. You can use images on Commons as if they were here locally. If you are looking for images of the Burrard Bridge, you can [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=burrard+bridge&amp;go=Go search] for it there. They even have a category for it: [[commons:Category:Burrard Bridge]].

Should you wish to upload a new image under a free license, please consider uploading it to Commons. Make sure you specify the license under which the image is released. Happy editing! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:50, 26 February 2009 (UTC)

== Your comment from the main page ==

Hi Theunixgeek,

[[Talk:Main Page]] is only for discussing the Main Page itself. Discussions go in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]]s. I've moved yours to [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects#Language Courses Need Some Fixing]] and replied to it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:38, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

== Importing pages ==

I noticed that a page you added, [[Business Strategy/Contents/Marketing Plans]], seems to be a copy-paste of [[w:Marketing plan]]. We are actually able to import pages from Wikipedia as well as several other Wikimedia projects to preserve the edit history as required by the GFDL. Please see [[Wikibooks:Requests for Import]] for more. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:53, 26 February 2009 (UTC)

== Brazilian Portuguese duplication merge proposal ==
Hi there. You created the Brazilian Portuguese wikibook back in 2009. It looks like you've done an excellent job of the first few lessons. I'd like to help extend this.

But there is a problem with the separate wikibook as far as I can see. It's a duplicating the same idea which somebody else initiated earlier. I've started a discussion about how we can resolve this duplication: [[Talk:Portuguese/Contents#Separate wikibook Brazilian Portuguese]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The study of rings originated from the theory of polynomial rings and the theory of algebraic integers. Furthermore, the appearance of hypercomplex numbers in the mid-nineteenth century undercut the pre-eminence of fields in mathematical analysis.

Richard Dedekind introduced the concept of a ring.

The term ring (Zahlring) was coined by David Hilbert in the article Die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlkörper, Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker Vereinigung, Vol. 4, 1897.

The first axiomatic definition of a ring was given by Adolf Fraenkel in an essay in Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (A. L. Crelle), vol. 145, 1914.

In 1921, Emmy Noether gave the first axiomatic foundation of the theory of commutative rings in her monumental paper Ideal Theory in Rings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We will start by the definition of a ring.

'''Definition 1''': A ring is a non empty set R together with two binary compositions defined by + and ., and satisfying the following properties hold for any &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in R&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;a+b\in R&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a+b=b+a&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c&lt;/math&gt;
* There exists an element denoted by &lt;math&gt;0\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a+0=a&lt;/math&gt;. 0 is called the '''additive identity''' or the '''zero element''' in R.
* For each &lt;math&gt;a\in R&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an element &lt;math&gt;b\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a+b=0&lt;/math&gt;. b is called '''additive inverse''' or '''negative''' of a and is written as b=-a so that a+(-a)=0.
* &lt;math&gt;a.b\in R&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a.(b.c)=(a.b).c&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a.(b+c)=a.b+a.c&lt;/math&gt; ('''Left distributive law.''')
* &lt;math&gt;(a+b).c=a.c+b.c&lt;/math&gt; ('''Right distributive law.''')


We denote a ring by (R,+,.). When the context is clear we just talk about a ring R and assume that the operations + and . are implicit. We will also drop the . in the operation a.b and just say ab.

The first 5 axioms of a ring just mean that (R,+) is an abelian group. The next two mean that (R,.) is a semi group. A ring is called '''commutative''' if &lt;math&gt;a.b=b.a\ \forall a,b\in R&lt;/math&gt;. A ring is called '''boolean''' if &lt;math&gt;x^2=x\ \forall x\in R &lt;/math&gt;. A ring R is called a ring with a '''unit element''' or '''unity''' or '''identity''' if &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; an element &lt;math&gt;e\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ae=ea=a\ \forall a\in R&lt;/math&gt;. Let R be a ring with unit element e. An element &lt;math&gt;a\in R&lt;/math&gt; is called '''invertible''', if there exists an element &lt;math&gt;b\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ab=ba=e&lt;/math&gt;. If n is a positive integer and a an element of a ring R then we define &lt;math&gt;a^n=\underbrace{aa\cdots a}_{n\ times}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;na=\underbrace{a+a\cdots +a}_{n\ times}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

One of the most important rings is the ring of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; with usual addition and multiplication playing the roles of + and . respectively. It is a commutative ring with identity as 1. The set of even numbers &lt;math&gt;2\mathbb{Z}:=\{0,\pm 2,\pm 4\cdots\}&lt;/math&gt; is an example of a ring without identity. Like &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, the sets of rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and of complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; are also rings with identity. However &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is not a ring.

The '''ring of Gaussian integers''' is given by the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[i]=\{m+ni:m,n\in\mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt; where usual addition and multiplication of complex numbers are the operations. Here i stands (0,1) as is usual in the complex plane.

The set of all n by n matrices with real entries is an example of a non commutative ring with identity, under the usual addition and multiplication of matrices.

===The ring of integers modulo n===

We now digress slightly to discuss a special kind of an equivalence relation which gives rise to an important class of finite rings.

Let n be a positive integer. Two integers ''a'' and ''b'' are said to be '''congruent''' '''modulo''' ''n'', if their difference ''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b'' is an integer multiple of ''n''. If this is the case, it is expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;a \equiv b \pmod n.\,&lt;/math&gt;      

The above mathematical statement is read: &quot;''a'' is congruent to ''b'' '''modulo''' ''n''&quot;.

For example,

:&lt;math&gt;38 \equiv 14 \pmod {12}\,&lt;/math&gt;

because 38 &amp;minus; 14 = 24, which is a multiple of 12. For positive ''n'' and non-negative ''a'' and ''b'', congruence of ''a'' and ''b'' can also be thought of as asserting that these two numbers have the same remainder after dividing by the modulus ''n''. So,

:&lt;math&gt;38 \equiv 2 \pmod {12}\,&lt;/math&gt;

because both numbers, when divided by 12, have the same remainder (2). Equivalently, the fractional parts of doing a full division of each of the numbers by 12 are the same: .1666... (38/12 = 3.166..., 2/12 = .1666...). From the prior definition we also see that their difference, a - b = 36, is a whole number (integer) multiple of 12 ( n = 12, 36/12 = 3). 

The same rule holds for negative values of ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt;-3 \equiv 2 \pmod 5.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The properties that make this relation a congruence relation (respecting addition, subtraction, and multiplication) are the following.

If &lt;math&gt;a_1 \equiv b_1 \pmod n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_2 \equiv b_2 \pmod n&lt;/math&gt;, then:

*&lt;math&gt;(a_1 + a_2) \equiv (b_1 + b_2) \pmod n\,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;(a_1 - a_2) \equiv (b_1 - b_2) \pmod n\,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;(a_1 a_2) \equiv (b_1 b_2) \pmod n.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Like any congruence relation, congruence modulo ''n'' is an [[w:equivalence relation|equivalence relation]], and the [[w:equivalence class|equivalence class]] of the integer ''a'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_n&lt;/math&gt;, is the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{\ldots, a - 2n, a - n, a, a + n, a + 2n, \ldots \right\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set, consisting of the integers congruent to ''a'' modulo ''n'', is called the '''congruence class''' or '''residue class''' of ''a'' modulo ''n''. Another notation for this congruence class, which requires that in the context the modulus is known, is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle [a]&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of congruence classes modulo ''n'' is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; (or, alternatively, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;) and defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \left\{ \overline{a}_n | a \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

When ''n'' ≠ 0, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; has ''n'' elements, and can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \left\{ \overline{0}_n, \overline{1}_n, \overline{2}_n,\ldots, \overline{n-1}_n \right\}.&lt;/math&gt; 

We can define addition, subtraction, and multiplication on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; by the following rules:

* &lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_n + \overline{b}_n = \overline{a + b}_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_n - \overline{b}_n = \overline{a - b}_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_n \overline{b}_n = \overline{ab}_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The verification that this is a proper definition uses the properties given before.
 
In this way, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; becomes a commutative ring.  For example, in the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{12}_{24} + \overline{21}_{24} = \overline{9}_{24}&lt;/math&gt;
as in the arithmetic for the 24-hour clock.

I am Abi, and I am on the faculty of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. Specifically, I am with the Department of Materials Engineering. My home page is here.

My research interests are in computational modelling of microstructures and their evolution. Our group has considerable experience in the use of phase field models in a variety of settings to study grain boundary effects during spinodal decomposition, elastic inhomogeneity effects on coherent microstructures (phase inversion, rafting and thin film instabilities) and multi-variant microstructures produced by precipitation of an ordered phase from a disordered matrix.

&quot;Chaco Canyon: Costly Signaling and the Evolution of
Pilgrimage Centers&quot;

Thursday February 4th
4:00 PM, Hibben Center 105

This presentation will consider how the practice of pilgrimage is a
costly signal of religious adherence, for pilgrims typically engage in
a variety of costly behaviors that affirm their commitment to the
religion while operating as a deterrent to cheaters. At the same time,
the pilgrimage center itself is a separate but interrelated costly
signal of power. I propose that both costly signals operate
side-by-side to promote cooperation and differentiation simultaneously,
qualities that mark many middle-range societies. Expectations of the
model are considered and evaluated using the 11th-century pilgrimage
center of Chaco Canyon as a case study.

I made a few minor edits under &quot;myth.&quot; A couple sentences seemed contradictory to one another. The second one stated &quot;well, this is not always true&quot; and that seemed quite unprofessional so I deleted it and rewrote the sentence so it had a better flow.


I edited some definitions in Magic, Contagious Magic, Functions of Religion, and Concepts of Supernatural Beings. [[User: melkim]]

In the first paragraph concerning Christianity, I cleaned up a few awkward and lengthy sentences. I also deleted the mention of &quot;animal sacrifices concerning the crucifixion because this seemed random and there was no citation giving it credibility. [[User:Eck4068|Eck4068]] ([[User talk:Eck4068|talk]]) 22:40, 9 March 2009 (UTC) Eck4068

I thought it was important to add that rituals do not always have to be religious in nature. [[User:Sechrist7888|Sechrist7888]] ([[User talk:Sechrist7888|talk]]) 22:45, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

I also thought it would be good to give at least a short discussion/definition of religion here as well, since ritual was discussed in this section (so both are covered in this intro). [[User:Sechrist7888|Sechrist7888]] ([[User talk:Sechrist7888|talk]]) 22:57, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

I added a picture to the ritual section to give a visual.  [[user:wilber6199]]

I added a little to the end of the religion part. I added that as time passes and cultures change, religons also change. I also added some present day religions and linked them to other Wikipedia articles. [[User:Rosbacw|Rosbacw]] ([[User talk:Rosbacw|talk]]) 00:53, 2 March 2009 (UTC)


I editied the the doctrine section and added some content as it was missing a few things on what doctrine is, and was stating something a little confusing. [[User:Hennessy01|Hennessy7730]]

I added the section on Satanism because I felt that it would contribute to the Wikibooks information  [[User:Sandlij|Sandlij]]

I added the section on Rites of Passage under ritual so that there could be a detailed description of an actual ritual type. [[User:Mcnabba|Mcnabba]] ([[User talk:Mcnabba|talk]]) 15:27, 9 March 2009

          o 1.1 Religion
                + 1.1.1 Origin of Religion
I expanded just a little on the origin of religion and it's development as a concept. --[[User:FBetancourt|FBetancourt]] ([[User talk:FBetancourt|talk]]) 05:58, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for editing my section. I left the changes that you made, but also made some changes of my own in terms of sentence structure to go along with the changes you made. I think section flows a lot more nicely now. Thanks! [[User:Rosbacw|Rosbacw]] ([[User talk:Rosbacw|talk]]) 02:36, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

[[User:Krakauc|Krakauc]] ([[User talk:Krakauc|talk]]) 07:02, 2 March 2009 (UTC)Also under the Functions of Religion section, I added the fact that social cohesion from religion can also lead to social control, as has been seen throughout world history. Chloe Krakauer

On magic section. I really liked both the magic sections I thought there was a lot of interesting information that I was unaware of and the ethnographic info was really interesting good job [[User:Tornquist367|Veronica Tornquist]] 

                + 1.1.2 Variety of Religious Beliefs
                      # 1.1.2.1 Animatism
All I did was change the formatting so that it was lined up with the page breaks. [[User:Aitchison0553|Aitchison0553]] ([[User talk:Aitchison0553|talk]]) 05:40, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added an image for the ethnographic example used [[User:Aitchison0553|Aitchison0553]] ([[User talk:Aitchison0553|talk]]) 15:08, 9 March 2009 (UTC)
                      Euhemerism
I just did some basic grammar changes to make reading smoother. --[[User:Scharnhorst6569|Scharnhorst6569]] ([[User talk:Scharnhorst6569|talk]]) 00:12, 4 March 2009 (UTC)
                      # 1.1.2.2 Animism
I changed the syntax and did a couple of other minor edits regarding spacing because I couldn't figure it out the first time [[User:Aitchison0553|Aitchison0553]] ([[User talk:Aitchison0553|talk]]) 23:47, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

The only major thing that I changed, was adding another paragraph about the difference between classic and new animism, other than that all I have been doing is adding internal links, citations, and a photo. [[User:Aitchison0553|Aitchison0553]] ([[User talk:Aitchison0553|talk]]) 05:19, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added links to the Animism article [[User:Kimble3865|Kimble3865]] ([[User talk:Kimble3865|talk]]) 21:28, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for adding those internal links Kimble3865

=== 1.1.2.3 Anthropomorphic===
I just changed the wording around in the beginning of this section to make it a little more clear. --[[User:FBetancourt|FBetancourt]] ([[User talk:FBetancourt|talk]]) 06:58, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I added behavior to the first sentenced because it isn't just characteristic traits, but emotional behavioral traits as well. I added some content to the bottom, mainly due because it is a major anthropomorphic example that wasn't there. [[User:Hennessy01|Hennessy7730]] 

I changed the wording to clarify the last part and capitalization of The Three Bears. Holmesa2

I added a picture of an anthropomorphic figure from Mycenae in Greece to help define anthropomorphism. [[User:Nataliza|Nataliza]] ([[User talk:Nataliza|talk]]) 11:20, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I reformatted the &quot;Anthropomorphic&quot; heading so it wasn't part of the previous section on Dualism, but rather its own new section. [[User:Nataliza|Nataliza]] ([[User talk:Nataliza|talk]]) 11:25, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

=== 1.1.2.4 Zoomorphic===
I thought it might be interesting to add some examples of exactly how widespread of a phenomenon this is (zoomorphism). [[User:Sechrist7888|Sechrist7888]] ([[User talk:Sechrist7888|talk]]) 21:54, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

The information about images of male deities with antlers and the countries that it comes from is good information, but what religion or religions does male deities with antlers come from? In response to your addition i also added that zoomorphic supernaturals can be found in Hinduism.--[[User:Barry8615|Barry8615]] ([[User talk:Barry8615|talk]]) 06:18, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

The deities with antlers have been found in prehistoric art in those countries, and I edited the section to include this--I think it's interesting that zoomorphism goes back so far in human history (feel free to add that to the section, too, if you want). [[User:Sechrist7888|Sechrist7888]] ([[User talk:Sechrist7888|talk]]) 00:11, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

I thought it might be better to have Zoomorphic up with Animatism and Anthromorphic beings, and then have all of those concepts of supernatural beings in their own category. I think the organization might make it easier to read. --[[User:Cavea|Cavea]] ([[User talk:Cavea|talk]]) 22:59, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I fixed the Totemism link because it was not in bold blue print

                     #1.1.2.5 Magic
the last sentence in the contagious magic section was really confusing so i switched some words and commas around to make it flow better ([[user:Alicia Troske|Alicia Troske]])

I just cleaned up a few of the sentences in the Imitative Magic section (some parts were a little wordy, so I made them a little more defined and straightfoward. (Scar8719)

I edited out the user name in the contagious section to make it appear more professional.--[[User:GoW00849457|GoW00849457]]

I included a basic definition of magic just to back up the description of how it's used.--[[User:FBetancourt|FBetancourt]] ([[User talk:FBetancourt|talk]]) 06:30, 5 March 2009 (UTC)
I added a picture of a voodoo doll with pins in it to help illustrate the example of imitative magic.--[[User:Barry8615|Barry8615]] ([[User talk:Barry8615|talk]]) 06:37, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

[[User:Krakauc|Krakauc]] ([[User talk:Krakauc|talk]]) 07:02, 2 March 2009 (UTC)I further specified the type of object that can be used in imitative magic to differentiate it from contagious magic, which involves the use of objects physically related to the person or object affected by the magic. Chloe Krakauer 

I edited the explanation on the voodoo doll idea by adding a little more explanation of what the infliction of a voodoo doll does to the actual person the spell is being caste on. [[User:Trujilb|Bria Trujillo]] ([[User talk:Trujilb|talk Bria Trujillo]]) 01:06, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the contagious magic section a tad to reword the explanation in general. ([[User talk: peterson9949|talk]]) 14:51, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the contagious magic section a little bit but it needs some more work, I didn't want to completely change it, but i added that contagious magic is when a part of the person they are trying to influence is used to cast the spell. Knight9366 ([[User talk: knight9366|talk]]) 14:51, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

[[User:Krakauc|Krakauc]] ([[User talk:Krakauc|talk]]) 07:02, 2 March 2009 (UTC)I changed the order of the first sentence slightly so that the &quot;toe nail&quot; became an example of the type of object used rather than the magic itself, even though the sentence could probably be phrased better. Chloe Krakauer

I edited the main bit about magic mostly just from the grammar standpoint but I also threw in a bit about how religion and science evolved from the inability of magic to explain the natural world and a couple other things I thought could add to it.
nelso79([[User talk: nelso79|talk]]) 16:43, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the contagious magic by adding some examples of contagious magic. There were not any examples just the statement that was used in class so I added examples of how teeth are used in contagious magic in Australia and how the afterbirth is used as a means of contagious magic all around the earth. [[User:Felker7736|Felker7736]]

Wanted to make the actual definition of imitative magic a little more clear then it was. Still used the general concept, of course. --[[User:Scharnhorst6569|Scharnhorst6569]] ([[User talk:Scharnhorst6569|talk]]) 00:53, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

I reorganized this page, I just moved the magic section up to the origin of religion, because they mention the failure of magic, and I thought that would be a better transition.--[[User:Cavea|Cavea]] ([[User talk:Cavea|talk]]) 23:08, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the magic and religion sections in general for grammatical and spelling errors like capitalization, use of commas and &quot;woman&quot; instead of &quot;women.&quot; [[User:Lianalewis|Lianalewis]] ([[User talk:Lianalewis|talk]]) [[User:Lianalewis|Lianalewis]] ([[User talk:Lianalewis|talk]]) 06:31, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

                + 1.1.3 How Beliefs Are Expressed
                      # 1.1.3.1 Myth
i put spaces between &quot;sacred spaces&quot; and the rest of the words so that it stood out as a title ([[User:Alicia Troske|Alicia Troske]])

Just some minor sentence structure changes. nelso79(3455)

I changed some parts of the sacred space entry. Some of it didn't make any sense [[User:Beesonm|Beesonm]] ([[User talk:Beesonm|talk]]) 04:51, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I thought that all the quotes around some of the words were unnecessary, so I removed them. [[User:Loves|Loves]] ([[User talk:Loves|talk]]) 22:50, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

Someone please actually contribute to the animitism!!!!

I edited the sacred space and added the information about the vatican and added a break to the information. [[User:Miramiller|Miramiller]] ([[User talk:Miramiller|talk]]) 05:11, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

                      # 1.1.3.2 Doctrine
I did some minor changes to grammar and phrasing like changing &quot;are&quot; to &quot;is&quot; --[[User:Mallahp|Mallahp]] ([[User talk:Mallahp|talk]]) 05:05, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed the Doctrine section from listing Catholicism, Christianity, and First Baptist to Catholicism, Islam, and First Baptist. I also added a paragraph on Islamic doctrine to complement that. The reason for this is that Catholicism and First Baptist fall under the realm of Christianity, and I didn't want the same thing listed twice. Plus, there are other religions outside of Christianity that are held together by doctrines, so there should be more representatives. Requirement 2b. [[User:Wittrock4570|Wittrock4570]] ([[User talk:Wittrock4570|talk]]) 02:20, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the same section later on, changing the word phrasing slightly and adding a link for the Five Pillars of Islam. [[User:Wittrock4570|Wittrock4570]] ([[User talk:Wittrock4570|talk]]) 05:53, 10 March 2009 (UTC)


==Syncretism==

I moved the image of the virgin guadelupe to the top of the syncretism section to take away the space in the middle of the section. [[Carr7805]]

I modified the first sentence on exclusivism, it was hard to understand so I changed some wording around and added a few clearer words. [[User:Hennessy01|John Hennessy]] ([[User talk:Hennessy01|talk]])

For requirement 2c I added the picture of The Black Madonna of Częstochowa and linked all the key terms in the part i wrote to wikipedia articles. [[User:Petit00865229|Petit00865229]] ([[User talk:Petit00865229|talk]]) 03:13, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

Under sacred spaces for this section, I changed the second person terms to third person and fixed some words spelled wrong.[[User:Loves|Loves]] ([[User talk:Loves|talk]]) 22:48, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a photo of the Wailing Wall to the sacred spaces section --[[User:Gill4569|Gill4569]] ([[User talk:Gill4569|talk]]) 01:40, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

                + 1.1.4 Religious Specialists

[[User:Krakauc|Krakauc]] ([[User talk:Krakauc|talk]]) 07:02, 2 March 2009 (UTC)I added the fact that shamans are part-time religious practitioners, as opposed to priests who are full-time religious practitioners. Chloe Krakauer

I moved the image of the shaman up to the top of the section for better clarity. [[Carr7805]]

I thought it might be interesting to add this sentence to help show how much power these people (shamans) are reported to have among their people. [[User:Sechrist7888|Sechrist7888]] ([[User talk:Sechrist7888|talk]]) 22:15, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

I also added a sentence to your ethnographic example (North American shamanism)
explaining that it still occurs today, but is declining--I thought that might just be an interesting fact to add (that it still exists here).  [[User:Sechrist7888|Sechrist7888]] ([[User talk:Sechrist7888|talk]]) 22:33, 28 February 2009 (UTC)                               1.1.4.1 Shaman [[User:Brown1147|Brown1147]] ([[User talk:Brown1147|talk]]) 19:05, 7 February 2009 (UTC)

I really enjoyed your contributions to the page. I think you did a good job of integrating your work with mine. I particularly liked the last sentence, because I had a hard time of figuring out how to transition shamanism from prehistoric times into the present but, you did it quite succinctly. Do you think I should add another sentence or two about how shamans are perceived by their people? I think it would be interesting to mention that they are often feared or mistrusted because of their supernatural capabilities. [[User:Telena Anderson|Telena Anderson]] ([[User talk:Telena Anderson|talk]]) 12:33, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks--yes, I think it would be a really good idea to add more information about how shamans are perceived by their people, especially because they are feared or mistrusted by some.  I think that's important (and interesting) information.  [[User:Sechrist7888|Sechrist7888]] ([[User talk:Sechrist7888|talk]]) 00:18, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

I added that Confirmation usually takes place after Eucharist and baptism.

I separated this into paragraphs to make it easier to read and comprehend. [[User:Mccalla|Amanda McCalley]]I changed some of the content from Jesus &quot;symbolizing&quot; something, to Jesus &quot;doing&quot; something and edited some of the details about what Christians believe about Jesus dying on the cross and rising again; in addition to what this all means to Christians. [[User:Mccalla|Amanda McCalley]]I think it would be good to recognize that there are different subsections/denominations under each religion. I added a few sentences about this under Christianity. --[[User:Whitlev|Veronica Whitley]] ([[User talk:Whitlev|talk]]) 22:36, 22 February 2009 (UTC)I added two subcategories (Catholic and Protestant) under Christianity to address the issue of denominations. I thought instead of listing all of the denomination of Christianity, adding Catholic and Protestant as subcategories would be best, since most denominations fit under either one. [[User:Rosbacw|Rosbacw]] ([[User talk:Rosbacw|talk]]) 21:12, 1 March 2009 (UTC)I also made a small structural change.

I felt like there needed to be an &quot;introduction&quot; of sorts to this article. It seemed like the history of Christianity was being implied so I added a short introduction to the beginning to add meaning to the rest of the article. I tried to not cut too much out but I feel like an introduction makes the article much stronger. [[User:Rosbacw|Rosbacw]] ([[User talk:Rosbacw|talk]]) 02:14, 2 March 2009 (UTC)I added a sentence to the person testimony section on salvation. [[User:Miramiller|Miramiller]] ([[User talk:Miramiller|talk]]) 05:48, 9 March 2009 (UTC)I agree with you there needed to be an introduction to this section. I could not come up with one when I first wrote it and was trying to play it safe by starting the section off with &quot;cold&quot; historical facts about Christianity, and not start with some of the beliefs and ramifications of the religion. The intro starts it off better.  [[User:Felker7736|Felker7736]] 15:10, 3, March 2009I made a small change under the Protestant section. I thought I was important to note that the Protestant denominations of today resulted from a split of the Catholic church, known as the Protestant Reformation. And I added that the Protestant Reformation was sparked by Martin Luther and the publication of his Ninety-Five Theses. I also added a few links to other Wikipedia articles for easy reference. [[User:Rosbacw|Rosbacw]] ([[User talk:Rosbacw|talk]]) 23:54, 3 March 2009 (UTC)I made a few changes to your grammar and spelling in the paragraph about you being baptized.

[[User:thisisme98|thisisme98]] ([[User talk:thisisme98|talk]])I added a section about the Christmas celebration.  I hope that people will add more detail to it.  I also added  a section for Santa Claus, thinking that it would be fun for someone to write about.  I changed the title of Catholic to Catholicism, and likewise for the Protestant  to Protestantism.  [[User:Ely4205|Ely4205]] ([[User talk:Ely4205|talk]])Although Christmas has turned into a materialistic holiday I added a bit explaining how it is common for people to attend Christmas mass.

[[User:Arielle Amoranto|Arielle Amoranto]] ([[User talk:Arielle Amoranto|talk]]) 04:27, 6 March 2009 (UTC)I changed the transition sentence from Christianity part into Christmas (Intro of Christmas), so that the transition flowed better. [[User:Mccalla|Amanda McCalley]] I also changed a sentence in the middle which re-stated what had previously been said and combined two shorter sentences to flow better as one sentence. [[User:Mccalla|Amanda McCalley]]Protestantism lots of things were changed on my intial article and I agree with most but I added in a few citations from where I got the information and a few grammatical things.

I don't know about anyone else, but I thought the assignment was supposed to be third person, and the personal testimony just seems unnecessary, and I really feel like deleting it in its entirety. To say that all humans sin from a personal rational isn't academic, and really should be debarred from the wiki entry. I'm afraid to be rude and just delete someones complete posting though, and I don't know where to post a talk on a vote for its removal. [[User:Hennessy01|Hennessy7730]]

I edited the Christianity section in the paragraph about Constantine because it led people to believe that the persecutions of Christians stopped after Constantine made it a legal religion, which is not true at all. Christians have been persecuted all through out history, even after Constantine. [[User:peter232|peter232]]

So I'm in agreement with the person above as far as the personal testimony under Christianity.  If we're going to do personal witnesses, which really have no place in textbooks as far as I'm concerned, there should be witnesses under the other religions as well. [[User:Stacycbreland|Stacycbreland]]

Under Non-Denominational, I revised the prior content to be more specific about the ways of Non-Denominational Christians because I feel that not many people take this sect seriously due to a lack of explanatory information about the actual beliefs of this group. This group of people may not associate with any one church, but they still hold firm beliefs based on what they individually hold to be true and this needs to be realized by other religious sects.[[User:Gordonlesley|Gordonlesley]] ([[User talk:Gordonlesley|talk]]) 08:00, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


I added a paragraph under Doctrines about Christianity. There was an example of Christianity in Fiji and I contrasted this with some Westernized beliefs of this religion. I felt this added some more content and showed how doctrines can be interpreted differently. [[User:adamsk9]]

Overall I like the changes you guys made to the Islam section. You did a nice job of separating relevant topics and adding more information. The section itself looks cleaner and more professional then it did before. Also I appreciate the parts you guys expanded on.

I improved the flow of this section a little bit. Sometimes I used words that became redundant so I removed some of those. --[[User:GoW00849457|GoW00849457]]

I think that &quot;Islam&quot; should be changed to Muslim, Because Muslim is the religion and Islam is more of the community and culture that accompanies it. [[User:Luna6045|Luna6045]] ([[User talk:Luna6045|talk]]) 06:43, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

I disagree. &quot;Islam&quot; classifies the religion itself, while the term &quot;Muslim&quot; describes an adherent to the Islamic faith and means &quot;one who submits (to God)&quot;. So I think it would be inappropriate to change the heading for Islam to Muslim, however, I do agree that other subheadings under &quot;Islam&quot; could be created.

I added that once a person has made the pigrimage to Mecca that the person would achieve the status of Hajji. This was mentioned in lecture and thought it would be useful to the reader.

I added two subcategories to Islam. I figured since we were reading the book on the Iraq War (''Waiting On An Ordinary Day'' by Farnaz Fassihi)it would be appropriate to add the two denominations of Islam, Sunni and Shi'a, as subcategories for Islam. This will help those who have trouble differentiating the two. Also, it will show the two denominations' similarities and differences.[[User:Rosbacw|Rosbacw]] ([[User talk:Rosbacw|talk]]) 02:24, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

In the beginning sentence, I changed the word &quot;originating&quot; to &quot;revitalized&quot; because I think that Islam was around before Muhammad's time. He just revitalized the religion. [[User:Mcnabba|Mcnabba]] ([[User talk:Mcnabba|talk]]) 04:42, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

Islam actually did originate from the teachings of Muhammad. There was no Islam before Muhammad[[User:Beesonm|Beesonm]] ([[User talk:Beesonm|talk]]) 08:30, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I agree with the edit of 'originating' to 'revitalized,' as Muslims traditionally view Islam as the restoration of the teachings which the other Abrahamic religions received, and then corrupted over time. In my edits I defined 'Muslims', reorganized some of the information to aid the flow, deleted a couple of lines to eliminate redundancy, defined 'Sharia', added a short section on taqlid, and made some of the information about the pillars more thorough.

I went through this paragraph and edited a few things. I took out a comma and added a word to make the sentence flow better. I also reworded the second sentence because it didnt make sense to me. [[Dachenhausen4129]]

I added a line to help make it clear of how important the separation of church and state is. [[User:Hennessy01|Hennessy7730]]

I added a few sentences about how some Atheists believe there is no God, and how some don't believe in any deity's teachings. I thought this was an important detail in understanding the religion...or lack there of.
[[User:Kerzman0375|Kerzman0375]]]

- This section is absolutely false, and the information of what atheism consists of is WRONG!

I made this section, because I thought it was important to have this form of religion part of the wiki as well.

=== Brass ===
==== Method 1 ====
''(Moved from &quot;Gold&quot;)''

Since this is &quot;every material known to man&quot; and this material looks a lot like highly polished brass, it might be wise to move this set up to a page titled &quot;Polished Brass&quot;.  Might also be nice to point out which knobs to push or buttons to turn to make it less polished looking (ordinarily  brass reflects, but is not a mirror).  I suspect it doesn't look like gold because the highlights are too white.  Try turning the specularity into a nice deep reddish glowy kind of highlight and see if it doesn't look more like gold.

== Asphalt ==
==='''Method 1'''===
This is a general asphalt texture. It can be used in any sort of situation, and able to be easily applied and altered for most situations.

[[File:EXAsphault.jpg|240px]]

&lt;u&gt;'''Color'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Col:  (Adjust as needed)&lt;br&gt;
**R-&lt;u&gt;0.25&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**G-&lt;u&gt;0.25&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**B-&lt;u&gt;0.25&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

**B-&lt;u&gt;0.8&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Shaders'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Diffuse Shader:(Lambert)&lt;br&gt;
**Ref-&lt;u&gt;0.6&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*Specular Shader:(CookTorr)&lt;br&gt;
**Spec-&lt;u&gt;0.22&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Hard-&lt;u&gt;5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''Texture (F6)'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Tex:  (Musgrave)&lt;br&gt;
**Input:&lt;u&gt;Multifractal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**H-&lt;u&gt;0.8&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Lacu-&lt;u&gt;1.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Octs-&lt;u&gt;2.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**iScale-&lt;u&gt;0.4&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**NoiseSize-(Adjust as needed)&lt;u&gt;0.03&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**NoiseBasis-&lt;u&gt;Voronoi F4&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''Map Input'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*TE: MusgraveTex&lt;br&gt;
**Coord-&lt;u&gt;Orco&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Map-&lt;u&gt;Cube&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**SizeX-&lt;u&gt;1.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**SizeY-&lt;u&gt;1.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**SizeZ-&lt;u&gt;1.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''(Note: Adjust SizeX/Y/Z as necessary, try to keep 1:1:1 Ratio)''
*Map To:&lt;br&gt;
**Output-&lt;u&gt;Nor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Nor-&lt;u&gt;2.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''(Adjust Nor based on mesh size, as necessary)''

For this texture, try adding an '''&lt;u&gt;Image&lt;/u&gt;''' Texture and add an image of actual asphalt. For a large scene, take multiple asphalt images and tile them randomly and overlapping in photoshop, then putting them down on your mesh. Also works well with Nodes. Hope this helped!

*Author Note: This material is more of a very freshly paved asphalt, and as most people known, almost all asphalt is heavily used. You can dull out the material by turning up the color to a slightly lighter grey, and turning down the specularity to take out some of the shine.

-The example is very delusive
The pattern is only removed from the center of the image,as in a unfinished work
If the technique is valid  then or the application on that image was not correct, or the image was not adapt to the technique used

{{prerequisite|Neuroscience}}

Though [[Neuroscience]] is listed as a prerequisite, it ''will not'' prepare you adequately for this text until it is finished (and perhaps not even then).

This covers some introductory aspects of the mechanisms of human hearing, sound localization, speech perception and speech production. The reader should have a partial undergraduate education (2nd or 3rd year) in either neuroscience (or psychology, provided the focus is on human biological psychology). This book explains only jargon which is unlikely to have been encountered previously - a working vocabulary of neuroscience terms is expected and required for understanding.

It explores many of the processes which occur between the occurrence of a sound in the world and the perception of that sound. In particular, there is a focus on speech as a distinct type of sound which occurs often in the environment of humans.

The processes involved operate on several levels:
*Mechanical (transmission of sound from its source to the outer and middle ears)
*Biophysical (transduction in the cochlea)
*Neurophysiological (representation of the sound in the nervous system and sound localization)
*Perceptive (detecting the sound and discrimination)
*Cognitive (identifying the sound)

The text is laid out such that an interested reader can follow it from start to end to learn the subject matter covered - it is not a reference text.

==Table of contents==
*[[/Sound/]]
**The nature and properties of sound
**Key terms: frequency, amplitude, phase, period, wavelength, diffraction, interference, standing waves, filtering, brick-wall, cutoff slope, impedance
**Fourier analysis, fundamental frequency, harmonics
**Measuring sound: dB scales, short-term/long-term spectra &amp; rise time

*[[/Outer &amp; middle ear/]]
**Structure and &quot;funneling&quot; function of the pinna
**Anatomy of the middle ear
**The impedance mismatch problem
**Conductive hearing loss

*[[/Inner ear/]]
**Gross anatomy of the cochlea
**Basilar membrane mechanics
**Passive and active components
**Fine structure of the Organ of Corti
**Transduction: hair cell receptor potentials
**Innervation patterns of the two types of hair cells
**Genesis of auditory nerve fiber tuning and the roles of the two hair cell populations
**Cochlear hearing loss

*[[/Auditory nerve/]]
**Two types of auditory nerve fibers
**Phase-locking
**Spatial &amp; temporal neural coding
**Rationale for Cochlear Implant programs

*[[/Central auditory nervous system/]]
**Structural and functional organization
**Brainstem-evoked potentials in audiological &amp; neurological diagnosis

*[[/Sound localization/]]
**Nature of binaural sound localization cues: effects of sound frequency and azimuth
**Neural coding of binaural sound localization cues, interaural phase and intensity differences
**Behavior-lesion studies of sound localization

*[[/Speech/]]
**Distinguishing ''speech'' and ''language''
**Nature of speech sounds

*[[/Speech production/]]
**Generation of speech sounds: the source-filter theory
**The problem of invariance in speech perception
***Solution: Liberman's motor theory
***Testing the motor theory: Linguistic feature detectors
***Testing linguistic feature detectors: Problem of invariance again

*[[/Speech perception/]]
**The acoustic account of speech recognition
**The auditory cortex and &quot;pure word deafness&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first thing to know about scales is that they are extremely important to memorize. This may seem daunting, but will help playing, intonation, embouchure, and technical skill immensely.

when learning scales with sharps, some basic knowledge is required.
1. The order of sharps, which is F C G D A E B. This is the order of sharps in the key signature, so basically it shows that (in most cases) you may not have a key signature containing any sharp unless it has the previous sharp in it as well
2. Knowledge of EVERY fingering full range on the saxophone
3. # means Sharp

The first scale is C major, it contains no sharps or flats, and the notes are C D E F G A B C, and its arpeggio is C E G C G E C.

The second scale is G Major, with one sharp and its notes are G A B C D E F# G, whose arpeggio is G B D G D B G

The third scale is D major, with two sharps, F# and C#, and notes are D E F# G A B C# D, arpeggio is D F# A D A F# D

The third scale is A major with three sharps, F#, C#, and G#, whose notes are A B C# D E F# G# A

      <comment>/* The nature of sound */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The nature of sound==
Sound is the sensing of a vibration as it propagates trough a medium. Without a medium, there can be no sound. The speed of propagation depends on the elasticity and density of the medium, the medium itself is not required to move, it the terms that it is only required to support the propagation of the vibration.

{{NOTE|Sound as a wave has a kinetic effect on the medium, that can lead to deformations and to clues that a sound wave was present in the past, without the direct sensing of the original event. This characteristic is also what enables the transmitting and recording of sound in other forms, even to more complex phenomena, as for instance [[w:Sonoluminescence|Sonoluminescence]]. }}

Sound depends not only on the point of the initiation of vibration (origin), since the medium may absorb or alter the propagation of the vibratory waves it is dependent also on the location of where the sensing is done and the sensor capabilities of processing those sound waves, as waves may have different frequencies.

[[File:Sine waves different frequencies.png|thumb|250px|Sinusoidal waves of various frequencies; the bottom waves have higher frequencies than those above. The horizontal axis represents time. Pure tones have waveforms of this kind.[[File:16bit sine.ogg|thumb|A pure tone.]]]]
Pure tones have sinusoidal waves, as shown at left.

{{-}}

==Inverse-square law==
[[Image:Inverse square law.svg|thumb|500px|The lines represent the sound energy coming from the source. The total number of lines depends on the strength of the source and is constant with increasing distance. A greater density of lines means more energy. The density of lines is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source because the surface area of a sphere increases with the square of the radius. Thus the strength of the field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.]] 

The inverse-square law states that the amount of sound energy decreases [[w:Inverse (mathematics)|inverse]]ly [[w:proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[w:square (algebra)|square]] of the [[w:distance|distance]] from the source of the sound. Thus, the law describes how sound intensity decreases with distance from the sound's source via a simple equation.

*r is the radius = distance from the source to the location of measurement
&lt;math&gt;A=4\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

So, amplitude drops by a factor of 9 when the radius triples.
{{-}}

==Impedence mismatch problem==
[[File:Partial transmittance.gif|thumb|When the impedence of two mediums is mismatched, only some of the energy is transmitted, in accordance with the equation at left.]]
&lt;math&gt;%\text{amplitude transmission} = 4\frac{Z_1 \cdot Z_2}{[Z_1 + Z_2]^2}&lt;/math&gt;

If you play around with the equation, you'll find that the more ''different'' the values for &lt;math&gt;Z_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; are, the less transmission of amplitude there is from medium 1 to medium 2. The energy which doesn't get transmitted into the next medium is reflected of the interface.

''Amplitude'' gets scaled down according to the above equation - all other properties remain unaffected.
{{-}}

==Diffraction==
There are four cases:
[[File:Huygens.gif|thumb|'''Case 1''': An opening smaller than the wavelength.]]
#Small opening
#*The opening is smaller than the wavelength.
#*A new source &quot;recycles&quot; the energy at the opening &amp; it radiates out spherically.
#Large opening
#*The opening is larger than the wavelength.
#*Waves continue along straight through the opening - no radiation.
#Small obstacle
#*The obstacle is smaller than the wavelength.
#*The wave propagates around the obstacle.
#Large obstacle
#*A &quot;shadow&quot; of the obstruction exists on the other side.
{{-}}
==Interference==
[[File:Stehende welle 3.gif|thumb|As the phase of the individual waveforms is changed, the combined waveform changes. This alternately shows constructive and destructive interference.]]
When waveforms interact, they add up linearly.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Constructive Interference.PNG|Constructive interference: the amplitude of the combined waveform is larger than either of the initial waveforms.
File:Destructive Interference.PNG|Destructive interference: the amplitude of the combined waveform is smaller (here, zero) than either of the initial waveforms.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
{{-}}

==Standing waves==
*The lowest frequency at which a standing wave will exist is the ''fundamental frequency'', &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt;, and has a wavelength of twice the length.
**Other standing waves have multiples of &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt;'s wavelength.

*For a tube with one end closed, only the ''odd'' multiples of &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; support a standing wave, and &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;4L&lt;/math&gt;.
**This is a model for the ear canal.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Measuring amplitude==
Amplitude corresponds to loudness - it's a measurement of how much energy the waveform contains.

Measurement is easy for pure tones, but for complex sounds, you must take repeated measures and average it out using a method we won't cover. It's not very useful to measure loudness in terms of pressure directly since we deal with such a large range of values (millions of orders of magnitude). Instead, we use the decibel scale:
&lt;math&gt;dB = 20 \cdot log_{10}\frac{P_A}{P_R}&lt;/math&gt;

Having multiple standards is perverse, but we do it anyways:
*As a standard, &lt;math&gt;P_R&lt;/math&gt; is often &lt;math&gt;20 \mu Pa&lt;/math&gt; - this is called &quot;sound pressure level&quot; (30dB SPL). This is most useful for physical measurements.
*As another standard, audiologists often set &lt;math&gt;P_R&lt;/math&gt; as the normal human hearing threshold for that sound - this is called hearing level (30dB HL). This is most useful for audiologists, because it indicates whether you can hear normally.
*As yet another standard, researchers often set &lt;math&gt;P_R&lt;/math&gt; as the listener's own threshold for that sound - this is called sensitivity level (30dB SL). This is useful for example if you wanted to compare the ability to discriminate between 2 sounds for a normally-hearing person to a hard-of-hearing person.

Greetings, all who are at all interested in this user page!

Aside from that, I don't have much to say.  I joined the WikiBooks community with the hopes that I could help with the [[Java Programming]] book, but as of yet I have failed to add anything.

'tis sad.

Not to imply that I think that the reader is dirt.  Honestly, I don't know where that came from; it is meant to be dirt as to a dirtbox like sand in a sandbox.  Obviously, dirt is nowhere near quite as workable as sand (most of the time), which is why after the changing of the name, the Main Region (the first header) was renamed 'Sand'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Chinchilla-ear.JPG|thumb|The pinna is a directional sound collector. In some species it also serves secondary functions, such as dissipating heat.]]
[[File:Gray1207.png|thumb]]
The '''pinna'''  is the visible part of the ear that resides outside of the head.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the pinna is to collect sound. It does so by acting as a funnel, amplifying the sound and directing it to the ear canal. In mammals like cats and dogs, it is obviously highly directional, but even in humans, the pinna functions as a directional sound collector. The &quot;sweet spot&quot; for which the pinna best collects sound is called the acoustic axis or the acoustic fovea. In various species, the pinna can also signal mood and radiate heat.

The frequency at which the pinna becomes a directional sound collector can be calculated since it does so at frequencies such that the pinna is larger than the wavelength:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda \approx 0.25 m&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{c}{f}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{c}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{343 m/s}{0.025 \cdot 4 m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f = 3430 Hz&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Modelling the auditory canal */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The ear canal (aka external auditory canal) is lined with epithelial cells. Particularly in the outer &lt;math&gt;1/3&lt;/math&gt;, these cells secrete wax ([[w:cerumen|cerumen]]).
==Cerumen &amp; cilia==
[[File:Chinchilla-ear.JPG|thumb]]
The cells lining the auditory canal have cilia (specialized hair) pointed out towards the pinna, which are extremely sensitive to tactile stimulation. Human ears have quite short hairs, but they serve the same purpose as those in the chinchilla pictured to the right. Try teasing a cat's hairs while they're sleeping and you're liable to lose a precious body part - the hairs are very sensitive, and for good reason: they guard against foreign bodies entering the ear.

{{-}}&lt;div style=&quot;display:block; float:right; padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Earwax on swab.jpg|100px]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Earwax on swab (uv).jpg|100px]]
&lt;/div&gt;
Cerumen has some antibiotic and antifungal properties. The cells which form the lining of the canal begin their life at the centre of the eardrum (the [[../tympanic membrane|umbo]]), and migrate out towards the [[../pinna/]] at about the same rate as the growth of your fingernails.

{{-}}
==Modelling the auditory canal==
The auditory canal is a tube with one end closed, so it is best suited to carrying some frequencies better than others:

&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{343m/s}{0.024 \cdot 4} = 3430Hz
&lt;/math&gt; (plus harmonics, which are [[w:Natural number|natural]] multiples of this frequency)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The eardrum (also tympanic membrane or tympanum), is a thin membrane that separates the external ear from the middle ear. Its function is to transmit sound from the air to the ossicles inside the middle ear. The malleus bone bridges the gap between the eardrum and the other ossicles, and is attached along its long arm on the inner surface.

==Structure==
[[File:Gray909-labels.png|thumb|350px|
A: [[w:pars tensa|pars tensa]]
B: annulus fibrosa
C: [[w:Umbo of tympanic membrane|umbo]]
D: Handle of the [[w:malleus|malleus]]
E: Long arm of the [[w:malleus|malleus]]
F: [[w:pars flaccida|pars flaccida]]
G: Long process of the [[w:incus|incus]]
]]
The typanic membrane is formed of a double-layer of epithelial cells across it's entire surface. In addition, about 1/3 has another 2 layers of tougher, fibrous epithelial tissue (between the previously-mentioned two layers of cells), to which the long arm of the malleus is attached.

The section with only two layers of cells is ''pars flaccida'', and is flaccid, weak, transparent, and damage to it causes no issues for hearing since it is not involved with transduction. When surgeons perform middle ear surgery, going through pars flaccida is the standard entrance.

The thicker section is ''pars tensa'', and this is the section which transduces the vibrations. Damage to this section of the membrane results in altered hearing.

The umbo (C) is the point of deepest recession of the membrane and is the location of genesis of new epithelial cells, which migrate out towards the pinna as new cells are formed behind them. This migration occurs at about the same rate as the growth of fingernails. In addition, the malleus is attached along the length of its long arm to the inner surface, beginning at the umbo (so, the handle of the malleus is attached at the umbo).

The whole tympanic membrane is about &lt;math&gt;9mm&lt;/math&gt; across, with a surface area of &lt;math&gt;~81mm^2&lt;/math&gt; (not circular).

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Gray912.png|Here, ''pars tensa'' is labelled as &quot;tense portion of membrana tympani&quot; and ''pars flaccida'' labelled as &quot;flaccid portion of membrana tympani&quot;

==Hi==

It's nice to see someone doing something with the Old English book. I think I'll chip in a bit if I can find my textbooks.

Wæs þu hæl! [[User:Actualist|Actualist]] ([[User talk:Actualist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Actualist|contribs]]) 16:14, 3 May 2013 (UTC)
:Éalá, ƿes hál. I also do work on the OE Wikipedia. It'd be good to have a decent book on OE here. [[User:Gott wisst|Gott wisst]] ([[User talk:Gott wisst|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gott wisst|contribs]]) 07:21, 4 May 2013 (UTC)

==Declensions?==

Why did you put accusative last in the tables for adjectives? Is this a German thing? In books written in English accusative always comes after nominative and before genitive.
:I didn't - I was following the precedent of whoever did (care to dig the history?), because I was just copying tables and changing the entries to save time. However, I agree that it is best to have the accusative after the nominative. Since you've pointed it out, I will be happy to change it (or it would be easy enough for you to do so, also - and that would lighten my workload). Wes hāl.

==Progress==

I've added stuff on strong verbs.

I think the verbs page needs to be broken into pieces. First an article explaining what the various parts of the verb actually do, then one on weak verbs, then weak irregulars, then strong verbs, then really irregular verbs, then preterite present verbs, rather than putting it all in one great slab of text.

[[User:Actualist|Actualist]] ([[User talk:Actualist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Actualist|contribs]]) 06:35, 17 May 2013 (UTC)
:Definitely the verbs page should be broken up... But I think that within, for example, the weak verbs, the present tense, past tense, past participle, etc., should either all be on one table anyway, or there should be a &quot;summary&quot; table where all the different forms of a verb are on one table. What do you think of that?

:BTW, despite lack of contribution by me recently, I have not given up on the project - I've been juggling several projects, including Wikipedia, and working on translatewiki.net, and also converting the source code of Bosworth and Toller as downloadable from the Germanic Lexican project, into a respectable odt document (and then a respectable HTML document, so I can put it on Wikisource, maybe).

      <text xml:space="preserve">We shall now discuss some basic theorems related to rings. We feel that a good way to learn ring theory is to try out proofs of simple theorems on ones own. Hence the reader is encouraged to work out proofs of theorems by him/herserlf before reading the proofs given here. Often we shall provide only a sketch of the proof and the reader is expected to fill in the gaps in that case.

==Basic properties==

'''Theorem 1.1''': If R is a ring and &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in R&lt;/math&gt;; then

1. a+b=a+c implies b=c. ('''Cancellation Law''')

2. -(-a)=a.

3. The zero element of R is unique.

4. The additive inverse of any element is unique.

'''Proof''':

1. Clearly adding -a on both sides of a+b=a+c gives us the desired result.

2. It suffices to show that a+(-a)=0 which is obvious from the definition of -a.

3. If there exists two zero elements 0 and 0' in R then 0+0'=0' and 0+0'=0 by definiton and so 0=0'.

4. If &lt;nowiki&gt;a' and a'' are two inverses of a then a'=a'+0=a'+a+a''=0+a''=a''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.2''': If R is a ring, then for any &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in R&lt;/math&gt;;

1. a0=0a=0.

2. a(-b)=(-a)b=-(ab).

3. (-a)(-b)=ab.

4. a(b-c)=ab-ac.

If in addition, R has a unit element 1, then

5. (-1)a=-a.

6. (-1)(-1)=1.

'''Proof''':

1. a0+0=a0=a(0+0)=a0+a0. By the cancellation law it now follows that a0=0. Similarly 0a=0.

2. It suffices to show that a(-b)=-(ab) or equivalently a(-b)+ab=0. Now a(-b)+ab=a(b-b)=a0=0 by 1. and so the result is proved.

3. (-a)(-b)=-(a(-b)) by 2. Again -(a(-b))=-(-(ab))=-(-ab) by 2. But by Theorem 1.1(2) -(-ab)=ab. 

4. a(b-c)=a(b+(-c))=ab+a(-c)=ab-ac by 2.

5. (-1)a+a=(-1)a+1a=(-1+1)a=0a=0 by 1. and so (-1)a=-a.

6. Put a=-1 in 5. and apply Theorem 1.1(2).&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

==Some more results==

It is strongly recommended that theorems in this section should be treated as exercises by the readers.

'''Theorem 1.3''': Prove that a ring R is commutative if and only if &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in R&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''': Suppose R is commutative. Then clearly the result holds. (In fact the '''binomial theorem''': &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^n=\textstyle\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k&lt;/math&gt; holds in that case. Try to prove it using induction and the '''Pascal's identity''':&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\binom{n}{k}+\textstyle\binom{n}{k+1}=\textstyle\binom{n+1}{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;.) Conversely suppose that for each &lt;math&gt;a,b\in R&lt;/math&gt; the given relation is satisfied. Now, on applying the distributive laws to &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^2=(a+b)(a+b)&lt;/math&gt; we get &lt;math&gt;=a^2+ab+ba+b^2=(a+b)^2=a^2+ab+ab+b^2&lt;/math&gt; and by the cancellation laws we have ab=ba. Hence R is commutative.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; 

'''Theorem 1.4''': If R is a system satisfying all the conditions of a ring with unit element with the possible exception of a+b=b+a, prove that the axiom a+b=b+a must hold in R and that thus R is a ring.

'''Proof''': (a+b)(1+1)=a1+a1+b1+b1=a+a+b+b and (a+b)(1+1)=a1+b1+a1+b1=a+b+a+b by the left and right distributive laws reepectively. Equating the two identities and applying the cancellation laws gives us the result.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.5''': Let R be a ring such that &lt;math&gt;a^2=a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in R&lt;/math&gt;. Prove that R is commutative. 

Note: Such a ring is called a '''Boolean ring'''.

'''Proof''': &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^2=a+b&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;a^2+ab+ba+b^2=a+b&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;a^2=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b^2=b&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;ab=-ba&lt;/math&gt; by the cancellation law. Now as &lt;math&gt;a+a=(a+a)^2=a^2+2a^2+a^2=a+a+a+a&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;a+a=0 \ \forall a\in R&lt;/math&gt; and so each element in R is its own additive inverse. Hence &lt;math&gt;-ba=ba&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;ab=ba&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.6''': If R is a ring with unity satisfying &lt;math&gt;(xy)^2=x^2y^2&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,y\in R&lt;/math&gt;, prove that R is commutative.

'''Proof''': By our hypothesis &lt;math&gt;[x(y+1)]^2=x^2(y+1)^2=x^2(y^2+2y+1)=x^2y^2+2x^2y+x^2&lt;/math&gt; and also by the distributive laws &lt;math&gt;[x(y+1)]^2=[xy+x]^2=(xy+x)(xy+x)=x^2y^2+xyx+x^2y+x^2&lt;/math&gt;. So equating the two and applying the cancellation laws we have &lt;math&gt;xyx=x^2y&lt;/math&gt; which holds as an identity. Now substituting x+1 for x in the identity we have &lt;math&gt;(x+1)y(x+1)=(x+1)^2y&lt;/math&gt;.  This gives &lt;math&gt;(x+1)(yx+y)=(x+1)(xy+y)&lt;/math&gt; and on the application of the distributive laws we have &lt;math&gt;xyx+xy+yx+y=x^2y+xy+xy+y&lt;/math&gt;. Cancellation law now gives &lt;math&gt;xy=yx&lt;/math&gt; as required.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.7''': Let R be a ring such that for &lt;math&gt;x \in R&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique &lt;math&gt;a\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that xa=x. Show that ax=x. Hence deduce that if R has a unique right identity e, then e is the unity of R.

'''Proof''': xa=x implies x(a+ax-x)=xa+xax-x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=x. Hence a+ax-x=a or ax=x. If R has a unique right identity e then xe=x implies ex=x and so e is the unity of R.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.8''': Let R be a ring with unity &lt;math&gt;1\in R&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose for &lt;math&gt;x\ne 0\in R \exists&lt;/math&gt; a unique &lt;math&gt;y\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that xyx=x. Prove that xy=yx=1, i.e. x is invertible in R.

'''Proof''': Suppose, if possible xa=0 for some &lt;math&gt;a\in R&lt;/math&gt;. Now, x(y+a)x=(xy+xa)x=xyx+xax=xyx=x and by the uniqueness of y it follows that y+a=a i.e. a=0. So &lt;math&gt;xa=0\Rightarrow a=0&lt;/math&gt;. Now x(yx-1)=xyx-x=x-x=0 and so yx-1=0. Hence yx=1. Similarly xy=1. So x is invertible.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.9''': Show that if 1-ab is invertible in a ring R with unity, then so is 1-ba.

'''Proof''': Let x be the inverse of 1-ab, i.e. let x(1-ab)=(1-ab)x=1. Now (1-ba)(1+bxa)=1+bxa-ba-babxa=1-ba+b(1-ab)xa=1-ba+ba=1. Similarly (1+bxa)(1-ba)=1. So 1-ba is invertible with inverse 1+bxa.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.10''': If a,b are any two elements of a ring R and m and n are any two positive integers, then prove that 

1. (m+n)a=ma+na.

2. m(a+b)=ma+mb.

3. m(na)=(mn)a.

4. (na)(mb)=(nm)(ab).

5. a&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;=a&lt;sup&gt;m+n&lt;/sup&gt;.

6. (a&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;=a&lt;sup&gt;mn&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Proof''' We shall prove 4. and leave the rest as an exercise for the reader.

4. &lt;math&gt;(na)(mb)=(\underbrace{a+\cdots a}_{n\ times})(\underbrace{b+\cdots b}_{m\ times})=\underbrace{ab+\cdots ab}_{nm\ times}&lt;/math&gt; by repeated application of the distributive law. The RHS is just (nm)(ab).&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

__TOC__

The following instructions will lead you through the process of downloading all the components necessary for using grsecurity on your system. Download each component to the same directory on your computer.

You need:
* The latest stable version of grsecurity.
* A matching version of gradm, the administration utility for grsecurity.
* Full source code of the [[w:Linux|Linux]] kernel.

You also need to have necessary programs for building, configuring and installing a custom kernel for your system. The preferred way, and required tools, to do the installation depend on the Linux distribution you are using. If you encounter problems with configuring or installing the kernel, please consult your distribution's documentation.

== Downloading grsecurity ==

Point your browser to http://grsecurity.net/. Click on the &quot;Download&quot; link and then &quot;Stable&quot;. For the purposes of this document, we will be installing the latest stable grsecurity for kernel 3.2.50. Therefore the patch file will be called &quot;grsecurity-2.9.1-3.2.50-201308052151.patch&quot;.

{{info|1=All grsecurity packages have a version string in their names. It contains both the version of the release itself and the kernel version it is meant for. For example, the version string &lt;span style=&quot;color:#990000;&quot;&gt;2.9.1&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6600cc;&quot;&gt;3.2.50&lt;/span&gt;-201308052151 tells us that the version of this grsecurity release is &lt;span style=&quot;color:#990000;&quot;&gt;2.9.1&lt;/span&gt; and it is meant for kernel version &lt;span style=&quot;color:#6600cc;&quot;&gt;3.2.50&lt;/span&gt;. The last section of the version is a timestamp.}}

In our case we downloaded the following files
* grsecurity-2.9.1-3.2.50-201308052151.patch
* grsecurity-2.9.1-3.2.50-201308052151.patch.sig - This is the [[w:Digital signature|digital signature]] of this release.

== Downloading gradm ==

When downloading &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt;, the administration utility for grsecurity's role-based access control system, you must download the version that matches the version of the grsecurity patch you downloaded. &lt;tt&gt;Gradm&lt;/tt&gt; is located on the same download page as grsecurity.

In our case we downloaded the following files
* gradm-2.9.1-201308021745.tar.gz
* gradm-2.9.1-201308021745.tar.gz.sig - This is the digital signature of this release.

== Downloading the Linux Kernel ==

The grsecurity patches can only be applied to a [[w:Linux_kernel#Development_model|vanilla]] kernel. Many distributions modify the official kernel with additional patches, which means that any kernel source packages acquired through their package manager is very likely incompatible with grsecurity.

For this reason we will download the official unmodified kernel from http://www.kernel.org/. Download the full kernel source package and its signature (the &quot;.sign&quot; file), and make sure its version matches the version of the grsecurity patch you downloaded. In this document the version is 3.2.50. The required version is most likely not the latest, so you need to get it from the [http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ kernel archives].

{{XWarning|Official support for kernel version 2.6.32.61 closed at the end of 2013.}}

If you've got a terminal open, you can use the below commands to download both the kernel source and the signature to the current working directory:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.2.50.tar.bz2
$ wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.2.50.tar.sign
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''NOTE''': The versions of the grsecurity patch and the kernel must match exactly.

== Verifying the Downloads ==

The grsecurity and gradm packages have been cryptographically signed so that users can verify that the source code has not been modified since it was packaged. You can find the public key used to sign them from the same download page as grsecurity. Scroll down the page until you see a heading that says &quot;Verify these downloads with GPG&quot;. Below the heading is a link to the public key. Download the key to the directory where you placed grsecurity.

Before you can verify the downloads, you need to import the grsecurity key to your public keyring using [[w:GNU Privacy Guard|Gnu Privacy Guard]] (GPG). If you are unfamiliar with GPG and wish to know more, please refer to [http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html The GNU Privacy Handbook].

To import the key, run the following command in the directory where your grsecurity and its key were downloaded.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ gpg --import spender-gpg-key.asc
gpg: key 4245D46A: public key &quot;Bradley Spengler (spender) &lt;spender@grsecurity.net&gt;&quot; imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

After importing the key, verify the downloaded grsecurity and gradm packages by running the below commands in your grsecurity directory:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ gpg --verify grsecurity-2.9.1-3.2.50-201308052151.patch.sig
gpg: Signature made Mon 05 Aug 2013 06:55:44 PM PDT using DSA key ID 4245D46A
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Bradley Spengler (spender) &lt;spender@grsecurity.net&gt;&quot;
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 9F74 393D 7E7F FF3C 6500  E778 9879 B649 4245 D46A

$ gpg --verify gradm-2.9.1-201308021745.tar.gz.sig
gpg: Signature made Fri 02 Aug 2013 02:45:37 PM PDT using DSA key ID 4245D46A
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Bradley Spengler (spender) &lt;spender@grsecurity.net&gt;&quot;
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 9F74 393D 7E7F FF3C 6500  E778 9879 B649 4245 D46A
&lt;/pre&gt;

Below is an example of a failed signature verification. The patch file was modified on purpose to make the verification fail.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ gpg --verify grsecurity-2.9.1-3.2.50-201308052151.patch.sig
gpg: Signature made Mon 05 Aug 2013 06:55:44 PM PDT using DSA key ID 4245D46A
gpg: BAD signature from &quot;Bradley Spengler (spender) &lt;spender@grsecurity.net&gt;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

As long as &lt;tt&gt;GPG&lt;/tt&gt; reports the signature is good, you do not need to worry about the warning about the key not being certified with a trusted signature. If you signed the grsecurity key with your own key, you will not get the warning. If the verification of either file failed (i.e. if you get the &quot;BAD signature&quot; message), re-download the file in question and try again.

The Linux kernel source packages have been signed as well. Please follow [https://www.kernel.org/signature.html the instructions on the Linux kernel website] to verify the kernel source package.

When you have successfully verified the downloaded files, you are ready to configure grsecurity.

__TOC__

The following instructions will lead you through the process of patching the Linux kernel with grsecurity, configuring its features and compiling, and installing the patched kernel.

== Patching Your Kernel with grsecurity == 

In this document the kernel source archive is called ''linux-3.2.50.tar'' and the matching grsecurity patch ''grsecurity-2.9.1-3.2.50-201308052151.patch''. Both files are in the same directory.

Change to the root user and run the following commands in the directory you downloaded the files to. The first command decompresses the Linux source package, and the second one applies the patch to the kernel.  You may need to install the patch program with your preferred package management tool.

&lt;pre&gt;
# tar -xf linux-3.2.50.tar
# cd linux-3.2.50
# patch -p1 &lt; ../grsecurity-2.9.1-3.2.50-201308052151.patch
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Configuring the Kernel ==

The kernel source package contains a generic configuration file that should work without any significant modifications. Your distribution may have its own process and tools for configuring and building the kernel, in which case you should consult their documentation. Nonetheless you should go through the options and make sure they match your hardware and current setup.

To configure the kernel using the default configuration as a base, change into the kernel source directory (e.g. ''/usr/src/linux-3.2.50''), and execute the below command.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ make menuconfig
&lt;/pre&gt;

You may need to install missing packages and libraries - follow the error messages for direction.

The interactive Kernel Configuration menu will launch. In the 3.x and 2.6 kernels the grsecurity options are under Security options &amp;raquo; Grsecurity. Detailed descriptions of each option and its effects on the system can be viewed online on the [[Grsecurity/Appendix/Grsecurity and PaX Configuration Options|Grsecurity and PaX Configuration Options]] page or by using the built-in help functionality of the kernel configuration system. Make sure you understand each option before you enable or disable them.  Once you have exited the Configuration menu, you can launch it again by rerunning &quot;make menuconfig&quot;.

It is recommended that you start by setting the Configuration Method option to Automatic and then configuring Usage Type and other options to fit your environment and needs. You can fine-tune all grsecurity and PaX settings in the Customize Configuration section, if needed.

=== Suggestions ===

* Enable the [[../Runtime_Configuration|sysctl interface]] (Grsecurity &amp;raquo; Customize Configuration &amp;raquo; Sysctl Support). It will enable you to change the options that grsecurity runs with without recompiling the kernel. This is a very helpful feature especially when you are using grsecurity for the first time.  &quot;Configuration Method - Automatic&quot; enables this feature by default.
* Some auditing options produce a lot of log messages, most notably Exec and Chdir logging (GRKERNSEC_EXECLOG and GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_CHDIR, respectively). If you enable either of them, make sure your logging system is properly configured to prevent the logs from flooding. Check Grsecurity &amp;raquo; Customize Configuration &amp;raquo; Logging Options as well.

== Compiling and Installing the Kernel ==

=== On Debian and Ubuntu ===

To compile the kernel and build a Debian package (deb), execute the below commands in the kernel source directory. Ubuntu users should reference [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile the Ubuntu Community Page] and decide whether they wish to use the ubuntu-package overlay directory in building. For building on Maverick from a git checkout, see [http://blog.avirtualhome.com/2010/11/06/how-to-compile-a-ubuntu-10-10-maverick-kernel/ How to compile a Ubuntu 10.10 kernel]
&lt;pre&gt;
# fakeroot make deb-pkg
&lt;/pre&gt;

To install the newly created Debian package, run:
&lt;pre&gt;
# cd ..
# dpkg -i *.deb
&lt;/pre&gt;

For more information about building kernels in Debian, please refer to the [http://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/ch-common-tasks.html#s-kernel-org-package Debian Linux Kernel Handbook].

=== Other Distributions ===

* Gentoo Linux: [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&amp;chap=7 Gentoo Linux (x86) Handbook] and [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/ Hardened Gentoo]
* CentOS: http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Custom_Kernel
* Fedora (release 8 and later): http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Docs/CustomKernel

=== Compilation Differences ===

As you are compiling a kernel patched with grsecurity, you will notice some differences.  One of these differences appears towards the end of compilation, and may look similar to:

&lt;pre&gt;
WARNING: modpost: Found 2820 section mismatch(es).
To see full details build your kernel with:
'make CONFIG_DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH=y'
&lt;/pre&gt;

This warning is harmless.  As described by the PaX Team on the grsecurity mailing list:
&lt;pre&gt;
the extra section mismatches are due to my changes, i explicitly
added detection for writeable function pointers which are potential
exploit targets, just to know how many of them there are. we've been
eliminating some of them already but this work will never finish.

as for what they are in general, a mismatch means an unwanted reference
from one section to another. say, accessing init code or data from
normal code/data is not good since init sections are freed up on boot,
so any reference to them must not exist from permanent sections.
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will also notice additional warnings emitted by the compiler when compiling a kernel patched with grsecurity.  This is due to additional warning flags that have been added to the build process to help spot specific kinds of bugs.  You can ignore these additional warnings.

== Introduction ==
This is a list of all grsecurity and [[w:PaX|PaX]] configuration options in the kernel. You can access this same information using the kernel configuration's built-in help. This page contains only the configuration options present in the [http://grsecurity.net/download_stable.php latest stable grsecurity release].  The grsecurity options are available under Security options &amp;raquo; Grsecurity.

Each option contains the corresponding kernel configuration symbol (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_FIFO&lt;/tt&gt;), all related [[Grsecurity/Runtime Configuration|sysctl]] variable names if the option is configurable through sysctl, and description of the option.

{{info|1=This listing was generated February 15, 2014 from the Kconfig file of grsecurity 3.0-3.13.3-201402132113.patch using a script. Manual updates will be lost the next time the content is regenerated.}}

=Grsecurity (top level menu)=


==Grsecurity==
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, you will be able to configure many features
that will enhance the security of your system.  It is highly
recommended that you say Y here and read through the help
for each option so that you fully understand the features and
can evaluate their usefulness for your machine.&lt;/pre&gt;

==Configuration Method==

===Automatic===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you choose this configuration method, you'll be able to answer a small
number of simple questions about how you plan to use this kernel.
The settings of grsecurity and PaX will be automatically configured for
the highest commonly-used settings within the provided constraints.

If you require additional configuration, custom changes can still be made
from the &quot;custom configuration&quot; menu.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Custom===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_CUSTOM&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you choose this configuration method, you'll be able to configure all
grsecurity and PaX settings manually.  Via this method, no options are
automatically enabled.&lt;/pre&gt;

==Usage Type==

===Server===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_SERVER&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if you plan to use this kernel on a server.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Desktop===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_DESKTOP&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if you plan to use this kernel on a desktop.&lt;/pre&gt;

==Virtualization Type==

===None===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_NONE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if this kernel will be run on bare metal.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Guest===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_GUEST&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if this kernel will be run as a VM guest.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Host===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_HOST&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if this kernel will be run as a VM host.&lt;/pre&gt;

==Virtualization Hardware==

===EPT/RVI Processor Support===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_EPT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if your CPU supports the EPT or RVI features of 2nd-gen
hardware virtualization.  This allows for additional kernel hardening protections
to operate without additional performance impact.

To see if your Intel processor supports EPT, see:
http://ark.intel.com/Products/VirtualizationTechnology
(Most Core i3/5/7 support EPT)

To see if your AMD processor supports RVI, see:
http://support.amd.com/us/kbarticles/Pages/GPU120AMDRVICPUsHyperVWin8.aspx&lt;/pre&gt;

===First-gen/No Hardware Virtualization===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_SOFT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if you use an Atom/Pentium/Core 2 processor that either doesn't
support hardware virtualization or doesn't support the EPT/RVI extensions.&lt;/pre&gt;

==Virtualization Software==

===Xen===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_XEN&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if this kernel is running as a Xen guest or host.&lt;/pre&gt;

===VMWare===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_VMWARE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if this kernel is running as a VMWare guest or host.&lt;/pre&gt;

===KVM===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_KVM&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if this kernel is running as a KVM guest or host.&lt;/pre&gt;

===VirtualBox===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_VIRTUALBOX&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if this kernel is running as a VirtualBox guest or host.&lt;/pre&gt;

==Required Priorities==

===Performance===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_PRIORITY_PERF&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if performance is of highest priority for this deployment
of grsecurity.  Features like UDEREF on a 64bit kernel, kernel stack clearing,
clearing of structures intended for userland, and freed memory sanitizing will
be disabled.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Security===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_PRIORITY_SECURITY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Choose this option if security is of highest priority for this deployment of
grsecurity.  UDEREF, kernel stack clearing, clearing of structures intended
for userland, and freed memory sanitizing will be enabled for this kernel.
In a worst-case scenario, these features can introduce a 20% performance hit
(UDEREF on x64 contributing half of this hit).&lt;/pre&gt;

==Default Special Groups==

===GID exempted from /proc restrictions===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_PROC_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Setting this GID determines which group will be exempted from
grsecurity's /proc restrictions, allowing users of the specified
group  to view network statistics and the existence of other users'
processes on the system.  This GID may also be chosen at boot time
via &quot;grsec_proc_gid=&quot; on the kernel commandline.&lt;/pre&gt;

===GID for TPE-untrusted users===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_TPE_UNTRUSTED_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Setting this GID determines what group TPE restrictions will be
*enabled* for.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
with name &quot;tpe_gid&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

===GID for TPE-trusted users===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_TPE_TRUSTED_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Setting this GID determines what group TPE restrictions will be
*disabled* for.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
with name &quot;tpe_gid&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

===GID for users with kernel-enforced SymlinksIfOwnerMatch===
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SYMLINKOWN_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Setting this GID determines what group kernel-enforced
SymlinksIfOwnerMatch will be enabled for.  If the sysctl option
is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;symlinkown_gid&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

==Customize Configuration==

===PaX===

====Enable various PaX features====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;This allows you to enable various PaX features.  PaX adds
intrusion prevention mechanisms to the kernel that reduce
the risks posed by exploitable memory corruption bugs.&lt;/pre&gt;

====PaX Control====

=====Support soft mode=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_SOFTMODE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Enabling this option will allow you to run PaX in soft mode, that
is, PaX features will not be enforced by default, only on executables
marked explicitly.  You must also enable PT_PAX_FLAGS or XATTR_PAX_FLAGS
support as they are the only way to mark executables for soft mode use.

Soft mode can be activated by using the &quot;pax_softmode=1&quot; kernel command
line option on boot.  Furthermore you can control various PaX features
at runtime via the entries in /proc/sys/kernel/pax.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Use legacy ELF header marking=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_EI_PAX&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Enabling this option will allow you to control PaX features on
a per executable basis via the 'chpax' utility available at
http://pax.grsecurity.net/.  The control flags will be read from
an otherwise reserved part of the ELF header.  This marking has
numerous drawbacks (no support for soft-mode, toolchain does not
know about the non-standard use of the ELF header) therefore it
has been deprecated in favour of PT_PAX_FLAGS and XATTR_PAX_FLAGS
support.

Note that if you enable PT_PAX_FLAGS or XATTR_PAX_FLAGS marking
support as well, they will override the legacy EI_PAX marks.

If you enable none of the marking options then all applications
will run with PaX enabled on them by default.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Use ELF program header marking=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_PT_PAX_FLAGS&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Enabling this option will allow you to control PaX features on
a per executable basis via the 'paxctl' utility available at
http://pax.grsecurity.net/.  The control flags will be read from
a PaX specific ELF program header (PT_PAX_FLAGS).  This marking
has the benefits of supporting both soft mode and being fully
integrated into the toolchain (the binutils patch is available
from http://pax.grsecurity.net).

Note that if you enable the legacy EI_PAX marking support as well,
the EI_PAX marks will be overridden by the PT_PAX_FLAGS marks.

If you enable both PT_PAX_FLAGS and XATTR_PAX_FLAGS support then you
must make sure that the marks are the same if a binary has both marks.

If you enable none of the marking options then all applications
will run with PaX enabled on them by default.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Use filesystem extended attributes marking=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_XATTR_PAX_FLAGS&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Enabling this option will allow you to control PaX features on
a per executable basis via the 'setfattr' utility.  The control
flags will be read from the user.pax.flags extended attribute of
the file.  This marking has the benefit of supporting binary-only
applications that self-check themselves (e.g., skype) and would
not tolerate chpax/paxctl changes.  The main drawback is that
extended attributes are not supported by some filesystems (e.g.,
isofs, udf, vfat) so copying files through such filesystems will
lose the extended attributes and these PaX markings.

Note that if you enable the legacy EI_PAX marking support as well,
the EI_PAX marks will be overridden by the XATTR_PAX_FLAGS marks.

If you enable both PT_PAX_FLAGS and XATTR_PAX_FLAGS support then you
must make sure that the marks are the same if a binary has both marks.

If you enable none of the marking options then all applications
will run with PaX enabled on them by default.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====MAC system integration=====
&lt;pre&gt;Mandatory Access Control systems have the option of controlling
PaX flags on a per executable basis, choose the method supported
by your particular system.

- &quot;none&quot;: if your MAC system does not interact with PaX,
- &quot;direct&quot;: if your MAC system defines pax_set_initial_flags() itself,
- &quot;hook&quot;: if your MAC system uses the pax_set_initial_flags_func callback.

NOTE: this option is for developers/integrators only.&lt;/pre&gt;

======none======
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_NO_ACL_FLAGS&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

======direct======
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_HAVE_ACL_FLAGS&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

======hook======
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_HOOK_ACL_FLAGS&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

====Non-executable pages====

=====Enforce non-executable pages=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_NOEXEC&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By design some architectures do not allow for protecting memory
pages against execution or even if they do, Linux does not make
use of this feature.  In practice this means that if a page is
readable (such as the stack or heap) it is also executable.

There is a well known exploit technique that makes use of this
fact and a common programming mistake where an attacker can
introduce code of his choice somewhere in the attacked program's
memory (typically the stack or the heap) and then execute it.

If the attacked program was running with different (typically
higher) privileges than that of the attacker, then he can elevate
his own privilege level (e.g. get a root shell, write to files for
which he does not have write access to, etc).

Enabling this option will let you choose from various features
that prevent the injection and execution of 'foreign' code in
a program.

This will also break programs that rely on the old behaviour and
expect that dynamically allocated memory via the malloc() family
of functions is executable (which it is not).  Notable examples
are the XFree86 4.x server, the java runtime and wine.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Paging based non-executable pages=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_PAGEEXEC&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;This implementation is based on the paging feature of the CPU.
On i386 without hardware non-executable bit support there is a
variable but usually low performance impact, however on Intel's
P4 core based CPUs it is very high so you should not enable this
for kernels meant to be used on such CPUs.

On alpha, avr32, ia64, parisc, sparc, sparc64, x86_64 and i386
with hardware non-executable bit support there is no performance
impact, on ppc the impact is negligible.

Note that several architectures require various emulations due to
badly designed userland ABIs, this will cause a performance impact
but will disappear as soon as userland is fixed. For example, ppc
userland MUST have been built with secure-plt by a recent toolchain.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Segmentation based non-executable pages=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_SEGMEXEC&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;This implementation is based on the segmentation feature of the
CPU and has a very small performance impact, however applications
will be limited to a 1.5 GB address space instead of the normal
3 GB.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Emulate trampolines=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_EMUTRAMP&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;There are some programs and libraries that for one reason or
another attempt to execute special small code snippets from
non-executable memory pages.  Most notable examples are the
signal handler return code generated by the kernel itself and
the GCC trampolines.

If you enabled CONFIG_PAX_PAGEEXEC or CONFIG_PAX_SEGMEXEC then
such programs will no longer work under your kernel.

As a remedy you can say Y here and use the 'chpax' or 'paxctl'
utilities to enable trampoline emulation for the affected programs
yet still have the protection provided by the non-executable pages.

On parisc you MUST enable this option and EMUSIGRT as well, otherwise
your system will not even boot.

Alternatively you can say N here and use the 'chpax' or 'paxctl'
utilities to disable CONFIG_PAX_PAGEEXEC and CONFIG_PAX_SEGMEXEC
for the affected files.

NOTE: enabling this feature *may* open up a loophole in the
protection provided by non-executable pages that an attacker
could abuse.  Therefore the best solution is to not have any
files on your system that would require this option.  This can
be achieved by not using libc5 (which relies on the kernel
signal handler return code) and not using or rewriting programs
that make use of the nested function implementation of GCC.
Skilled users can just fix GCC itself so that it implements
nested function calls in a way that does not interfere with PaX.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Automatically emulate sigreturn trampolines=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_EMUSIGRT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Enabling this option will have the kernel automatically detect
and emulate signal return trampolines executing on the stack
that would otherwise lead to task termination.

This solution is intended as a temporary one for users with
legacy versions of libc (libc5, glibc 2.0, uClibc before 0.9.17,
Modula-3 runtime, etc) or executables linked to such, basically
everything that does not specify its own SA_RESTORER function in
normal executable memory like glibc 2.1+ does.

On parisc you MUST enable this option, otherwise your system will
not even boot.

NOTE: this feature cannot be disabled on a per executable basis
and since it *does* open up a loophole in the protection provided
by non-executable pages, the best solution is to not have any
files on your system that would require this option.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Restrict mprotect()=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_MPROTECT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Enabling this option will prevent programs from
 - changing the executable status of memory pages that were
   not originally created as executable,
 - making read-only executable pages writable again,
 - creating executable pages from anonymous memory,
 - making read-only-after-relocations (RELRO) data pages writable again.

You should say Y here to complete the protection provided by
the enforcement of non-executable pages.

NOTE: you can use the 'chpax' or 'paxctl' utilities to control
this feature on a per file basis.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Use legacy/compat protection demoting (read help)=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_MPROTECT_COMPAT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;The current implementation of PAX_MPROTECT denies RWX allocations/mprotects
by sending the proper error code to the application.  For some broken 
userland, this can cause problems with Python or other applications.  The
current implementation however allows for applications like clamav to
detect if JIT compilation/execution is allowed and to fall back gracefully
to an interpreter-based mode if it does not.  While we encourage everyone
to use the current implementation as-is and push upstream to fix broken
userland (note that the RWX logging option can assist with this), in some
environments this may not be possible.  Having to disable MPROTECT
completely on certain binaries reduces the security benefit of PaX,
so this option is provided for those environments to revert to the old
behavior.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Allow ELF text relocations (read help)=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_ELFRELOCS&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Non-executable pages and mprotect() restrictions are effective
in preventing the introduction of new executable code into an
attacked task's address space.  There remain only two venues
for this kind of attack: if the attacker can execute already
existing code in the attacked task then he can either have it
create and mmap() a file containing his code or have it mmap()
an already existing ELF library that does not have position
independent code in it and use mprotect() on it to make it
writable and copy his code there.  While protecting against
the former approach is beyond PaX, the latter can be prevented
by having only PIC ELF libraries on one's system (which do not
need to relocate their code).  If you are sure this is your case,
as is the case with all modern Linux distributions, then leave
this option disabled.  You should say 'n' here.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Allow ELF ET_EXEC text relocations=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_ETEXECRELOCS&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;On some architectures there are incorrectly created applications
that require text relocations and would not work without enabling
this option.  If you are an alpha, ia64 or parisc user, you should
enable this option and disable it once you have made sure that
none of your applications need it.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Automatically emulate ELF PLT=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_EMUPLT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Enabling this option will have the kernel automatically detect
and emulate the Procedure Linkage Table entries in ELF files.
On some architectures such entries are in writable memory, and
become non-executable leading to task termination.  Therefore
it is mandatory that you enable this option on alpha, parisc,
sparc and sparc64, otherwise your system would not even boot.

NOTE: this feature *does* open up a loophole in the protection
provided by the non-executable pages, therefore the proper
solution is to modify the toolchain to produce a PLT that does
not need to be writable.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Emulate old glibc resolver stub=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_DLRESOLVE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;This option is needed if userland has an old glibc (before 2.4)
that puts a 'save' instruction into the runtime generated resolver
stub that needs special emulation.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Enforce non-executable kernel pages=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_KERNEXEC&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;This is the kernel land equivalent of PAGEEXEC and MPROTECT,
that is, enabling this option will make it harder to inject
and execute 'foreign' code in kernel memory itself.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Return Address Instrumentation Method=====
&lt;pre&gt;Select the method used to instrument function pointer dereferences.
Note that binary modules cannot be instrumented by this approach.

Note that the implementation requires a gcc with plugin support,
i.e., gcc 4.5 or newer.  You may need to install the supporting
headers explicitly in addition to the normal gcc package.&lt;/pre&gt;

======bts======
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_KERNEXEC_PLUGIN_METHOD_BTS&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;This method is compatible with binary only modules but has
a higher runtime overhead.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====bts=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_KERNEXEC_PLUGIN_METHOD&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

=====Minimum amount of memory reserved for module code=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_KERNEXEC_MODULE_TEXT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Due to implementation details the kernel must reserve a fixed
amount of memory for runtime allocated code (such as modules)
at compile time that cannot be changed at runtime.  Here you
can specify the minimum amount in MB that will be reserved.
Due to the same implementation details this size will always
be rounded up to the next 2/4 MB boundary (depends on PAE) so
the actually available memory for runtime allocated code will
usually be more than this minimum.

The default 4 MB should be enough for most users but if you have
an excessive number of modules (e.g., most distribution configs
compile many drivers as modules) or use huge modules such as
nvidia's kernel driver, you will need to adjust this amount.
A good rule of thumb is to look at your currently loaded kernel
modules and add up their sizes.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Address Space Layout Randomization====

=====Address Space Layout Randomization=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_ASLR&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Many if not most exploit techniques rely on the knowledge of
certain addresses in the attacked program.  The following options
will allow the kernel to apply a certain amount of randomization
to specific parts of the program thereby forcing an attacker to
guess them in most cases.  Any failed guess will most likely crash
the attacked program which allows the kernel to detect such attempts
and react on them.  PaX itself provides no reaction mechanisms,
instead it is strongly encouraged that you make use of Nergal's
segvguard (ftp://ftp.pl.openwall.com/misc/segvguard/) or grsecurity's
(http://www.grsecurity.net/) built-in crash detection features or
develop one yourself.

By saying Y here you can choose to randomize the following areas:
 - top of the task's kernel stack
 - top of the task's userland stack
 - base address for mmap() requests that do not specify one
   (this includes all libraries)
 - base address of the main executable

It is strongly recommended to say Y here as address space layout
randomization has negligible impact on performance yet it provides
a very effective protection.

NOTE: you can use the 'chpax' or 'paxctl' utilities to control
this feature on a per file basis.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Randomize kernel stack base=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_RANDKSTACK&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the kernel will randomize every task's kernel
stack on every system call.  This will not only force an attacker
to guess it but also prevent him from making use of possible
leaked information about it.

Since the kernel stack is a rather scarce resource, randomization
may cause unexpected stack overflows, therefore you should very
carefully test your system.  Note that once enabled in the kernel
configuration, this feature cannot be disabled on a per file basis.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Randomize user stack base=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_RANDUSTACK&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the kernel will randomize every task's userland
stack.  The randomization is done in two steps where the second
one may apply a big amount of shift to the top of the stack and
cause problems for programs that want to use lots of memory (more
than 2.5 GB if SEGMEXEC is not active, or 1.25 GB when it is).
For this reason the second step can be controlled by 'chpax' or
'paxctl' on a per file basis.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Randomize mmap() base=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_RANDMMAP&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the kernel will use a randomized base address for
mmap() requests that do not specify one themselves.  As a result
all dynamically loaded libraries will appear at random addresses
and therefore be harder to exploit by a technique where an attacker
attempts to execute library code for his purposes (e.g. spawn a
shell from an exploited program that is running at an elevated
privilege level).

Furthermore, if a program is relinked as a dynamic ELF file, its
base address will be randomized as well, completing the full
randomization of the address space layout.  Attacking such programs
becomes a guess game.  You can find an example of doing this at
http://pax.grsecurity.net/et_dyn.tar.gz and practical samples at
http://www.grsecurity.net/grsec-gcc-specs.tar.gz .

NOTE: you can use the 'chpax' or 'paxctl' utilities to control this
feature on a per file basis.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Miscellaneous hardening features====

=====Sanitize all freed memory=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the kernel will erase memory pages and slab objects
as soon as they are freed.  This in turn reduces the lifetime of data
stored in them, making it less likely that sensitive information such
as passwords, cryptographic secrets, etc stay in memory for too long.

This is especially useful for programs whose runtime is short, long
lived processes and the kernel itself benefit from this as long as
they ensure timely freeing of memory that may hold sensitive
information.

A nice side effect of the sanitization of slab objects is the
reduction of possible info leaks caused by padding bytes within the
leaky structures.  Use-after-free bugs for structures containing
pointers can also be detected as dereferencing the sanitized pointer
will generate an access violation.

The tradeoff is performance impact, on a single CPU system kernel
compilation sees a 3% slowdown, other systems and workloads may vary
and you are advised to test this feature on your expected workload
before deploying it.

To reduce the performance penalty by sanitizing pages only, albeit
limiting the effectiveness of this feature at the same time, slab
sanitization can be disabled with the kernel commandline parameter
&quot;pax_sanitize_slab=0&quot;.

Note that this feature does not protect data stored in live pages,
e.g., process memory swapped to disk may stay there for a long time.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Sanitize kernel stack=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_MEMORY_STACKLEAK&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the kernel will erase the kernel stack before it
returns from a system call.  This in turn reduces the information
that a kernel stack leak bug can reveal.

Note that such a bug can still leak information that was put on
the stack by the current system call (the one eventually triggering
the bug) but traces of earlier system calls on the kernel stack
cannot leak anymore.

The tradeoff is performance impact: on a single CPU system kernel
compilation sees a 1% slowdown, other systems and workloads may vary
and you are advised to test this feature on your expected workload
before deploying it.

Note that the full feature requires a gcc with plugin support,
i.e., gcc 4.5 or newer.  You may need to install the supporting
headers explicitly in addition to the normal gcc package.  Using
older gcc versions means that functions with large enough stack
frames may leave uninitialized memory behind that may be exposed
to a later syscall leaking the stack.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Forcibly initialize local variables copied to userland=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_MEMORY_STRUCTLEAK&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the kernel will zero initialize some local
variables that are going to be copied to userland.  This in
turn prevents unintended information leakage from the kernel
stack should later code forget to explicitly set all parts of
the copied variable.

The tradeoff is less performance impact than PAX_MEMORY_STACKLEAK
at a much smaller coverage.

Note that the implementation requires a gcc with plugin support,
i.e., gcc 4.5 or newer.  You may need to install the supporting
headers explicitly in addition to the normal gcc package.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Prevent invalid userland pointer dereference=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_MEMORY_UDEREF&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the kernel will be prevented from dereferencing
userland pointers in contexts where the kernel expects only kernel
pointers.  This is both a useful runtime debugging feature and a
security measure that prevents exploiting a class of kernel bugs.

The tradeoff is that some virtualization solutions may experience
a huge slowdown and therefore you should not enable this feature
for kernels meant to run in such environments.  Whether a given VM
solution is affected or not is best determined by simply trying it
out, the performance impact will be obvious right on boot as this
mechanism engages from very early on.  A good rule of thumb is that
VMs running on CPUs without hardware virtualization support (i.e.,
the majority of IA-32 CPUs) will likely experience the slowdown.

On X86_64 the kernel will make use of PCID support when available
(Intel's Westmere, Sandy Bridge, etc) for better security (default)
or performance impact.  Pass pax_weakuderef on the kernel command
line to choose the latter.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Prevent various kernel object reference counter overflows=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_REFCOUNT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the kernel will detect and prevent overflowing
various (but not all) kinds of object reference counters.  Such
overflows can normally occur due to bugs only and are often, if
not always, exploitable.

The tradeoff is that data structures protected by an overflowed
refcount will never be freed and therefore will leak memory.  Note
that this leak also happens even without this protection but in
that case the overflow can eventually trigger the freeing of the
data structure while it is still being used elsewhere, resulting
in the exploitable situation that this feature prevents.

Since this has a negligible performance impact, you should enable
this feature.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Automatically constify eligible structures=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_CONSTIFY_PLUGIN&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the compiler will automatically constify a class
of types that contain only function pointers.  This reduces the
kernel's attack surface and also produces a better memory layout.

Note that the implementation requires a gcc with plugin support,
i.e., gcc 4.5 or newer.  You may need to install the supporting
headers explicitly in addition to the normal gcc package.
 
Note that if some code really has to modify constified variables
then the source code will have to be patched to allow it.  Examples
can be found in PaX itself (the no_const attribute) and for some
out-of-tree modules at http://www.grsecurity.net/~paxguy1/ .&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Harden heap object copies between kernel and userland=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_USERCOPY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the kernel will enforce the size of heap objects
when they are copied in either direction between the kernel and
userland, even if only a part of the heap object is copied.

Specifically, this checking prevents information leaking from the
kernel heap during kernel to userland copies (if the kernel heap
object is otherwise fully initialized) and prevents kernel heap
overflows during userland to kernel copies.

Note that the current implementation provides the strictest bounds
checks for the SLUB allocator.

Enabling this option also enables per-slab cache protection against
data in a given cache being copied into/out of via userland
accessors.  Though the whitelist of regions will be reduced over
time, it notably protects important data structures like task structs.

If frame pointers are enabled on x86, this option will also restrict
copies into and out of the kernel stack to local variables within a
single frame.

Since this has a negligible performance impact, you should enable
this feature.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Prevent various integer overflows in function size parameters=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_SIZE_OVERFLOW&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the kernel recomputes expressions of function
arguments marked by a size_overflow attribute with double integer
precision (DImode/TImode for 32/64 bit integer types).

The recomputed argument is checked against TYPE_MAX and an event
is logged on overflow and the triggering process is killed.

Homepage: http://www.grsecurity.net/~ephox/overflow_plugin/

Note that the implementation requires a gcc with plugin support,
i.e., gcc 4.5 or newer.  You may need to install the supporting
headers explicitly in addition to the normal gcc package.&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Generate some entropy during boot and runtime=====
&lt;tt&gt;PAX_LATENT_ENTROPY&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;By saying Y here the kernel will instrument some kernel code to
extract some entropy from both original and artificially created
program state.  This will help especially embedded systems where
there is little 'natural' source of entropy normally.  The cost
is some slowdown of the boot process and fork and irq processing.

When pax_extra_latent_entropy is passed on the kernel command line,
entropy will be extracted from up to the first 4GB of RAM while the
runtime memory allocator is being initialized.  This costs even more
slowdown of the boot process.

Note that the implementation requires a gcc with plugin support,
i.e., gcc 4.5 or newer.  You may need to install the supporting
headers explicitly in addition to the normal gcc package.

Note that entropy extracted this way is not cryptographically
secure!&lt;/pre&gt;

===Memory Protections===

====Deny reading/writing to /dev/kmem, /dev/mem, and /dev/port====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_KMEM&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, /dev/kmem and /dev/mem won't be allowed to
be written to or read from to modify or leak the contents of the running
kernel.  /dev/port will also not be allowed to be opened, and support
for /dev/cpu/*/msr and kexec will be removed.  If you have module
support disabled, enabling this will close up six ways that are
currently used to insert malicious code into the running kernel.

Even with this feature enabled, we still highly recommend that
you use the RBAC system, as it is still possible for an attacker to
modify the running kernel through other more obscure methods.

Enabling this feature will prevent the &quot;cpupower&quot; and &quot;powertop&quot; tools
from working.

It is highly recommended that you say Y here if you meet all the
conditions above.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Restrict VM86 mode====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_VM86&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, only processes with CAP_SYS_RAWIO will be able to
make use of a special execution mode on 32bit x86 processors called
Virtual 8086 (VM86) mode.  XFree86 may need vm86 mode for certain
video cards and will still work with this option enabled.  The purpose
of the option is to prevent exploitation of emulation errors in
virtualization of vm86 mode like the one discovered in VMWare in 2009.
Nearly all users should be able to enable this option.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Disable privileged I/O====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_IO&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.disable_priv_io&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, all ioperm and iopl calls will return an error.
Ioperm and iopl can be used to modify the running kernel.
Unfortunately, some programs need this access to operate properly,
the most notable of which are XFree86 and hwclock.  hwclock can be
remedied by having RTC support in the kernel, so real-time 
clock support is enabled if this option is enabled, to ensure 
that hwclock operates correctly.

If you're using XFree86 or a version of Xorg from 2012 or earlier,
you may not be able to boot into a graphical environment with this
option enabled.  In this case, you should use the RBAC system instead.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Harden BPF JIT against spray attacks====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_JIT_HARDEN&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the native code generated by the kernel's Berkeley
Packet Filter (BPF) JIT engine will be hardened against JIT-spraying
attacks that attempt to fit attacker-beneficial instructions in
32bit immediate fields of JIT-generated native instructions.  The
attacker will generally aim to cause an unintended instruction sequence
of JIT-generated native code to execute by jumping into the middle of
a generated instruction.  This feature effectively randomizes the 32bit
immediate constants present in the generated code to thwart such attacks.

If you're using KERNEXEC, it's recommended that you enable this option
to supplement the hardening of the kernel.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Disable unprivileged PERF_EVENTS usage by default====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_PERF_HARDEN&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the range of acceptable values for the
/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid sysctl will be expanded to allow and
default to a new value: 3.  When the sysctl is set to this value, no
unprivileged use of the PERF_EVENTS syscall interface will be permitted.

Though PERF_EVENTS can be used legitimately for performance monitoring
and low-level application profiling, it is forced on regardless of
configuration, has been at fault for several vulnerabilities, and
creates new opportunities for side channels and other information leaks.

This feature puts PERF_EVENTS into a secure default state and permits
the administrator to change out of it temporarily if unprivileged
application profiling is needed.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Insert random gaps between thread stacks====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_RAND_THREADSTACK&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, a random-sized gap will be enforced between allocated
thread stacks.  Glibc's NPTL and other threading libraries that
pass MAP_STACK to the kernel for thread stack allocation are supported.
The implementation currently provides 8 bits of entropy for the gap.

Many distributions do not compile threaded remote services with the
-fstack-check argument to GCC, causing the variable-sized stack-based
allocator, alloca(), to not probe the stack on allocation.  This
permits an unbounded alloca() to skip over any guard page and potentially
modify another thread's stack reliably.  An enforced random gap
reduces the reliability of such an attack and increases the chance
that such a read/write to another thread's stack instead lands in
an unmapped area, causing a crash and triggering grsecurity's
anti-bruteforcing logic.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Harden ASLR against information leaks and entropy reduction====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_PROC_MEMMAP&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps and /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/stat files will
give no information about the addresses of its mappings if
PaX features that rely on random addresses are enabled on the task.
In addition to sanitizing this information and disabling other
dangerous sources of information, this option causes reads of sensitive
/proc/&lt;pid&gt; entries where the file descriptor was opened in a different
task than the one performing the read.  Such attempts are logged.
This option also limits argv/env strings for suid/sgid binaries
to 512KB to prevent a complete exhaustion of the stack entropy provided
by ASLR.  Finally, it places an 8MB stack resource limit on suid/sgid
binaries to prevent alternative mmap layouts from being abused.

If you use PaX it is essential that you say Y here as it closes up
several holes that make full ASLR useless locally.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Prevent kernel stack overflows====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_KSTACKOVERFLOW&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the kernel's process stacks will be allocated
with vmalloc instead of the kernel's default allocator.  This
introduces guard pages that in combination with the alloca checking
of the STACKLEAK feature prevents all forms of kernel process stack
overflow abuse.  Note that this is different from kernel stack
buffer overflows.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deter exploit bruteforcing====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_BRUTE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.deter_bruteforce&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, attempts to bruteforce exploits against forking
daemons such as apache or sshd, as well as against suid/sgid binaries
will be deterred.  When a child of a forking daemon is killed by PaX
or crashes due to an illegal instruction or other suspicious signal,
the parent process will be delayed 30 seconds upon every subsequent
fork until the administrator is able to assess the situation and
restart the daemon.
In the suid/sgid case, the attempt is logged, the user has all their
existing instances of the suid/sgid binary terminated and will
be unable to execute any suid/sgid binaries for 15 minutes.

It is recommended that you also enable signal logging in the auditing
section so that logs are generated when a process triggers a suspicious
signal.
If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
&quot;deter_bruteforce&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Harden module auto-loading====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_MODHARDEN&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, module auto-loading in response to use of some
feature implemented by an unloaded module will be restricted to
root users.  Enabling this option helps defend against attacks 
by unprivileged users who abuse the auto-loading behavior to 
cause a vulnerable module to load that is then exploited.

If this option prevents a legitimate use of auto-loading for a 
non-root user, the administrator can execute modprobe manually 
with the exact name of the module mentioned in the alert log.
Alternatively, the administrator can add the module to the list
of modules loaded at boot by modifying init scripts.

Modification of init scripts will most likely be needed on 
Ubuntu servers with encrypted home directory support enabled,
as the first non-root user logging in will cause the ecb(aes),
ecb(aes)-all, cbc(aes), and cbc(aes)-all  modules to be loaded.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Hide kernel symbols====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_HIDESYM&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, getting information on loaded modules, and
displaying all kernel symbols through a syscall will be restricted
to users with CAP_SYS_MODULE.  For software compatibility reasons,
/proc/kallsyms will be restricted to the root user.  The RBAC
system can hide that entry even from root.

This option also prevents leaking of kernel addresses through
several /proc entries.

Note that this option is only effective provided the following
conditions are met:
1) The kernel using grsecurity is not precompiled by some distribution
2) You have also enabled GRKERNSEC_DMESG
3) You are using the RBAC system and hiding other files such as your
   kernel image and System.map.  Alternatively, enabling this option
   causes the permissions on /boot, /lib/modules, and the kernel
   source directory to change at compile time to prevent 
   reading by non-root users.
If the above conditions are met, this option will aid in providing a
useful protection against local kernel exploitation of overflows
and arbitrary read/write vulnerabilities.

It is highly recommended that you enable GRKERNSEC_PERF_HARDEN
in addition to this feature.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Randomize layout of sensitive kernel structures====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_RANDSTRUCT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the layouts of a number of sensitive kernel
structures (task, fs, cred, etc) and all structures composed entirely
of function pointers (aka &quot;ops&quot; structs) will be randomized at compile-time.
This can introduce the requirement of an additional infoleak
vulnerability for exploits targeting these structure types.

Enabling this feature will introduce some performance impact, slightly
increase memory usage, and prevent the use of forensic tools like
Volatility against the system (unless the kernel source tree isn't
cleaned after kernel installation).

The seed used for compilation is located at tools/gcc/randomize_layout_seed.h.
It remains after a make clean to allow for external modules to be compiled
with the existing seed and will be removed by a make mrproper or
make distclean.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Use cacheline-aware structure randomization====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_RANDSTRUCT_PERFORMANCE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the RANDSTRUCT randomization will make a best effort
at restricting randomization to cacheline-sized groups of elements.  It
will further not randomize bitfields in structures.  This reduces the
performance hit of RANDSTRUCT at the cost of weakened randomization.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Active kernel exploit response====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_KERN_LOCKOUT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, when a PaX alert is triggered due to suspicious
activity in the kernel (from KERNEXEC/UDEREF/USERCOPY)
or an OOPS occurs due to bad memory accesses, instead of just
terminating the offending process (and potentially allowing
a subsequent exploit from the same user), we will take one of two
actions:
 If the user was root, we will panic the system
 If the user was non-root, we will log the attempt, terminate
 all processes owned by the user, then prevent them from creating
 any new processes until the system is restarted
This deters repeated kernel exploitation/bruteforcing attempts
and is useful for later forensics.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Old ARM userland compatibility====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_OLD_ARM_USERLAND&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, stubs of executable code to perform such operations
as &quot;compare-exchange&quot; will be placed at fixed locations in the ARM vector
table.  This is unfortunately needed for old ARM userland meant to run
across a wide range of processors.  Without this option enabled,
the get_tls and data memory barrier stubs will be emulated by the kernel,
which is enough for Linaro userlands or other userlands designed for v6
and newer ARM CPUs.  It's recommended that you try without this option enabled
first, and only enable it if your userland does not boot (it will likely fail
at init time).&lt;/pre&gt;

===Role Based Access Control Options===

====Disable RBAC system====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_NO_RBAC&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the /dev/grsec device will be removed from the kernel,
preventing the RBAC system from being enabled.  You should only say Y
here if you have no intention of using the RBAC system, so as to prevent
an attacker with root access from misusing the RBAC system to hide files
and processes when loadable module support and /dev/[k]mem have been
locked down.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Hide kernel processes====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_ACL_HIDEKERN&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, all kernel threads will be hidden to all
processes but those whose subject has the &quot;view hidden processes&quot;
flag.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Maximum tries before password lockout====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_ACL_MAXTRIES&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;This option enforces the maximum number of times a user can attempt
to authorize themselves with the grsecurity RBAC system before being
denied the ability to attempt authorization again for a specified time.
The lower the number, the harder it will be to brute-force a password.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Time to wait after max password tries, in seconds====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_ACL_TIMEOUT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;This option specifies the time the user must wait after attempting to
authorize to the RBAC system with the maximum number of invalid
passwords.  The higher the number, the harder it will be to brute-force
a password.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Filesystem Protections===

====Proc restrictions====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_PROC&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the permissions of the /proc filesystem
will be altered to enhance system security and privacy.  You MUST
choose either a user only restriction or a user and group restriction.
Depending upon the option you choose, you can either restrict users to
see only the processes they themselves run, or choose a group that can
view all processes and files normally restricted to root if you choose
the &quot;restrict to user only&quot; option.  NOTE: If you're running identd or
ntpd as a non-root user, you will have to run it as the group you
specify here.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Restrict /proc to user only====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_PROC_USER&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, non-root users will only be able to view their own
processes, and restricts them from viewing network-related information,
and viewing kernel symbol and module information.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Allow special group====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_PROC_USERGROUP&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, you will be able to select a group that will be
able to view all processes and network-related information.  If you've
enabled GRKERNSEC_HIDESYM, kernel and symbol information may still
remain hidden.  This option is useful if you want to run identd as
a non-root user.  The group you select may also be chosen at boot time
via &quot;grsec_proc_gid=&quot; on the kernel commandline.&lt;/pre&gt;

====GID exempted from /proc restrictions====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_PROC_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Setting this GID determines which group will be exempted from
grsecurity's /proc restrictions, allowing users of the specified
group  to view network statistics and the existence of other users'
processes on the system.  This GID may also be chosen at boot time
via &quot;grsec_proc_gid=&quot; on the kernel commandline.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Additional restrictions====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_PROC_ADD&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, additional restrictions will be placed on
/proc that keep normal users from viewing device information and 
slabinfo information that could be useful for exploits.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Linking restrictions====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_LINK&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.linking_restrictions&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, /tmp race exploits will be prevented, since users
will no longer be able to follow symlinks owned by other users in
world-writable +t directories (e.g. /tmp), unless the owner of the
symlink is the owner of the directory. users will also not be
able to hardlink to files they do not own.  If the sysctl option is
enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;linking_restrictions&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Kernel-enforced SymlinksIfOwnerMatch====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SYMLINKOWN&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.enforce_symlinksifowner&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.symlinkown_gid&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Apache's SymlinksIfOwnerMatch option has an inherent race condition
that prevents it from being used as a security feature.  As Apache
verifies the symlink by performing a stat() against the target of
the symlink before it is followed, an attacker can setup a symlink
to point to a same-owned file, then replace the symlink with one
that targets another user's file just after Apache &quot;validates&quot; the
symlink -- a classic TOCTOU race.  If you say Y here, a complete,
race-free replacement for Apache's &quot;SymlinksIfOwnerMatch&quot; option
will be in place for the group you specify. If the sysctl option
is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;enforce_symlinksifowner&quot; is
created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====GID for users with kernel-enforced SymlinksIfOwnerMatch====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SYMLINKOWN_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Setting this GID determines what group kernel-enforced
SymlinksIfOwnerMatch will be enabled for.  If the sysctl option
is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;symlinkown_gid&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====FIFO restrictions====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_FIFO&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.fifo_restrictions&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, users will not be able to write to FIFOs they don't
own in world-writable +t directories (e.g. /tmp), unless the owner of
the FIFO is the same owner of the directory it's held in.  If the sysctl
option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;fifo_restrictions&quot; is
created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Sysfs/debugfs restriction====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SYSFS_RESTRICT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, sysfs (the pseudo-filesystem mounted at /sys) and
any filesystem normally mounted under it (e.g. debugfs) will be
mostly accessible only by root.  These filesystems generally provide access
to hardware and debug information that isn't appropriate for unprivileged
users of the system.  Sysfs and debugfs have also become a large source
of new vulnerabilities, ranging from infoleaks to local compromise.
There has been very little oversight with an eye toward security involved
in adding new exporters of information to these filesystems, so their
use is discouraged.
For reasons of compatibility, a few directories have been whitelisted
for access by non-root users:
/sys/fs/selinux
/sys/fs/fuse
/sys/devices/system/cpu&lt;/pre&gt;

====Runtime read-only mount protection====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_ROFS&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.romount_protect&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, a sysctl option with name &quot;romount_protect&quot; will
be created.  By setting this option to 1 at runtime, filesystems
will be protected in the following ways:
* No new writable mounts will be allowed
* Existing read-only mounts won't be able to be remounted read/write
* Write operations will be denied on all block devices
This option acts independently of grsec_lock: once it is set to 1,
it cannot be turned off.  Therefore, please be mindful of the resulting
behavior if this option is enabled in an init script on a read-only
filesystem.
Also be aware that as with other root-focused features, GRKERNSEC_KMEM
and GRKERNSEC_IO should be enabled and module loading disabled via
config or at runtime.
This feature is mainly intended for secure embedded systems.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Eliminate stat/notify-based device sidechannels====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_DEVICE_SIDECHANNEL&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, timing analyses on block or character
devices like /dev/ptmx using stat or inotify/dnotify/fanotify
will be thwarted for unprivileged users.  If a process without
CAP_MKNOD stats such a device, the last access and last modify times
will match the device's create time.  No access or modify events
will be triggered through inotify/dnotify/fanotify for such devices.
This feature will prevent attacks that may at a minimum
allow an attacker to determine the administrator's password length.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Chroot jail restrictions====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, you will be able to choose several options that will
make breaking out of a chrooted jail much more difficult.  If you
encounter no software incompatibilities with the following options, it
is recommended that you enable each one.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny mounts====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_MOUNT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_mount&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to
mount or remount filesystems.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a
sysctl option with name &quot;chroot_deny_mount&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny double-chroots====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_DOUBLE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_chroot&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to chroot
again outside the chroot.  This is a widely used method of breaking
out of a chroot jail and should not be allowed.  If the sysctl 
option is enabled, a sysctl option with name 
&quot;chroot_deny_chroot&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny pivot_root in chroot====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_PIVOT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_pivot&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to use
a function called pivot_root() that was introduced in Linux 2.3.41.  It
works similar to chroot in that it changes the root filesystem.  This
function could be misused in a chrooted process to attempt to break out
of the chroot, and therefore should not be allowed.  If the sysctl
option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;chroot_deny_pivot&quot; is
created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Enforce chdir(&quot;/&quot;)====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CHDIR&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_enforce_chdir&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the current working directory of all newly-chrooted
applications will be set to the the root directory of the chroot.
The man page on chroot(2) states:
Note that usually chhroot does not change  the  current  working
directory,  so  that `.' can be outside the tree rooted at
`/'.  In particular, the  super-user  can  escape  from  a
`chroot jail' by doing `mkdir foo; chroot foo; cd ..'.

It is recommended that you say Y here, since it's not known to break
any software.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with
name &quot;chroot_enforce_chdir&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny (f)chmod +s====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CHMOD&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_chmod&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to chmod
or fchmod files to make them have suid or sgid bits.  This protects
against another published method of breaking a chroot.  If the sysctl
option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;chroot_deny_chmod&quot; is
created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny fchdir out of chroot====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_FCHDIR&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_fchdir&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, a well-known method of breaking chroots by fchdir'ing
to a file descriptor of the chrooting process that points to a directory
outside the filesystem will be stopped.  If the sysctl option
is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;chroot_deny_fchdir&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny mknod====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_MKNOD&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_mknod&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be allowed to
mknod.  The problem with using mknod inside a chroot is that it
would allow an attacker to create a device entry that is the same
as one on the physical root of your system, which could range from
anything from the console device to a device for your harddrive (which
they could then use to wipe the drive or steal data).  It is recommended
that you say Y here, unless you run into software incompatibilities.
If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
&quot;chroot_deny_mknod&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny shmat() out of chroot====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_SHMAT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_shmat&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to attach
to shared memory segments that were created outside of the chroot jail.
It is recommended that you say Y here.  If the sysctl option is enabled,
a sysctl option with name &quot;chroot_deny_shmat&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny access to abstract AF_UNIX sockets out of chroot====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_UNIX&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_unix&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to
connect to abstract (meaning not belonging to a filesystem) Unix
domain sockets that were bound outside of a chroot.  It is recommended
that you say Y here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
with name &quot;chroot_deny_unix&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Protect outside processes====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_FINDTASK&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_findtask&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to
kill, send signals with fcntl, ptrace, capget, getpgid, setpgid, 
getsid, or view any process outside of the chroot.  If the sysctl
option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;chroot_findtask&quot; is
created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Restrict priority changes====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_NICE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_restrict_nice&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to raise
the priority of processes in the chroot, or alter the priority of
processes outside the chroot.  This provides more security than simply
removing CAP_SYS_NICE from the process' capability set.  If the
sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;chroot_restrict_nice&quot;
is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny sysctl writes====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_SYSCTL&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_sysctl&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, an attacker in a chroot will not be able to
write to sysctl entries, either by sysctl(2) or through a /proc
interface.  It is strongly recommended that you say Y here. If the
sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
&quot;chroot_deny_sysctl&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Capability restrictions====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CAPS&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_caps&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the capabilities on all processes within a
chroot jail will be lowered to stop module insertion, raw i/o,
system and net admin tasks, rebooting the system, modifying immutable
files, modifying IPC owned by another, and changing the system time.
This is left an option because it can break some apps.  Disable this
if your chrooted apps are having problems performing those kinds of
tasks.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with
name &quot;chroot_caps&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Exempt initrd tasks from restrictions====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_INITRD&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, tasks started prior to init will be exempted from
grsecurity's chroot restrictions.  This option is mainly meant to
resolve Plymouth's performing privileged operations unnecessarily
in a chroot.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Kernel Auditing===

====Single group for auditing====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_GROUP&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.audit_gid&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.audit_group&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the exec and chdir logging features will only operate
on a group you specify.  This option is recommended if you only want to
watch certain users instead of having a large amount of logs from the
entire system.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with
name &quot;audit_group&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====GID for auditing====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

====Exec logging====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_EXECLOG&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.exec_logging&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, all execve() calls will be logged (since the
other exec*() calls are frontends to execve(), all execution
will be logged).  Useful for shell-servers that like to keep track
of their users.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with
name &quot;exec_logging&quot; is created.
WARNING: This option when enabled will produce a LOT of logs, especially
on an active system.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Resource logging====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_RESLOG&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.resource_logging&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, all attempts to overstep resource limits will
be logged with the resource name, the requested size, and the current
limit.  It is highly recommended that you say Y here.  If the sysctl
option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;resource_logging&quot; is
created.  If the RBAC system is enabled, the sysctl value is ignored.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Log execs within chroot====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_EXECLOG&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.chroot_execlog&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, all executions inside a chroot jail will be logged
to syslog.  This can cause a large amount of logs if certain
applications (eg. djb's daemontools) are installed on the system, and
is therefore left as an option.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a
sysctl option with name &quot;chroot_execlog&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Ptrace logging====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_PTRACE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.audit_ptrace&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, all attempts to attach to a process via ptrace
will be logged.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
with name &quot;audit_ptrace&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Chdir logging====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_CHDIR&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.audit_chdir&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, all chdir() calls will be logged.  If the sysctl
option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;audit_chdir&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====(Un)Mount logging====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_MOUNT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.audit_mount&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, all mounts and unmounts will be logged.  If the
sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;audit_mount&quot; is
created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Signal logging====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SIGNAL&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.signal_logging&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, certain important signals will be logged, such as
SIGSEGV, which will as a result inform you of when a error in a program
occurred, which in some cases could mean a possible exploit attempt.
If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
&quot;signal_logging&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Fork failure logging====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_FORKFAIL&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.forkfail_logging&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, all failed fork() attempts will be logged.
This could suggest a fork bomb, or someone attempting to overstep
their process limit.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
with name &quot;forkfail_logging&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Time change logging====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_TIME&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.timechange_logging&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, any changes of the system clock will be logged.
If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
&quot;timechange_logging&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/ipaddr support====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_PROC_IPADDR&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, a new entry will be added to each /proc/&lt;pid&gt;
directory that contains the IP address of the person using the task.
The IP is carried across local TCP and AF_UNIX stream sockets.
This information can be useful for IDS/IPSes to perform remote response
to a local attack.  The entry is readable by only the owner of the
process (and root if he has CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, which can be removed via
the RBAC system), and thus does not create privacy concerns.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Denied RWX mmap/mprotect logging====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_RWXMAP_LOG&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.rwxmap_logging&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, calls to mmap() and mprotect() with explicit
usage of PROT_WRITE and PROT_EXEC together will be logged when
denied by the PAX_MPROTECT feature.  This feature will also
log other problematic scenarios that can occur when PAX_MPROTECT
is enabled on a binary, like textrels and PT_GNU_STACK.  If the 
sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;rwxmap_logging&quot;
is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Executable Protections===

====Dmesg(8) restriction====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_DMESG&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.dmesg&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, non-root users will not be able to use dmesg(8)
to view the contents of the kernel's circular log buffer.
The kernel's log buffer often contains kernel addresses and other
identifying information useful to an attacker in fingerprinting a
system for a targeted exploit.
If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;dmesg&quot; is
created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deter ptrace-based process snooping====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_HARDEN_PTRACE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.harden_ptrace&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, TTY sniffers and other malicious monitoring
programs implemented through ptrace will be defeated.  If you
have been using the RBAC system, this option has already been
enabled for several years for all users, with the ability to make
fine-grained exceptions.

This option only affects the ability of non-root users to ptrace
processes that are not a descendent of the ptracing process.
This means that strace ./binary and gdb ./binary will still work,
but attaching to arbitrary processes will not.  If the sysctl
option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;harden_ptrace&quot; is
created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Require read access to ptrace sensitive binaries====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_PTRACE_READEXEC&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.ptrace_readexec&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, unprivileged users will not be able to ptrace unreadable
binaries.  This option is useful in environments that
remove the read bits (e.g. file mode 4711) from suid binaries to
prevent infoleaking of their contents.  This option adds
consistency to the use of that file mode, as the binary could normally
be read out when run without privileges while ptracing.

If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;ptrace_readexec&quot;
is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Enforce consistent multithreaded privileges====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SETXID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.consistent_setxid&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, a change from a root uid to a non-root uid
in a multithreaded application will cause the resulting uids,
gids, supplementary groups, and capabilities in that thread
to be propagated to the other threads of the process.  In most
cases this is unnecessary, as glibc will emulate this behavior
on behalf of the application.  Other libcs do not act in the
same way, allowing the other threads of the process to continue
running with root privileges.  If the sysctl option is enabled,
a sysctl option with name &quot;consistent_setxid&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Disallow access to overly-permissive IPC objects====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_HARDEN_IPC&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.harden_ipc&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, access to overly-permissive IPC objects (shared
memory, message queues, and semaphores) will be denied for processes
given the following criteria beyond normal permission checks:
1) If the IPC object is world-accessible and the euid doesn't match
   that of the creator or current uid for the IPC object
2) If the IPC object is group-accessible and the egid doesn't
   match that of the creator or current gid for the IPC object
It's a common error to grant too much permission to these objects,
with impact ranging from denial of service and information leaking to
privilege escalation.  This feature was developed in response to
research by Tim Brown:
http://labs.portcullis.co.uk/whitepapers/memory-squatting-attacks-on-system-v-shared-memory/
who found hundreds of such insecure usages.  Processes with
CAP_IPC_OWNER are still permitted to access these IPC objects.
If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
&quot;harden_ipc&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Trusted Path Execution (TPE)====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_TPE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.tpe&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.tpe_gid&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a gid to add to the
supplementary groups of users you want to mark as &quot;untrusted.&quot;
These users will not be able to execute any files that are not in
root-owned directories writable only by root.  If the sysctl option
is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;tpe&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Partially restrict all non-root users====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_TPE_ALL&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.tpe_restrict_all&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, all non-root users will be covered under
a weaker TPE restriction.  This is separate from, and in addition to,
the main TPE options that you have selected elsewhere.  Thus, if a
&quot;trusted&quot; GID is chosen, this restriction applies to even that GID.
Under this restriction, all non-root users will only be allowed to
execute files in directories they own that are not group or
world-writable, or in directories owned by root and writable only by
root.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
&quot;tpe_restrict_all&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Invert GID option====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_TPE_INVERT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.tpe_invert&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the group you specify in the TPE configuration will
decide what group TPE restrictions will be *disabled* for.  This
option is useful if you want TPE restrictions to be applied to most
users on the system.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
with name &quot;tpe_invert&quot; is created.  Unlike other sysctl options, this
entry will default to on for backward-compatibility.&lt;/pre&gt;

====GID for TPE-untrusted users====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_TPE_UNTRUSTED_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Setting this GID determines what group TPE restrictions will be
*enabled* for.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
with name &quot;tpe_gid&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====GID for TPE-trusted users====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_TPE_TRUSTED_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Setting this GID determines what group TPE restrictions will be
*disabled* for.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
with name &quot;tpe_gid&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Network Protections===

====Larger entropy pools====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_RANDNET&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, the entropy pools used for many features of Linux
and grsecurity will be doubled in size.  Since several grsecurity
features use additional randomness, it is recommended that you say Y
here.  Saying Y here has a similar effect as modifying
/proc/sys/kernel/random/poolsize.&lt;/pre&gt;

====TCP/UDP blackhole and LAST_ACK DoS prevention====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_BLACKHOLE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.ip_blackhole&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.lastack_retries&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, neither TCP resets nor ICMP
destination-unreachable packets will be sent in response to packets
sent to ports for which no associated listening process exists.
This feature supports both IPV4 and IPV6 and exempts the 
loopback interface from blackholing.  Enabling this feature 
makes a host more resilient to DoS attacks and reduces network
visibility against scanners.

The blackhole feature as-implemented is equivalent to the FreeBSD
blackhole feature, as it prevents RST responses to all packets, not
just SYNs.  Under most application behavior this causes no
problems, but applications (like haproxy) may not close certain
connections in a way that cleanly terminates them on the remote
end, leaving the remote host in LAST_ACK state.  Because of this
side-effect and to prevent intentional LAST_ACK DoSes, this
feature also adds automatic mitigation against such attacks.
The mitigation drastically reduces the amount of time a socket
can spend in LAST_ACK state.  If you're using haproxy and not
all servers it connects to have this option enabled, consider
disabling this feature on the haproxy host.

If the sysctl option is enabled, two sysctl options with names
&quot;ip_blackhole&quot; and &quot;lastack_retries&quot; will be created.
While &quot;ip_blackhole&quot; takes the standard zero/non-zero on/off
toggle, &quot;lastack_retries&quot; uses the same kinds of values as
&quot;tcp_retries1&quot; and &quot;tcp_retries2&quot;.  The default value of 4
prevents a socket from lasting more than 45 seconds in LAST_ACK
state.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Disable TCP Simultaneous Connect====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_NO_SIMULT_CONNECT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, a feature by Willy Tarreau will be enabled that
removes a weakness in Linux's strict implementation of TCP that
allows two clients to connect to each other without either entering
a listening state.  The weakness allows an attacker to easily prevent
a client from connecting to a known server provided the source port
for the connection is guessed correctly.

As the weakness could be used to prevent an antivirus or IPS from
fetching updates, or prevent an SSL gateway from fetching a CRL,
it should be eliminated by enabling this option.  Though Linux is
one of few operating systems supporting simultaneous connect, it
has no legitimate use in practice and is rarely supported by firewalls.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Socket restrictions====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SOCKET&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, you will be able to choose from several options.
If you assign a GID on your system and add it to the supplementary
groups of users you want to restrict socket access to, this patch
will perform up to three things, based on the option(s) you choose.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny any sockets to group====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_ALL&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.socket_all&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.socket_all_gid&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a GID of whose users will
be unable to connect to other hosts from your machine or run server
applications from your machine.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a
sysctl option with name &quot;socket_all&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====GID to deny all sockets for====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_ALL_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Here you can choose the GID to disable socket access for. Remember to
add the users you want socket access disabled for to the GID
specified here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
with name &quot;socket_all_gid&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny client sockets to group====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_CLIENT&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.socket_client&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.socket_client_gid&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a GID of whose users will
be unable to connect to other hosts from your machine, but will be
able to run servers.  If this option is enabled, all users in the group
you specify will have to use passive mode when initiating ftp transfers
from the shell on your machine.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a
sysctl option with name &quot;socket_client&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====GID to deny client sockets for====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_CLIENT_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Here you can choose the GID to disable client socket access for.
Remember to add the users you want client socket access disabled for to
the GID specified here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl
option with name &quot;socket_client_gid&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Deny server sockets to group====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_SERVER&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.socket_server&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.socket_server_gid&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a GID of whose users will
be unable to run server applications from your machine.  If the sysctl
option is enabled, a sysctl option with name &quot;socket_server&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

====GID to deny server sockets for====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SOCKET_SERVER_GID&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Here you can choose the GID to disable server socket access for.
Remember to add the users you want server socket access disabled for to
the GID specified here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl
option with name &quot;socket_server_gid&quot; is created.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Physical Protections===

====Deny new USB connections after toggle====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_DENYUSB&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Related sysctl variables:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;kernel.grsecurity.deny_new_usb&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, a new sysctl option with name &quot;deny_new_usb&quot;
will be created.  Setting its value to 1 will prevent any new
USB devices from being recognized by the OS.  Any attempted USB
device insertion will be logged.  This option is intended to be
used against custom USB devices designed to exploit vulnerabilities
in various USB device drivers.

For greatest effectiveness, this sysctl should be set after any
relevant init scripts.  This option is safe to enable in distros
as each user can choose whether or not to toggle the sysctl.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Reject all USB devices not connected at boot====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_DENYUSB_FORCE&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, a variant of GRKERNSEC_DENYUSB will be enabled
that doesn't involve a sysctl entry.  This option should only be
enabled if you're sure you want to deny all new USB connections
at runtime and don't want to modify init scripts.  This should not
be enabled by distros.  It forces the core USB code to be built
into the kernel image so that all devices connected at boot time
can be recognized and new USB device connections can be prevented
prior to init running.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Sysctl Support===

====Sysctl support====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SYSCTL&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, you will be able to change the options that
grsecurity runs with at bootup, without having to recompile your
kernel.  You can echo values to files in /proc/sys/kernel/grsecurity
to enable (1) or disable (0) various features.  All the sysctl entries
are mutable until the &quot;grsec_lock&quot; entry is set to a non-zero value.
All features enabled in the kernel configuration are disabled at boot
if you do not say Y to the &quot;Turn on features by default&quot; option.
All options should be set at startup, and the grsec_lock entry should
be set to a non-zero value after all the options are set.
*THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT*&lt;/pre&gt;

====Extra sysctl support for distro makers (READ HELP)====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SYSCTL_DISTRO&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, additional sysctl options will be created
for features that affect processes running as root.  Therefore,
it is critical when using this option that the grsec_lock entry be
enabled after boot.  Only distros with prebuilt kernel packages
with this option enabled that can ensure grsec_lock is enabled
after boot should use this option.
*Failure to set grsec_lock after boot makes all grsec features
this option covers useless*

Currently this option creates the following sysctl entries:
&quot;Disable Privileged I/O&quot;: &quot;disable_priv_io&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

====Turn on features by default====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_SYSCTL_ON&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;If you say Y here, instead of having all features enabled in the
kernel configuration disabled at boot time, the features will be
enabled at boot time.  It is recommended you say Y here unless
there is some reason you would want all sysctl-tunable features to
be disabled by default.  As mentioned elsewhere, it is important
to enable the grsec_lock entry once you have finished modifying
the sysctl entries.&lt;/pre&gt;

===Logging Options===

====Seconds in between log messages (minimum)====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_FLOODTIME&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;This option allows you to enforce the number of seconds between
grsecurity log messages.  The default should be suitable for most
people, however, if you choose to change it, choose a value small enough
to allow informative logs to be produced, but large enough to
prevent flooding.

Setting both this value and GRKERNSEC_FLOODBURST to 0 will disable
any rate limiting on grsecurity log messages.&lt;/pre&gt;

====Number of messages in a burst (maximum)====
&lt;tt&gt;GRKERNSEC_FLOODBURST&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;This option allows you to choose the maximum number of messages allowed
within the flood time interval you chose in a separate option.  The
default should be suitable for most people, however if you find that
many of your logs are being interpreted as flooding, you may want to
raise this value.

Setting both this value and GRKERNSEC_FLOODTIME to 0 will disable
any rate limiting on grsecurity log messages.&lt;/pre&gt;

This table lists all standard [[w:Linux|Linux]] capabilities and one special capability related to grsecurity. With capabilities, the system is divided into logical groups that may be individually granted to, or removed from, different processes. See [[../../The RBAC System#Capability Restrictions|Capability Restrictions]] for more information.

| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''CAP_ALL'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|CAP_ALL is not a real capability, but was coded into &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; to represent all capabilities. Therefore to denote dropping of all capabilities, but CAP_SETUID, -CAP_ALL and +CAP_SETUID would be used.
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''CAP_CHOWN'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|In a system with the [_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED] option defined, this overrides the restriction of changing file ownership and group ownership.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting Help ==
If the information in the [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]] section doesn't help you, the Toppy has active and helpful user forums.  For the UK models (5800, 5800t and 5810 and others), the best place to get help will be the UK user forums at [http://forum.toppy.org.uk forum.toppy.org.uk].
; Using the forums effectively :
Please bear in mind that the helpful people on the forums read and post in their spare time - they're not paid to do it!  Before you post your question, '''''please''''' search the forum to see whether your question has already been answered.  (The forum does have its own search facility, but you may find it more effective to use Google, including &quot;''site:forum.toppy.org.uk''&quot; in your [http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aforum.toppy.org.uk search].)  

If you still can't find an answer to your question, the following tips will help others to help you. 
*Post in the appropriate forum discussion area. 
*Be specific, and include as much information as possible related to your question.  
*Include information about your Toppy and setup:  The answer to your question may depend on '''''exactly''''' what you're running.  Please '''don't''' say you're running &quot;the latest&quot; firmware, because you'll just get a reply to say that various versions of firmware could be considered &quot;the latest&quot;, so it's an unhelpful statement to say the least - and anyway, latest is very definitely not necessarily best in this instance.  See below for how to find and report what you're ACTUALLY running.  

If people trying to help you make the wrong assumptions, the advice you receive may be just plain wrong, and could result in you doing things to your Toppy that may be potentially frustrating and time-consuming to recover from.  In other cases, something you hadn't thought of as being relevant may be precisely the thing that somebody else recognises as crucial to your issue.  Either way, the more basic information you make available on the forum, the more effectively and quickly people will be able to help you.  
; Save time and get more targeted help with a signature :
The most effective way to include the basic information about your setup (and save you forgetting something or endlessly repeating yourself) is to set up a signature.  To do this, click on the Profile link at the top of the forum page and scroll about halfway down where you'll see the signature box.  
Type or paste in here information about your Toppy.  As a rule, you should include at least the following information:
*Your Toppy model (e.g. 5800, 5800t, 5810, etc.)
*Your firmware version and patches 
''(To find your firmware version, press '''Menu''' and then choose '''Information''', '''System Info''' and report the '''Software''' version, or see '''MyInfo''' below for an easy way to find this out plus more detail on which patches are installed - NB: Most of the toppy.org.uk site's recommended firmware include a number of pre-installed patches)''
*TAPs - if any - run from Autostart and their version numbers
*PC/Toppy connection setup if &quot;unusual&quot;.  A number of Windows XP/Vista tools are available to connect to and use with a Toppy.  The general assumption will tend to be that you run Windows.  Clearly, although the majority still do, an increasing number of people don't. If your sig tells people your only PC runs *nix, 64-bit Windows or something else, people can point you to the appropriate alternatives instead.  

See below for information on the '''MyInfo''' TAP which can generate an accurate signature for you by scanning your Toppy for information.  

Just below the signature box, in the '''Preferences''' section, change the setting for “Always attach my signature” to Yes, or nobody will see your signature and all your efforts will have been wasted. 

[[File:Always_attach_my_signature.jpg]]
 
; MyInfo – making it even easier :
The easiest way to get most of the useful information about your Toppy for your signature is to install and run EMJB's excellent MyInfo TAP.  This can either be run interactively to show the information on the screen, or can run silently and automatically on startup.  In both cases it will generate a text log file which you can copy back to your PC.  (You will not be able to see or read the log file using the Toppy user interface.)  Included in this log file is a suggested signature to use on the forums which includes all the information above.  Simply select this section of the log and paste it into the signature box in your Profile.  You don't necessarily need to understand all the information in the signature for it to be useful to people trying to help you!  

To install MyInfo, download the zip file from the link in the first post of the MyInfo [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=175844&amp;sid=7caf607d6549bbc4299c6f8627750ddf forum thread].

Extract all the files from the zip, and use Altair (or whatever you normally use to connect your PC to the Toppy) to copy MyInfo.tap from your PC over to /ProgramFiles/Auto Start on the Toppy. Once you have done this, each time you reboot (i.e. start up the Toppy), MyInfo will wait for a minute to allow other TAPs to start.  Then it will run, create a log file, and exit without showing anything on the screen. You can also run MyInfo interactively.  If you run it more than two minutes after your Toppy has started up, it will display information about your Toppy on the screen as well as creating the log.  

The log file created (MyInfo Log.txt) will be stored in ProgramFiles/Logs, and you can copy that back to your PC also using Altair or your normal connection method. The suggested signature is at the end of the log, and you can add other useful information to your signature too (within the limit on the total number of characters in a signature, of course).

Here are very simple and very delicious cookies!

== Ingredients ==
*1 cup of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]].
*2 sticks (1 cup) of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]].
*3 cups of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]].

== Optional==
*Chocolate chips.
*Oats.

== Procedure ==
#Melt the butter
#Mix the butter and sugar.
#Then add the flour to the butter and sugar.
#Mix them all up until you have a thick dough.
#Make the shape of the that you want the cookies to be out of the dough.
#Heat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and put the cookies in the oven.
#Wait until the cookies are a golden colour and are hard then take them out.

You might like your cookies with chocolate chips or oats in them...perhaps even both! So to do that all you have to do is add the chocolate chips or oats to the dough you have at the end of step number 4. Then mix some more...and then you do just the same as in step number 5 and continue do exactly the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This textbook, ''Constructivism &amp; Technology: Transforming Schools &amp; Classrooms'', is initiated as a collaborative writing project for a Webster University graduate course on constructivism and technology. 

The first edition of this textbook was developed in the Spring 2009 semester. Instructors were Dr. Roy Tamashiro and Dr. Mary Beckmann. The 10 graduate students in the course were the primary authors, editors, and quiz builders. 

The aim of the course was to learn ''about'' the theory, research and applications of constructivism and technology by ''doing'' constructivism in the course. The development of this WikiBook was the primary methodology for reading about constructivism, dialoguing about it, applying it to other teaching / learning situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 3: Authentic Learning &amp; Instruction'''

===Overview ===

According to author Marilyn M. Lombardi (2007), authentic learning is not a new concept.  In fact, authentic learning is an old concept that has been around long since the time when apprentice-mentor relationships were the leading method of job or trade training.  In the next few sections of this chapter, we will define authentic learning and “real-world” learning and investigate examples of each, discuss why authentic learning is a key concept in Constructivist theory, and discuss the relationship between authentic learning and technology.

===What Is Authentic Learning? / What Is &quot;Real-World&quot; Learning? ===


Author Sean Cavanaugh (2004) defines “real-world” learning as “experiential” learning.  According to the Encarta Dictionary (n.d.), “experiential” learning is learning “derived from or relating to experience as opposed to other methods of acquiring knowledge” (Encarta Dictionary online, n.d.).  “Real-world” learning experiences include service learning, apprenticeship, cooperative learning, job-shadowing, and internship experiences (Cavanaugh, 2004).    As mentioned above, Lombardi (2007) reports that in earlier times, “real-world” learning experiences, such as apprenticeships, were one of the most popular means of knowledge acquisition, but things changed during the 19th century when the number of individuals interested in learning increased significantly.  During this time, “real-world” learning experiences, such as apprenticeships, became nearly impossible to implement due to the complexity and steep expense associated with meeting the “real-world” experience demands of so many students.  Moreover, the hazards associated with supervising amateurs on the job made “real-world” learning even more complicated to manage and implement.  After examining this issue from a variety of different angles, experts from the educational realm concluded that the usefulness and importance of “real-world” learning should not be inhibited by these impracticalities, and that students could achieve an equivalent level of authenticity in situated authentic learning experiences (Lombardi, 2007).  

Authentic learning is defined as learning that is seamlessly integrated or implanted into meaningful, “real-life” situations (Jonassen, Howland, Marra, &amp; Crismond, 2008), and Dr. Imran A. Zualkernan (2004), insists that authentic learning situations are a safe and situated “surrogate” for “real-world” learning experiences (Zualkernan, 2004, p. 3).   In authentic learning, learners are presented with realistic problems or projects that have realistic purposes and given the opportunity to investigate and converse about these problems and projects in manners that are applicable to them and their lives (Carlson, 2002; Mims, 2003).  Jonassen et al. (2008) contend that this type of learning exists in stark contrast to traditional classroom learning where, often for the sake of time, ideas and concepts are frequently extracted from their original, real-world contexts and presented to the learners as isolated facts to be memorized.  These authors (Jonassen et al., 2008) suggest that this extraction devalues learning because it destroys the relative prompts that make the ideas and concepts significant to the students and their lives.  Experts (Herrington &amp; Kervin, 2007) also contend that assessment should be authentic, or embedded directly into authentic, realistic learning experiences, instead of being administered as an independent quiz or test in an isolated context.  Examples of authentic assessment include learning/reflection journals, traditional or electronic portfolios, and rubric-guided performance assessment task (Herrington &amp; Kervin, 2007).  

According to Audrey C. Rule (2006), in recent years, many education professionals have made an effort to investigate and define authentic learning and the fundamental principles upon which it is based.  She has read much of their work in her own investigations of authentic learning and concludes that there are four broad principles that characterize authentic learning, regardless of discipline.  These four principles state that authentic learning experiences should 1) focus on practical, lifelike problems that imitate the trade of experts in the field with communication of results to individuals outside the classroom, 2) be inquiry-based with an emphasis on metacognitive skills, 3) encourage learners to participate in active conversations in a social learning environment, and 4) allow learners make choices and guide their own learning in meaningful, task-oriented work (Rule, 2006).

Authentic learning manifests itself in many forms and fashions, and it occurs across age groups and disciplines.  Examples of authentic learning include problem-based, project-based, inquiry-based, role-playing/simulation based, case study-based, and critical incident-based learning experiences (Lombardi, 2007; Zualkernan, 2004).  For example, nursing students experience authentic learning when they read case studies and create care plans for hypothetical patients.  In correlation with these ideas, Lombardi (2007) reports about a simulation/role-playing activity where graduate business students participate in an online simulation that allows them to interact with one another and pretend to be decision makers in a global company.

===Rationale for Using Authentic Learning in the Constructivist Classroom ===

As we have discussed in previous chapters, one of the major beliefs of Constructivist theory is that learning is an active and social procedure in which learners use their prior knowledge as a basis for constructing new knowledge (Educational Broadcasting Corporation, 2004). According to Peter C. Honebein (1996), integrating learning into realistic and meaningful contexts is one of the major objectives of Constructivist instructional designers.  Therefore, in correspondence with these ideas, authentic learning is a key concept in Constructivist theory because authentic learning methods/environments help accomplish the monumental task of connecting new knowledge to existing knowledge by encouraging students to make direct connections between their new learning and the real world in which they live (Carlson, 2002; Mims, 2003).  According to Zaulkernan (2004), “authentic learning experiences… are situations that allow a learner to create their own personal knowledge in a particular task environment,” (Zaulkernan, 2004, p. 3).

===Authentic Learning and Technology ===

According to Jan Herrington and Lisa Kervin (2007), when it comes to technology, teachers often have good intentions but are frequently pressured into using technology within the classroom for a variety of misguided reasons.  These reasons range from stressful administrative demands to the sheer convenience of having a multitude of new and exciting technological tools readily available.  Herrington and Kervin also argue that technology is often misused in the classroom when teachers depend upon technology only to deliver information to the students or when teachers focus instruction solely on teaching students to use the technologies in and of themselves.  However, these authors contend that technology can be a very powerful “cognitive tool” when used in the right capacity and that rather than being used as a vehicle to transport information to the students, technology can and should be used to aid students in examining and understanding their learning in authentic learning environments (Herrington &amp; Kervin, 2007. p. 220).  For example, Herrington and Kervin (2007) report about an elementary ELL teacher who had her ELL students practice using English to plan a trip to Australia.  In this lesson, the students used online “discussion forums and chat spaces” to communicate in English with Australian students around their same age (Herrington &amp; Kervin, 2007, p. 223-224).  

The North Dakota Teaching with Technology (TWT) Initiative (2003) further supports these notions by adding that technology enhances authentic learning by giving learners access to reliable, first-hand information for investigation and analysis, by allowing learners to network with their peers as well as specialists in a given field, and by providing learners with a way to communicate their learning to a larger real-world audience outside the classroom.  For example, Herrington and Kervin (2007) report about a tenth grade geography teacher who had his students use the Internet and other computer-based resources along with a physical field experience to investigate some solutions to several of the environmental problems, such as an increase of rats and mosquitoes, associated with the Sydney Olympic Park that was built for the 2000 Olympics.  At the close of this unit, the students presented their findings to a group of recreational officials who were working to solve these problems (Herrington &amp; Kervin, 2007).    

Lombardi (2007) agrees with these ideas, and she contends that today’s technological resources can make authentic learning more practical and easier to implement than ever before.  Lombardi acknowledges that it can often be tough to put authentic learning methods into practice because many authentic learning experiences are too costly, hazardous, and/or complex to actually implement in the classroom.  However, she maintains that technology and technological tools can be used to bridge the gap between the possible and the impossible when it comes to authentic learning.  For example,   in actuality, it is impossible for instructors to have students physically summon up tornadoes by manipulating air masses and adjusting the weather conditions, however, it is possible for them to use technology to allow students to participate in an Internet-based simulation that allows them to manage these factors in order to create a virtual tornado (see http://www.nationalgeographic.com/forcesofnature/interactive/index.html?section=t).

===Conclusion ===

Throughout this chapter, we have discovered that authentic learning is an effective instructional strategy that can be used with multiple age groups, from elementary learners to graduate-level learners, and in a variety of disciplines, from the business world and the medical field to social studies, music, and foreign language instruction.  We have also discovered that technology can enhance the authenticity of learning experiences by making the experiences more accessible to today’s students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''5: Constructivism and the Individual Learners’ Responsibilities and Leadership'''



&lt;u&gt;'''Overview'''&lt;/u&gt;



The constructivist theory argues that learners construct meaning from their experiences. In a constructivist setting, both the instructor and the learner play different roles. In the next few sections, we will examine the role of the learner in a constructivist environment.



&lt;u&gt;'''Goals of the Learner in Personal Development'''&lt;/u&gt;


The learner plays a pivotal role in the learning process. There are five dispositions that the learner should have to help them become active and autonomous learners: be inquisitive, take initiative, be confident, be inventive, and be reflective (Project Construct). First, the learner should be inquisitive. An inquisitive learner is one that asks many questions and wants to find out new information and will investigate. Second, the learner should take initiative. A learner that takes initiative is one that is able to make decisions independently and is a problem solver. Third, the learner should be confident. Confidence is important in the role of a learner because when one has to construct knowledge, one cannot be afraid to take risks and express their thoughts and ideas, and need to be able to handle frustration and disappointments. Another disposition is to be inventive. When constructing individual knowledge, it is important to be able to think about things in new ways and to transfer ideas into different contexts. The last disposition is to be reflective. Learners who reflect will more than likely use their prior experiences to direct them in new situations and experiences.



&lt;u&gt;'''Goals of the Learner in Social Development'''&lt;/u&gt;

In addition to developing personally, learners must also develop socially. This is critical in constructivism, because in a constructivist environment, the learner will work cooperatively with others. There are four goals of social development for the learner: build relationships of mutual trust and respect with adults, build relationships of mutual trust and respect with peers, consider the perspectives of others, and cooperate and collaborate as a member of a learning community (Project Construct). First, building a relationship of mutual trust and respect with adults is necessary because children need guidance and support as they work to make their own decisions. Second, building a relationship of mutual trust and respect with peers is also necessary because through peer interactions, children learn to share their ideas, negotiate, and collaborate. Third, learners should consider the perspectives of others. When they learn to consider the views of others, they are more able to respect different opinions from their own. This is important in a constructivist environment because learners must be able to work together and talk through problems and solutions as they construct their own knowledge. Finally, learners should cooperate and collaborate as a member of a learning community. When learners take part in the learning community, they are able to take risks, and recognize that they are accountable for their actions.



&lt;u&gt;'''Role of the Learner in Knowledge Building'''&lt;/u&gt;

Knowledge building is the “collective knowledge of a group through social discourse” (Hmelo-Silver and Barrows, 48). Knowledge building occurs when all learners are actively engaged, and they take responsibility not only for their own, but for other’s learning. Discourse requires the learner to take responsibility for learning what they need to know. In order for knowledge building to occur, several conditions must be in place. The learner must have a goal of improving the quality of ideas, and be able to discuss their ideas and the ideas of others, the group has a responsibility for advancing and furthering their knowledge and understanding, and everyone in the group must contribute. With these conditions in place, the learner is active and responsible for their own learning.


&lt;u&gt;'''Role of the Learner in the Classroom'''&lt;/u&gt;

In a constructivist classroom, learning is an active process. Students are actively engaged, and are responsible for their learning. According to Grennon Brooks and Brooks, the learner controls their own learning, not the teacher. In addition, the learner should give their opinions and viewpoints. Learners should also demonstrate their knowledge everyday in a variety of ways. In the classroom setting, the learner would be asking questions. They would express an interest in the activities and would initiate interactions with others. The learner also would make decisions, and be confident in their ability to share their ideas and opinions with others. In addition, the learner makes connections based on previous experience. All of these characteristics require the learner to be an active agent in the learning process, which requires a prevalent role in the classroom.


&lt;u&gt;'''Technology Tools and the Learner'''&lt;/u&gt;

Technology can be a powerful tool in assisting the learner construct knowledge. Technology tools can include, but are not limited to computers, SMARTBoards or ActiveBoards, audio clips, video clips, and software such as PowerPoint, Inspiration, iMovie, or GarageBand. These tools are designed to meet the learning styles and modes that support all learners as they work to construct knowledge (Solvie and Kloek). In addition, technology tools help learners acquire relevant information and give them opportunities to look at a variety of viewpoints so that they can construct their own knowledge (Tam).



&lt;u&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/u&gt;

The learner is key in constructivist theory. The learner must develop certain dispositions personally and socially in order to thrive in the constructivist environment. Overall, the learners are responsible for their own learning, and they control what exactly they learn. Technology is a tool that can assist the learner as they construct knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Recommendation: Increase Suction Pressure==
'''&lt;u&gt;Summary:&lt;/u&gt;'''
Increase refrigeration suction pressure to reduce compressor power and save energy. Typically, compressor power decreases 2% to 3% for every degree Fahrenheit that suction temperature increases. 

'''&lt;u&gt;When to apply:&lt;/u&gt;'''
When suction pressures are lower than needed to meet refrigeration loads, or back-pressure regulators (BPR) are used. BPRs are used to hold evaporator pressures above the suction pressure, resulting in higher evaporating temperatures.

When the evaporator approach temperature difference is excessively low due to non-product related refrigeration loads.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''

* Compressor power is directly proportional to the compression ratio [verify]
* Increasing suction pressure will decrease compression ratio
* Suction pressure is directly controlled by compressor settings

'''Preparation:'''

&lt;u&gt;Tool Required&lt;/u&gt;

* Refrigeration data sheets

&lt;u&gt;Data Required:&lt;/u&gt;

* Existing Suction Pressure - (Pressure gauges or Display)
* Temperature of cooled product - (Measure)
* Desired temperature of cooled product - (thermostat or control settings)
* BPR settings (if any)
* Compressor Performance Data - (manufacturer's specifications)

'''Special Considerations:'''
Suction pressure may be lower than needed due to high refrigeration loads. Refer to Recommendation No 6, Minimize Excess Refrigeration Loads for more information.

'''Analysis process:'''
''&lt;u&gt;Choose Target Suction Pressure&lt;/u&gt;''
A 10 degrees F approach temperature difference is recommended across the evaporators.

If the minimum evaporator approach is larger than this, consider purchasing more evaporators. Otherwise, select an appropriate suction temperature based on the desired temperature of the cooled medium and the minimum approach temperature difference with all fans operating. Back pressure regulators may have to be removed to allow an increase in suction pressure, or excess loads.

Calculate Coefficient of Performance (COP) to be reduced.

''&lt;u&gt;Get Compressor Performance Specifications&lt;/u&gt;''
Call the manufacturer of the compressor and request performance specifications for the compressor model you are analyzing. BHP and tons of refrigeration are generally available at various suction and discharge pressures.

Compressor specifications contain tables of compressor power and refrigeration capacity (usually in tons) for various suction and discharge pressures. Use compressor specifications at the existing discharge pressure to calculate and graph COPs at various section pressures. Use the curves to find existing and proposed COP's at various suction pressures or temperatures.

''&lt;u&gt;3) Calculate COP:&lt;/u&gt;''
Coefficient of Performance is a measure of efficiency, calculated as the ratio of refrigeration effect to compressor power. COP is unitless, so convert power and refrigeration capacity to common units using the following conversion factors:

* COP = Refrigeration Effect / Compressor Power

Where 1 ton refrigeration = 12,000 Btu / hr

''&lt;u&gt;4)Calculate Energy Savings&lt;/u&gt;''
The proposed COP will be larger than the existing. Calculate the percent energy savings based on the change in COP.

* energy savings = 1 - (existing COP / proposed COP)

Calculate the current compressor energy use (CE) based on the operating schedule and the measured power, or volts and current. The total energy savings is the compressor energy multiplied be the percent energy savings.

* CES = CE x ES%

''&lt;u&gt;5) Calculate Cost Savings&lt;/u&gt;''
Calculate cost savings by multiplying the energy cost from the utility bills.

''&lt;u&gt;6) Estimate Implementation Cost&lt;/u&gt;''
The implementation cost depends on the action necessary. Cost can be for maintenance or for new equipment.

''&lt;u&gt;7)Determine payback&lt;/u&gt;''
Determine simple payback period by dividing the implementation cost by the annual cost savings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Recommendation: Use Thermosyphon Oil Cooling==
'''Summary:'''
Install thermosyphon oil cooling to avoid power and energy costs associated with liquid injection oil cooling. Liquid injection oil cooling typically consumes 5% to 15% of the compressor power to recompress injected refrigerant. Thermosyphon cooling does not consume compressor power.

'''When to Apply:'''

* When liquid injection is used to cool large compressors.
* When reducing refrigerant, condensing pressure is limited by liquid injection cooling without installation of a liquid injection pump. The pump uses energy and improves the economics of thermosyphon oil cooling.

'''Key Engineering Conceptets:'''
* Liquid injection oil cooling works by expanding high-pressure refrigerant liquid to an intermediate pressure and injecting it into the compressor.
* Some liquid refrigerant flashes to vapor during expansion and the rest evaporates as it cools the compressor.
* Thermosyphon oil cooling uses a heat exchanger near the compressor sump to cool the oil.
* A high pressure pilot receiver collects refrigerant liquid which falls by gravity into the oil heat exchanger.
* The refrigerant evaporates and buoyancy drives the flow to the condenser.
* The thermosyphon oil cooler may require an additional condenser.
* Condenser fans will use more energy, but much less than compressor.

'''Preparation:'''

&lt;u&gt;Tools Required:&lt;/u&gt;

* Refrigeration Data Sheets
* Power Meter
* DMM
* Clamp-on Ammeter

&lt;u&gt;Data Required:&lt;/u&gt;

* Compressor Nameplate Data
* Refrigerant Type
* Proposed Suction and Discharge Pressures
* Compressor Power Profile (CP) - (measure)

&lt;u&gt;Special Considerations:&lt;/u&gt;
To size the thermosyphon heat exchanger, you will need to know the refrigerant mass flow rate, which you can calculate from.

* Compressor Volumetric Flow Rate
* Intake refrigerant density

'''Analysis Process:'''
''&lt;u&gt;1) Calculate Power Savings&lt;/u&gt;''
Liquis injection oil typically increases compressor power by 5% to 15%. Use operating hours to calculate energy use.

&lt;u&gt;Compressor Power Savings:&lt;/u&gt;
Conservatively estimate the liquid injection power as 5% of compressor power. Measure compressor power or calculate from measured volts and current

Compressor Power Savings are:

* CPS = 5% x compressor power

If the liquid injection system currently pumps liquid refrigerant, there will be further pump power savings (PPS) from turning off the pumps.

Total Power Savings (TPS) is combination of a decrease in pump and compressor power.

* TPS = compressor savings + pump savings

''&lt;u&gt;2) Calculate Energy Savings&lt;u&gt;''
Calculate energy savings from refrigeration system power savings and operating hours (OH).

&lt;u&gt;Energy Savings:&lt;/u&gt;
The operating hours of the refrigeration system may change with time of day or year. Pay attention to the operating schedule when calculating the following.

* Energy savings = total power savings x operating hours

''&lt;u&gt;3) Calculate Cost Savings.&lt;/u&gt;''
Calculate cost savings by multiplying energy savings by energy cost from utility bills.

Estimate implementation cost

Use the refrigeration mass flow rate, the discharge pressure of the refrigerant, and compressor power to size the thermosyphon heat exchanger. Calculate mass flow from compressor volumetric flow rate and refrigerant density at suction conditions.

''&lt;u&gt;4) Determine payback&lt;/u&gt;'' 
Calculate simple payback by dividing implementation cost by annual cost savings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Using SPICE with Celestia =

SPICE is a software suite developed at NASA for making the geometric calculations needed to plan an interplanetary mission. SPICE is used by mission teams at NASA, ESA, JAXA, and other space agencies. Most versions of Celestia are built with the SPICE libraries, enabling Celestia to use navigational data direct from space missions.

= Audience =

This tutorial is targeted at two groups of people:
* Mission operators and scientists who want to use Celestia for visualization
* Experienced Celestia users interested in very accurate reconstructions of space missions

Those already familiar with SPICE can skip the &quot;Introduction to SPICE&quot; section.

= Spice Introduction =

An in-depth discussion of SPICE is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but knowing few concepts should be enough to make most of this tutorial understandable. SPICE kernel files contain different types of data relevant to space missions. SPK files (typically with the extension bsp) are used to calculate the position of a spacecraft, planet or other body. A single SPK file may have data for multiple bodies. Finding the position of a body relative so some other object may require multiple kernels. For example, one SPK file might have the position of Cassini relative to Saturn. A second SPK kernel might give the positions of the planets relative to the Sun. In order to compute the heliocentric position of Cassini, we need both kernels. Kernel files have orbit or trajectory files covering a finite time span. For spacecraft, the mission is usually split into several kernels, each covering a different mission phase. The site from which you download the SPK files should have some sort of README files describing the source and time coverage for each file.

There is extensive documentation on SPICE available here at the main NAIF site:

http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/

The NAIF site is a good place to look for SPICE kernels for many space missions, including both currently operational and historical ones:

http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/data.html

= Celestia Introduction =

Celestia loads information about solar system bodies (including planets, natural satellites, asteroids, and spacecraft) from .ssc (Solar System Catalog) files. Each ssc file is a list of one or more body definitions. A solar system body has a trajectory, a rotation model, and a collection of attributes related to its appearance (since Celestia is after all a visual simulation.) The trajectory and rotation model specify the position and orientation of the body over a range of time. The possible sources of trajectory information include Keplerian elements, hardcoded calculations (e.g. VSOP87), and of course, SPICE kernels. The lists of rotation model types is similar.

== Simple Example ==

Here's a sample solar system body definition:

 Body &quot;Earth&quot; &quot;Sun&quot;
 {
     Texture &quot;earth.*&quot;
     Radius 6378.140  # equatorial
     Oblateness 0.0034
  
     CustomOrbit &quot;vsop87-earth&quot;
     CustomRotation &quot;earth-p03lp&quot;
 }

This example defines a body called Earth which orbits the Sun. Built-in calculations are used for both the trajectory and rotation of Earth. These particular built-in calculations assume that the coordinate system is the heliocentric J2000 ecliptic system. Indeed, this is the default system for heliocentric objects in Celestia. But, we can make it explicit by adding OrbitFrame and BodyFrame definitions:

 Body &quot;Earth&quot; &quot;Sun&quot;
 {
     Texture &quot;earth.*&quot;
     Radius 6378.140  # equatorial
     Oblateness 0.0034
 
     OrbitFrame { J2000Ecliptic {} }  
     CustomOrbit &quot;vsop87-earth&quot;
     BodyFrame { J2000Ecliptic {} }
     CustomRotation &quot;earth-p03lp&quot;
 }

Here, the frame for the trajectory and orientation are set to the same thing. But, we can make the BodyFrame different than the orbit frame if we want. This is useful for spacecraft, where it may make more sense to specify local vertical / local horizontal system.

= Spacecraft Example =

This tutorial will go step by step through the process of introducing a new spacecraft object into Celestia that has a position and attitude calculated by SPICE. We'll use the Deep Impact mission as an example. All of the SPICE kernels required for the mission may be downloaded from the NAIF site:

ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/DEEPIMPACT/kernels/

The first thing to do is to create a new folder for the Deep Impact add-on. Make a folder called deepimpact inside Celestia's extras folder. Then, make subfolders inside deepimpact called data and models. The folder structure should look like this:

 extras/
    deepimpact/
        data/
        models/

The ssc file for the Deep Impact mission will go in the deepimpact folder. The models folder will contain a 3D studio mesh file representing the spacecraft. Finally, all the necessary SPICE kernel files will go in data.

== Getting the SPICE Kernel Files ==

The first files that we need for the mission are the SPK files. These may be found in the SPK directory:

ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/DEEPIMPACT/kernels/spk/aareadme.txt

There are a lot of kernels in this directory, but fortunately, most are unnecessary. The file aareadme.txt helpfully clarifies which kernel files are necessary.

   NOTE 4: The following four of these SPKs should be loaded in
   this order to make sure that the best trajectory solutions are
   available to the calling application at any given time:
 
      dii_preenc174_nav_v1.bsp
      dif_preenc174_nav_v1.bsp
      di_tempel1_ssd_v1.bsp
      di_finalenc_nav_v3_to2006048.bsp

The note also specifies a loading order for the files. We will need to pay attention to that later. For now, just copy the four .bsp files into the data subfolder of the Deep Impact mission add-on.

== Comet Trajectory ==

We will be begin by creating a new Celestia object representing Comet 9P/Temple. Although we could define the comet in a separate ssc file, we'll keep things and define all of the objects relevant to the Deep Impact mission in a single file called deepimpact.ssc. Here's the definition for Comet 9P/Temple using just Keplerian elements for the orbit:

 Body &quot;9P Temple&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;comet&quot;
     SemiAxes [ 3.1 2.1 2.1 ]
     Texture &quot;asteroid.jpg&quot;
 
     EllipticalOrbit {
         Epoch                &quot;2005 7 4 00:00:00&quot;
         Period               5.51521370
         SemiMajorAxis        3.121543768
         Eccentricity         0.517493300
         Inclination         10.530163779
         AscendingNode       68.938123883
         ArgOfPericenter    178.837987181
         MeanAnomaly        359.765094570
     } 
 }

The orbital elements were derived from HORIZONS. If you have a SPICE kernel for an object, it's not necessary to begin with orbital elements. It's done here only to illustrate how an object definition is changed to add a SPICE trajectory.

=== Converting to SPICE ===

The README file in the SPK directory lists four SPK files that are required for the Deep Impact mission. The same file also recommends an order in which the files should be loaded. The order is important because when there's more than one trajectory segment valid for an object at a particular time, the most recently loaded one has priority. Celestia always loads SPICE files in the order that they're listed in an SSC file. The README doesn't mention two extra kernel files that are needed for the mission: di_tempel1_v01.tpc and di_v17.tf. Together, these define a SPICE frame for the comet Tempel 1. This frame is used for Deep Impact's trajectory right around the time of impact. Careful reading of the documentation accompanying a set of SPICE kernels is often necessary in order to understand which kernel files should be used.

Here is Tempel 1 with the Keplerian orbit replaced by a SPICE orbit:

 Body &quot;9P Temple&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;comet&quot;
     SemiAxes [ 3.1 2.1 2.1 ]
     Texture &quot;asteroid.jpg&quot;
 
     SpiceOrbit {
         Kernel [
             &quot;dii_preenc174_nav_v1.bsp&quot;
             &quot;dif_preenc174_nav_v1.bsp&quot;
             &quot;di_tempel1_ssd_v1.bsp&quot;
             &quot;di_finalenc_nav_v3_to06048.bsp&quot;
             &quot;di_tempel1_v01.tpc&quot;
             &quot;di_v17.tf&quot;
         ]
 
         Origin &quot;SUN&quot;
         Target &quot;TEMPEL 1&quot;
         BoundingRadius 10
     }
 }

We are using four parameters for SpiceOrbit. The list of kernel files appears first. Celestia will load these kernel files from the add-on's data directory. It will ignore already loaded kernels, thus it's harmless to repeat the kernel list in the definition of every object that requires it. However, it does mean that multiple objects will have to be updated if a kernel file name changes. Origin and target are both NAIF names or IDs. Instead of &quot;TEMPEL 1&quot;, we could have used the NAIF ID code 1000093. The name is much clearer, and so it is favored when available. ''The SPICE origin must match the Celestia origin.'' In Celestia an origin is given by the orbit frame center; if an orbit frame isn't explicitly specified (as in our example), the default frame is centered on the parent object. In our example, the Sun is the parent object.

The BoundingRadius field gives the radius of a sphere centered at origin that is large enough to completely contain the orbit. This information is used by Celestia to optimize rendering; with it, Celestia can do very quick checks to see whether an object might possibly be visible. Setting too small a value for BoundingRadius may make an object disappear when it should be visible. Making it too large will have no visible side effects, but can force Celestia to make extra calculations. There's no need to get too precise--bounding radii that are too large by a factor of two shouldn't cause any performance problems. On the other hand, setting all bounding radii to extremely large values like 1000 AU is to be avoided. Like other distances in Celestia, the units of BoundingRadius are AU for heliocentric objects and kilometers for everything else.

== Spacecraft Trajectory ==

Now that we've tracked down the kernels file needed for the trajectories of the objects involved in the mission, it's quite straightforward to add the flyby spacecraft:

 Body &quot;Deep Impact&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;spacecraft&quot;
     Radius 0.003
     Mesh &quot;DeepImpact2.3ds&quot;
 
     SpiceOrbit {
         Origin &quot;SUN&quot;
         Target &quot;DEEP IMPACT FLYBY SPACECRAFT&quot;
         BoundingRadius 10
     }
 }

The kernel files are omitted, since they're already loaded in the Tempel 1 definition. The only other thing different from the comet's SpiceOrbit is that we've changed the name of the target object.

== Spacecraft Attitude ==

Showing accurate attitude for a spacecraft is slightly more difficult than getting a correct trajectory. The main chore may be finding all the kernel files necessary. For spacecraft, four types of kernel files are usually necessary:

* One or more C-kernels giving the orientation of the spacecraft at different times
* A text frame kernel that defines a SPICE frame for the spacecraft
* A spacecraft clock (SCLK) kernel for translating UTC to spacecraft clock time
* A leap second kernel for converting ephemeris time to UTC

Once the needed kernel files have been installed in the add-on's data directory, we just need to replace the spacecraft's existing rotation model (if any) with a SpiceRotation. The syntax is very similar to that for SpiceOrbit.

 SpiceRotation {
     Kernel [
         &quot;dif_sc_050112_050809.bc&quot;
         &quot;di_v17.tf&quot;
         &quot;DIF_SCLKSCET.00036.tsc&quot;       
         &quot;naif0009.tls&quot;
     ]
     Frame &quot;DIF_SPACECRAFT&quot;
     BaseFrame &quot;eclipj2000&quot;
 }

Note that there are four kernel files lists: a C-kernel, a text frame kernel, a spacecraft clock kernel, and a leap second kernel. The frame kernel isn't actually necessary because it was already loaded in a SpiceOrbit. However, it's listed here anyway, because this is a tutorial, and in the more typical case, the .tf file will appear in the kernel list for the trajectory. Frame gives the name of a C-kernel frame defined for the spacecraft. BaseFrame should be set to the SPICE equivalent of whatever the object's BodyFrame is in Celestia. The default BodyFrame of a Sun-orbiting object in Celestia is the J2000 ecliptic. This matches the default BaseFrame for a SpiceRotation: eclipj2000. Still, it's a good idea to explicitly specify both frames. This is one situation where Celestia's defaults can be confusing: for objects that orbit something other than a star, the default BodyFrame is ''the equatorial frame of the parent object.'' This is rarely what you want when using SPICE!

== Debugging SpiceRotation ==

There are a lot of things that may go wrong when orienting a spacecraft with SPICE. If you restart Celestia and find that you spacecraft is pointing in the wrong direction, here are some things to check:

* Press the tilde key (~) to bring up Celestia's console log. See if there are any SPICE errors scrolling by, perhaps indicating that some required kernel files are missing. If not, press the up error to scroll backward in the log. See if any errors occurred when loading the add-on.
* Make sure that you haven't forgotten the leap second kernel or frame kernel
* Verify that the SPICE frame matches the Celestia frame for the object (i.e. BaseFrame is appropriate for the object's BodyFrame.)
* Check to make sure that the spacecraft's 3D mesh is oriented correctly in the body frame. The 'Reference Vectors/Body Axes' option in the spacecraft's right click popup menu is ''very'' helpful here.

== Adding the Impactor ==

=== SPICE Planets ===

We'll now convert the Earth example to use a SPICE kernel for the orbit of Earth. The SPICE kernel de421.bsp may be downloaded from the NAIF FTP site:

[[Image:Wohler synthesis.gif|thumb|A step-by-step breakdown of a reaction shows its ''mechanism'', the actual process of reactions becoming products.]]

Chemists often write chemical equations for reactions as a single step, which only shows the net result of a reaction. However, most chemical reactions occur in a series of steps called [[w:Elementary reaction|elementary reactions]]. All of these elementary reactions must add up to equal the overall balanced equation. The complete sequence of these elementary steps is called a '''reaction mechanism'''. The reaction mechanism is the step-by-step process by which reactants actually become products. It is the &quot;how&quot; of the reaction, whereas the overall balanced equation only shows the &quot;what&quot; of the reaction.

== Rate-Determining Steps ==

Sometimes, '''intermediate substances''' are created in the process that disappear in the end. Take the following example of a homogeneous reaction (where products and reactants are all in the same phase):

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{CO} + \hbox{NO}_2 \to \hbox{CO}_2 + \hbox{NO}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

There are actually two reactions occurring at different speeds.

* &lt;math&gt;2\hbox{NO}_2 \to \hbox{NO}_3 + \hbox{NO}&lt;/math&gt; (slow)
* &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NO}_3 + \hbox{CO} \to \hbox{NO}_2 + \hbox{CO}_2&lt;/math&gt; (fast)

Since the first step is the slowest, and the entire reaction must wait for it, it is known as the '''rate-determining step'''.  The overall reaction rate depends almost entirely on the rate of the slowest step.  The other steps are fast enough that their rate is insignificant, as they are always waiting for the slower step to complete.

Why is the first step slower? Collision theory explains whether or not particles react when they collide. The particles must collide with a minimum energy and a proper orientation if a reaction is to occur.

The minimum energy needed for a reaction to occur is its '''activation energy'''.  The particles must be moving fast enough for their collision to satisfy the activation energy.  Without the necessary energy, the particles will bounce off each other with no reaction.  A good example of activation energy is a butane lighter, which needs a spark before the fluid burns.  The spark provides enough energy to the particles to make their collisions effective.

Reactions with high activation energy will be slower than those with low activation energy.  With a high activation energy, less particles are likely to generate the needed energy when they collide.  Reactions that break bonds, especially double or triple covalent bonds, will have higher activation energy.

The particles must also collide with the proper orientation.  For example, the reaction in the animation above shows an ammonium ion reacting with a NCO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ion.  For the reaction to occur, the ammonium ion must collide with the nitrogen of the NCO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  If the ions don't collide in the right place while facing in the right direction, the reaction cannot occur.

Reactions that have very specific requirements for the orientation of the colliding particles will be much slower.  Reactions that can occur without a specific orientation will happen faster.

== Determining the Validity of an Elementary Step Model ==

In order for a proposed elementary step equation to be valid it must fulfil these requirements.

1. The rate equation of the slow step much match the rate equation of the overall reaction. 

2. The reactants and products of all the elementary steps added together must equal the one of the actual equation.

3. The rate law for the elementary step must be able to be written without the concentration of the intermediates, because the intermediates are too small to be accurately measured.

For example, if given this equation and asked to prove the rate mechanism

Equation
&lt;math&gt;\hbox{2O}_3 \to \hbox{3O}_2 + \hbox{NO}&lt;/math&gt;

Proposed Mechanism

&lt;math&gt;\hbox{O}_3 \to \hbox{O}_2 + \hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt; (fast)

&lt;math&gt;\hbox{O}_3 \hbox{O} \to \hbox{2O}_2 &lt;/math&gt; (slow)

&lt;math&gt; rate = k [O_3]^2/[O_2] &lt;/math&gt;

We know that when the reaction occurs backwards, the k changes from k to k^{-1}. So, we substitute in the backwards rate for O_3, and plug it into the slow step. Then, take the rate equation of the slow step. We find that it is the same as the rate law for the overall equation and meets the three criteria above, so this proposed mechanism is valid.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Install ASD on Condenser Fans==
'''Summary:'''
Install Adjustable Speed Drives (ASDs) to reduce part-load fan power.

'''When to Apply:'''
Single-speed to two-speed fans that cycle often to maintain minimum discharge pressure.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''

* Ideal fan power is proportional to the cube of fan speed with an ASD
* Actual fan power is greater due to ASD inefficiencies
* Fan energy is directly proportional to use factor (UF) with on-off fan control
* Fan energy is inversely proportional to the condensing approach temperature difference

'''Preparation:'''

&lt;u&gt;Tool Required&lt;/u&gt;

* Power Meter
* DMM
* Clamp-on Ammeter
* Stopwatch
* Thermometer
* Psychrometer
* Refrigeration data sheets

&lt;u&gt;Data Required&lt;/u&gt;

* Minimum condensing temperature (Tm)(saturated temperature for condenser fan set-points)
* Fan power (FP)(measure)
* Wet and dry bulb temperatures (measure)
* Condenser MATD - (measure with all fans on)
* Fan Use Factor, may be available from trend logs on electronic control systems.

'''Analysis process:'''
&lt;u&gt;1) Calculate Condenser Fan Use Factor&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;u&gt;2) Calculate Current Fan Energy Use&lt;/u&gt;
Calculate current fan energy use differently than proposed energy use due to the change in control strategies. The existing control strategy is on-off control.

Calculate fan energy for each bin temperature with the fan power, use factor, and bin hours. Sum the energy for each bin temperature, normalized with operating hours, for total fan energy.

* fan energy = sum of(bin hrs x use factor x fan power) x (operating hrs / total bin hrs)

&lt;u&gt;3) Calculate Proposed Fan Energy Use&lt;/u&gt;
Power and fan capacities are related cubically for ASD motors.

&lt;u&gt;Proposed Fan Energy Use&lt;/u&gt;
Estimate energy for each bin temperature with fan power, percent capacity, bin hours, and the following cubic relation shown is a curve fit based on measured fan data that relates the fan percent power to the bin specific use factor. Sum energy for each bin temperature, normalized with operating hours for total fan energy.

* %power = curve fit based on percent capacity
* fan energy = sum of (total power x % power x bin hrs) x (operating hrs / total bin hrs)

The curve fit is based on data collected by a former OSU graduate student.

&lt;u&gt;4) Calculate Fan Energy Savings&lt;/u&gt;
Calculate fan energy savings:

* fan energy savings = difference between existing and proposed energy use

&lt;u&gt;5) Calculate Cost Savings&lt;/u&gt;

* Calculate cost savings by multiplying energy savings by the energy cost from the utility bills.
* Estimate implementation cost
* Adjustable speed drives vary in coast due to size and type:
* Get a quote
* They may be additional costs for ASD rated motors, isolation transformers, and / or harmonic filters, if needed
* Determine payback
* Calculate simple payback by dividing the implementation cost by annual cost savings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Recommendation: Minimize Excess Refrigeration Loads==
'''Summary:'''
Compressor power can be directly related to refrigeration load by the COP. Reduce excess refrigeration loads to reduce compressor power and save energy. This recommendation commonly applies to refrigeration loads in freezers and coolers.

'''When to Apply:'''
When excess heat gain is a substantial part of the refrigeration load, from:

* Lights 
* Open doors
* Poor insulation
* Door weatherstripping
* Defrost
* Floor heating

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''

* Refrigeration load in freezers and coolers consists of the desired refrigeration effect and heat
* Gains from lights, and through doors, walls, floors and ceilings.
* Efficient lights produce more lumens per watt and introduce less energy to the cold area
* Fast acting, well-insulated weatherproofed doors reduced heat gain from outside air
* Improved insulation reduces heat gain through doors, walls, floors and ceilings.
* The COP relates refrigeration effect to compressor power

'''Preparation:'''
&lt;u&gt;Tools Required&lt;/u&gt;

* Power Meter
* DMM
* Clamp-on Ammeter
* Stopwatch
* Therometer
* Psychrometer
* Refrigeration Data Sheets

&lt;u&gt;Data Required&lt;/u&gt;

* Room Dimensions (Measure, take from plans or step off approximate dimensions)
* Insulation thickness (Use plans or approximate)
* Wall, ceiling and door temperatures (Measure)
* Outside temperature (Measure)
* Doors dimensions (Approximate)
* Number and type of doors (observe)
* Time the doors spend open (Approximate)
* Number, type, power, and operating hours of lights
* Lighting level in room (Measure with light meter)

'''Analysis Process:'''
''&lt;u&gt;1a) Calculate Existing Lighting Power&lt;/u&gt;''
A simple approximation for the lighting load is to consider instantaneous power dissipated by the lamps in the room, multiplied by the use factor. This approximates the time-varying heat flux from the lamps as a constant flux to be absorbed by the refrigeration system.

&lt;u&gt;Existing Lighting Power&lt;/u&gt;
Count the light fixtures in the space and determine the input power rating for each fixture, including lamps and ballasts. Sum input power for all fixtures to calculate the average power dissipated into the room.

* Existing lighting power = number of fixtures x input wattage x use factor

''&lt;u&gt;1b) Determine the Proposed Lighting Configuration&lt;/u&gt;''
Replace existing lamps with more efficient lamps that emit more lumens per watt. Lamps in order of increasing efficiency are:

* Incandescent 
* Halogen
* Compact Fluorescent
* Fluorescent
* Mercury Vapor
* Metal Halide
* High-pressure Sodium

Take care to use only fixtures that will work in low temperature areas.

Consider lighting system design to ensure that lighting level is adequate with a reduced number of fixtures or lamps.

''&lt;u&gt;1c) Calculate Proposed Lighting Power&lt;/u&gt;''
Once you select a new lighting type and the number of fixtures, calculate the proposed lighting power.

&lt;u&gt;Proposed Lighting Power&lt;/u&gt;
Use the proposed number of fixtures and input walls to calculate the proposed lighting power.

* Proposed lighting power = number of fixtures x input watts x use factor

''&lt;u&gt;1d) Determine the Load Reduction due to Efficient Lighting&lt;/u&gt;''

&lt;u&gt;Lighting Power Savings&lt;/u&gt;
Subtract the proposed from the existing lighting power to calculate the lighting power savings.

* Lighting power savings = existing power - proposed power

''&lt;u&gt;2a) Calculate Heat Gain through Walls, Floor and Ceiling&lt;/U&gt;''
Heat flows through the walls, floor, and ceiling of a cold room driven by a temperature difference between the cold space and the outside air. You will need dimensions and extermal temperatures of each. Heat transfer is by convection on the outside and inside of the wall, and by conduction through the wall and insulation. Unless you can measure temperature throughout the year, you will have to use bin weather data to calculate the heat transfer through the year. In the calculations below, only average heat transfer rates are shown.

&lt;u&gt;Calculate Existing Heat Gain through each Surface&lt;/u&gt;
Consider radiative and convective coefficients on the outside of the surface, conduction through the surface components and insulation, and finally convection to the cold space. Refer to a heat transfer text for convective and radiative heat transfer rates.

Once all heat-transfer coefficients have been approximated, calculate the total heat transfer to the cold space. The total heat transfer into the room through the walls, ceiling, and floor is the sum of the individual heat transfer rates for each surface.

* Heat Gain through Surfaces = sum (Heat transfer coefficient x area x temp difference)

&lt;u&gt;2b) Determine Insulation Thickness&lt;/u&gt;
Increasing insulation thickness or replacing saturated insulation will decrease the heat gain to the cold space. However, there are practical limits to the amount of insulation that should be applied. Reaching and maintaining desired temperature is generally a high priority if it affects product quality. Reasonable payback may also affect the amount of insulation to be installed.

&lt;u&gt;2c) Calculate Proposed Heat Gain&lt;/u&gt;
Recalculate heat-transfer rates with the proposed insulation installed, and recalculate total heat gain:

* proposed surface gain = sum (new heat transfer coefficient x area x temp difference)

&lt;u&gt;2d) Determine insulation savings&lt;/u&gt;
Subtract proposed from existing surface heat gain to calculate the reduction.

* insulation heat reduction = existing surface heat gain - proposed surface heat gain

&lt;u&gt;3a) Calculate heat gain through doors&lt;/u&gt;
When a cold space door is opened without air or strip curtains, buoyant forces draw warm air into the space. Heat gain through an open door will be mainly by convection, unless a curtain is used. Unless you can measure temperature throughout the year, use bin weather data to calculate the heat transfer through the year. In the calculations below, only the average heat transfer rates are shown.

&lt;u&gt;Calculate Heat Gain through Doors&lt;/u&gt;
Heat gain through doors varies with similar to lighting load. To approximate and average heat flux through the doors,
estimate the percentage of time that the doors spend open then calculate the heat transfer die to convection into the cooler.

* Door heat gain = percent of time open x calculated heat transfer

&lt;u&gt;3b) Calculate proposed heat gain through doors&lt;/u&gt;
To reduce the heat transfer through the doors of a cold space, reduce either the time the doors spend open or the heat transfer rates. Install air or strip curtains when doors do not have them. Install fast acting doors or others automatic closers to reduce open time. Calculate the proposed heat transfer through the doors as above, using the proposed time spent open or heat transfer rates. Calculate proposed heat gain through doors.

Using the new valve for percent of time spent open, calculate the proposed heat gain through the doors. The heat transfer rate will change if a new air door is installed.

* proposed door gain = New percentage of time open x calculated heat transfer

&lt;u&gt;3c)Calculate door savings&lt;/u&gt;
Calculate door savings. Subtract the proposed from the existing heat gain to calculate door load reduction. 

* door load reduction = existing - proposed door load

&lt;u&gt;3d)Calculate total heat reduction&lt;/u&gt;
Calculate the total reduction from lighting, surfaces, and doors.

Total reduction in refrigeration load is:

* total load reduction = lighting reduction + surface load reduction + door load reduction

&lt;u&gt;4) Calculate COP&lt;/u&gt;
Calculate COP

Coefficient of Performance is a measure of efficiency, calculated as the ratio of refrigeration effect to compressor power. COP is unit less, so convert power and refrigeration capacity to common units using the following conversion factors:

* COP = Refrigeration Effect / Compressor Power
* Where 1 ton of refrigeration = 12,000 BTU/hr
* 1 hp = 2,546 BTU / hr

&lt;u&gt;Calculate Compressor Power Savings&lt;/u&gt;
Calculate the average reduction in compressor power based on the decrease in average refrigeration load and the coefficient of performance.

* PS = TRR / COP

&lt;u&gt;Calculate Auxiliary Power and Energy Increase&lt;/u&gt;
Installation of an air curtain will increase the system power because the air requires a blower. The power and energy used by the blower depend on the size of the freezer door and the air curtain chosen for application. 

&lt;u&gt;Calculate Cost Savings&lt;/u&gt;
Calculate cost savings by multiplying energy savings by energy cost from the utility bills.

&lt;u&gt;Estimate implementation cost&lt;/u&gt;
Implementation cost is the total cost for purchase and installation of the new equipment. The choice of new equipment will be plant specific.

&lt;u&gt;Determine Payback&lt;/u&gt; 
Determine simple payback period by dividing the implementation cost by the annual savings.

'''Hi All,''' 

My Name is Rajaa Krayem.  I am an Electrical engineer graduated from California State University Long Beach in 1990. I turned to education on 1996 to help my beloved son with his learning difficulties. I am a devoted mother of three and a compassionate teacher who live to learn and to connect with challenged young minds.  I am an advocate for love and knowledge.  I love to make learning fun and accessible for every one. All can learn , but some need a different approach or a special attention to trigger the creative learning abilities that each of us have.. I enjoy teaching Math and Physics.  I consider Mathematics as the Language of Science and I want to teach student how to apply it as an easy language.  If teachers believe in their student abilities to learn this will lead students to believe in themselves and they will give the best out naturally and spontaneously. This can be achieved by constant motivations, assigning an  inspiring and challenging tasks, and supporting an atmosphere of fun interactive classroom discussion with topic- relevant activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Moods==
Mood or modality is about how the speaker relates to what is being said. English four moods that are being used these days. They are:
* Indicative indicates an assertion (&quot;the house is red&quot;), a question (&quot;is that your car?&quot;) or denial (&quot;I did not do that&quot;).
* Imperative indicates a command (&quot;paint that house!&quot;), an advice (&quot;Bring a spare coat!&quot;) etc.
* Subjunctive is used in a variety of cases such as &quot;If I '''were''' a millionaire I would buy a house&quot;.
* Infinitive mood is used in dictionaries: &quot;to eat&quot;.

Moods changes the inflection of verbs in Mapudungun. There are three moods.

&lt;div style=&quot;border:0px solid #000000;padding:1em;padding-top:0.5em;margin:8px 0 0;background: #EEEEEE&quot;&gt;
===Realis mood===
This mood is used when it is known how something is. For example: 

'''I have a house''' or '''I don't have a house'''.

'''Iñce nien kiñe ruka''' or '''Iñce nielan kiñe ruka'''.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border:0px solid #000000;padding:1em;padding-top:0.5em;margin:8px 0 0;background: #EEEEEE&quot;&gt;
===Conditional mood===
This mood is used... For example: 

'''If we go...''' or '''If they don't leave...'''.

If making a sentence that is negative a extra particle ('''no''') is used in this mood.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border:0px solid #000000;padding:1em;padding-top:0.5em;margin:8px 0 0;background: #EEEEEE&quot;&gt;
===Volitive mood===
This mood is used when expressing a hope, a wish or fear for something.For example: 

'''I don't want to go''' or '''I want to eat it'''.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Changes=

It would be good to add an example on the etic section that shows how the 'external' view can lead to misunderstanding between cultures. [[User:Spuckie|Spuckie]] ([[User talk:Spuckie|talk]]) 00:27, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
In the cultural transmission section, I added another brief example of cultural transmission, describing how Hip-Hop influenced the 2007 elections in Dakar.  

In the section about Holism, I changed the word 'probably' because it didn't sound very text-book-like. I also connected the final sentence to the main theme of the paragraph. [[User:Osbornh|Osbornh]] ([[User talk:Osbornh|talk]]) 00:14, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

At the section about Ethnology, I felt that there should be a little bit more history to ethnology.[[User:Colboc2|Colboc2]] ([[User talk:Colboc2|talk]]) 23:28, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

At the end of the Biological Anthro. section there were a couple sentences that were disconnected from the main body paragraph. I fit them back into the paragraph and made some words more concise. [[User:Needhaa2|Needhaa2]] ([[User talk:Needhaa2|talk]]) 20:41, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

I added more to the description on anthroplogy because I felt that it needed more than just a small sentence, so people could undertand really what it was.[[User:Hamc|Hamc]] ([[User talk:Hamc|talk]]) 17:06, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

Some of the reference links are a little screwy. I'll try to what I can, but watch out. [[User:Brennanholten|Brennanholten]] ([[User talk:Brennanholten|talk]]) 23:11, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed some sentences and deleted some redundant phrases and words. (Scar8719)

I added an example of the emic view of culture, brining in an example from a class reading--[[User:Monroe3191|Monroe3191]] ([[User talk:Monroe3191|talk]]) 21:09, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added some more information to the section What is Race, brining in some new insights. --[[User:Monroe3191|Monroe3191]] ([[User talk:Monroe3191|talk]]) 20:35, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added links and corrected a small spelling mistake in cultural relativism. [[User:Strickh|Strickh]] ([[User talk:Strickh|talk]]) 05:51, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added information from my notes on etic and emic perspectives. I did not want to delete what was already there, instead I clarified what was the &quot;insiders&quot; and the &quot;outsiders&quot; perspectives.

I made a couple of changes to the &quot;what is culture&quot; part. I added a comma after mother to make it flow better so it doesn't sound like a run on sentence and I also bolded Diversity and Change. - [[egoronkin]]

I edited the biography on Franz Boas, the &quot;Father of Anthropology.&quot; I looked up his place of birth because all the other biographys for the other anthropologists included their place of birth. Also, I contributed minor edits such as a mandatory comma after a year in the middle of the sentence.

I changed a few sentences around under the discussion about Chinese foot binding. Some phrases were choppy, &quot;china&quot; wasn't capitalized so I chanegd that, and the incorrect use of &quot;there&quot; was supposed to be &quot;their.&quot;

I reworded physical anthropology &quot;historically&quot; to &quot;also&quot; (known as) because some still use physical and biological anthropology interchangably. Also, I added some grammatical structures like a comma to &quot;what is anthropology?&quot; since I am a grammar fiend.

I linked ethnography to wikipedia. - [[asamih]]

I linked ethnocentrism to wikipedia. - [[asamih]]

I added a bold heading to a heading which gave it more organization. millerp7

I changed some wordings and transitions in the cultural relativism section, specifically the part about foot binding. It was a bit wordy. - [[asamih]]

In Familial Culture, I linked &quot;enculturation&quot; to wikipedia. - [[asamih]]

I changed the first sentence of the paragraph where it talks about the royal family in Great Britain. It sounded a bit repetitive with the first paragraph. - [[asamih]] 

I would suggest that whoever wrote the section on &quot;enculturation&quot; change or take out the sentence where they write in first person since we are not supposed to do this. - [[White9354]]

I decreased the picture of the Chinese woman with her feet unbound to a thumbnai. Its in Cultural Relativism [allumbt]

Someone posted the link for Participant observation incorrectly under the ethnography section, so I fixed it. - [[Hykal0597]]

Someone posted the link for Edward Burnett Tylor incorrectly under development of the discipline, so I fixed it. - [[Hykal0597]]

In History I added a link to the google book &quot;anahuac: Or Mexico and the Mexicans, Ancient and Modern&quot;

I made some minor changes to section 3.1 to make it flow better. I took away the comma after ethnology that was unnecessary, made topic plural, and added ethnography to the last sentence.

Made minor changes to 1.2 Levels of culture. I changed to voice from second person to third person to make it more formal.
Changes to 3.3 Participant observation. Changed to word order to make it flow better. 

I made a minor change to the Edward Tylor's section referencing his wikipedia page, but i am still unable to make the link connect.

I made some minor changes to section 3.4 Participant Observation. I changed the tense of gather to help sentence flow and altered one of the sentences, correcting what I assume was simple spelling errors. Also I changed &quot;them&quot; to &quot;the researcher&quot; to help the sentence make more sense. --[[User:Logan6012|Logan6012]] ([[User talk:Logan6012|talk]]) 23:42, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

I made some minor changes to section 1.1 What is culture. I added a couple sentences to the first short paragraph just to better define what culture is. I also wanted it to read better. I added that culture can also be defined as a structured stage of civilization that can be specific to a nation or time period. I also added &quot;a particular social, ethnic, or age group&quot; to the first sentence to broaden it. --[[User:Capalungan6902|Capalungan6902]] ([[User talk:Capalungan6902|talk]]) 06:58, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

I also made some minor changes to section 3.7 Cultural Relativism. I changed &quot;in&quot; to &quot;on&quot; in the first sentence and &quot;their&quot; to &quot;ones&quot; to make the sentence flow a little smoother. I also added &quot;, it&quot; to the second sentence to also help the flow of the sentence.--[[User:Capalungan6902|Capalungan6902]] ([[User talk:Capalungan6902|talk]]) 07:03, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

I made minor grammatical corrections to parts of the Introduction, Symbolism and Communication, Healing and Human Rights, and Reproduction and Kinship. I rearranged some parts to make it flow better, and changed a few words to make it make more sense. [[User:Kholderbein|Kholderbein]] ([[User talk:Kholderbein|talk]]) 07:10, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

For '''Encultration''' section I dont think I would use the term how everyone deals maybe adapt may be a a better choice, because its not always a negative experience and it seams like you can't escape it so different word choice would probably be better. That was a nice run on sentence eh?--[[User:Knight9366|Knight9366]] ([[User talk:Knight9366|talk]]) 23:38, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a photo to the Archeology section to show an example of what an Archeologist might find. [[User:Nortonl|Nortonl]] ([[User talk:Nortonl|Nortonl]])

I added a link to the Valley of Kings so that someone that was reading about Archeology would be able to understand why the example given is interesting. [[User:Nortonl|Nortonl]] ([[User talk:Nortonl|Nortonl]])

okay thank you for editing mine! [[User:Dorres2582|Dorres2582]] ([[User talk:Dorres2582|Dorres2582]])
I also added a picture to section 3.1 Ethnography [[User:Dorres2582|Dorres2582]] ([[User talk:Dorres2582|Dorres2582]])

I added to the rules for cultural   --[[User:Rutha2|Rutha2]] ([[User talk:Rutha2|talk]]) 02:32, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a caption to the Royal family of Great Britain to tie it into the section --[[User:Mbutler07|Mbutler07]] ([[User talk:Mbutler07|talk]]) 23:38, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I moved the picture that was in Ethnology because It just broke up the flow of the page.--[[User:Mbutler07|Mbutler07]] ([[User talk:Mbutler07|talk]]) 23:51, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I moved the picture of Edward Tylor over to the right for you.--[[User:Mbutler07|Mbutler07]] ([[User talk:Mbutler07|talk]]) 23:59, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I made minor punctuation changes for better readability.--[[User:Klokow7568|Klokow7568]] ([[User talk:Klokow7568|talk]]) 01:44, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I added Etic and Emic to the page because I think they would be important subjects to discuss--[[User:Logan6012|Logan6012]] ([[User talk:Logan6012|talk]]) 03:35, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed &quot;if&quot; to &quot;in&quot; in the Familial Culture caption because I think that it would make more sense--[[User:Logan6012|Logan6012]] ([[User talk:Logan6012|talk]]) 03:36, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I added more information to the &quot;What is Cultural Anthropology&quot; page under the &quot;What is Culture&quot; section.--[[User:Williams3099|Williams 3099]] ([[User talk:Williams3099|talk]])

I added a photo to the Cultural Relativism section to help depict what is discussed --[[User:Logan6012|Logan6012]] ([[User talk:Logan6012|talk]]) 04:03, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed the wording of some sentences in the &quot;Ethnography&quot; section by taking out the equals signs to make it seem more professional.--[[User:Williams3099|Williams 3099]] ([[User talk:Williams3099|talk]])

I added a link in the section Early Cultural Anthropological Studies to offer more thorough information--[[User:Logan6012|Logan6012]] ([[User talk:Logan6012|talk]]) 04:12, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

Thank you for offering me advice for the &quot;Enculturation&quot; section. I'll try to reword it to make better sense. --[[User:Logan6012|Logan6012]] ([[User talk:Logan6012|talk]]) 04:16, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I made some punctuation changes in the Familial Culture section to help it flow better. --[[User:Logan6012|Logan6012]] ([[User talk:Logan6012|talk]]) 04:39, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

In the &quot;Ethnography&quot; section, I changed the order and wording of a few sentences to make it easier to read. --[[User:Logan6012|Logan6012]] ([[User talk:Logan6012|talk]]) 04:50, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the &quot;Early Influential Personalities&quot; section by fixing grammar, spelling, and doing some re-phrasing to make the section more readable.--[[User:Williams3099|Williams 3099]] ([[User talk:Williams3099|talk]])

I rephrased and fixed grammar on the &quot;Cultural Anthropology&quot; section.--[[User:Williams3099|Williams 3099]] ([[User talk:Williams3099|talk]])

In the &quot;Enculturation&quot; section, I reworded some of the sentences and also took out words that weren't necessary.--[[User:Williams3099|Williams 3099]] ([[User talk:Williams3099|talk]])

I added more information and edited some wording in the linguistic anthropology section. Only to make things more clear.

I added information about language to the symbolism section, since language is the most commonly used symbol for humans.

Thanks for adding info to the symbolism section, it helps to strengthen it. --[[User:Williams3099|Williams 3099]] ([[User talk:Williams3099|talk]])

I took out &quot;preparation, and types of food consumed.&quot; from cultural universals because these things are not universal, there are some things that some cultures eat that others don't and the ways that they prepare food could also be non-universal.

I added sex and play to cultural universals because these are things that all cultures do in order to thrive and survive.

I took out culAnths and put in Cultural Anthropologists because I felt that it was more direct and will be more clear in the long run.

I created subdivisions under Levels of Culture for Familial Culture, Micro or Subculture, and Cultural Universals because I felt that it would help in trying to identify the area in which they would be found. [[User:Stadlerl|Stadlerl]] ([[User talk:Stadlerl|talk]])

I added a picture to the Micro or Subculture subdivision because I felt that a picture would be helpful in understanding the concept a little better. [[User:Stadlerl|Stadlerl]] ([[User talk:Stadlerl|talk]])

I added a picture under the section of What is Culture? because I wanted to identify the tribe of Ashanti in some way. [[User: Stadlerl|Stadlerl]] ([[User talk:Stadlerl|talk]])

I added two links to wikipedia under Cultural Universals because I felt that it would help the understanding of some terms that were brought up in the paragraphs. [[User:Stadlerl|Stadlerl]] ([[User talk:Stadlerl|talk]])

I added a section of Technology under Introduction to Anthropology and Culture as well as a link for Technology. [[User:Gabi Chavarria|Gabi Chavarria]] ([[User talk:Gabi Chavarria|talk]])

I added more detail in the Cross-Cultural relationship section to explain how certain traditions restrict opportunity. [[tallman5651]]

I added a little more to the example of the !Kung people (dealing with enculturation) to further explain the difference between cultures. [[User:Mikelsm|Mikelsm]] ([[User talk:Mikelsm|talk]]) 02:16, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

I added the chinese for “three-inch golden lotuses” [[User:Kuoy2|Kuoy2]] ([[User talk:Kuoy2|talk]]) 07:09, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

===Questions===
I added a picture of edward tylor but I couldn't figure out how to add the text box that exists on his wikipedia page.  So if anyone knows how to do this feel free because it would look better. - [[User:White9354]]

Is anyone opposed to me bolding the types of anthropology? I'm not sure who created it, but if you don't like it feel free to change it back. I think it helps separate them from their definitions. [[User:Kurnikm|Kurnikm]] ([[User talk:Kurnikm|talk]]) 06:59, 26 February 2009 (UTC)

== The poor man from Vanuatu.  Please, make it stop! ==

For the love of God, please stop making that poor man from Vanuatu keep trying to create fire, unsuccessfully.  He keeps rubbing the stick on that piece of wood, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth …. !  

I don't know what this man's crime was; in what way he affronted the gods; perhaps his sentence to Sisyphean endeavor, to rub the two sticks together for the rest of eternity, in an effort to create fire, and never succeeding, is something he deserves, but if you cannot have mercy on him, could you please have mercy on people like me, who have come to view this page?

Maybe it's just me, but that image, that gif or whatever it is; the over and over and overness of it is incredibly, incredibly distracting and, I think, detracts from the contents of this page.


Make it stop!  Please, for the love of God, make it stop!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rubber ==

=== &lt;u&gt;Method 1&lt;/u&gt; ===

This method is for a general, computer-performance-oriented rubber material.
[[File:EXRubber.jpg|240px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Color'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Col:  (Adjust as needed)&lt;br&gt;
**R - &lt;u&gt;0.15&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**G - &lt;u&gt;0.14&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**B - &lt;u&gt;0.12&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*Spec: (Change as needed)&lt;br&gt;
**R - &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**G - &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**B - &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Shaders'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Diffuse Shader:(Minnaert)&lt;br&gt;
**Ref - &lt;u&gt;0.7&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Dark - &lt;u&gt;0.6&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*Specular Shader:(Blinn)&lt;br&gt;
**Spec - &lt;u&gt;1.5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Hard - &lt;u&gt;10&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Refr - &lt;u&gt;2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Some people think it looks TOO smooth. If you feel that way, add a very light texture:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Texture'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tex Type - &lt;u&gt;Stucci&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*StucciType - &lt;u&gt;Wall In&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*NoiseType - &lt;u&gt;Hard Noise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*NoiseSize - &lt;u&gt;0.05&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Turbulance - &lt;u&gt;3F&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Noise Basis - &lt;u&gt;Voronoi F1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Map Input'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Coordinates - &lt;u&gt;Orco&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*SurfaceType - &lt;u&gt;Cube&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Map To'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*MapType - &lt;u&gt;Nor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**'''''Nor'''Slider'' - &lt;u&gt;0.3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== &lt;u&gt;Method 2, w/SSS&lt;/u&gt; ===

This method is a better quality and more realistic Rubber material, but works best using SubSurface Scattering, so it may affect the time of your Render.&lt;br&gt;
[[File:EXRubberSSS.jpg|240px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Color'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Col:  (Adjust as needed)&lt;br&gt;
**R - &lt;u&gt;0.15&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**G - &lt;u&gt;0.14&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**B - &lt;u&gt;0.12&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*Spec: (Change as needed)&lt;br&gt;
**R - &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**G - &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**B - &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Shaders'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Diffuse Shader:(Lambert)&lt;br&gt;
**Ref - &lt;u&gt;0.8&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*Specular Shader:(CookTorr)&lt;br&gt;
**Spec - &lt;u&gt;0.97&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Hard - &lt;u&gt;5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''SSS'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Scale - &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*RadiusR - &lt;u&gt;8.5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*RadiusG - &lt;u&gt;5.5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*RadiusB - &lt;u&gt;4&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Hex - &lt;u&gt;DFDFDF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Col - &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Tex - &lt;u&gt;0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Front - &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Back - &lt;u&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*IOR - &lt;u&gt;1.8&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Some people think it looks TOO smooth. If you feel that way, add a very light texture:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Texture'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

**'''''Nor'''Slider'' - &lt;u&gt;0.3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==1 Nonverbal Primate Communication==
          o 1.1 Call Systems

I wrote an introductory sentence under the heading in order to make the section easier to get into. [[User:Nataliza|Nataliza]] ([[User talk:Nataliza|talk]]) 11:30, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I made minor edits to write the whole paragraph in objective, 3rd person. --[[User:Klokow7568|Klokow7568]] ([[User talk:Klokow7568|talk]]) 23:01, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed the wording a bit in this section. [[User:Minshull9320|Minshull9320]] ([[User talk:Minshull9320|talk]]) 04:29, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I corrected an error in that polychronic cultures appear improper to monochronic cultures when before it in incorrectly stated that polychronic tendencies appeared improper to polychronic cultures. --[[User:Moraleg|Moraleg]] ([[User talk:Moraleg|talk]]) 06:43, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

I added a personal example to another students example about posture and ballet in order to show the opposite approach with hip-hop and then tied it back into how switching from different postures in dance applies to different situations in everyday life. [[User:Deweesk|Deweesk]] ([[User talk:Deweesk|talk]]) 03:33, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I added some related information about the similarities between human and primate nonverbal communication [[User:Robins30|Robins30]] ([[User talk:Robins30|talk]]) 20:11, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

== 1.2 Sign Language== 
I re-added &quot;the&quot; before &quot;Abbe,&quot; as it is a title, and not a name. --[[Special:Contributions/76.177.60.16|76.177.60.16]] ([[User talk:76.177.60.16|talk]]) 03:52, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

I revised a sentence that didn’t make any sense. It said “a deaf baby born into deaf parents…” I thought this wasn’t really true since only about 4% of all children are born deaf also the way the sentence was written made it sound like being deaf was a genetic disease. It’s actually a mutation. [[User:Shielse|Shielse]] ([[User talk:Shielse|talk]]) 02:40, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

Under the introduction to Nonverbal communication, I altered it to properly reflect sign langauge as a verbal language, despite the lack of sound. [[User:Blodgek|Blodgek]] ([[User talk:Blodgek|talk]]) 01:53, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

I added my main content contribution to British Sign Language. --[[User:Klokow7568|Klokow7568]] ([[User talk:Klokow7568|talk]]) 00:26, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited a section under 'American Sign Language' to include an accurate history of where from/how ASL originated. --[[User:Klokow7568|Klokow7568]] ([[User talk:Klokow7568|talk]]) 00:26, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

Please Add link and reference to 
[[w:Fingerspelling]] it has a lot of history--[[User:Paul James|Paul James]] ([[User talk:Paul James|talk]]) 20:41, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link for Fingerspelling under the French Sign Language section. --[[User:Malone2927|Malone2927]] ([[User talk:Malone2927|talk]])9 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited my picture for French Sign Language with a caption. I also edited the main content for this section so it flows better.--[[User:Malone2927|Malone2927]] ([[User talk:Malone2927|talk]])9 March 2009 (UTC)

I just added a little more to the beginning of sign language
[[User:emerson2791|emerson2791]] ([[User talk:emerson2791|talk]])


2.2 I edited the sentances 

The Abbe de l'Epee is considered the Father of French Sign Language... and. One night, it is said, The Abbe was trying to get out of ... I removed the &quot;The's&quot; before Abbe in both sentances because they did not fit. commonly in French there is a &quot;the&quot; before a word and this name may have been translated with the &quot;The's&quot; before his name. It makes more sense without them[[User:Wynnn|Wynnn]] ([[User talk:Wynnn|talk]]) 16:49, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I included that ASL is becoming more popular in the American schools, but due to personal experience in the Seattle School District, I have observed that it is not offered as a normal course like French or Spanish is in most schools. [[User:Brownl31|Brownl31]] ([[User talk:Brownl31|talk]]) 03:14, 1 May 2009 (UTC)brownl31

I added a bit more info as to what cochlear implants are, and why they are controversial in deaf culture. [[User:mcgrawj|mcgrawj]] ([[User talk:mcgrawj|talk]])

==  + 1.2.1 Cultural Transmission==

I edited grammatical errors and re-wrote small fragments to increase readability. --[[User:Klokow7568|Klokow7568]] ([[User talk:Klokow7568|talk]]) 23:19, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed the size of the picture and moved it. [[User:Minshull9320|Minshull9320]] ([[User talk:Minshull9320|talk]]) 03:50, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

 + 1.2.2 Displacement

==* 2 Nonverbal Communication==
I did the class assignment/essay on nonverbal communication. I did (very basic!) research in the areas of eye contact, posture, paralanguage, personal space, and manner of dress. If these topics help anyone, I am willing to share the examples I found.[[User:Kurnikm|Kurnikm]] ([[User talk:Kurnikm|talk]]) 17:41, 26 February 2009 (UTC)

I made the picture in Morphology bigger :). [[User:Whitee7|Whitee7]] ([[User talk:Whitee7|talk]]) 05:05, 8 March 2009

I added a definition for, and examples of paralanguage, and the image of two men demonstrating nonverbal communication. [[User:Kurnikm|Kurnikm]] ([[User talk:Kurnikm|talk]]) 07:17, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

[[User:Krakauc|Krakauc]] ([[User talk:Krakauc|talk]]) 07:36, 2 March 2009 (UTC)I really enjoyed reading about your case study. I would be interested to know if you think there is a specific line between what is appropriate and inappropriate for eye contact or if it is all relative. Chloe Krakauer

In the United States, eye contact is taught to children, and looking people in the eye is a sign of respect and trustworthiness. However, even within the United States there are discrespancies as to how much eye contact is acceptable (east coast vs. west coast, for example). On a global basis, the appropriate amount of eye contact is culturally determined, and I don't think that one culture can declare that its eye contact as the &quot;appropriate amount.&quot; [[User:Kurnikm|Kurnikm]] ([[User talk:Kurnikm|talk]]) 07:42, 2 March 2009 (UTC)
    * 3 The Structure of Language
    * 4 Language and Thought
    * 5 Sociolinguistics
    * 6 Historical Linguistics

I would like to reserve this section. Sam Turner [[User:Turner3393|Turner3393]] ([[User talk:Turner3393|talk]]) 04:29, 10 February 2009 (UTC)


Sam, mind if I take the nonverbal communication section off your hands? [[User:Craiga2|Craiga2]] ([[User talk:Craiga2|talk]]) 19:29, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

I edited under 'Call Systems.'I really enjoyed this section and I thought it was done well. I just added an internal link for the word ‘displacement’ because I thought it would help to clarify the concept. --[[User:Reeh8419|Reeh8419]] ([[User talk:Reeh8419|talk]]) 06:34, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

===Nonverbal Communication===
I just added the part about Kinesics. I said that it was another form of nonverbal communication and then I defined what it was. --[[User:Colburd|Colburd]] ([[User talk:Colburd|talk]]) 05:10, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

I rearranged some sentences and added a few clarifying words in order to help the flow of the paragraph and make it easier to read and understand.--[[User:Cravene|Cravene]] ([[User talk:Cravene|talk]]) 21:33, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

I added a link and changed some sentence structure around in Proxemics. --[[User:Shearer2868|Shearer2868]] ([[User talk:Shearer2868|talk]]) 05:31, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link to nonverbal communication to help define the word emoticons--[[User:Monroe3191|Monroe3191]] ([[User talk:Monroe3191|talk]]) 18:30, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the wording and grammar in the gesture area. [[User:Crockfj|Crockfj]] ([[User talk:Crockfj|talk]]) 01:10, 4 May 2009 (UTC)

I added to Sign language and how it is beneficial for hearing children to be taught it. --[[User:Monroe3191|Monroe3191]] ([[User talk:Monroe3191|talk]]) 18:20, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Edited the entry for &quot;Creole&quot;, adding a clause to the last sentence of the first paragraph and breaking up a run-on sentence-[[User:Bryant3113|Bryant3113]] ([[User talk:Bryant3113|talk]]) 04:09, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Changed a link in &quot;Chronemics&quot; so that it directs you to the nonverbal communication section of the wikibook (instead of the wikipedia entry)-[[User:Bryant3113|Bryant3113]] ([[User talk:Bryant3113|talk]]) 04:03, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the &quot;Gesture&quot; entry a bit, clarifying and correcting grammar in the final example and rearranging  a couple sentences near the beginning-[[User:Bryant3113|Bryant3113]] ([[User talk:Bryant3113|talk]]) 03:58, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added to the example of the middle finger in Western society to express insult. In other countries other gestures are used to express similar meaning. Spain for example uses a hand flick under the chin. I viewed this gesture many times while living in Barcelona.[[User:Parsonl4|Parsonl4]] ([[User talk:Parsonl4|talk]]) 19:57, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I added an example of how different gestures can be perceived differently in different cultures and countries - [[omoto16]]

I added another example to the eye gaze section about what it means in different cultures - [[omoto16]]

I refined the section of &quot;eye gaze&quot; under nonverbal communication.  I changed the point of view to third person to maintain the objectivity of the topic and also fixed some grammatical errors.  I deleted several questions asked in the paragraph which I felt were not necessarily needed to further the understanding of the article.  I also refined some of the information to make the information flow more smoothly.

I revised a part in the eye gaze section. I added to the sentence about how Americans keep eye contact in the beginning and gradually let the eyes drift. I added on because that shows only one side, as a speaker. When as a listener, letting your eyes drift occasionally shows disinterest or rudeness. [[User:Lima3|Lima3]] ([[User talk:Lima3|talk]]) 21:24, 29 April 2009 (UTC) 

I slightly altered the section on &quot;gesture&quot;. Just tried to make the beginning a bit less stiff. Also added a link to the &quot;nonverbal communication&quot; page on Wikipedia-[[User:Bryant3113|Bryant3113]] ([[User talk:Bryant3113|talk]]) 03:52, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

thanks it needed to be lightened up i didnt even realize that [[User:Healowl|Healowl]] ([[User talk:Healowl|talk]]) 03:37, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the section of &quot;call systems&quot;. I removed a couple of spelling errors, changed a small amount of text to make it flow a bit better, and removed the second instance of a lengthy list in favor of a pronoun-[[User:Bryant3113|Bryant3113]] ([[User talk:Bryant3113|talk]]) 03:52, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited some of the grammar and concepts in the Bowing section. I just tweeked it a little bit so that it would be easier to read. The original also sounded like bowing was exclusive to Japan, so I edited it a little to show that it was common in both Asian and European (well, somewhat) countries. [[User:thisisme98|thisisme98]] ([[User talk:thisisme98|talk]])

I added more detail on how emoticons are used in electronic nonverbal communication. [[User:Barrona|Barrona]] ([[User talk:Barrona|talk]]) 04:14, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I removed the link to a image that did not exist. [allumbt]

I corrected a sentence in the sign language section.  The sentence didn't flow well so I turned it into two sentences.  There was also a &quot;be&quot; that I think was accidentally inserted into the sentence that didn't make sense, so I got ride of it.  ([[User:Tomlinson3500|Tomlinson3500]]) ([[User talk:Tomlinson3500|talk]])

I edited a sentence's structure because it sounded awkward.  I just flipped around the words to help it read smoothly.  I did this in the Nonverbal Communication section. ([[User:Tomlinson3500|Tomlinson3500]]) ([[User talk:Tomlinson3500|talk]])

I edited the grammar in one of the sentences of Bowing.  The word bowing should have been pluralized in the specific sentence, so I pluralized it.  ([[User:Tomlinson3500|Tomlinson3500]]) ([[User talk:Tomlinson3500|talk]])

In the physical section, I added an s to the word shoulder, because it was meant to be said in a plural setting.  I also got rid of a comma and added an and since there were only two words being listed. ([[User:Tomlinson3500|Tomlinson3500]]) ([[User talk:Tomlinson3500|talk]])

There had to be commas surrounding a statement in the gestures section, so I added that in to correct the grammar of a sentence.  ([[User:Tomlinson3500|Tomlinson3500]]) ([[User talk:Tomlinson3500|talk]])

I edited the wording of the ASL section. ([[User:marti211|marti211]]) ([[User talk:marti211|talk]])

I edited an awkward sentence in bowing. ([[User:johns588|johns588]]) ([[User talk:johns588|talk]])

I edited my own section (Morphology) as well as some things in gestures, just to make it sound a little more academic. I also added my ethnography for morphology about the Bangla language [[User:Turner3393|Turner3393]] ([[User talk:Turner3393|talk]]) 00:29, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited my own section &quot;Personal Space&quot; by fixing the link (that initially led to a blank page on Wiki for some reason) and I also fixed some grammatical errors and punctuation issues.--[[User:Reeh8419|Reeh8419]] ([[User talk:Reeh8419|talk]]) 05:46, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

Pidgin
After much work, I added an anchor for your reference here.  I believe I got it to work correctly now.

I added a link to the Wikipedia definition of Nonverbal communication. --[[User:Jamesk5|Jamesk5]] ([[User talk:Jamesk5|talk]]) 01:07, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added an example of nonverbal communication in the US --[[User:Jamesk5|Jamesk5]] ([[User talk:Jamesk5|talk]]) 01:12, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link to Charles Darwin in the History subsection [[User:Eck4068|Eck4068]] ([[User talk:Eck4068|talk]]) 04:54, 9 March 2009 (UTC) Eck4068

I included more specific examples in the main Nonverbal Communication section [[User:Eck4068|Eck4068]] ([[User talk:Eck4068|talk]]) 05:05, 9 March 2009 (UTC) Eck4068

I eliminated an unnecessary sentence in &quot;eye gaze.&quot; [[User:Johns588|Johns588]] ([[User talk:Johns588|talk]]) 06:04, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Does anybody know how to fix the size and font of the words so it's all the same? [[User:willarg|willarg]]

I added an internal Wikipedia link about Noam Chomsky to 1.2.6.9.1 Syntax so readers can find out more about his work. [[User:Anthronut12|Anthronut12]] ([[User talk:Anthronut12|talk]]) 22:48, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Thank you for the editing!  It looks better now! ([[User:Tomlinson3500|Tomlinson3500]]) ([[User talk:Tomlinson3500|talk]])

I corrected some grammar and clarified the middle finger introduction. [[User:Lindner6320|Lindner6320]] ([[User talk:Lindner6320|talk]]) 03:26, 10 March 2009 (UTC)Lindner6320

Edited grammar in the History section. [[User:Lindner6320|Lindner6320]] ([[User talk:Lindner6320|talk]]) 03:29, 10 March 2009 (UTC)Lindner6320

Added historical context to Proxemics [[User:Lindner6320|Lindner6320]] ([[User talk:Lindner6320|talk]]) 03:34, 10 March 2009 (UTC)Lindner6320

I added a link to the Nonverbal Communication section.  I linked to Ray Birdwhistell who was the anthropologist that first studied nonverbal communication and kinesics.  [[User:Cayab|Cayab]]

There was a photo next to the &quot;personal space&quot; heading under this section of a street fight in China. I changed it to a diagram representation of personal space limits because looking at it initially, the street fight picture didn't make sense to me. [[User:Nataliza|Nataliza]] ([[User talk:Nataliza|talk]]) 11:35, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

The proxemics diagram is very interesting to me.  I think that it is a very good representation of a person's 'bubble space'--[[User:Klukas8628|Klukas8628]] ([[User talk:Klukas8628|talk]]) 00:12, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed the personal space discussion to 'when concentrated on' instead of 'when overlooked' because overlooked was not in the right context.

I changed a sentence order inorder to make it clear what was being said, i also made 3 grammatical changes to mispelled words. [[user: acdalm|acdalm]]

I added an alternative definition to non verbal communication to make it more clear and also to give it more depth.[[User:Eangr|Eangr]] ([[User talk:Eangr|talk]]) 04:43, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

I added a paragraph about personal space in Latin American countries because the one paragraph only talked about the U.S..[[User:Muellep3|Muellep3]]

I added to the paragraph about eye contact, because it seemed to portray that eye contact or gaze is always negative. Gaze is often used as flirtation or a means of portraying attraction.

== '''Bowing''' ==
I added some things to Bowing. It seemed very short. I was recently in Japan so I knew the basic things. I did a little research on the direct numbers of angles. I also saw the girls in the stores on Saturday mornings along all the shops and elevators. They were mostly women too. I don't quite know why. Maybe to seem more innocent and friendly. [[User:Allenc30|Allenc30]] ([[User talk:Allenc30|talk]])

Hello. I edited some punctuation and such in the bowing section. Nothing too big, but I think it'll flow better. [[User:thisisme98|thisisme98]] ([[User talk:thisisme98|talk]])

All i did was just add the bowing link to the paragraph nothing big just thought it would fit better incorporated in the paragraph :) [[User:emerson2791|emerson2781]] ([[User talk:emerson2791|talk]])

I just made a few more grammatical/punctuation changes. I also changed a few sentences that were written in 2nd person to be written in 3rd person and re-wrote the last sentence for clarification on what was going on. --[[User:Klokow7568|Klokow7568]] ([[User talk:Klokow7568|talk]]) 23:27, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I added an image to this section from the wikipedia page [[User:Sinko6488|Sinko6488]] ([[User talk:Sinko6488|talk]]) 00:45, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed the word &quot;Oriental&quot; to &quot;Asian&quot; the word Oriental is potentially racist and offensive, so I changed it to Asian to make it more non-biased
[[User:Douglas772727|Douglas772727]] ([[User talk:Douglas772727|talk]]) 07:28, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a few more things about Bowing. I further explained what bowing meant in Korea because what was put before sounded like it was generalizing all of Asia when there are many aspects of bowing in the different countries that are not quite the same. [[User:Lima3|Lima3]] ([[User talk:Lima3|talk]]) 21:26, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

I added more specific examples of bowing and kneeling in the passage about Korea. I felt that it added more depth and detail to the passage as a whole.[[User:Kimt7|Kimt7]] ([[User talk:Kimt7|talk]]) 00:07, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

== '''Haptics''' ==
I changed a couple of the words to make it flow better. --[[User:Sinko6488|Sinko6488]] ([[User talk:Sinko6488|talk]]) 00:23, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I also just changed some of it to make sure it was in 3rd person [[User:Sinko6488|Sinko6488]] ([[User talk:Sinko6488|talk]]) 00:34, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Fixed some spacing things. [[User:Johns588|Johns588]] ([[User talk:Johns588|talk]]) 06:09, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

 ===Revisions===
I added some content to the &quot;Sapir-Whorf hypothesis&quot; entry, commenting on how the stuff about the Hopi ties in to my entry on &quot;Chronemics&quot;. I added a link from the former to the latter-[[User:Bryant3113|Bryant3113]] ([[User talk:Bryant3113|talk]]) 05:01, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I fixed some formatting errors in the &quot;Focal Vocabulary&quot; part of the &quot;Sapir-Whorf hypothesis&quot; entry. [[User:Nataliza|Nataliza]] ([[User talk:Nataliza|talk]]) 11:40, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added an example of what Displacement is. - [[egoronkin]]

I went through and did basic editing that people may have missed when typing their sections.

In gesture i moved the picture because it ran into the next article down [[User:Sinko6488|Sinko6488]] ([[User talk:Sinko6488|talk]]) 00:37, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I tweaked to wording a little in the section about &quot;paralanguage&quot; so that is adhered a little more to the third person rule. It also sounded a little more fluid.

I added a picture to the sociolinguistics page also that went with the text [[User:Sinko6488|Sinko6488]] ([[User talk:Sinko6488|talk]]) 00:41, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

(Snowden2661) In section 5 (Sociolinguistics) I made various editing and grammatical corrections so the content was more readable and more fluid. Such as changing:

I added a link that was interesting to the section on the Griots [[User:Seidens|Seidens]] ([[User talk:Seidens|talk]]) 07:34, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for adding that link! It was quite an engaging read, really absorbing! [[User:Anthronut12|Anthronut12]] ([[User talk:Anthronut12|talk]]) 23:43, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

*Gender Speech Contrasts
There are many differences between the way that men and women speak, one may not realize this when in everyday conversation but it is very apparent and obvious once looked into and studied. &lt;br&gt;
	In Western societies, women typically have a more standard way of speaking. They are more likely to changes the way they speak in order to elevate their status in the community. Women are more status conscious, this explains their use of standard 
speech forms. 

I added a little bit about the close-talker in the proxemics section. It's something most can relate to and I thought it fit in well. I also fixed a few typos. [[User:Barrona|Barrona]] ([[User talk:Barrona|talk]]) 04:24, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I removed a few sentences added above to my original paragraph because I found them to be highly irrelevant to the point.  Thanks for fixing my typos. 
----
In secton 5 i also removed an extra space that i saw, it made it look weird. [[User:Sinko6488|Sinko6488]] ([[User talk:Sinko6488|talk]]) 00:33, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a few more sentences to the bowing section &amp; added a link to the the word bowing so people can click there are go into wikipedia. [[User:Barrona|Barrona]] ([[User talk:Barrona|talk]]) 04:38, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed the losing the wallet to pickpocketing, i think it is more concise.  Also added an advantage to the Chinese outlook of grocery lines in order to balance the disadvantage.--[[User:Ely4205|Ely4205 Contribution]] ([[User talk:Ely4205|talk]]) 00:36, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I fixed some run-on sentences, grammatical errors, and the like in the Sociolinguistics section. I also added some content to make the paragraphs more fluid. [[User:Hamilton8152|Hamilton8152]] ([[User talk:Hamilton8152|talk]]) 01:05, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited my section on semantics, i felt that it needed to be better organized, and wanted to use some of my own ideas to help explain the topic better. [[User:Anderson2917|Anderson2917]] ([[User talk:Anderson2917|talk]]) 04:55, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I added more information on Morphology-how words are coined. I think the info i added is very important to this topic. I also tried to explained everything I've typed. [[User:Feazings|Feazings]] ([[User talk:Feazings|talk]])Wilson Wu

Thanks for doing that! I used the link to morphology (I think? It may have been the wikipedia link...) in my section on the Oral Tradition. --[[User:Emily Pierce|Emily Pierce]] ([[User talk:Emily Pierce|talk]]) 00:58, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I added information from personal experience to the Phonology section about the different sounds and emphases on various syllables.

I removed &quot;On the other side there are advantages, there is not any &quot;dinking-around&quot; when it comes to getting into a line. Either you stand in a formal line, or you lose your spot. &quot; from the second paragraph from proxemics because it was not very relevant to the context.--[[User:ZacharyShaffer|ZacharyShaffer]] ([[User talk:ZacharyShaffer|talk]]) 03:20, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed the order of this chapter and put the section I added to the chapter (Contact Language) after the topic &quot;Language and Thought&quot; because it might be easier for one to understand the concept of pidgins and creoles once after they grasp the concept of language. [[User:Arielle Amoranto|Arielle Amoranto]] ([[User talk:Arielle Amoranto|talk]]) 03:38, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

A student added a personal experience to my section about phonology which I had not considered up to this point. This will allow a connection to the student from the text.

I added a some more information to &quot;Displacement,&quot; and added another term that it connects to so it can be explained a little more.

I fixed some grammatical problems in the &quot;Gestures&quot; section to make it read more clearly.

I changed the sizing of the picture in the personal space section. [[User:Minshull9320|Minshull9320]] ([[User talk:Minshull9320|talk]]) 03:39, 9 March 2009 (UTC)


I also moved the picture to the top of the section instead of the bottom. [[User:Minshull9320|Minshull9320]] ([[User talk:Minshull9320|talk]]) 03:39, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed a little of the structure in the Chronemics section to make it flow better. [[User:Minshull9320|Minshull9320]] ([[User talk:Minshull9320|talk]]) 04:23, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I cleaned up some of the grammar and punctuation in the morphology section, as well as clarified the distinction between morphemes and words a bit. [[User:Douglas0393|Douglas0393]] ([[User talk:Douglas0393|talk]])

I made grammatical edits and added words to the &quot;songs and words&quot; subsection of music under Cultual Arts. --21:16, 26 April 2009 (UTC)[[User:W00887377|W00887377]] ([[User talk:W00887377|talk]])

== '''Standards in Language''' ==
I added the difference between written and spoken language to the morphemes section. - [[whitefj]]

I edited the language ideology section to make it more clear that they development of the ideology of indirectness for African Americans developed back in the roots of America's history, since it kind of sounded like it was more recent. - [[omoto16]]

I added a sentence to the Semantics part that I thought fit in. - [[egoronkin]]

I added more in the Pidgin section about the Africans developing their own pidgin language. - [[egoronkin]]

On the second sentence, I believe, I originally said that the term 'standard' was used in many different ways, and continued to talk about a working definition in sociolinguistics. However, I changed that to mean, &quot;in sociolinguistics, standards are used in different ways&quot;. That keeps the meaning in the scientific realm, rather than mixing popular terminology and scientific jargon. --[[User:ArkieOptrix|ArkieOptrix]] ([[User talk:ArkieOptrix|talk]]) 14:28, 8 March 2009 (UTC)


In that first paragraph, I also said linguistics were written down or codified in some way. I included the dictionary as an example, so there would be more clarity as to the use of codification in language. --[[User:ArkieOptrix|ArkieOptrix]] ([[User talk:ArkieOptrix|talk]]) 15:31 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed &quot;traditional and important ceremonies&quot; to simply 'ceremony' to fit in with the rest of the list that included governence and education. [[User:ArkieOptrix|ArkieOptrix]] ([[User talk:ArkieOptrix|talk]]) 15:32, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I separated the opening paragraph of the second paragraph to make it more readable. It is now a sentence to say that understanding standards are important, and another sentence saying why. This allows more flow and doesn't put too much information in one thought. --[[User:ArkieOptrix|ArkieOptrix]] ([[User talk:ArkieOptrix|talk]]) 15:40, 8 March 2009 (UTC)


I had mentioned that languages usually don't become a standard, since so few are codified. However, there was no reason, in my initial paragraph, as to why they wouldn't be codified. Therefore, I altered it to say that many vernacular languages or native languages become overshadowed by standard languages, and therefore languish and usually die. --[[User:ArkiOptrix|ArkieOptrix]] ([[User talk:ArkieOptrix|talk]]) 15:40, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I made a small grammatical change.  I removed a comma that broke up the sentence wrong. [[User wilber6199]] 

I made grammatical edits and added words to the &quot;songs and words&quot; subsection of music under Cultual Arts. --21:16, 26 April 2009 (UTC)[[User:W00887377|W00887377]] ([[User talk:W00887377|talk]])


Under the &quot;Nonverbal Communication&quot; heading I re-organized it by putting &quot;History&quot; section underneath the headin, and above &quot;Bowing section&quot; instead of in the middle of types of nonverbal communication. Makes more sense this way. 

In the &quot;Children Playing in U.S.&quot; section I edited some grammar and sentences to be more concise/clear.--[[User:True7302|True7302]] ([[User talk:True7302|talk]]) 23:02, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

Under the &quot;Call Systems&quot; section I bulletted the 6 call signals of humans, making them stand out more within the section.--[[User:True7302|True7302]] ([[User talk:True7302|talk]]) 23:09, 7 March 2009 (UTC)


Under &quot;Symbolism&quot; I added an example to give the reader a better understanding of what symbolism consists of. I thought it helped to give an example that could be relevant to real life.--[[User:Reeh8419|Reeh8419]] ([[User talk:Reeh8419|talk]]) 05:39, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

For the Symbolism section I just added another example of how from culture to culture symbols can change. I thought it would help explain and make it easier to understand symbolism.--[[User:Grotjahn2975|Grotjahn2975]] ([[User talk:Grotjahn2975|talk]]) 21:24, 9 March 2009 (UTC)
 
I did some editing under ‘play’ under non-verbal communication and symbolism. I just made a few revisions to some of the sentences in order to make them flow more smoothly. --[[User:Reeh8419|Reeh8419]] ([[User talk:Reeh8419|talk]]) 06:57, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I really liked the page about personal space, I thought it was very informing. I added the phrases of how to tell someone to give you more space. You may want to rewrite the sentence if you don't like how its written. --[[User:Woolsey8578|Woolsey8578]] ([[User talk:Woolsey8578|talk]]) 17:22, 8 March 2009 (UTC)


Under the Creole section I added an extra explanation of what a Creole is and an example of a culture that used a pidgin and it became the native language after being taught to the next generation of speakers.--[[User:Auldj|Auldj]] ([[User talk:Auldj|talk]]) 19:17, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I removed a broken gif link. [[User:Lindner6320|Lindner6320]] ([[User talk:Lindner6320|talk]]) 03:37, 10 March 2009 (UTC)Lindner6320
===Sociolinguistics===
You should really attach your references to the list at the bottom instead of at the bottom of your article.

I'm sorry I attached the references in the middle instead of the bottom. I didn't know how to.[[User:Snowden2661|Snowden2661]] ([[User talk:Snowden2661|talk]]) 04:21, 10 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;

===References===
For the &quot;Rowe, Bruce M.&quot; reference I added a link as to help the user.

For Morphology, you should add your links to the bottom of the page.  I would do it for you but I don't know what parts you need to cite from those pages.

== nonverbal communication ==

I edited a little of the Relation Explanation/Analogy to be more fluid. I also added my own ethnographic example. [[User:Eck4068|Eck4068]] ([[User talk:Eck4068|talk]]) 04:51, 9 March 2009 (UTC) Eck4068

I divided paragraphs for Nonverbal Communication [[User:Eck4068|Eck4068]] ([[User talk:Eck4068|talk]]) 04:52, 9 March 2009 (UTC) Eck4068

I elaborated on the ethnographic example in Relating Explanation/Analogy. 
[[User:Eck4068|Eck4068]] ([[User talk:Eck4068|talk]]) 05:01, 9 March 2009 (UTC) Eck4068

==Symbolism and Communication==
I contributed more information on symbolism and what a symbol is.  I also added the types of symbols there and accompanied it with the explanations of those types.  I also added another section under the symbolism and communication chapter on metaphors.  I explained what a metaphor is as well as describing the types of metaphors.  Both edits I added the wikipedia link for the specific subjects and provided specific examples for certain points.--[[User:Marianna White|Marianna White]] ([[User talk:Marianna White|talk]]) 06:45, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

==Language and Thought==
I contributed to Universal Grammar in relation to Noam Chomsky.  I wrote of language acquisiton and how children are born with an inherent idea of all languages and are then brought up in an environment with a specific language that they then pursue to learn and speak.

I also wrote of cognitive therapy and how it is used to help patients with their inner turmoils--[[User:Klukas8628|Klukas8628]] ([[User talk:Klukas8628|talk]]) 00:09, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

== Language Change ==

I made some changes to the section that cited pidgin languages as being only monogenerational and only used for first-time contact between people groups. I included a reference to Tok Pisin, the pidgin language of Papua New Guinea because not only is it a multi-generational pidgin language but the tribal groups of the island who use it had already been in contact with one another before the introduction of Tok Pisin, but had simply had no common language of communication unless members of one group learned the language of another group. --[[User:Whiteh|Whiteh]] ([[User talk:Whiteh|talk]]) 06:42, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

I added some more information about Native American language and storytelling because the previous information was detailed enough.
&lt;ref&gt; http://digital.library.okstate.edu/KAPPLER/Vol2/Toc.htm &lt;/ref&gt; [[User:Chamblc|Chamblc]] ([[User talk:Chamblc|talk]]) 19:28, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

In the humor section, i not only added many new ideas to the section, but i completely revised the whole paragraph, keeping only 20 percent of the old insufficient one, reorganizing and contributing to a new, better and more insightful section.[[User:druryj]]

I added an example of a culture that uses a creole as their native language in order to explain the concept of creoles a little bit more fully and to help people understand what exactly creoles are. I also added some information to a chunk in this section that is very out of place in order to make it seem like it was in the right place and also so it seemed like it pertained to the subject at hand. There were a few small minor edits I made in order for the section to make sense too. [[User:Hurleyn2|Hurleyn2]] ([[User talk:Hurleyn2|talk]]) 03:01, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I added some information on the background of Creole's and their place in history.  I also edited a statement in order to clarify what the difference was between a Pidgin and a Creole[[User:Hiattm|Hiattm]] ([[User talk:Hiattm|talk]]) 19:19, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I revised the Hawaiian Pidgin section to clarify why the language came about. The immigrants to Hawaii came to work on the sugar plantations, not to do business. They were brought in by the American plantation owners because they provided cheap labor. Also, I added more information on the current use of Pidgin in Hawaii to clarify that the language is still in use.


I made a small change to the section about Noam Chomsky and his theories. There was a part that mentioned something having to do with his personal character I thought was a little unnecessary and unrelated to the topic.
[[User:Ketchoa|Ketchoa]] ([[User talk:Ketchoa|talk]]) 04:02, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

== Speech Sounds ==

This section could use more info. I added a paragraph before the IPA chart which was previously directly under the heading, which is less than ideal. If the chart (or this section, for that matter) is important to the article, then the chart should be discussed and explained further, and otherwise removed.--[[User:Capronk|Capronk]] ([[User talk:Capronk|talk]]) 22:32, 1 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Definition 1''': A non zero element 'a' of a commutative ring R is called a '''zero divisor''', if there exists some non zero element b in R such that ab=0.

For example, in the ring of 2-by-2 matrices, the matrix
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;1\\
2&amp;2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
is a zero divisor because
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;1\\
2&amp;2\end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;1\\
-1&amp;-1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}-2&amp;1\\
-2&amp;1\end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;1\\
2&amp;2\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Definition 2''': A commutative ring is called an '''integral domain''', if it has no zero divisors. Equivalently, a commutative ring is called an integral domain if &lt;math&gt;ab=0\Rightarrow a=0\ or\ b=0&lt;/math&gt; or in other words &lt;math&gt;a\ne0,b\ne 0\Rightarrow ab\ne 0\forall a,b\in R&lt;/math&gt;.

For example &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; are all integral domains. &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_6&lt;/math&gt; is not an integral domain (2.3=0 here) but &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_5&lt;/math&gt; is.

'''Definition 3''': A ring (R,+,.) is called a '''division ring''' if it forms a group with respect to the operation '.'. If that group is abelian then the ring is called a '''field'''. We will emphasize the properties of a field again:

A field F is a set together with two operations, usually called addition and multiplication, and denoted by + and ·, respectively, such that the following axioms hold:

*Closure of F under addition and multiplication 
For all a, b in F, both a + b and a · b are in F (or more formally, + and · are binary operations on F). 

*Associativity of addition and multiplication 
For all a, b, and c in F, the following equalities hold: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c and a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c. 

*Commutativity of addition and multiplication 
For all a and b in F, the following equalities hold: a + b = b + a and a · b = b · a. 

*Additive and multiplicative identity 
There exists an element of F, called the additive identity element and denoted by 0, such that for all a in F, a + 0 = a. Likewise, there is an element, called the multiplicative identity element and denoted by 1, such that for all a in F, a · 1 = a. For technical reasons, the additive identity and the multiplicative identity are required to be distinct. 

*Additive and multiplicative inverses 
For every a in F, there exists an element −a in F, such that a + (−a) = 0. Similarly, for any a in F other than 0, there exists an element a−1 in F, such that a · a−1 = 1. (The elements a + (−b) and a · b−1 are also denoted a − b and a/b, respectively.) In other words, subtraction and division operations exist. 

*Distributivity of multiplication over addition 
For all a, b and c in F, the following equality holds: a · (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c). 

Clearly every field is a division ring. The easiest examples of fields are &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. A division ring which is not a field is the field of quaternions, described as follows:

Consider &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4&lt;/math&gt;. Let the symbol 1 stand for (1,0,0,0); i for (0,1,0,0); j for (0,0,1,0) and k for (0,0,0,1). Clearly every element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0(1)+\alpha_1(i)+\alpha_2(j)+\alpha_3(k)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; is some real number. We endow addition and multiplication on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4&lt;/math&gt; according to the following rules: Addition of two elements &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0(1)+\alpha_1(i)+\alpha_2(j)+\alpha_3(k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_0(1)+\beta_1(i)+\beta_2(j)+\beta_3(k)&lt;/math&gt; is simply &lt;math&gt;(\alpha_0+\beta_0)(1)+(\alpha_1+\beta_1)(i)+(\alpha_2+\beta_2)(j)+(\alpha_3+\beta_3)(k)&lt;/math&gt;. For multiplication note that if we impose the following rules: 

:&lt;math&gt;i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = i j k = -1,&lt;/math&gt;

then these determine all the possible products of ''i'', ''j'', and ''k''. 

For example, since
:&lt;math&gt;-1 = i j k,&lt;/math&gt;
right-multiplying both sides by ''k'' gives
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
-k &amp; = i j k k, \\
-k &amp; = i j (-1), \\
 k &amp; = i j. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
All the other possible products can be determined by similar methods, and this gives the following table:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
ij &amp; = k, &amp; \qquad ji &amp; = -k, \\
jk &amp; = i, &amp; kj &amp; = -i, \\
ki &amp; = j, &amp; ik &amp; = -j. 
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

For two elements &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0(1)+\alpha_1(i)+\alpha_2(j)+\alpha_3(k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_0(1)+\beta_1(i)+\beta_2(j)+\beta_3(k)&lt;/math&gt;, their product is determined by the products of the i,j,k's according to the above rules and the distributive law. This gives the following expression:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_0\beta_0-\alpha_1\beta_1-\alpha_2\beta_2-\alpha_3\beta_3)(1)+(\alpha_0\beta_1+\alpha_1\beta_0+\alpha_2\beta_3-\alpha_3\beta_2)(i)+(\alpha_0\beta_2-\alpha_1\beta_3+\alpha_2\beta_0+\alpha_3\beta_1)(j)+(\alpha_0\beta_3-\alpha_1\beta_2-\alpha_2\beta_1+\alpha_3\beta_0)(k)&lt;/math&gt;

It is left to the reader to verify that the thus obtained algebraic structure is indeed a division ring.

==Basic Theorems on Integral domains and fields==

'''Theorem 1.11''': Let R be a commutative ring. Then R is an integral domain if and only if &lt;math&gt;ab=ac\Rightarrow b=c&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in R, a\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''': '''&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;''': Clearly ab=ac implies a(b-c)=0. As a is non zero and R is an integral domain so b-c=0 or b=c.

'''&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;''': Suppose that for some nonzero a we have ab=0. But then ab=a0 and by our hypothesis b=0.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Remark''': Basically the above theorem means that integral domains are the rings where cancellation laws hold. In rings where cancellation laws do not hold we are bound to have some zero divisors.

'''Theorem 1.12''': Every field is an integral domain.'''

'''Proof''': Let R be any field. Let ab=ac, where &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then as &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; exists so multiplying it on both sides of ab=ac we have b=c, i.e. cancellation laws hold. By the previous theorem R is an integral domain.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark''': The converse of the above result may not be true as is evident from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 1.13''': Every finite integral domain is a field.

'''Proof''': Let R be a finite integral domain and let &lt;math&gt;x\in R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x\ne 0,1&lt;/math&gt;. It suffices to show that x is a unit. Now the list 1,x,x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;... can't go on forever as R is finite. Suppose, without losing generality that for some i&lt;j, x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;=x&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;. Then x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;-x&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;=0 and since i&lt;j, so x&lt;sup&gt;j-i&lt;/sup&gt; is a legitimate member of R (in fact so is x&lt;sup&gt;j-i-1&lt;/sup&gt;). We have x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;(1-x&lt;sup&gt;j-i&lt;/sup&gt;)=x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;-x&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;=0. As x is non zero and R is an integral domain so x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is non zero. But then 1-x&lt;sup&gt;j-i&lt;/sup&gt;=0 or x&lt;sup&gt;j-i&lt;/sup&gt;=1. It follows that as  x&lt;sup&gt;j-i-1&lt;/sup&gt;x=1. Hence x is a unit with inverse x&lt;sup&gt;j-i-1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;
  
'''Corollary''': The ring &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{p\mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; is a field iff p is prime.

'''Proof''': '''&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;''': We will denote elements of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{p\mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; by numbers 0,1,...p-1. Now suppose p was composite and p=ab where 1&lt;a,b&lt;p. Now ab=0 in &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{p\mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; although a,b are themselves nonzero. This contradicts the fact that &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{p\mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain.

&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt; Suppose p is prime. It suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{p\mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain. Let a,b be nonzero elements of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{p\mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; such that ab=0 there. But then p|ab and as p is prime so p|a or p|b. That's just another way of saying that a=0 or b=0 in &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{p\mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{p\mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.14''': Let R be a ring such that the equation ax=b has a solution for all &lt;math&gt;a(\ne 0)\in R&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;b\in R&lt;/math&gt;. Then R is a division ring.

'''Proof''': We first show that R has no zero divisors followed by the fact that it has a unity. Let ab=0 where a,b are non zero. Now abx=0 for each x in R. Ler r be any element of R. Now by the hypothesis there exists an x such that bx=r. Using this x we see that ar=0 for any r in R. Now consider ax=a. Clearly there is a c such that ac=a. But ar=0 implies that ac=0=a. This contradicts the fact that a was chosen to be nonzero. So R has no zero divisors. Now let e be the solution of ax=a. Obviously e is nonzero. Then ae=a and a(e-e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)=ae-ae&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=a-ae=0 and so e=e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then for any x (xe-x)e=xe-xe=0 and as e is nonzero so xe=x following which R has unity. (The fact that ex=x is similarly proved.)

Now if a is non zero, then ax=e has a solution a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Also (a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;a-e)a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;e-ea&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=0 and so as a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is non zero we have a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;a-e=0 or a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;a=e. Then aa&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;a=e and so a is a unit. Similarly all non zero elements are units.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]] 

'''Kesari''' or '''Kesari baath''' is a sweet dessert dish that is traditionally prepared in South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] for special occasions. Most often it is prepared with Semolina (cream of wheat), but that maybe substituted with 'beaten rice' (aval) or at times even with rice.

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup white [[Cookbook:Semolina|Semolina]]
* 4 cups water
* 1/4 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashew]] nuts
* 1/4 cup white [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] powder
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] (or substitute [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]])
* 3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Jaggery|Jaggery]] or [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]]
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Pineapple|Pineapple]] pieces(optional)
* A few strands of [[Cookbook:Saffron|Saffron]](optional)

==Procedure==
# Lightly toast the semolina in a deep-bottom pot, while boiling water in another pot at the same time.
# Soak the saffron in a teaspoon of warm milk.
# When the semolina is golden brown, add the boiling water into it while stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
# Add the sugar, the pineapple and the spices to the mix while stirring.
# Keep stirring well and cook on low heat till the mixture comes together well.
# Heat the ghee or butter in a separate pan and fry cashews to golden brown. 
# Add raisins and fry for a few more seconds or until they swell up. 
# Add the nuts and raisins to the Kesari.
# Add the saffron milk along with the saffron and mix well.
# Serve hot.

Serves 4.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Java Applet ==

The Java Applet section seems to have a little of a POV issue.  As with all the plugin platforms, they all need to be installed by the browser, and they are usually not installed by default - rather, I believe that Flash may have been marketed as easier to create animations or otherwise the most suitable as an HTML plugin.  --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 16:13, 10 February 2009 (UTC)


== For beginners? ==
As a C++ programmer I find all this quite interesting, but since this wikibook is addressed towards beginners the reader should imho not be bothered with client-server architecture at this point (i.e.: before he hasn't even written one line of code). After all this is a book and those are usually meant to be read one page after another.

:I agree; it's teh same as the previous module concerning the compilation of Java programs, where it goes in depth into the many different ways a java project can be compiled, this chapter could be striped down to just explaining the use of the java command, I'd go as far to say we should simply delete this module and keep compiling and executing Java programs to one module, then mention the different methods of execution in later chapters or appendixes, far easier for the beginner. --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 00:05, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

== Navigation Bar ==
the green navigation bar at the top of each page should also be at the bottom of each page, its handy at the top as it lets u skip through topics, but when u get to the bottom of reading a page it would be nice not to have to scroll back to the top.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Commands ===
----

Commands are basically divided into C-defined ones, procedures, and aliases (and, from Tcl 8.5 onwards, ensembles). You can rename any command with
 rename oldname newname
To delete a command (make it no more reachable), use the empty string as new name:
 rename oldname {}
Introspection: Get a list of all defined commands with
 info commands

==== C-defined commands ====
These are implemented in C and registered to be available in the Tcl interpreter. They can come from the Tcl core, or a loaded shared library (DLL) - for instance Tk.

To get a list of built-in commands, subtract the result of ''info procs'' from that of ''info commands'':
 set builtins {}
 set procs [info procs]
 foreach cmd [info commands] {
    if {[lsearch -exact $procs $cmd] == -1} {lappend builtins $cmd}
 }
The following C-defined commands are available in a fresh tclsh. For detailed documentation, see the respective man pages, e.g. at http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/ - I will characterize each only very briefly:
; after : group of commands for timed events
; after ''msec ?script?'' : waits, or executes the script after, some time
; append ''varName arg..'': appends the arguments to a string variable
; array : group of commands for arrays
; binary : group of commands for binary scanning and formatting
; break : terminate current loop
; case : deprecated, use '''switch'''
; catch ''script ?varName?'' : catch possible error in ''script''
; cd ''path'' : change working directory
; clock : group of commands dealing with date and time
; close ''handle'' : closes a channel (file, socket, etc.)
; concat ''list..'' : make one space-separated list of the arguments
; continue : start next turn of current loop
; encoding : group of commands dealing with character set encoding
; eof ''handle'' : 1 if channel is at end of file, else 0
; error ''message ?info? ?code?'' : raise an error with the given message
; eval ''arg..'' : evaluate the arguments as script
; exec ''file arg..'' : execute a separate process
; exit ''?int?'' : terminate this process, return status 0..127
; expr ''arg..'' : arithmetic and logic engine, using C-like syntax and functions (variables referenced with $name). In addition, from Tcl 8.4 there are ''eq'' and ''ne'' operators for string equal or not; from 8.5, also ''in'' and ''ni'' operators for list inclusion or not
 expr {&quot;foo&quot; in {foo bar grill}} == 1
The argument to expr should in most cases be {braced}. This prevents the Tcl parser from substituting variables in advance, while ''expr'' itself has to parse the value from the string. In a braced expression ''expr'' can parse variable references itself, and get their numeric value directly where possible. Much faster, usually. The only exception, where bracing should not be used, is if you want to substitute operators from variables:
 foreach op {+ - * /} {puts [expr 1 $op 2]}
; fblocked ''handle'' : returns 1 if the last input operation exhausted all available input, else 0
; fconfigure ''handle -option value...'' : configure a channel, e.g. its encoding or line-end translation
; fcopy ''handle1 handle2'' : copy data from handle1 to handle2
; file : group of commands dealing with files
; fileevent : group of commands dealing with events from channels (readable, writable) but not files
; flush ''handle'' : make sure the channel's buffer is written out. Useful after ''puts -nonewline''
; for ''initbody condition stepbody body'' : loop, somehow similar to C's ''for''
; foreach ''varlist list ?varlist list...? body'' : loop over one or more lists, The ''varlist''s can be a single or multiple varNames. Example:
 % foreach {x y} {1 0  1 2  0 2  0 0} {puts &quot;x:$x, y:$y&quot;}
 x:1, y:0
 x:1, y:2
 x:0, y:2
 x:0, y:0
; format ''fstring arg..'' : put the arguments %-formatted into fstring, similar to C's sprintf()
; gets ''handle ?varName?'' : read a line from handle. If variable is given, assigns the line to it and returns the number of characters read; else returns the line. Guaranteed to be safe against buffer overflows
; glob ''?-options? pattern..'' : list of files matching the glob pattern (which can contain * and ? wildcards)
; global ''varName..'' : declare the given variable(s) as global
; history : list the last interactive commands
; if ''condition ?then? body1 ?elseif condition body2...? ??else? bodyN?'' : conditional
; incr ''varName ?amount?'' : increments the integer variable by given amount (defaults to 1). Use negative amount to decrement
; info : group of commands for introspection
; interp : group of commands for interpreters
; join ''list ?separator?'' : Turn a list into a string, with separator between elements (defaults to &quot; &quot;)
; lappend ''varName arg..'' : appends the arguments to the list variable. Can also be used to make sure a variable exists:
 lappend x ;# corresponds to: if {![info exists x]} {set x &quot;&quot;}
; lindex ''list int..'' : retrieve an element from the list by integer index(es)
; linsert ''list int arg..'' : inserts the arguments at int position into list
; list ''?arg..?'' : creates a list form the arguments
; llength ''list'' : length of the list
; load ''filename ?name?'' : loads a shared library (DLL)
; lrange ''list from to'' : returns a sublist at integer indexes from-to
; lreplace ''list from to arg..'' : replaces the sublist in list with the arguments
; lsearch ''?-options? list element'' : searches the list for the element, returns its integer index, or -1 if not found. Can be used to select a subset of elements from a list (using the -all option)
; lset ''varName int.. value'' : sets an existing element in the named list variable, indexed by integer(s), to the given value
; lsort ''?-options? list'' : sorts the list
; namespace : group of commands dealing with namespaces
; open ''name ?mode ?permissions??'' : opens a file or pipe, returns the handle
; package : group of commands dealing with packages
; pid ''?handle?'': returns the id of the current process. Can also return the list of pids for a pipeline given the pipeline channel

; proc ''name arglist body'' : defines a procedure
; puts ''?-nonewline? ?channel? string'' : outputs a line to the given channel (default stdout) To prevent errors from closed pipe (like ''more'' or ''head''), use
 proc puts! str {if [catch {puts $str}] exit}
; pwd : returns the current working directory
; read ''handle ?int?'' : reads int bytes from handle (all if int not given)
; regexp ''?-options? re string ?varName...?'' : regular expression matching of re in string, possibly assigning parenthesized submatches to the given variables
; regsub ''?-options? re value substring ?varName?'': substitutes occurrences of the regular expression re in value with substring. If varName is given, assigns the new value to it, and returns the number of substitutions; else returns the new value
; rename ''cmdName1 cmdName2'': renames a command from cmdName1 to cmdName2, or deletes cmdName1 if cmdName2 is {}
; return ''?value?'' : exits from the current proc or sourced script
; scan ''string format ?varName...?'' : extracts values by %-format in string to the given variables. Similar to C's sscanf()
; seek ''channelId offset ?origin?'' : moves pointer in file to the given position
; set ''varName ?value?'' : sets variable to value if given, and returns the variable's value
; socket ''?-myaddr addr? ?-myport myport? ?-async? host port'' : open the client side of a TCP connection as a channel
; socket ''-server command ?-myaddr addr? port'' : open the server side of a TCP connection, register a handler callbacvk command for client requests
; source ''filename'' : evaluate the contents of the given file
; split ''list ?charset?'' : splits a string into a list, using any of the characters in charset string as delimiters (defaults to &quot; &quot;)
; string : group of commands dealing with strings
; subst ''?-options? string'' : performs command, variable, and/or backslash substitutions in string
; switch ''?-options? ?--? value alternatives'' : performs one of the alternatives if the value matches
; tell ''handle'' : return the byte position inside a file
; time ''body ?int?'' : runs the body for int times (default 1), returns how many microseconds per iteration were used
; trace : group of commands to tie actions to variables or commands
; unset ''varName..'' : delete the given variable(s)
; update ''?idletasks?'' : services events
; uplevel ''?level? body'' : evaluates the body up in the call stack 
; upvar ''?level? varName localVarName...'' : ties the given variables up in the call stack to the given local variables. Used for calling by reference, e.g. for arrays
; variable ''varName ?value ?varName value...??'' : declare the variables as being non-local in a namespace
; vwait ''varName'' : suspend execution until the given variable has changed. Starts event loop, if not active yet
; while ''condition body'': performs body as long as condition is not 0

==== Procedures ====
Procedures in Tcl cover what other languages call procedures, subroutines, or functions. They always return a result (even if it is the empty string &quot;&quot;), so to call them functions might be most appropriate. But for historical reasons, the Tcl command to create a function is called '''proc''' and thus people most often call them procedures.
 proc name argumentlist body
Examples:
 proc sum {a b} {return [expr {$a+$b}]}
The ''return'' is redundant, as the proc returns anyway when reaching its end, and returning its last result:
 proc sum {a b} {expr {$a+$b}}

The following variant is more flexible, as it takes any number of arguments (the special argument name ''args'' collects all remaining arguments into a list, which is the value of the parameter ''args''):
 proc sum args {
     set res 0
     foreach arg $args {set res [expr {$res + $arg}]}
     return $res
 }
An elegant but less efficient alternative builds a string by ''join''ing the ''args'' with plus signs, and feeds that to ''expr'':
 proc sum args {expr [join $args +]}
If an argument in a proc definition is a list of two elements, the second is taken as default value if not given in the call (&quot;Sir&quot; in this example):
 proc greet {time {person Sir}} {return &quot;good $time, $person&quot;}

 % greet morning John
 good morning, John
 % greet evening
 good evening, Sir

'''Introspection:''' Get the names of all defined procedures with
 info procs
There are also '''info''' subcommands to get the argument list, and possible default arguments, and body of a proc. The following example combines them to recreate the textual form of a proc, given its name (''corp'' being ''proc'' in reverse):
 proc corp name {
    set argl {}
    foreach arg [info args $name] {
       if [info default $name $arg def] {lappend arg $def}
       lappend argl $arg
    }
    list proc $name $argl [info body $name]
 }
Using '''rename''', you can overload any command, including the C-coded ones. First rename the original command to something else, then reimplement it with the same signature, where ultimately the original is called. Here is for instance an overloaded ''proc'' that reports if a procedure is defined more than once with same name:
 rename proc _proc
 _proc proc {name argl body} {
    if {[info procs $name] eq $name} {
        puts &quot;proc $name redefined in [info script]&quot;
    }
    _proc $name $argl $body
 }

'''Named arguments:''' Arguments to commands are mostly by position. But it's very easy to add the behavior known from Python or Ada, that arguments can be named in function calls, which documents the code a bit better, and allows any order of arguments.

The idea (as found in Welch's book) is to use an array (here called &quot;&quot; - the &quot;anonymous array&quot;) keyed by argument names. Initially, you can set some default values, and possibly override them with the args of the proc (which has to be paired, i.e. contain an even number of elements):

 proc named {args defaults} {
    upvar 1 &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;
    array set &quot;&quot; $defaults
    foreach {key value} $args {
      if {![info exists ($key)]} {
         set names [lsort [array names &quot;&quot;]]
         error &quot;bad option '$key', should be one of: $names&quot;
      }
      set ($key) $value
    }
 }

Usage example:

 proc replace {s args} {
   named $args {-from 0 -to end -with &quot;&quot;}
   string replace $s $(-from) $(-to) $(-with)
 }

Testing:

 % replace suchenwirth -from 4 -to 6 -with xx
 suchxxirth
 % replace suchenwirth -from 4 -to 6 -witha xx
 bad option '-witha', should be one of: -from -to -with

==== Argument passing by name or value ====
Normally, arguments to commands are passed by value (as constants, or with $ prefixed to a variable name). This securely prevents side-effects, as the command will only get a copy of the value, and not be able to change the variable.

However, sometimes just that is wanted. Imagine you want a custom command to set a variable to zero. In this case, at call time specify the name of the variable (without $), and in the proc use '''upvar''' to link the name (in the scope &quot;1 up&quot;, i.e. the caller's) to a local variable. I usually put a &quot;_&quot; before arguments that are variable names (e.g. _var), and ''upvar'' to the same name without &quot;_&quot; (e.g. var):

 % proc zero _var {upvar 1 $_var var; set var 0}

 % set try 42
 42
 % zero try
 0
 % set try
 0
If you often use call by reference, you could indicate such arguments with a special pattern (e.g. &amp;arg) and have the following code generate the necessary '''upvar'''s:
 proc use_refs { {char &amp;}} {
    foreach v [uplevel 1 {info locals}] {
        if [string match $char* $v] {
            uplevel 1 &quot;upvar 1 \${$v} [string range $v 1 end]&quot;
        }
    }
 }
That's all. This command is preferrably called first inside a proc, and upvars all arguments that begin with a specific character, the default being &quot;&amp;&quot; - it runs code like

 upvar 1 ${&amp;foo} foo
in the caller's scope. Testing:

 proc test_refs {a &amp;b} {
    use_refs
    puts a=$a,b=$b
    set b new_value
 }
 % set bar 42
 42
 % test_refs foo bar
 a=foo,b=42
So the values of a (by value) and b (by reference) are readable; and the side effect of changing b in the caller did also happen:

 % set bar
 new_value

==== Variable scope ====
Inside procedures, variables are by default local. They exist only in the proc, and are cleared up on ''return''. However, you can tie local variables to others higher in the call stack (e.g. in the caller), up to the topmost global scope. Examples:
 proc demo arg {
    global g
    set    g 0            ;# will effect a lasting change in g
    set local 1           ;# will disappear soon
    set ::anotherGlobal 2 ;# another way to address a global variable
    upvar 1 $arg myArg    ;# make myArg point at a variable 1-up
    set          myArg 3  ;# changes that variable in the calling scope
 }

==== Aliases ====
One can also define a command as an alias to a sequence of one or more words, which will be substituted for it before execution. (The funny {} arguments are names of the source and target interpreter, which typically is the current one, named by the empty string {} or &quot;&quot;). Examples:
 interp alias {} strlen {} string length
 interp alias {} cp     {} file copy -force
Introspection: Get the names of all defined aliases with
 interp aliases

----

=== Advanced concepts ===
----
==== Interpreters ====
Tcl being an interpreted (plus on-the-fly byte-compiled) language, an interpreter is of course a central kind of object. Every time Tcl is running, at least one interpreter is running, who takes scripts and evaluates them. 

One can also create further &quot;slave&quot; interpreters to encapsulate data and processes, which again can have their &quot;sub-slaves&quot;, etc., ultimately forming a tree hierarchy. Examples:

 % interp create helper
 helper
 % helper eval {expr 7*6}
 42
 % interp delete helper
 % helper eval {expr 1+2}
 invalid command name &quot;helper&quot;

By deleting an interpreter, all its global (and namespaced) variables are freed too, so you can use this for modularisation and encapsulation, if needed.

In particular, '''safe interpreters''' have intentionally limited capabilities (for instance, access to the file system or the Web) so that possibly malicious code from over the Web cannot create major havoc.

Introspection: The following command lists the sub-interpreters (&quot;slaves&quot;) of the current interpreter:
 % interp slaves

==== Ensembles ====
Ensembles, (from Tcl 8.5 on), are commands that are composed out of sub-commands according to a standard pattern. Examples include Tcl's built-in '''chan''' and '''clock''' commands. Dispatching of subcommands, as well as informative error message for non-existing subcommands, is built-in. Subcommands are in a ''dict'' structure called &quot;-map&quot;, with alternating name and action. Very simple example:
 namespace ensemble create -command foo -map \
       {bar {puts Hello} grill {puts World}}
creates a command ''foo'' that can be called like
 % foo bar
 Hello
 % foo grill
 World
 % foo help
 unknown or ambiguous subcommand &quot;help&quot;: must be foo, or bar
Obviously, ensembles are also a good base for implementing object orientation, where the command is the name of the objects, and the map contains its methods.

'''Introspection:''' Serialize an ensemble's map with
 namespace ensemble configure $name -map

==== Namespaces ====

Namespaces are containers for procedures, non-local variables, and other namespaces. They form a tree structure, with the root at the global namespace named &quot;::&quot;. Their names are built with :: as separators too, so ''::foo::bar'' is a child of ''::foo'', which is a child of ''::'' (similar to pathnames on Unix, where / is the separator as well as the root).

In a nutshell, a namespace is a separate area, or ''scope'', where procedures and variables are visible and private to that scope.  

To create a namespace, just ''eval''uate some script (which may be empty) in it:
 namespace eval ::foo {}
Now you can use it to define procedures or variables:
 proc ::foo::test {} {puts Hello!}
 set  ::foo::var 42

To get rid of a namespace (and clean up all its variables, procs, and child namespaces):
 namespace delete ::foo

Introspection:
 namespace children ::
 info var namespace::*
 info commands namespace::*

The following code gives an approximate size in bytes consumed by the variables and children of a Tcl namespace (of which ::, the global namespace, is of particular interest - all the (grand)*children are also added). If you call this proc repeatedly, you can observe whether data are piling up:

 proc namespace'size ns {
   set sum [expr wide(0)]
   foreach var [info vars ${ns}::*] {
       if {[info exists $var]} {
           upvar #0 $var v
           if {[array exists v]} {
               incr sum [string bytelength [array get v]]
           } else {
               incr sum [string bytelength $v]
           }
       }
   }
   foreach child [namespace children $ns] {
       incr sum [namespace'size $child]
   }
   set sum
 }
Usage example:

 % puts [namespace'size ::]
 179914

==== Threads ====
Tcl users have traditionally been skeptical about threads (lightweight concurrent sub-processes) - the event loop model has proved pretty powerful, and simpler to debug. Originally from Tk, the event loop has moved into Tcl and serves
* fileevents (more on channels than real files)
* timed events
* UI events (mouse or keyboard actions by the user)
 
However, there is a growing tendency to enable threads in Tcl builds. The underlying model is that every thread runs in an interpreter of its own, so it is mostly encapsulated from the rest of the world. Communication between threads must be done with explicit methods.

=== Packages and extensions ===

Packages are Tcl's recommended way to modularize software, especially supportive libraries. The user most often uses the command
 package require name ?version?
One can write packages in pure Tcl, or as wrappers for extensions which come with one or more compiled shared libraries (plus optionally one or more Tcl scripts). Popular extensions are:
* BWidget (adds useful widgets to Tk - more below)
* Expect (supports remote execution over networks)
* Img (adds support of additional image file formats to Tk)
* snack (sound input/output)
* Snit (OO extension, with support for &quot;megawidgets&quot; in Tk)
* sqlite (a tiny yet powerful SQL database)
* tcllib (a collection of pure-Tcl packages - see below)
* TclOO (the canonical object-orientation extension from 8.5)
* tcltcc (a built-in C compiler - see below)
* TclX (collection of system-related extensions, like signal handling)
* tdom (XML parser, SAX or DOM, with XPath query support)
* Tk (the cross-platform GUI toolkit, see below)
* tkcon (a vastly extended console)
* XOTcl (advanced dynamic OO extension)

==== A little example package ====
The following script creates the trivial but educational package futil, which in a namespace of the same name implements two procs for reading and writing complete text files, and the little introspection helper function, futil::?. The command to register the package (package provide) is executed only after all went well - this way, buggy source code, which raises an error during package require, will not be registered. (Other bugs you'd have to spot and fix for yourself...)

Common Tcl distribution practice has the good habit of profound testing, typically in a separate test directory. On the other hand, including a self-test in the same file with the code makes editing easier, so after the package provide comes a section only executed if this file is sourced as a top- level script, which exercises the commands defined in futil. Whether the string read should be equal to the string written is debatable - the present implementation appends \n to the string if it doesn't end in one, because some tools complain or misbehave if they don't see a final newline.

If the tests do not run into an error either, even the required construction of a package index is fired - assuming the simplified case that the directory contains only one package. Otherwise, you'd better remove these lines, and take care of index creation yourself.

A script that uses this package will only have to contain the two lines

 lappend ::auto_path &lt;directory of this file&gt;
 package require futil
You can even omit the first line, if you install (copy) the directory with the source and pkgIndex.tcl below ${tcl_install_directory}/lib. }

 namespace eval futil {
     set version 0.1
 }
But now back to the single script that makes up the package (it would make sense to save it as ''futil.tcl''). We provide a ''read'' and a ''write'' function in the ''futil'' namespace, plus a little introspection function ''?'' that returns the names of available functions:
 proc futil::read {filename} {
    set fp [open $filename]
    set string [::read $fp] ;# prevent name conflict with itself
    close $fp
    return $string
 }
 proc futil::write {filename string} {
    set fp [open $filename w]
    if {[string index $string end]!=&quot;\n&quot;} {append string \n}
    puts -nonewline $fp $string
    close $fp
 }
 proc futil::? {} {lsort [info procs ::futil::*]}
 # If execution comes this far, we have succeeded ;-)
 package provide futil $futil::version

 #--------------------------- Self-test code
 if {[info ex argv0] &amp;&amp; [file tail [info script]] == [file tail $argv0]} {
    puts &quot;package futil contains [futil::?]&quot;
    set teststring {
        This is a teststring
        in several lines...}
    puts teststring:'$teststring'
    futil::write test.tmp $teststring
    set string2 [futil::read test.tmp]
    puts string2:'$string2'
    puts &quot;strings are [expr {$teststring==$string2? {}:{not}}] equal&quot;
    file delete test.tmp ;# don't leave traces of testing

    # Simple index generator, if the directory contains only this package
    pkg_mkIndex -verbose [file dirn [info scr]] [file tail [info scr]]
 }

==== TclOO ====
TclOO is a loadable package to provide a foundation for object orientation, designed so that specific OO flavors like Itcl, Snit, or XOTcl can build on it. But it's a usable OO system in itself, offering classes, multiple inheritance, mixins and filters. Here is some example code to give you an impression:

 #!/usr/bin/env tclsh85
 package require TclOO
 namespace import oo::*
 class create Account {
    constructor { {ownerName undisclosed}} {
        my variable total overdrawLimit owner
        set total 0
        set overdrawLimit 10
        set owner $ownerName
    }
    method deposit amount {
        my variable total
        set total [expr {$total + $amount}]
    }
    method withdraw amount {
        my variable {*}[info object vars [self]] ;# &quot;auto-import&quot; all variables
        if {($amount - $total) &gt; $overdrawLimit} {
            error &quot;Can't overdraw - total: $total, limit: $overdrawLimit&quot;
        }
        set total [expr {$total - $amount}]
    }
    method transfer {amount targetAccount} {
        my variable total
        my withdraw $amount
        $targetAccount deposit $amount
        set total
    }
    destructor {
        my variable total
        if {$total} {puts &quot;remaining $total will be given to charity&quot;}
    }
 }

==== tcltcc ====
Tcltcc is a loadable package that wraps the Tiny C compiler (tcc) for use with Tcl. It can be used to
* compile C code directly to memory
* produce dynamic loadable libraries (DLLs) or executable files.
Convenience functions generate wrapper code, so that the user needs only write the really substantial C code.

'''Examples:'''

Wrap a C function into a Tcl command &quot;on the fly&quot; (here shown in an interactive session):
 % package require tcc
 0.2
 % namespace import tcc::*
 % cproc sigmsg {int i} char* {return Tcl_SignalMsg(i);} 
 % sigmsg 4
 illegal instruction

Produce a DLL with a fast implementation of Fibonacci numbers:
 % set d [tcc::dll]
 % $d ccode {
      static int fib(int n) {return n &lt;= 2? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);}
   }
 % $d cproc fiboy {int n} int {return fib(n);}
 % $d write -name fiboy
 % load fiboy[info sharedlibextension]
 % fiboy 20
 6765

Produce a tclsh with an extra ''square'' command:
 % set code [tcc::wrapCmd square {double x} double x_square {return x*x;}]
 % append code {
     int AppInit(Tcl_Interp *interp) {
        int rc;
        rc = Tcl_CreateObjCommand(interp,&quot;square&quot;,x_square,NULL,NULL);
            return Tcl_Init(interp);
     }
     int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
         Tcl_Main(argc, argv, AppInit);
         return 0;
     }
 }
 % tcc $::tcc::dir exe t
 % t add_file    $::tcc::dir/c/crt1.c
 % t add_library tcl8.5
 % t compile     $code
 % t output_file mytclsh.exe
 % exec mytclsh.exe {&lt;&lt;puts [square 5]}
 25.0

Tcltcc is open source, LGPL licensed, available at http://code.google.com/p/tcltcc/ . The full functionality is at the current early stage (October 2007) only available on Windows 95/XP platforms, but in-memory compilation works on Linux too.

==== tDOM ====
tDOM is a popular extension for XML/HTML processing, allowing both SAX-style &quot;on-the-fly&quot; parsing and the DOM approach of representing a whole XML element in memory. 

Here is an example of a SAX-style application. The '''expat''' parser that comes with tDOM is instrumented with callbacks for element start, character data, and processing instructions. Elements, attributes, characters and processing instructions are counted, plus a tally for each element type is done.

 #!/usr/bin/env tclsh
 package require tdom
 #--- Callbacks for certain parser events
 proc el {name attlist} {
     global g
     incr ::nEl
     incr ::nAtt [llength $attlist]
     inc g($name)
 }
 proc ch data {
    incr ::nChar [string length $data]
 }
 proc pi {target data} {
    incr ::nPi
 }
 proc inc {varName {increment 1}} {
    upvar 1 $varName var
    if {![info exists var]} {set var 0}
    incr var $increment
 }
 #--- &quot;main&quot; loop
 if ![llength $argv] {puts &quot;usage: $argv0 file...&quot;}
 foreach file $argv {
     foreach i {nEl nAtt nChar nPi} {set $i 0} ;# reset counters
     array unset g
     set p [expat -elementstartcommand el \
            -characterdatacommand          ch \
            -processinginstructioncommand  pi ]
     if [catch {$p parsefile $file} res] {
                puts &quot;error:$res&quot;
     } else {
        puts &quot;$file:\n$nEl elements, $nAtt attributes, $nChar characters,\
            $nPi processing instructions&quot;
        foreach name [lsort [array names g]] {
            puts [format %-20s%7d $name $g($name)]
        }
    }
    $p free
 }

== Brooke Flood ==

Hello everyone! My name is Brooke Flood. I am currently a sophomore at Old Dominion University.  I relocated here from Martinsville, Virginia. I am a very long way from home, but I am surviving. I am looking to pursue a career as a teacher and hope to effectively teach the children for tomorrow. I enjoy being around kids and love to show them new things. 


'''My Philosophy of Education:'''

My philosophy of education is very simple. There are only two very important groups of children that I feel are not acknowledged. They are children with special needs and low-income students.  Students with special needs should be treated with special treatment. They have learning disabilities, therefore, why not give them a little bit more extra attention and funds. This will give them one on one teaching and allow them to learn better. 

Teaching is the most &quot;left-out&quot; career. We always forget about our elementary education. When it comes to funds for new schools or better technology, the government leaves teaching out. Low-income areas are not provided with the best schools or the best classrooms. Also, are not provided with the best learning equipment. Why?</text>

== Standard Form ==

Standard form is another way to write slope (as opposed to y=mx+b). It is written as Ax+By=C.
You can also change slope-intercept form to standard form like this:
Y=-3/2x+3.
Next, you isolate the y- intercept(in this case it is 3) like this:
Add 3/2x to each side of the equation to get this:
3/2x+y=3.
You can not have a fraction in standard form so you solve this.
2(3/2x+y)=3(2).
To get:
3x+2y= 6.
Now you have a standard form equation!

== Solving Slope ==

=== Solving Standard Form ===

Slope intercept equations (y=mx+b) are the easiest to graph. So if you encounter an equation in standard form that you are required to graph, you must convert it to slope intercept form. To do this you must take the equation and solve for Y.

Example:

&lt;math&gt;9x + 7y = -3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;9x - 9x + 7y = -3 - 9x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;7y = -3 - 9x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{7y}{7}=\frac{-3 - 9x}{7}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{-3}{7}-\frac{9}{7}x&lt;/math&gt;

That is technically slope intercept form, but if you want to make it true (y=mx+b) simply follow the rule of negatives (a - b = a + -b):

&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{-9}{7}x+\frac{-3}{7}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Solving Slope Intercept Form ===

If you come upon an equation in slope intercept form, and require it to be in standard form, simply solve for m (c).

Example:

&lt;math&gt;y = 10x + 9&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y - 10x = 9 + 10x - 10x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y - 10x = 9&lt;/math&gt;

Standard form cannot have fractions if they are in a fraction, you must multiply each side to get rid of it.

Example:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{9}{10}x + 9y = 5&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;10 [\frac{9}{10}x + 9y] = 10 [5]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;9x + 90y = 50&lt;/math&gt;</text>

==Slope==
Slope is the measure of how much a line moves up or down related to how much it moves left to right.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:slope.gif]][[Image:points.gif]]
&lt;/center&gt;
In this image, the slope of the line is &lt;math&gt; \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} &lt;/math&gt;.

Parallel lines are those that have the same slope and do not touch. Examples include [[w:Latitude|latitude]] lines.

===Slope===
'''Algebra/Slope'''

Slope is the change in the vertical distance of a line on a coordinate plane over the change in horizontal difference.  In other words, it is the “rise” over the “run” or the steepness of a line.  Slope is usually represented by the symbol &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; like in the equation &lt;math&gt; y = mx + b &lt;/math&gt;, m the coefficient of x represents the slope of the line.

Slope is computed by measuring the change in vertical distance divided by the change in horizontal difference, i.e.:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{rise}{run} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
The Greek uppercase letter &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; represents change, in this case change in the y-coordinates divided by the change in x-coordinates.
 
'''Positive Slope/ Negative Slope'''

If a line goes up from left to right, then the slope has to be positive.  For example, a slope of  ¾ would have a “rise” of  3, or go up 3;  and a “run” of 4, or go right 4.  Both numbers in the slope are either negative or positive in order to have a positive slope.

If a line goes down from left to right, then the slope has to be negative. For example, a slope of -3/4 would have a “rise” of -3, or go down 3; and a “run” of 4, or go right 4.  Only one number in the slope can be negative for a line to have a negative slope.

'''Other Types of Slope'''

There are two special circumstances, no slope and slope of zero.  A horizontal line has a slope of 0 and a vertical line has an undefined slope.

Horizontal lines have the form: &lt;math&gt;\ y = a &lt;/math&gt; ; where a is a constant, i.e. &lt;math&gt; a \in R &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Vertical lines have the form: &lt;math&gt;\ x = a &lt;/math&gt; ; where as is a constant, i.e. &lt;math&gt; a \in R &lt;/math&gt;
== Determining Slope ==
To determine the slope you need some information. This can include two (or more) coordinates, a parallel slope and a coordinate, a perpendicular slope and a coordinate, or the y-intercept and slope.



For completely horizontal lines, the difference in y coordinates between any two points  is 0, so the slope m = 0, indicating no steepness in the line at all.  If the line extends between right-upper (+,+) and left-lower ( -, -) directions, then the slope is positive.  As the slope increases, the line becomes steeper until the line is almost vertical when the slope is very large.  When the slope m = 1, the line is diagonal with an angle halfway between the x and y axes.  If the line extends between left-upper (-,+) and right-lower (+, -) directions, then the slope is negative.  As the slope changes from 0 to very negative numbers, the steepness in the opposite direction increases.  Compare the slope ( m ) values in the following graph of functions y = 1 (where &lt;br&gt;m = 0), y = (&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;/&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;) x + 1, y = x + 1, y = 2 x, y = -(&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;/&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;) x + 1, y = -x + 1, and y = -2 x + 1.  For all two-variable linear equations that can be converted to linear functions, the same calculation applies to slopes for those lines.  

[[image:Various_Linear_Slopes.PNG]]

== Finding It ==
For the most part finding slope when given information is a simple matter. Simply take the slope equation y=mx+b and replace the variable with whatever information you know, and solve. 

=== Two Coordinates ===
To find the slope with two coordinates, you must first find the slope. Use the standard equation &lt;math&gt;\frac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}&lt;/math&gt;. Put that into the equation as m, and replace x and y with x and y from one of the coordinates. Solve for b. Put that into the equation and your done.

Example:
(1,4) (4,8)

&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{4-1}{4-8}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{3}{-4}&lt;/math&gt;

Plug that right in.

&lt;math&gt; y = \frac{3}{-4}x+b &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 4 = \frac{3}{-4}(1)+b &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 4 = \frac{3}{-4}+b &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 4-\frac{3}{-4} = b &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{-19}{4} = b &lt;/math&gt;

Put that in the equation and you're done.

&lt;math&gt; y = \frac{3}{-4}x + \frac{-19}{4} &lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Experiences in Industrial Management as a Ship Superintendent at US Coast Guard Yard=
==Duties and Responsibilities==
**&lt;u&gt;The Job:&lt;/u&gt; As a ship superintendent at the US Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, MD, I was essentially a project manager for major depot level repair of ships ranging in size from 110’ Patrol ships to 378’ High endurance light frigates.  I was responsible for managing eleven different trades and coordinating a workforce of over 450 permanent civilian employees, not including the numerous sub contractors.   (There were 7 of us ship superintendents, and each of us had 1-2 ships and sometimes additional special projects that shared these resources.)  The bulk of the work done here was repair and upgrade of existing ships.  There was very little pure ‘design’ happening here, but we did have to ‘engineer’ upgrades and improvements because existing equipment was ineffective, not effective for a new mission, or no longer supported.  There was, however, workforce management of technical trades to the extreme.  A ship is a complex as a small town, squeezed into less than 1 percent of the space.  Everything is on top of and interfering with everything else.  Every work item of a package affected every other work item.  Every ship competed for resources with every other ship.  Budgets were nearly fixed and keeping the schedule was critical to the function of the Coast Guards mission effectiveness.

==Staging Process==
**&lt;u&gt;Spec development:&lt;/u&gt; Developed coordinated by the ships crew, the ships shore side support infrastructure, the CG YARD, and the larger CG Command structure.  Items included renewal of the underbody paint, engine overhaul, replacement, habitability upgrades, weapons systems overhauls, command and control system upgrades, structural repair, major scheduled maintenance to all major systems, the list goes on.  Everything that was to be done to the ship had to be documented in the specification as clearly as possible.  Many of the parts needed for the specialized systems had delivery times of months.  A missing part can be a show stopper.  This was also the first time the Ship Superintendent can begin to manage expectations.   Each customer is different.  Some ship commanders understood the complexities of the ships they were in charge of, and did not take much attention.  Others flat out refused to understand why everything couldn’t be done in 10 minutes.  Most fell somewhere in-between.  The sooner you are honest with a customer, the sooner you can make sure they stay part of the project, the better.  There will be miscommunications, and mistakes.  Maintaining a personal yet professional relationship means that miscommunications get cleared up quickly and most mistakes are forgiven and resolved concurrently.  As a manager, it must be abundantly clear that your primary focus is the job and that everyone working on the job is a close second.  Even if one does not possess the slightest iota of natural personal skills, a focus on the job will warrant some measure of followership.  Here, we were face to face with all of the major players and it was a perfect opportunity to walk around the ship, ask a ton of questions, write everything down, and show all the players that we were going to work very hard at this, and that we were going to expect everybody else to work hard at this too.  
**&lt;u&gt;Risk assessment:&lt;/u&gt; Some risk was spoken of at the spec development meeting above, but we waited until we had a good draft spec (usually the 2nd or 3rd revision) before doing an official risk assessment meeting.  This was still several months before the ship actually arrived.  (A note on forethought here, while we did the spec development process and much of the other lead up, we still had other ships high and dry that we were responsible for.  Organization is critical, and it is critical to make sure you are prepared for the future, regardless of what ‘fires you are putting out’ right now.)  At the Risk assessment meeting, we brought in foremen from every major trade, put a spec in front of each of them (most actually read the spec before the meeting), projected a preliminary schedule on the wall, and went through each work item.  It worked out that the foremen would talk about how difficult and how much time each item would take them, and that the ship superintendent would ask questions to find out how much each item interfered with each other.  This was critical to sequencing the work.  In essence, this team would ‘design’ the repair period, sequencing events, augmenting work items with contractors and extra shifts, discovering what expectations were impossible given the time period.  Each item was categorized as green, yellow, or red.  Green were well within capabilities, yellow were items of concern that warranted additional resources or time, and red meant we took that work item back to the spec development team (via email or conf. call) and attempted a compromise, either postponing a work item to another maintenance availability, having a contractor do it at the ships home port, or modifying the work item for it to fit into the existing package.  Finding solutions to such problems is a communication process because no matter how much one tries, it’s very very difficult to completely understand the customers desires.  
**&lt;u&gt;Estimate development:&lt;/u&gt; 	Based largely on historical data, a team of estimators would build a cost estimate for the availability.  (The YARD did not work like a private enterprise, but charged parts and labor for everything.  Cost overruns cost the ‘customer’ more, but coming under ‘budget’ returned money to the customer.  A vastly different animal from private enterprise.)   The detailed cost estimates were compared to the ‘back of the envelope’ estimates developed at the spec development meeting and communicated to the customer.  Those that were vastly different warranted further (sometimes heated) discussion.  It’s pretty important to make clear that the spec development meeting estimates are by no means ‘official’ and are not even guaranteed to order of magnitude.  But, if one has managed the personalities (primarily through a overt dedication to the job) this process can be very smooth no matter what the bad news.
**&lt;u&gt;Scheduling:&lt;/u&gt; This process started with spec development, but at YARD we have a scheduling program.  Part of the detailed estimate was estimating how many man hours each job would take.  This information, with the preliminary work order schedule worked out during the previous meetings, was imported into a master scheduler that had timelines listed for each work item.  Work items that could not be done at the same time due to space considerations, or work items that were dependent on others could be set ‘end to end’.  The schedulers would work with the ship superintendent to make sure that high risk work items were addressed first.  Even before the ships arrival, the schedule would take into consideration the parts procurement and dry dock preparation process.   Throughout the entire process, this program would be used to print off a sheet for each trade every day with task listing (down to a minute level, such as “Remove bolts for tank cover” listed as a different item as “Remove tank manhole cover”).  These lists often seemed pedantic and silly ‘to do list’ given to people who had been doing their jobs longer than I had been alive, and sometimes they listed things in the wrong order, and they were something that foremen complained about.  They were also a very valuable tool.  Each task, once done, was marked off as done on these sheets.  If the task was started but not done, the ‘days until complete’ was listed.  This was fed back into the software and gave an update on how well we were sticking to the plan.  The scheduling software often required some ‘correction’ when it happened to show some strange timeline estimates, but it was a valuable master checklist of each task that needs to be done in a major availability.  Probably the most interesting aspect of the software is that we cut our estimated time to complete each task in half.  Looking at a schedule at the beginning of a 10 week dry docking, it said we would be done in about 5 and a half weeks.   It’s a way to dangle a carrot in front of us.  If we blow a artificial deadline that keeps us in the real deadline, we use that as a psychological ‘warning shot’ that something may threaten the schedule.  We also showed this incredibly optimistic schedule to the customer at the arrival conference (discussed later).  Some understood what were doing, others wanted the 4 and a half weeks back.  Another potential for some heated discussion.
**&lt;u&gt;Negotiation:&lt;/u&gt; This process is really always happening.  Regardless, there was an official teleconference for negotiation to the final specification revision.  Really, this was a line in the sand.  After this meeting, there were no more changes to the specification, and the specification was given the status of ‘gospel’.  If there were significant changes to the customers desires after this, it was very hard to enact them.  Even if the changes were not significant, we held this card that we could stick to the spec regardless.  This is again different from private industry, but we really stuck to this for the protection of all the other projects that relied on the CG YARD.  Here, we also discussed finances and really communicated any items of high risk we found in the risk assessment above and gave the customer the chance to avoid that risk (and the potential reward) by cancelling, delaying, or modifying the work item.  The most contentious work items required ‘prototype’ installs.  Sometimes we were given a tasker that basically said “here are the parts, make it work”.  This would turn into a higher risk ‘design on the fly’ shipfitting problem solving exercise.  These were mentally stimulating, challenging, and fun, but higher risk.
**&lt;u&gt;Parts procurement:&lt;/u&gt; Discussed above, this process happens throughout the lead up.  Some parts were bought by the YARD, some by the ship, and some by the ships shoreside support commands.  Very confusing to keep track of ensuring all the parts are ordered and slated to be delivered on time, complicated by the very restricting US codes for government procurement.  This is a huge time sink for the ship superintendent, and was the most critical resource for management to consider prior to ship arrival.  Here, good organization is paramount.  Some ships were more ‘on the ball’ than others when it came to getting the parts they were promising to provide.  Some ships required ‘if-then’ threats to prompt action.  The lines of responsibility are very often blurry, but when they are clearly defined, one must make sure they stay clearly defined.

==Arrival==
**&lt;u&gt;Arrival conference:&lt;/u&gt; Once the ship arrived at the CG Yard, the first major face to face meeting with the senior command at the Yard and the ships officers was held.  If the ‘tone’ for the project was not yet set, this was the place to make final role clarifications, deliver the first update (primarily part procurement process), and discuss the technical aspects of the drydocking process.
**&lt;u&gt;Dry dock conference:&lt;/u&gt; At the end of the arrival conference, we usually rolled right into the drydocking conference.  Without getting into the technical details, drydocking a ship is one of the riskiest things that can be done to a large vessel.  A mistake here really can turn a multi-million dollar ship into a very expensive scrap cleanup operation.  As such, it is a significant exercise in co-ordinaion requiring the ships crew, tug operators, machinery operators, carpenters, and engineers.
**&lt;u&gt;Drydocking:&lt;/u&gt; An all day event, usually.  The Ship Supt is on the ship for this (the most dangerous spot) usually communicating with the crew having them operate ships machinery and handle lines for positioning the ship in the docking basin.
**&lt;u&gt;Repair operations:&lt;/u&gt; Finally, where the ‘rubber meets the road’.  Here is where preparation either pays off, or a lack of preparation results in disaster.  The most important phase of the Ship Superintendents role is already complete.  From here on out, the name of the game is to carry out the carefully constructed plan as well as possible.
**&lt;u&gt;Daily progress meetings:&lt;/u&gt; These were discussed some above.  Each day, usually on the ship if it was possible, we had meetings with a representative from each shop working on that project.  We would hand out our scheduling task sheets mentioned above.  We would then go around the room and have each trade talk about work happening today and the specifics of the work they plan to do over the next week.  Everybody listens to everybody else, tasks that require more than one trade are coordinated here, and conflicts are resolved.  These were very good at finding the ‘unforeseen’ coordination challenges a few days before workers were actually competing for the same space, or one trade was brought to a halt by another, or preventing the re-work costs incorporated by ‘walking on wet paint’.  The Ship Superintendent was essentially the final decision maker for these conflicts, although just having the shop representatives talk it out for 2 minutes in front of the rest of the team usually led to a good solution.  These meetings also involved a representative from the crew and was the first time we discussed ‘items of discovery’.  Some work items required inspection of a space or condition that could not be observed during the spec development process before we could determine exactly what had to be done.  We aimed to complete all these inspections by the 25% mark, and these daily meetings were the first communications of inspection results to the crew.  These daily meetings usually lasted about 8 minutes.  This showed respect for everyone’s time.  The foremen hated the meetings, but they had to walk around the ships to check up on their workers, and they had to communicate their needs and progress to management.  We tried to keep the meetings on the ships so the foremen hand to go see first hand what their people were up to, and give them the most convenient location possible to have managements ear and direction.  Even the most ‘anti meeting’ mindset found some support for very brief, to the point, direct communications with all the players.  This was also the perfect chance to walk to a specific job with a foremen after the meeting so they could explain it, in real time, exactly what the problem was if it wasn’t made totally clear at the meeting.
**&lt;u&gt;Communicating up the food chain:&lt;/U&gt;  The best way to keep from getting in real trouble with a boss is to feed them too much information.  At the Yard, we always had a direct line to our bosses and used it often.  We called this the cell phone leash.  In addition to this, we also had weekly ‘traffic court’ meetings.  These involved all the ships superintendents, the senior Yard leadership, and the senior shop foremen.  Each ship superintendent would submit a report (an Excel spreadsheet) with each work item on it.  Each work item was color coded green, yellow, red with regard to threat to the schedule and the budget.  This was our opportunity to bring more weight down upon the trades that were underperforming, but more importantly this was a chance to tell the bosses who was really coming to bat for you.  Some did not take this approach, but I found that when I complimented the trades who were doing their jobs every chance I got, I got more work out of them.  Also, when I said I had a problem people perked up.  (One of my co-workers did nothing by ‘knit pick’ the workforce.  It should be noted that this individual was also very effective, but did about the same with much more effort and sometimes had a hoarse voice.)  ‘Traffic court’ also served as a valuable opportunity to take stock of the project on a weekly basis, and to understand what other projects were happening at the Yard.  Often it was necessary for ships superintendents to modify schedules with other ships in order to best use labor resources, and these meetings allowed for this.   
**&lt;u&gt;Constant customer communications:&lt;/u&gt; The ‘customer’ was at most of the daily meetings.  We would usually reserve two of the meetings to be ‘in house’, so we could deal with internal Yard politics that the ‘customer’ didn’t need to know about.  Also worth note here is the definition of ‘customer’.  We referred to the ships command and crew as the ‘customer’.  Sometimes, when there was disagreement, the ship’s representative would try to play the ‘customer is always right’ card.  If the disagreement was strong enough and a compromise couldn’t be reasonably reached, or if the ship’s representative was flat out mistaken (i.e., requesting a ship alteration that was against Coast Guard regulations), we would tactfully remind them that these ships belong to the taxpayer, and that the taxpayer is the ultimate ‘customer’.  Obviously this isn’t an option in private industry.  Regardless, everybody can and will lose perspective, and as middle management, it is critical to maintain perspective and possibly remind others (even the customer) of what the objective really is.  
**&lt;u&gt;Inspection-sign-off:&lt;/u&gt;  This was done for each work item, and sometimes required several sign-offs for each work item.  The Ship Superintendent basically had to make sure that the ship’s crew responsible for inspecting that work item actually looked at the work and understood what they were signing.  Some people will sign anything without thinking twice.  Once this was documented, it was an official ‘we accept’ from the customer.

==Departure==
**&lt;u&gt;Customer speaks to your boss:&lt;/u&gt;  The commanding officer of the Yard was rarely involved in day to day waterfront operations (there were other support functions of the base that required attention as well). Regardless, the biggest fish in this pond would have individual face to face meetings with the senior members of each ship as the arrived, and then again when they left.  The customer had free reign to say whatever they wanted about you.  Sometimes they were very happy and surprised at the experience, sometimes they were a little disappointed.  The important part is that no matter what, we wanted the crews to have no choice but to tell the boss that we were professional, competent, dedicated, responsible, and fair, even if we weren’t completely accommodating.  It’s a little like the NY Times test, in that each decision you make should have a good explanation.  Mistakes happened because we made the wrong calls, but if we could prove that we though it through, everybody came out in much better shape.
**&lt;u&gt;Follow up/warranty:&lt;/u&gt; A couple months or so, we had another teleconference with the same players as the spec development conference.  Here, we discussed warranty issues, how and when to resolve them, if they are warranty issues, etc.  We also did a de-brief of what worked well, and what did not.  We tried to use this opportunity to force the CG support infrastructure to further improved their canned specification work items for the future.  We would also discuss final costs and collecting further funds or, more often, returning funds to the appropriate commands.  We finished off the final checklist

[[File:Partial transmittance.gif|thumb|When the impedence of two mediums is mismatched, only some of the energy is transmitted.]]
Recall that the ''more different'' the impedances for two mediums, the ''less'' acoustic energy will be transferred into the second medium (and the rest will be reflected). The middle ear faces an impedance mismatch problem since the sound energy is travelling from air into fluid (in the cochlea). According to the equation &lt;math&gt;%\text{amplitude transmission} = 4\frac{Z_1 \cdot Z_2}{[Z_1 + Z_2]^2}&lt;/math&gt;, the reduction in amplitude due to this impedance mismatch is about 97% of the energy (that's 30dB less). Luckily the middle ear compensates for this mismatch in two ways:
#The &lt;math&gt;A_{\text{tympanic membrane}}:A_{\text{footplate}}&lt;/math&gt; ratio is large: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{pars tensa}}{\text{stapes footplate}} = \frac{59.4mm^2}{3.2mm^2} = 18.6&lt;/math&gt;
#The length of the long arm of the malleus is &lt;math&gt;1.3\times&lt;/math&gt; longer than that of the incus. This produces a [[w:lever|lever]] effect.

&lt;math&gt;18.6 \times 1.3 = 24.2&lt;/math&gt;, which is almost the 30dB amplitude loss the impedance mismatch problem would have created.

Hi Broxy999,

I just added a query tag on your [[Gloster meteor‎]] page.  It seems like it is destined to be an encyclopedia article rather than a book.  You are most welcome to contribute here, but it seems to me that Wikipedia would be a better place for this content. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:27, 10 February 2009 (UTC)
: Perhaps this was intended as a chapter to [[Jet Propulsion]]?  If so, you should move it to [[Jet Propulsion/Gloster Meteor]].  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:59, 11 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

''This tutorial has been created with Blender v2.48a''

[[File:CuttingThroughSteel.ogv|framed|'''Figure 1:''' Cutting out a logo, the result of this tutorial]]
In order to simulate a laser beam which is cutting through a steel plate, we have in Blender (at least) two possibilities:
# an animated Mesh with many Shapekeys
# an animated texture

The latter method is considerably easier to implement and the result is nevertheless convincing enough. We will proceed as follows:
* You need an animated alpha mask for the points at which the metal is changed. For this use a text object as a path. A cube follows the path and emits a particle system. The results are rendered as animation and the images stored.
* Then load these pictures and use them as an animated texture on a plane.
* With a second particle system the sparks are simulated.
* With a third particle system we simulate the annealing of the weld. Again, this sequence is used as an animated texture.
* Smoke is created with a fourth particle system. 

The result is shown in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;1'''. 

This guide is based on the well-known tutorial [http://www.blendernation.com/tutorials/blender-3d-intermediate-tutorial-cutting-through-steel/ Cutting Through Steel], but remade with the current Blender particle system and with constraints. You need to have basic knowledge of Blender.

== Creating the Alpha-Map ==
[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel-ObjectCamera-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 2a:''' Setup of curve, emitter and camera in the 3D window.]]
* Start Blender.  Save your file.  Delete the cube. 
We should save the file right at the beginning, because we will save the animated textures in subdirectorys to the current directory. Particle caches are also created as subdirectorys.
* Set the ''End'' value to 150 in the ''Anim'' panel of the ''Render'' buttons. This allows you to specify the total length of the animation. 
* In the ''Output'' panel use &quot;//AlphaMap/&quot; as output directory. When we render the animation the images are than saved in the subdirectory &quot;AlphaMap&quot; to the current directory. 
The animated alpha map consists of gray-scale images whose luminance information is used to calculate the mask. Bright pixels produce transparency, dark pixels remain opaque. 
* Use ''PNG'' as output format.  This avoids compression artifacts wich occur with the JPEG format.
I've left the resolution at 800x600, but you need to set your desired resolution here.

* Create the shape you want to cut out as Curve object, or use a text object and convert this to a curve. I've done the latter, I've used a text-object (a &quot;W&quot;), and converted this to a Curve object (''Object-&gt; Convert Object Type ...-&gt; Curve''). 
* With the function ''Center'' in the ''Curve and Surface'' panel I've brought the object in the middle of the 3D-coordinate space. 
* The filling of the object is not needed here, therefore activate the option ''3D'' for the curve object, even though the object should remain two-dimensional.

Now we need again a cube. The cube will follow the curve. It's particle system will create a glowing trail, that is later used as alpha map.

[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel-AlphaParticleSystem-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 2b:''' particle system of the cube.]]
* Insert a cube.
* Scale the cube as small as the track of the laser beam (the welder) shall become.
* Select the cube, than also select the curve object with '''Shift-RMB'''. 
* '''Ctrl-P'''-&gt;''Path Constraint'' creates a ''Follow Path'' constraint.
* Select only the cube and activate the option ''CurveFollow'' in the ''Constraints'' panel in the ''Object'' buttons.
If you press '''Alt-A''' now and let run the animation, the cube will follow the shape of the curve object, but not necessarily in the desired direction and not from the desired location. So some work needs to be done:
* Change to the ''Edit'' mode of the curve object.
* ''Curve-&gt;Toggle Cyclic'' opens the curve object, by adding (''Subdivide'') of one or more control points you achieve the desired movement. '''W'''-&gt;''Switch Direction'' reverses the direction of the motion of the cube.

By adding a ''Time'' Ipocurve to the curve you could set the duration and speed of the animation, but I've left the preset duration of 100 Frames. The last 50 Frames the path will glow a bit and the smoke will vanish.

* Add a particle system to the cube, call this ''Alpha''.
* Set the particle lifetime to 150 (or higher) ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;2b'''). The particles will live the entire length of the animation.
* ''Bake'' the particle animation.

* The cube gets a material:
** ''Halo''
** RGB 1/1/1, that is completely white
** ''XAlpha''
** ''HaloSize:'' 0.03
** ''Hardness:'' 40
I want to achieve with these settings, that we will get a grayscale image, that is completely white where the material shall become transparent. We don't need partial transparency, since a relatively sharp cutting edge shall be created.  Slight irregularities in the periphery are wanted.

[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel-AlphaMap-0026.png|thumb|150px|'''Figure 2c:''' A frame of the AlphaMap.]]
To render the animation, the camera is centered directly over the object.
* ''View-&gt;Top''
* '''Strg-Alt-Num0''' sets the camera to the current view.  Select the camera.
* With the ''Transform Properties'' panel in the 3D-window (''Object-&gt;Transform Properties'') set the coordinates of the camera exactly vertically above the center of the 3D window (X/Y=0).
* In the ''Editing'' buttons of the camera set the option ''Orthographic'' in the''Camera'' panel. Scale the size of the animation with the ''Scale'' value.
* The the world color to black in the ''World'' buttons.
* Render the animation.

Blender now generates an image sequence from 1 to 150 in the subfolder ''AlphaMap'' ('''Fig. 2c''').

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
== Welding sparks ==
[[File:BlenderD CuttingThroughSteel-AddScene-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 3a:''' Adding a new ''Scene'']]
Now we'll create a new scene, in which the different effects are joined.
* Rename your current scene to ''AlphaMap''.
* Create a new scene as ''FullCopy'' ('''Img.&amp;nbsp;3a'''). Name this new scene ''Cutter''.

The welding sparks are created using a particle system.
* Add a ''UVSphere'' with 16 segments and 16 rings.
* Delete the lower half of the sphere in Edit Mode and scale it to approximately the same size as the cube.
* Switch to Object Mode.
* Select the cube in addition to the sphere. Copy the ''Follow-Path''-Constraint from the cube to the sphere.
Note that you copy attributes from the active to the selected objects. The active object is the one you've selected last

'''Noob Note:''' Using Blender 2.65, the easiest way I found to do this was to use the '3D View: Copy Attributes Menu' addon. (To enable the addon press Ctrl+Alt+U to bring
up User Preferences, click the 'Addons' tab, type 'copy' into the search box, located at the top left of the tab, and put a check in the box to the right of the addon that's found, 
'3D View: Copy Attributes Menu'.) First RMB click the sphere, then Shift+RMB click the cube, the one with the follow path constraint.  With the 2 selected press 
Ctrl+C and choose 'copy object constraints' from the popup menu.  If the sphere gets offset in the process, just move it manually to the position of the cube or the first waypoint on the path.



&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel-SparksParticles-2.48a.png|framed|none|'''Figure 3b:''' The particle system for the sparks.]]
* Create a particle system for the sphere.
** Name ''Sparks''
** ''Amount:'' 4200
** ''Life:'' 5
** ''Emit From:'' ''Random/Verts''
** ''Normal:'' 0.757
** ''Random:'' 0.397 
** ''Rotation Random:'' 0.116
** ''AccZ:'' -1.37
Except for the lifetime the values are relatively arbitrary, I have just experimented with the values until I was halfway satisfied with the results. The sparks have a slight acceleration in negative Z direction to sink down.

* ''Visualization:''
** ''Line'' (which corresponds as much as possible to the setting ''Vect'' in the particle system before 2.46)
** ''Speed''
** ''Back:'' 0.04
** ''Front:'' 0.0
You achieve a long spark with these settings.

* ''Bake'' the particles. Change to the ''Bake'' panel and click on the ''Bake'' button. The particle animation is now permanently saved.
The ''Bake'' end value is also the final value for the normal particle animation, even if you don't bake. If you need more than 250 frames, you need to increase this value.

== Using the alpha map on an object ==
The alpha map is now used as texture on a plane. Therefore we have to position the texture exactly like the previously rendered animation, so that the sparks run in sync with the blending out of the plane.

* Add a new plane to your scene (''Add-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Plane'').
* Scale the plane at about twice it's size - as big as you need it for the final shot.

The main problem is now to fit the texture exactly to the plane. We will give the plane UV coordinates, than fit the plane to the ratio of the texture and finally adjust the position in the 3D window with UV coordinates.


[[File:Blender3D DrawType.png|framed|'''Figure 4a:''' Setting the ''Draw Type'']]
* Switch to ''Draw Type Textured'' ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;4a'''). 
* Split the 3D window, and open in one part the ''UV/Image Editor''.
* Switch to edit mode of the plane.
* Unwrap the plane ((''Mesh-&gt;UV Unwrap'').
* Load an image of the alpha map in the image editor (not the first one, so you can see the course of the map). 
Normally the texture is not orientated the way I would like it to be.
* Click the padlock icon in the toolbar of the ''UV/Image Editor'' (''Update other windows in real time''). 
* Rotate the UV vertices in the ''UV/Image Editor'' until the texture fits (e.g., while holding the '''Ctrl''' key)
* Switch to object mode.

[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel-AlphaMapMaterial-2.48a.png|framed|none|'''Figure 4b:''' Material settings for the plane]]
* Add a new material to the plane and name it ''Rust''.
* Select the fifth texture slot and add a new texture. Name it ''AlphaMap'' with the parameters:
** ''Map Input:'' ''UV''
** ''Map To:''
*** ''Alpha''
*** ''Spec''
*** ''Nor''
*** ''NoRGB''
*** ''DVar: 0''
With these ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;4b''') settings we achieve, that the white pixels in the texture set the Alpha and the Spec value to zero (''DVar''). Because the texture delivers RGB colors we have to activate ''NoRGB'', because we need intensity values. We don't need ''RayTransp'', because the world background is black anyway. We can't use ''ZTransp'', because Halos are not rendered in front of materials with ''ZTransp'' (probably a bug in Version 2.48a). With ''Nor'' we get a 3D effect.

[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel-AlphaMapTexture-2.48a.png|framed|none|'''Figure 4c:''' Texture settings for the animated alpha map]]
* Switch to the ''Texture'' buttons.
* Type: Image Texture
* Load the first image of the alpha map sequence.
** ''Image:'' ''Sequence''
** ''Frames:'' 150
** ''Map Image:'' ''Extend'' ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;4c''')

Now we adjust the UV coordinates.
* ''Object-&gt;Transform-&gt;Scale to Image Aspect Ratio''. This scales the ratio of the plane automatically to the aspect ratio of the image texture.
* Change to a frame where you can judge the particle animation and it's fitting to the texture.
* Switch to edit mode. Scale the UV coordinates in the UV editor until the texture fits to the particles.
* Switch back to object mode.

== Material for the plane ==
[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel-PlaneMaterial-Frame34.jpg|framed|'''Figure 5:''' Material for the plane]]
We will now give the plane a better material. To judge the material we will first re-focus the camera, give it a texture and make some material settings. If you already have a good metal material, you can use this of course directly and use the Alpha texture from above on your existing material.

* Select the camera.
* Turn ''Orthographic'' in the ''Camera'' buttons off.
* Position the camera as desired.
* Select the plane.
** I've used the rust texture that is linked at the bottom of the page as image texture.
*** ''Map Input:'' ''Orco'', ''SizeX/Y'' each 0.5. The size change is to use a larger part of the texture on the final image. But this depends on the size of the camera and the texture.
*** ''Map To:'' ''Col/Nor''
** In the second texture slot I've mapped a ''Stucci'' texture to ''Spec''.
*** This abridged sentence means: select the texture slot. Set ''Map To'' to ''Spec''. Deselect ''Col''. Change to the ''Texture'' buttons. Select ''Texture type'' ''Stucci''.
** The ''Specularity'' is thus determined by a texture. The spec value is increased by the texture (''DVar=1''). Therefore you have to set the ''Specularity'' in the ''Shaders'' panel to the smallest value the material shall have (e.g. 0.08).
If you have done a test render, you'll see that the particle track of the cube is still there.
* We don't need the cube anymore, you may delete it. In the ''Scene'' ''Cutter'' we use the already generated AlphaMap.

Texture with OSA (''Antialiasing'') are somewhat blurred, for our purpose we use ''CatRom'' instead of the default ''Gauss'' method.
* Set in the ''Render'' panel ''CatRom'' as ''AntiAliasing'' filter.
We need a new output directory for the animation, to not overwrite the AlphaMap we've created earlier.
* Set the output directory to &quot;//Render/&quot; in the ''Output'' panel.

== Lighting the torch ==
[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel-LampEnergieIpo-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 6:''' Ipo curve for the energy of the lamp]]
The torch itself shall cast light, therefore we parent a Lamp to the ''Sphere'' and animate the energy of the lamp.
* Change to frame 1.
* Select the ''Sphere''.
* Place the 3D cursor on the ''Sphere''. ''Object-&gt;Snap-&gt;Cursor to Selection''
* ''Add-&gt;Lamp-&gt;Lamp''
* Select the lamp in addition to the ''Sphere''.
* ''Object-&gt;Parent-&gt;Make Parent-&gt;OK''
* Select the lamp and move it a bit up (i.e. in positive z-direction). The lighting shall emit from the sparks, not from the hole.
I find it cumbersome to animate the energy of the lamp by setting ipo-keys in the lamp buttons. Instead I do it directly in the 3D window.
* Change to the ''Ipo Curve Editor'' in one of the open windows. 
* Change the ipo type to ''Lamp''.
* Activate the ''Energy'' channel with '''LMB''' click in the ipo window.
* By holding '''Ctrl''' key pressed, you create by left-clicking in the ipo window the points of the ipo curve.
These values may be larger than 1. However, the last maximum value should be reached in frame 100, and decrease significantly to frame 105. The sparks are only issued up to frame 100, and live up to the 105th frame. After that the metal is glowing a bit.

Your result may look somewhat like mine in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;6'''. If the amplitude of the curve is not large enough, you can scale the ipo curve at the y-axis.

== More realistic sparks ==
[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel-Sparks-Frame34.jpg|framed|'''Figure 7:''' Better 
sparks]]
You may animate the material for ''Line'' visualization during the lifetime of each individual particle if you use ''Halo'' for the material, so you could change the sparks color from white to red. 

We will show this in the next step, but confine ourself here to make a better, not animated material ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;7''').
* Add a material to the ''Sphere'', name it ''Sparks''.
* Activate ''Halo'' in the ''Links and Pipelines'' panel.
* Set the RGB color for ''Halo'' to white.
* Activate ''Lines/X Alpha/Shaded'' in the ''Shaders'' panel.
* ''Halo Size:'' 0.1
* ''Add:'' 0.8

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

== Smoke ==
[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel-SparksSmoke-Frame34.jpg|framed|'''Figure 8a:''' Sparks and Smoke]]
Now were going to create an individual material animation for every particle during its own lifetime.

We will use particles with a simple texture and animate the alpha value of the material. We're going to duplicate the ''Sphere'' and give it a new particle system.
* Duplicate the ''Sphere'' with ''Object-&gt;Duplicate''. The new sphere already bears the ''Path'' constraint. 
* Remove the ''Sparks'' system from the new ''Sphere''.
* Create a new particle system. Name it ''Smoke''.
* ''Amount:'' 300
* ''Emit from:'' ''Random/Verts''
* ''Initial velocity:'' 
** ''Object:'' 0.02
** ''Normal:'' 0.1
** ''Random:'' 0.01
* ''AccZ:'' 0.05
* Bake this particle system.

* Change to the ''Material'' buttons.
* Create a new material and call it ''Smoke''.
* ''Alpha:'' 0.034. This is the basic visibility for the smoke texture.
* Add an ipo key for ''Alpha'' in frame 1. 
* Change to frame 100.
* Set ''Alpha'' to 0.0 and add the second ipo key.
Now the smoke will disappear within the lifetime of each particle, independently of the lifetime of the particle. 

* ''Halo''
** ''Halo Size:'' 0.224
** ''Hard:'' 12
** ''Add:'' 0.014
** ''Halo Tex'' This is the crucial setting to use a texture for the shape of the halo.
** ''X Alpha''

[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel Smoke.jpg|framed|'''Figure 8b:''' Particle texture]]
* Create a new texture, you may also call it ''Smoke''.
* ''Texture Type:'' ''Image''
* Load an image with random, smoke-like structures, like that from '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;8b'''.

If the fading goes to quickly, or the texture is to transparent / opaque, change the animation of the ''Alpha'' value.

You see, even though we use only a few objects and materials, it is extremly helpful if we designate meaningfull names to the objects, materials, textures etc.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
== After Glow ==
Now at last we will create another animated texture, that shall simulate the annealing of the steel plate after it is being cut through.

[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughtSteel GlowMap-34.png|thumb|200px|'''Figure 9a:''' A Frame of the ''Glow''-Map]]
* Change to the scene ''AlphaMap''.
* Add a new scene again as a ''Full Copy''.
* Name this scene ''Glow''.
* Enter the output directory &quot;//Glow/&quot; in the ''Output''-Panel of the ''Render'' buttons.
The texture shall have nice semi transparencies.
* Therefore we select a different output format in the ''Format'' panel, namely ''RGBA'' (RGB with Alpha).
* Selecting ''Premul'' in the ''Render'' panel the world background will become fully transparent, and the particle trace semi transparent. 

We use the existing particle system, but change it's material settings.
* Call the material of the cube ''Glow''.
* Increase the ''HaloSize'' to 0.04. Our new texture has to be larger than the cutout of the plane, else it will not be visible.
Now we're going to animate the material of the halos. Again this works only because we have ''Point'' visualization of the particles.
* Change to frame 1.
* Set an IPO key for the RGB color (here white).
* Go to 3rd Frame.
* Change the Halo color to 1/1/0.42 (light yellow). Set the next IPO key.
* Go to 6th Frame. Change the Halo color to 1/0/0 (red). Set the next IPO key.
* Go to 11th Frame. Change the Halo color to 0/0/0 (black). Set the next IPO key.
The particle trace will fade out during 11 frames.

* Render the animation.

[[File:Blender3D CuttingThroughSteel-SparksSmokeGlow-Frame34.jpg|framed|'''Figure 9b:''' A finished frame of the animation.]]
* Go back to the scene ''Cutter''.
* Select the plane.
* Load the newly created texture in the third texture slot as an animated image texture.
** ''Add New''. Name the texture ''Glow''.
** ''Map Input:'' ''UV''
** ''Map To:'' ''Col/Emit''
We need the alpha values in the image for changing the emit value. Also the alpha blends the glow texture nicely with the plane texture.
* ''Texture Type:'' ''Image''
** Select the first image from the subdirectory ''Glow''.
** Activate ''Sequence''.
** ''Frames:'' 150
** ''Extend''
The settings for the texture are identical with those of the texture ''AlphaMap'' ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;4c''), except of course for the directory in which the images reside.

In '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;9b''', see a finished frame of the animation. For the video in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;1''' I've changed the animation a bit, scaled the emitter objects a bit smaller, changed the sparks Color and used a different camera perspective. 

Suggestions, critics and approval please write on the commentary page of this article. If you find some obvious mistakes you may correct the article directly of course.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Normally I work on the German manual for the 3D-Software Blender. [[:de:Blender Dokumentation|Blender Dokumentation]] I've one of the two main authors there and I've begun Mai 2005 with editing. In the German wikibook I have today (march 2009) over 7.000 Edits, so you may assume I'm pretty sure about the things I write. 

I'm also contributing various pages for the English manual at [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/User:Soylentgreen|Soylentgreen]. 

My English skills are limited, so everything I write will need correction. 

I intend to help with the book [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]], because I hope for a reusability of articles for the German manual. I have also written the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/example/ Piston, Rod and Crank|Piston, Rod and Crank]] Tutorial, but as User Soylentgreen without the capital G in the middle.

If you want to reach me please write on my discussion page either here or in the German wikibook, where I'm even more often than here.

      <comment>Distinguishing the various types of frying cats.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}
__NOTOC__
==Ingredients==

*Bread in slices
*Butter
*2 leaves of lettuce
*1 egg
*1 churasco (beef meat) thin
*1 pepper
*Ketchup (optional)
*Mayonnaise (optional)
*Mustard (optional)

==Procedure==
# Cut the loaf of bread lengthwise and put in a warm place.
# Cook the beef in a hot frying pan with a little oil.
# Season beef with salt and pepper.
# Fry the egg alongside the beef or in another frying pan.  The yolk should be well cooked (not runny).
# Spread a little mayo on both sides of cut bread. Put the beef, the fried egg and a couple of lettuce leaves and the tomato slices. 
# Top with ketchup or mustard to taste. 
# Cover with the other half of the bread loaf.  Serve hot.

=== Chivito Canadiense ===

This is a variation which adds a couple of slice of a cold cut called &quot;Lomito Canadiense&quot; which is a cured pork sirloin which might be on the sweetish side if cured with honey. A couple of slices are heated in the frying pan together with the beef and egg and towered before adding the lettuce and tomato.

Another option is called &quot;Chivito Al Plato&quot; which includes all the above ingredients except for the bread.  Everything is piled on a plate and eaten with a knife and fork instead as sandwiched in a bread loaf.  Some add a few pickled vegetables - cucumber, carrot, etc.

Grsecurity supports all the resources [[w:Linux|Linux]] supports, but uses slightly different names for them: The &lt;tt&gt;RLIMIT&lt;/tt&gt; prefix has been replaced with &lt;tt&gt;RES&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, the [[w:Linux|Linux]] resource &lt;tt&gt;RLIMIT_CPU&lt;/tt&gt; is called &lt;tt&gt;RES_CPU&lt;/tt&gt; in grsecurity.

For detailed information about resources in Linux, see [http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/getrlimit.2.html the man page of getrlimit].

== Syntax and Examples ==

A single resource rule follows the following syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;resource name&gt; &lt;soft limit&gt; &lt;hard limit&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

An example of this syntax would be:
&lt;pre&gt;RES_FSIZE 5K 5K&lt;/pre&gt;

This would prevent the process from creating files that are bigger than 5 [[w:Kilobyte|Kilobytes]].

Using &lt;tt&gt;unlimited&lt;/tt&gt; is valid for both the soft limit and the hard limit, to denote an unlimited resource.  Note that by omitting a resource restriction, the system's default limits are used (as set by PAM or the application itself).  If a resource is specified within the policy, the specific limits override the system's default limits for the given subject.

A number of suffixes are allowed when specifying resource limits.  They are described below.

|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_AS'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|The maximum size of the process's virtual memory (address space) in bytes.
|-style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot;
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_CORE'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|Maximum size of core file, in bytes. When 0 no core dump files are created. When non-zero, larger dumps are truncated to this size. 
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_CPU'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|CPU time limit in seconds.
|-style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot;
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_DATA'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|The maximum size of the process's data segment, in bytes (initialized data, uninitialized data, and heap).
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_FSIZE'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|The maximum size of files, in bytes, that the process may create.
|-style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot;
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_LOCKS'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|A limit on the combined number of flock() locks and fcntl() leases that this process may establish. 
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_MEMLOCK'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|The maximum number of bytes of memory that may be locked into RAM. In effect this limit is rounded down to the nearest multiple of the system page size.
|-style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot;
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_MSGQUEUE'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|Specifies the limit on the number of bytes that can be allocated for POSIX message queues for the real user ID of the calling process
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_NICE'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|Specifies a ceiling to which the process's nice value can be raised using setpriority(2) or nice(2).
|-style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot;
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_NOFILE'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|Specifies a value one greater than the maximum file descriptor number that can be opened by this process.
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_NPROC'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|The maximum number of threads that can be created for the real user ID of the calling process.
|-style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot;
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_RSS'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|Specifies the limit (in pages) of the process's resident set (the number of virtual pages resident in RAM). This limit only has effect in Linux 2.4.x, x &lt; 30.
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_RTPRIO'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|Specifies a ceiling on the real-time priority that may be set for this process using sched_setscheduler(2) and sched_setparam(2). 
|-style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot;
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_SIGPENDING'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|Specifies the limit on the number of signals that may be queued for the real user ID of the calling process. Both standard and real-time signals are counted for the purpose of checking this limit.
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_STACK'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|The maximum size of the process stack, in bytes.
|-style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot;
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_RTTIME'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|Specifies a limit on the amount of CPU time that a process scheduled under a real-time scheduling policy may consume without making a blocking system call.  for the purpose of this limit, each time a process makes a blocking system call, the count of its consumed CPU time is reset to zero.  The CPU time count is not reset if the process continues trying to use the CPU but is preempted, if its time slice expires, or if it calls sched_yield(2).   Upon reaching the soft limit, the process is sent a SIGXCPU signal.  If the process catches or ignores this signal and continues consuming CPU time, then SIGXCPU will be generated once each second until the hard limit is reached, at which point the process is sent a SIGKILL signal.  The intended use of this limit is to stop a runaway real-time process from locking up the system.
|-
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|'''RES_CRASH'''
| style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|This is a pseudo-resource interpreted only by the RBAC system.  The meaning of soft and hard limits are overridden for this resource.  The intent of the resource is to be able to rate-limit bruteforced exploit attempts for a given subject.  The soft limit for this resource is the number of times the subject is allowed to crash in ways that suggest an exploitation attempt.  The hard limit specifies the amount of time those crashes are allowed to occur in.  With a rule like &lt;tt&gt;RES_CRASH 3 30m&lt;/tt&gt; one can limit a privileged binary to three exploit attempts every 10 minutes, deterring bruteforcing attempts.  The RBAC system actively responds to bruteforcing attempts that overstep this limit.  If the target is a setuid binary, the attacker has all of his/her processes killed and will be unable to log in for the remainder of the configured time.  If the target is a forking network daemon, that daemon will be unable to fork additional copies of itself for the remainder of the configured time.

Embouchure is extremely important to producing a good sound on the horn. There are many different opinions as to which embouchure is &quot;correct&quot;. However, a standard technique exists that most other embouchure styles are based upon:
* The corners of the lips must do the majority of the work of forming the embouchure. If the corners are not firm, then the player will be forced to push the mouthpiece hard against the lips, which ''will'' result in an unpleasant tone quality.
* No part of the embouchure should be tight except for the corners. In particular, the lips must not be jammed together. If the lips are too tight and/or jammed together, the horn will sound very bad, if it can produce a sound at all.
* Thus, a good embouchure has firm, tight corners, and the rest of the embouchure is loose. The lips should be slightly apart in the center so that the air can vibrate the lips easily. Forcing the air is a bad idea. The lips must be able to vibrate constantly and freely without requiring the pressure of the mouthpiece.

Articulation and tonguing are two closely related concepts, as much articulation is done with the tongue.

==Regular tonguing==
On most notes, the tongue is used to start the note. Release the air used to start the note with the syllable &quot;tah&quot;. Make sure that the T is not too audible. Once the note has started, the tongue must be out of the way of the sound. Unless otherwise noted in the music, this is how all notes should be tongued. If a passage is to be played legato but not slurred, then the tongue should be light. In this case, it may be more helpful to think of &quot;dah&quot; rather than &quot;tah&quot;.

==Slurring==
When a slur is called for in the music, simply do not tongue any of the notes in the slurred passage. Slurs should sound beautiful and have a gradual transition from note to note. Slurs are indicated by a curve connecting the first note of the slur to the last note of the slur. It is generally acceptable to start a slur with the tongue.

==Accents / Sforzandos==
Accents should have more air behind them, but also are produced by tonguing harder. This will push more air at the beginning of the note. A sforzando is simply an exaggerated accent. An accent is indicated by a symbol looking a bit like &gt; above or below the note. A sforzando is indicated by sf or sfz below the note. fp or sfp indicate that a note should be played sforzando then quickly reduced to piano (quiet).

==Staccato==
Staccato notes may be slightly accented, and they should be short and separated. The shortness of the note is created by stopping the airstream. ''Do not stop the note with the tongue.'' Tongue-stopping will result in a choked sound.

==Double and triple tonguing==
Double and triple tonguing is useful in fast phrases where regular tonguing is not fast enough. For double tonguing, the first note should be tongued with the syllable &quot;tah&quot; like normal, but the second note is tongued with the syllable &quot;kah&quot;. With practice, the tongue will be able to double tongue very quickly, allowing long sixteenth-note passages to be playable by simply silently saying tah-kah-tah-kah with the tongue. Triple tonguing is similar; it is produced with the syllables tah-kah-tah. This will come in very handy in passage in fast 6/8 time or passages with lots of triplets. Whenever double or triple tounging is used, there must be more air behind the &quot;kah&quot; or else it will result in an extremely weak articulation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is meant to be a guide to non-linear dynamics in the accelerator physics field.

The aim of this book is to simplify the access to the field by

* reducing the number of concepts necessary to develop and handle the tools,
* listing the concepts used in the literature and putting them in a broader context,
* not trying to develop a complex notation that is particularly consistent, but defining verbosely any symbol used in each section 

The book is at an early stage of development. We are defining the basic concepts, notation and outlook.

There are three types of mutes for the horn - a stopping mute, a straight mute, and a practice mute.
==Stopping mute==
Stopping mutes are often made of metal and are somewhat pear-shaped. Its use will have the same effect as completely closing off the bell with your right hand (&quot;hand-stopping&quot;), which is generally preferred over using the mute. It is very important to note that this will cause the note to jump up a half-step, so you will need to finger down a half-step. If, when hand-stopping, you find that the tone jumps down a half-step rather than up, it is because you are not completely closing off the bell. Make sure that there are no gaps between your fingers. It is not uncommon for there to inadvertently be a gap between your thumb and your index finger. If you want proof that jumping down a half-step is not correct, try playing a concert E arpeggio with open valves, hand-stopped. A + sign over the note indicates to start using the stopped horn (either hand stop or use the stopping mute) and o means to return to regular, unstopped horn. In other words, + means stop, and o means go.
==Straight mute==
This type of mute does not require as much explanation. There is no alternative to the straight mute in music that calls for it. Straight mutes are usually cone-shaped and made of wood, but some are made of metal. con sord. (short for con sordino, Italian for &quot;with mute&quot;) means to insert the straight mute. senza sord. (senza sordino - &quot;without mute) means to remove it. Most straight mutes have wrist straps. It is strongly recommended that you hang the mute on your right wrist ''before'' beginning a piece that calls for it.
==Practice mute==
Practice mutes are never used in concerts, thus their name. They simply make your sound much, much quieter to avoid disturbing others when you have to practice in hotel rooms, etc.

'''With any type of mute''', it is a good idea to twist it slightly when you insert it into your bell. This will make it more secure and prevent it from falling out.

Hi Kparke,

Your &quot;parallel passages&quot; uploads appear to be scans from a copyrighted source.  Could you clarify please? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:02, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

I created the original document myself and have a link to the pdf version at the bottom of the page.

Ah, OK!  I hope I have not offended you in any way with this question.  We just have to be very careful about this sort of thing.  

BTW, I created a template a while back for displaying Bible verses, and I'm thinking that you might find it useful.  Here's an example of it in use:
{{Bible verse
|book = Genesis
|chapter=1
|verse = 1,2
|version=NIV
|text=
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
}}

Thanks for the tip about the Bible Verse Template!

Hi Kparke,

I noticed your upload of [[:File:Big_Map.jpg]]. This seems to be a scan from a print with a circle added to highlight a part of the image. The image license states you to be the author of the image. Are you the original author of the image, or is this your derivative work of someone else's image?

Also, some of the details are a little blurry. Could you upload the image in a higher resolution. Images can be automatically resized when rendered, so images are rarely too big. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:32, 4 April 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The main safety rule to follow with any tool is to ''use common sense''.
===Coping saw===
# Clamp your work firmly to a bench before cutting it with a coping saw.  You may wish to pad the clamp with a piece of scrap wood so it does not mar the piece.
# Be careful not to saw into the bench.
# Keep your fingers clear of the blade.
===Rasp===
# Do not draw the rasp across your skin - it will cut skin even easier than it will cut wood.
# Do not strike a rasp with a hammer or mallet or it may shatter.
===Plane===
# Do not test the sharpness of a plane's blade by sliding it along a finger.
# Retract the plane blade when storing.
# Keep the blade sharp.
===Knife===
# Do not push the knife toward another person (or yourself!) when cutting.  Imagine the path blade will follow if the item you are cutting suddenly give way, freeing the blade.  Always make sure nothing is in that path.
# If you drop a knife, let it fall.  Do not try to catch it.
# When handing a knife to another person, offer them the handle - not the blade.  
# Do not throw the knife.
# Do not use a locking knife unless the blade is locked.
# For non-locking knives that fold, be aware that it may close on your hand if you apply pressure the wrong way.
# Do not pry with a knife - you may break the blade.
# Keep the blade sharp. 
===Chisel===
# Store the chisel with the blade covered.
# Keep the blade sharp. 
# Keep both hands behind the blade.
# Use a mallet with the chisel rather than pushing it along with your hand.  This will ensure that your hands ''are'' both behind the blade.
# Do not put a chisel in your pocket.
===Sanding block===
# Do not throw a sanding block
# Pay attention to the path of the sanding block.  It is easy to knock something over when you're paying attention to the piece you're sanding instead of the surrounding environment.
# Do not sand skin.  Sand paper ''will'' abrade skin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">GLUT is the utility toolkit that provides Window management for OpenGL applications and their interface with the operating system.  

== GLUT alternatives ==

GLUT started as a [http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/ non-free library].
Nowadays, free/open-source and portable alternatives such as FreeGLUT and OpenGLUT exist.

In this wikibook, we recommend FreeGLUT.
See the platform-specific [[../../#Setting_Up_OpenGL|installation pages]] for details on how you can install it.

== Using GLUT to discover OpenGL version ==

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* printf */
#include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt; /* glut graphics library */
/* 
Linux c console program 
gcc f.c -lglut -lGL
./a.out
*/
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  glutInit(&amp;argc, argv);
  glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DEPTH);
  glutCreateWindow(&quot;red 3D lighted cube&quot;);
  printf(&quot;GL_VERSION = %s\n&quot;,glGetString(GL_VERSION) ); /* GL_VERSION = 2.1.2 NVIDIA 195.36.24 */
  return 0; 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== More information ==

This program shows info about glut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koders.com/c/fidCC93715ADD9A9AE521AE7ECB209AD313AD45B37A.aspx?s=file koders.com : glversion.c ]&lt;/ref&gt;

To compile :

 gcc v.c -lglut -lGL

To run :
 ./a.out

&lt;source lang = c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#if defined(HAVE_FREEGLUT)

#ifdef WIN32
#include &quot;../include/GL/freeglut.h&quot;
#else
#include &lt;GL/freeglut.h&gt;
#endif

#else

#include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;

#endif

#define PROGRAM &quot;glversion&quot;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *version = NULL;
  char *vendor = NULL;
  char *renderer = NULL;
  char *extensions = NULL;
  GLuint idWindow = 0;
  int	glutVersion;

  glutInit(&amp;argc, argv);
  glutInitWindowSize(1,1);
  glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA);
  idWindow = glutCreateWindow(PROGRAM);
  glutHideWindow();

  glutVersion = glutGet(0x01FC);
  version =     (char*)glGetString(GL_VERSION);
  vendor =      (char*)glGetString(GL_VENDOR);
  renderer =    (char*)glGetString(GL_RENDERER);
  extensions =  (char*)glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS);

  printf(&quot;GLUT=%d\nVERSION=%s\nVENDOR=%s\nRENDERER=%s\nEXTENSIONS=%s\n&quot;,
    glutVersion,version,vendor,renderer,extensions);

  glutDestroyWindow(idWindow);
  return(0);

Hi M62flyover,

Rather than tearing this book apart in an unconstructive manner, perhaps you would be willing to give it an overhaul?  You obviously have a passion for the topic, and if you can edit more constructively, your opinions will be taken more seriously.  You have made several good points about the book, and I would like to encourage you to [[Wikibooks:Be bold|be bold]].  But you also need to know that we cannot allow your edits to stand as they are. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 04:08, 12 February 2009 (UTC)



Jomegat,

Thank you for your comments, but I assure you I have no intention of being constructive or having my &quot;opinions&quot; taken seriously on such a page. I disagree entirely with the existence of a song rule book, so why would I want to help build one? I merely wanted to make a mockery of it. --[[User:M62flyover|M62flyover]] ([[User talk:M62flyover|talk]]) 10:08, 22 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter provides tools to describe linear motions

== Linear dynamics of a single particle ==


For the case of linear dynamics, the motion can be represented by a 2N x 2N matrix.
This matrix maps phase space points into phase space points.  Let us represent the initial phase space point by 
&lt;math&gt;\vec z_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The transformation can then be represented by

&lt;math&gt;\vec z = M \vec z_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The matrix &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; will be symplectic. This means that

&lt;math&gt;M^TJM=J&lt;/math&gt;

where 

&lt;math&gt;J=\left(\begin{matrix}0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\ -1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;-1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\ 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;-1&amp;0\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, in quantum mechanics, we typically deal with Hermitian operators.  These can be diagonalized by orthogonal matrices.  With symplectic matrices, we can diagonalize the matrix, but here the transformation matrix will be symplectic.  To do this, we find the eigenvectors of M.  Let us label these as &lt;math&gt;v_{\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3}&lt;/math&gt;  The positive and negative eigenmodes are related to each other by

&lt;math&gt;v_{-k} = iv_k^*&lt;/math&gt;

We can define the normalization by defining an upper indexed vector

&lt;math&gt;v^j=-i{\rm sgn}(j)v_j^*&lt;/math&gt;

Then we find the normalization condition

&lt;math&gt;v^jv_k=\delta_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix of eigenvectors 

&lt;math&gt;U=(v_1\ v_{-1} v_2\ v_{-2}\ v_3\ v_{-3})&lt;/math&gt;

is symplectic. 
The invariants are given in terms of the eigenvectors as

&lt;math&gt;G_a = -J(v_a v_a^\dagger+v_a^*v_a^T)J&lt;/math&gt;
== Linear Motion in terms of Lie operators ==

We may also describe the one turn map as an operator on x and p.  Let us consider the rotation matrix
&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}x\\ p\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}cos\mu &amp; \sin\mu\\ -\sin\mu &amp; \cos\mu\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_0\\ p_0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
We may represent this in terms of functions by the Lie operator
&lt;math&gt;R=e^{\frac{\mu}{2}:x^2+p^2:}&lt;/math&gt;
This operator acts on the functions x and p in the following way
&lt;math&gt;Rx=\cos\mu x-\sin\mu p&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;Rp=\sin\mu p+\cos\mu x&lt;/math&gt;
The eigenfunctions of R are given by
&lt;math&gt;h_\pm=x\mp i p&lt;/math&gt;
with
&lt;math&gt;R h_\pm = e^{\pm i\mu} h_\pm &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;h_\pm&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes referred to as the resonance basis.  In the non-linear problems, we will need to compute various operators built out the linear operator.  Expanding in terms of the resonance basis will allow us to do these calculations.

== 2-D phase space ==
Here the one turn map is a 2 x 2 matrix with determinant 1.
We can parametrize it by

&lt;math&gt;M_x = I \cos\mu  + J_x \sin\mu &lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;J_x = \left(\begin{matrix} \alpha &amp; \beta \\ -\gamma &amp; -\alpha\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== phase space ==
''Phase space'' refers to the space in which dynamics occurs.  In order to describe dynamics
with a Hamiltonian, one must specify the positions and momenta, &lt;math&gt;\vec x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec p&lt;/math&gt;.  Although phase space in general may be a 2N dimensional manifold with non-trivial topology(a pendulum for example, has a ''position'' coordinate that connects back on itself).  Usually, however, the ''phase space'' is  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{2N}&lt;/math&gt;.

== observable or function==

An ''observable'' or simply ''function'' is a function from the phase space to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. They can be represented as a multivariate polynomial or approximated by a truncated taylor series. An example of distribution is:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon=\gamma x^2 + 2 \alpha x p + \beta p^2&lt;/math&gt;

An observable or function can be composed with a map. See later.

== map ==

A ''map'' is a function of the phase space into itself. It can be represented as a vector of observables or functions.
Maps can be summed and multiplied by a scalar. A map can be a constant map:

&lt;math&gt;M: \vec z \to \vec z_0&lt;/math&gt;

A map can be linear. If A is a matrix:

&lt;math&gt;M={\rm map}(A,\vec z) : \vec z \to A \vec z.&lt;/math&gt;

A map can be non linear as well.

&lt;math&gt;M={\rm map}(z_1=f_1(z_1,z_2,...), z_2=f_2(z_1,z_2,...) : z_1 \to A \vec z.&lt;/math&gt;


Function can be composed with maps.

If a point in the face space has coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,p)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x,p)&lt;/math&gt; is an observable, &lt;math&gt;M =( m1(x,p), m2(x,p) )&lt;/math&gt; is a map where &lt;math&gt;m1,m2&lt;/math&gt; are observables, composition is defined by:

&lt;math&gt;f(M)= f(x=m1(x,p),p=m2(x,p)) &lt;/math&gt;.

Composition can be extended to vector of functions and therefore with maps. Maps form an algebra with the composition operation.

We denote composition with &lt;math&gt;()&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; or nothing.

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a map and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function, we denote the composition operation with

&lt;math&gt;f(A) = f \circ A = Af&lt;/math&gt;

If A,B are maps, we denote the composition operation with

&lt;math&gt;A(B) = A \circ B = B A&lt;/math&gt;,

For instance if

&lt;math&gt;M_1 = (x=x+p l, p=p)  \qquad M_2 = (x=x, p=p+k x) \qquad  f = x^2   &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;M_1(f)= (x+p l)^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;M_1(M_2)= M_2 M_1= (x=x+(p+k x) l, p=p+k x)  &lt;/math&gt;

Please note that if A and B are matrices:

&lt;math&gt;{\rm map}(A) \circ {\rm map}(B) = {\rm map}(B)  {\rm map}(A) = {\rm map}(A B)&lt;/math&gt;




One may consider a tracking code as an algorithm for computing a map which is an approximation of the one turn map.

== operator ==

An ''operator'' is a function that transform a function in a function. A map is also an operator. Operators can be generated by function like derivative operators, vector fields, lie operator. Operator can be composed to form, for instance, exponential operators.

== derivative operators ==

A  ''derivative operator'' is made of various powers of derivatives and multiplications by distributions.
Examples are [[#vector field|vector fields]] and [[#lie operator|lie operators]].

== vector field ==
A differential operator with the form
&lt;math&gt;f(x,p)\partial_x + g(x,p)\partial_p&lt;/math&gt;

== dynamical system ==

A dynamical system can be defined by the problem of solving

&lt;math&gt;\partial_t  x(t) =  f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a trajectory in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a map.

If we are interested in finding &lt;math&gt;g(x) \circ x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is in general a map,
the solution can be written as

&lt;math&gt;g(x(t))=\exp( t f(x) \cdot \partial_x) g(x) = \exp(v_f) g(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_f=t f(x) \cdot \partial_x&lt;/math&gt; is a vector field and

&lt;math&gt;\exp(v_f) = 1 + v_f + \frac12 v_f v_f + \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

The method can be used for instance for solving the diff. eq. starting from an initial condition &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.
First define
&lt;math&gt;g(x)=x&lt;/math&gt;

then compute

&lt;math&gt;s(x,t)=\exp(v_f) x&lt;/math&gt;

then substitute &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; in s, and the solution will be
&lt;math&gt;s(x_0,t)&lt;/math&gt;.

== lie operator ==
A special case of a vector field when the map is defined by &lt;math&gt;f=J {\rm grad} H=J \partial H&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the symplectic matrix.

If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;v_f=-\partial_p H \partial_x +\partial_x H \partial_p &lt;/math&gt;.

It is often denoted in the literature as

&lt;math&gt;:H:&lt;/math&gt;

such that

&lt;math&gt;:H:g=[H,g]&lt;/math&gt;

== Other concepts ==

; differential algebra :
An algebra with the properties of the derivative. Related to field of non-standard analysis.  TPSA vectors are approximate examples of.  See also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_algebra]

; TPSA:
Truncated power series algebra.  Algebra of power series all truncated  at a
particular order.  Power series may be added, multiplied. Analytic functions
can be defined for them. A power series can be composed with a map. Example:
epsilon(z).

; k-Jets:
Power series vector truncated at a particular order &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. A compositional map may
be represented as a K-jets if the generating map maps the origin into the
origin.  See also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(mathematics)]

; compositional map:
An operator generated by a map or a function equivalent to the composition of
the map with another map. A compositional map may be represented as a k-jets if the generating map maps the origin into the origin.



; Lie transformation:
The transformation induced by a Lie operator by exponentiating.  In particular, if :f: is a Lie operator, then &lt;math&gt;e^{:f:}&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie transformation.  The Lie Transformations form a group, a Lie group, which is also a topological group, when defined in a more general setting.

; lie algebra:
In general, any vector field that also has a multiplication property  
that satisfies
* bilinear
* anti-commutative
* Jacobi identity
In classical dynamics, refers to either phase space functions with  
Poisson bracket as multiplication, or Lie operators with commutation  
as multiplication

; Floquet space:
Normalized space in which particles move in circles.  Connected to Floquet's theorem which is more commonly known in solid state physics as Bloch's theorem.  See also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floquet_theory]

; BCH formula
A formula relating the combining of two exponential operators into a single operator.  For finite matrices, we state
:&lt;math&gt; e^A e^B = e^C&lt;/math&gt;
where C is composed of sums of nested commutators of A and B.  Due to the formula [:f:,:g:]=:{f,g}:, this generalizes in the case of Lie operators to the statement that 
:&lt;math&gt; e^{:f:}e^{:g:}=e^{:h:} &lt;/math&gt;
where h is a distribution on phase space.  We note, however, that this is a purely formal relationship, and may in fact break down due to lack of convergence.
h may be expressed in a series in different forms depending on what is considered the expansion parameter.  If both f and g are considered small, then
:&lt;math&gt; h = f+g +\frac{1}{2}:f:g + \frac{1}{12}(:f:^2 g+:g:^2 f)+...&lt;/math&gt;
If only g is considered small, then
:&lt;math&gt; h = g + \frac{:g:}{e^{:g:}-1}f + ...&lt;/math&gt;

== L. Michelotti, Intermediate Classical Dynamics with Applications to Beam Physics ==

Includes many of the concepts used in Forest's book.  Here they are spelled out a bit more explicitly.
L.M. makes a point to generalize phase space to a manifold.  (The subject of dynamics is described as &quot;vector fields on a manifold&quot;). This allows for phase space to have more complicated topology than R^n.  For example, the phase space of a pendulum is a torus.
The book culminates in a description of the Forest, Irwin, Berz normal form algorithm.  This is described quite formally, with emphasis on commutative diagrams and solving the homological equations at each step.  Although the purpose of such an algorithm (mainly to find amplitude dependent tune shift for a general one turn map) is described clearly at places, it is easy to get lost in all the symbols.  Reading chapters 3 and 4 describe the models that one is to keep in mind, and the physics that is to be extracted from the general perturbation theory algorithms of chapters 5 and 6.  

The epilogue begins with a quote by Saul Bellow describing the breakdown of language.  One can't help but feel that this is commentary on the state of non-linear dynamics in accelerator physics.  The break between old methods of Hamiltonian mechanics and new left a descriptive gap in the field.  Michelotti has tried valiantly to bridge that gap.  Although one may feel that he isn't entirely successful in formulating the symbols and language to describe the physics and the algorithms, this book is the closest to solid ground one may find when trying to navigate some of the literature in this field.

== Hot chocolate ==
You wake up in the morning and you want something hot and nice to begin your day, and here is a very easy recipe for delicious hot chocolate I personally love.

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup milk (or water)
* 1 ts cocoa powder
* 1 ts sugar

==Procedure== 
# heat the milk/water
# while heating the milk/water put the other ingredients in a mug and mix them very well. It would be better if you try to grind it a bit using the spoon.
# fill half the mug with hot milk/water and stir very well
# add the remaining milk/water to the mixture
# enjoy!

== Introduction ==

There are several way of tracking a particle in accelerator physics. Each one has different goal and needs its own approximation. Here there is a possible classification.

=== physics involved ===

In their evolution particles experience the following physical process:

;decay or inelastic scattering: spontaneous or triggered by very small scale interaction with other particles. The particles are propagated using probabilistic models using QFT.

;elastic scattering: small scale interaction of high energy particles with other particles that does not involve decays. As inelastic scattering particles are propagated using probabilistic models using QFT.  A special case of elastic scattering is synchrotron radiation that may or may not use probabilistic models or approximated statistics law. The approximation used are typically neglect not probable terms, simplify the motion.

;electromagnetic field: propagation due the interaction of particle with electromagnetic field which can be either external or generated by two or more particles.

=== simulation goals ===

;event generation: for describing which kind of particle may be produced after a collision
: between an high energy particle and either another high energy particle
: in particle colliders or a low energy particles in fixed target experiment. 
:The approximation used is too neglect the extension of the space time. 
:Codes are &lt;tt&gt;dmjet&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;pythia&lt;/tt&gt;.

;particle matter interaction: for calculating the efficiency of a detector, 
:the energy deposited, the radiation damage of some equipment.
:Codes are &lt;tt&gt;geant&lt;/tt&gt;,  &lt;tt&gt;mars&lt;/tt&gt;,  &lt;tt&gt;fluka&lt;/tt&gt;.

;short term analysis (one turn): for calculating or approximating beam envelops, 
:invariants of the motion and perturbation terms for periodic structures. The object 
:of the study are the explicit form of the equation of motion more than the trajectory 
:of the particle even though  the trajectories may be use to compute or approximate the equation of motion. Matter interaction and collective effects are usually not included.
:Codes are &lt;tt&gt;mad&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ptc&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;tracy&lt;/tt&gt;.

;short term simulation for beam loss: for calculating the trajectory of the particles in the tail of the particle distribution in the beam. These particles are usually source of losses or background noise in the experiments. Usually hundreds of turn are needed in these simulations. The motion is accurate but the interaction with matter is very simplified.
:Codes are &lt;tt&gt;sixtrack&lt;/tt&gt;. 

;short term simulation for collective instabilities: for calculating the short term stability of a bunch of particle due the interaction of the particles with themselves (direct space charge) or the interaction with metallic surfaces close by (impedances, indirect space charge). The motion is accurate but not the simplecticity of the equation. This is an unavoidable approximation due the high dimensionality of the problem.
:Codes are &lt;tt&gt;orbit&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;elegant&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;headtail&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;warp&lt;/tt&gt;.

;long term simulation: for evaluating the long term stability of motion in circular ring due to small non-linear perturbation. Usually thousands (electron) or millions (hadron) of turns are needed to find results. Long term simulation are used either as a direct evaluation tool for the impact of machine imperfection or as a benchmark for perturbation methods (analysis of the 1-turn map, frequency map, tune footprint, tune or action diffusion). The approximation used are share by the short term analysis.
: Codes are &lt;tt&gt;sixtrack&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;teapot&lt;/tt&gt;.

In the following, we concentrate on tracking for short term analysis and long term simulation that shares the need of keeping the mathematical structure of the equations exact.

== Discrete Tracking ==

The aim of this section is to study how to solve the motion of a single particle in a general em field without affecting the structure of the equation of motions.

If the em fields are easily approximated by discontinuous vector field occupying a well defined not overlapping region, the tracking problem can be approached by a composition of discrete steps. Each step is the exact solution of the equation of motion between the boundary of the region. The region type may be 

* a region of zero volume defined  by one surface
* a region enclosed by two parallel plane surfaces
* a region enclosed by two not parallel plane surfaces
* a region enclosed by general surfaces.

The program is to find out which kind of field and region allows the motion to be solved exactly and how to find those fields and regions that approximate the real field.

== Equation of motion ==

A particle in the vacuum has four degree of freedom and the rest mass therefore can identified by the quantities:

&lt;math&gt;\vec x=(x,y,z,t) \qquad \vec p = (p_x,p_y,p_z,p_t) \quad m&lt;/math&gt;

which are the location and mechanical momentum. The conservation of rest mass implies:

&lt;math&gt;m^2c^2= p_t^2 - p_x^2 - p_y^2 - p_z^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The least action principle and the isotropy the space and homogeneity of time implies:

&lt;math&gt;\partial_t \vec x = \partial_{\vec p} H &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\partial_t \vec p = - \partial_{\vec x} H &lt;/math&gt;

for any &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H=p_t&lt;/math&gt;.

Instead of &lt;math&gt;t, x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; could have be used as well. The solution of motion is a straight line.

In case of the em &lt;math&gt;\vec A(\vec x)=(-\phi(\vec x),A_x(\vec x),A_y(\vec x),A_z(\vec x))&lt;/math&gt;, if one wants to keep the same structure for the equation of motion, one has to substitute &lt;math&gt;\vec p&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \vec P=\vec p - q \vec A&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the charge of the particle.

The equation of motion are not exactly solvable in a bounded region in the general case. Solvable cases are:

=== drift type ===
The hamiltonian depends only on &lt;math&gt;\vec p&lt;/math&gt;. The map is

&lt;math&gt;\vec x \to \vec x + \partial_{\vec p} H \qquad \vec p \to \vec p&lt;/math&gt;.

A particular case is for no field in a parallel plane boundary region. The map is

&lt;math&gt;\vec x \to \vec x + \frac{t_f} m \vec p \qquad \vec p \to \vec p&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; is the time of flight which does not depend on
&lt;math&gt;\vec x&lt;/math&gt; because of the parallel boundaries. Assuming that the particle is sitting on one face,
if the opposite face is at a distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; then
&lt;math&gt;t_f=\frac {m d}{p_z}&lt;/math&gt;

=== kick type ===
Zero volume surface with infinite field. The motion is a change of momentum but not a change of coordinate:

&lt;math&gt;\vec x \to \vec x \qquad \vec p_x \to \vec p_x + \vec f(\vec x)&lt;/math&gt;

=== free field region (CONJECTURE TO BE CHECKED) ===

If there is no field and the region is defined by

&lt;math&gt;f(\vec x)=0&lt;/math&gt;

and if 
&lt;math&gt;f(\vec x + t_f \frac{\vec p}{m} )=0&lt;/math&gt;

can be solved for &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt;. The map is:

&lt;math&gt;\vec x \to \vec x + \frac{t_f} m \vec p \qquad \vec p \to \vec p&lt;/math&gt;

Being exact, the resulting map (maybe containing infinite terms) should be symplectic by construction.

=== uniform type (CONJECTURE TO BE CHECKED) ===

Uniform em field with parallel boundaries. Examples are ideal dipoles or solenoid magnet.

Since the motion can be exactly determined, the resulting map (maybe containing infinite terms) should be symplectic by construction.


=== derived type ===

If it exists a canonical transformation &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;that brings the field and the region in the above forms, the map 
&lt;math&gt;T S T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a map of one the type above solve exactly the motion. Example are sector bend magnets, where the canonical transformation brings to cylindrical coordinate (and may or may not cancel the bending field) and back.

=== symplectic integrator ===
In case the Hamiltonian is the sum of solvable pieces &lt;math&gt;H=H_1+H_2+\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, approximate models could be built in the form of a sequence of region such that
&lt;math&gt;\prod \exp(c_i:H_j:)=\exp(:H:+O(n))&lt;/math&gt;. A particular case is the kick drift approximation or the generalized Yoshida symplectic integrator.

=== Inclusion of Radiation ===
When tracking a single single particle through a magnetic field, if it accelerates, it will emit radiation.
This is particularly important when tracking electrons.  Actually, the effect of radiation is typically split into two distinct pieces, a deterministic energy loss, and a stochastic part resulting from the quantization of the outgoing electromagnetic field (photons).

First we describe the deterministic part.  We use a high energy approximation in which the energy and momentum are related by E=P/c. The power radiated by a charged particle in a magnetic field is given by
&lt;math&gt; P_\gamma = \frac{e^2 c^3}{2\pi}C_\gamma E^2 B^2\ &lt;/math&gt;  with &lt;math&gt;C_\gamma = \frac{4\pi}{3}\frac{r_e}{(mc^2)^3}=8.85\times 10^{-5}\frac{m}{GeV^3}&lt;/math&gt;.  Now, suppose that in the symplectic integrator, we go track through a region of magnetic field of length L.  In fact, the length of this section will depend on the initial coordinates of the particle.  The length of the region is given by &lt;math&gt;L^* = L(1+\frac{x}{\rho}+\frac{1}{2}(x'^2+y'^2))&lt;/math&gt;.  Now, in many codes, the magnetic field is normalized by &lt;math&gt;B\rho&lt;/math&gt; so that the integrated constant term is unitless.  Define &lt;math&gt;\bar B = \frac{B}{B\rho}&lt;/math&gt;. Using the relation &lt;math&gt;B\rho =\frac{E}{ec}&lt;/math&gt;, one finds that the change in the energy deviation is given by
&lt;math&gt;\delta = \delta_0 - C_r (1+\delta_0)^2\bar B_\perp^2 L^* &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; C_r = C_\gamma \frac{E^3}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the formula used in e.g. Accelerator Toolbox and Tracy.  Now that the change in energy (momentum) has been computed, the changes in the transverse momenta x', y' may be correspondingly computed.  This is done by noting that &lt;math&gt;p_{x,y}&lt;/math&gt; don't change in the radiation process.

This chapter provides tools to describe non-linear motion of the particles.  We focus on the case of circular machines.  This means that we want to understand the behavior over many turns.

== Local and Global Representation of Machine and Value of Model Building and Analysis==
The machine is composed of magnets and cavities with corresponding electric and magnetic fields.
The dynamics in these fields may be described locally by a Hamiltonian H(s).
A tracking code will integrate particles through the Hamiltonian.

There are two approaches to building up the field of non-linear dynamics in this context.  One approach is to start with various simple models such as constant Hamiltonians, various simplified representations of the one-turn map or simplified s-dependent Hamiltonians.  Features of these models are abstracted and used to build the language with which to describe the phenomena.  When realistic simulation is needed, a tracking code is used, and the resulting phenomena analyzed in terms of the simplified model.  Parameters may be varied in order to improve quantities of interest, such as phase space shape, speed of diffusion to large amplitudes, or locations of separatrices.  The results are checked within the tracking code, but the analysis occurs based on the simplified models.

The second approach would involve more direct analysis of the realistic model.  Here representations of the full s-dependent Hamiltonian, or one-turn map are analyzed.  Due to the discrete nature of the magnets and the complexity of ring lattices, analysis of the one turn map may be simpler.  This one turn map may be represented in terms of a truncated power series, or in terms of a Dragt-Finn factorized Lie operator form, or perhaps some other Lie Operator form.

The advantage of the first approach is that the models used are simpler and can be more easily related to other physical systems.  This builds up intuition and provides links to other fields and physical systems such as pendula, anharmonic oscillators, kicked rotors or orbiting planets and stars.  These are the systems in which much mathematical analysis of non-linear dynamics has occurred.  The KAM theorem, the Nekhoroshev theorem, the Chirikov criterion, and much other analysis uses as a starting point simplified systems which do not immediately describe non-linear dynamics in circular accelerators, but do so closely enough that we may expect to find many similarities, and use these theorems and bodies of theory as a guide to the phenomena we encounter in the tracking codes.  The main downside of this approach is that it typically results in qualitative results rather than quantitative.

The second approach is to use techniques directly applicable to the full system in all its complexity.  This approach implies a separation of duties.  It is one job to calculate the map for the system, and an entirely different job to do the analysis.  This approach suffers from lack of development on both ends.  On the map calculation end, the existing codes are difficult to use and not well documented.  On the map analysis end, the algorithms are rather difficult to understand in their full generality, and also suffer from some lack of clear explication.  Although further development in this direction is desirable it actually requires more than just development of local and global algorithms.  It also requires the building up of physical intuition and the connection to other fields and physical systems.  This is more along the lines of the S-matrix approach to particle physics.  Analysis of S-matrices and calculation via Feynman diagrams or whatever other technique are somewhat separate pursuits.  One may also connect this to scattering theory in condensed matter physics.  The systems are modeled in terms of input and output.  The reason for making this connection and emphasizing this is to bring out the fact that one should know what one wants to calculate from the global approach.  In accelerator physics, the normal form algorithm, supposedly the epitome and framework for analysis of maps suffers from a lack of clearly defined quantities.  Before one enters into the normal form details, one should have an idea of what one is trying to calculate. Here, a better understanding of the distinction between integrable and non-integrable is required.  If one approximates a system by an integrable system, then tunes exist for all initial conditions.  It is the job of the normal form algorithm to compute these tunes.

== Constant Hamiltonian Models and their Analysis ==

Here we consider 2-D phase space and consider a constant Hamiltonian H(x,p).
For example, let us consider
:&lt;math&gt; H(x,p) = \frac{\mu}{2}(x^2+p^2)+\epsilon x^4 &lt;/math&gt;
Hamilton's equations are given by
:&lt;math&gt; \dot x = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} = \mu p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \dot p = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial x} = -\mu x - 4\epsilon x^3 &lt;/math&gt;

== Simple Map Models and their Analysis ==
Maps may be represented in a variety of forms.  One approach is using Lie operators.
A simple example is phase space rotation followed by an octupole kick-
:&lt;math&gt; e^{\frac{\mu}{2}:x^2+p^2:}e^{\epsilon :x^4:}&lt;/math&gt;

== TPSA Lie Algebra Normal Form Tools ==

Here we describe the ways in which maps may be transformed to extract useful quantities.   We start by limiting to the non-resonant case.  For this, the entire goal of the normal form algorithm is simply to find the tune shift with amplitude.  Sometimes this involves going back and forth between power series and Lie operator, or differential operator formalisms.  
A preliminary goal is to compare the algorithms described in 
;E. Forest, M. Berz, J. Irwin, “Normal form methods for complicated periodic systems:
;&quot;A complete solution using differential algebra and lie operators.&quot; Particle Accelerators,24-91,1989
and
;M. Berz, &quot;Differential algebraic formulation of normal form theory&quot;, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.46.6663
In the second of these, it is claimed that no Lie operators are needed.  Although these papers focus on working with a power series representation with the map, we may also compare to the compact Lie representation in simple cases.
== Normal forms with Lie Map ==
We would like to transform the following map such that we can extract tune shift with amplitude
:&lt;math&gt; M=e^{\frac{\mu}{2}:x^2+p^2:}e^{\epsilon :x^4:}\equiv R e^{-\epsilon:x^4:}&lt;/math&gt;
We transform by applying
:&lt;math&gt; e^{:F:}R e^{\epsilon:x^4:}e^{-:F:} = RR^{-1}e^{:F:}R e^{\epsilon:x^4:}e^{-:F:}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = Re^{:R^{-1}F+\epsilon x^4 -F: + O(\epsilon^2)} &lt;/math&gt;
We now choose F to simplify
:&lt;math&gt; (R^{-1}-1)F+\epsilon x^4 &lt;/math&gt;
To do so, we expand &lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt; in the eigenfunctions of R:
:&lt;math&gt; R h_\pm = e^{\pm i\mu} h_\pm &lt;/math&gt;
Here, where R is just the rotation, we have
:&lt;math&gt;h_\pm = x\mp i p&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, 
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{1}{2}(h_+ + h_-), \ \ \ p = \frac{i}{2}(h_+-h_-) &lt;/math&gt;
So
:&lt;math&gt;x^4 = (h_+ + h_-)^4 = h_+^4+4h_+^3h_+ + 6h_+^2h_-^2 + 3h_+h_-^3+h_-^4&lt;/math&gt;
Now, the middle term here is the tune shift with amplitude term.  We can remove all the others by setting
:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{1}{16}\left(\frac{h_+^4}{1-e^{4i\mu}}+4\frac{h_+^3h_-}{1-e^{2i\mu}}+4\frac{h_+h_-^3}{1-e^{-2i\mu}}+\frac{h_-^4}{1-e^{-4i\mu}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Connection between polynomial maps and vector fields ==
Suppose we have a near identity polynomial map.
* &lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\ p_1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}x_0 + f(x_0,p_0) \\ p_0 + g(x_0,p_0)\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
then the vector field associated with this map is
* &lt;math&gt; f\partial_x + g\partial_p &lt;/math&gt;


== Normal forms with maps ==

We use the following notation:
* If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an array, &lt;math&gt;A[i]&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th element of the array.
* An array can be indexed by a integer number or an array of integer numbers.
* &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1,...,x_k,...)&lt;/math&gt; is a point in the phase space,
* A map &lt;math&gt;M: x \to M(x)&lt;/math&gt; is represented as an array of polynomials &lt;math&gt;x_i \to T[i](x)&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
* A polynomial f is represented as an array of coefficients indexed by an array of exponents, that is &lt;math&gt;f=\sum_j f[j] \prod_k x_k^{j[k]}&lt;/math&gt; 
* &lt;math&gt;j &lt;/math&gt; is an integer vector that identifies a monomial whereas f[j] is a real or complex number, in general, the coefficient of the monomial . The number of elements of &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the dimension of the phase space.
* &lt;math&gt;j[k]&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. It gives the power of the &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; variable of the monomial.
* The order of a monomial is &lt;math&gt;\sum_k j[k]&lt;/math&gt;.
* The order of the polynomial is the defined by the max order of its monomials.
* The order of a map is defined by the max order of its polynomials.
* In general a map is fully identified by all &lt;math&gt;T[i][j]&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the array of array &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; can be associated with a map.

We can define several operations for maps:
* &quot;act on a point&quot; &lt;math&gt;()&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;x_i\to \sum_j T[i][j]\prod_k x_k^{j[k]} &lt;/math&gt;.
* &quot;act on a map&quot; that combines two maps into another map my composing the individual polynomials. We use the same notation:
&lt;math&gt;M(A)=C&lt;/math&gt;if &lt;math&gt;C(x)=M(A(x)) \quad \forall x&lt;/math&gt;.
* &quot;sum&quot; (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;): it is given by adding element by element the array of the polynomials,
* &quot;multiplication&quot; defined by &lt;math&gt;(M A)(x) = A ( M (x) ) \quad \forall x&lt;/math&gt;.
* We can write also M f where f is a polynomial meaning &lt;math&gt;(M f)(x) = f(M(x)) \quad \forall x&lt;/math&gt;.


Now can describe the normal form algorithm.

Let
*  &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; the identity map,
*  &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; a linear map, 
*  &lt;math&gt;S,T&lt;/math&gt; maps of order &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;,
*  &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; maps of order &lt;math&gt;&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;,
*  &lt;math&gt;M=R+S&lt;/math&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;A=E+T&lt;/math&gt;
then

&lt;math&gt;A M A^{-1} = (E+T ) (R+S) (E-T+ O) = (E+T) ( R + S -RT + O ) = R + S + TR - RT + O.&lt;/math&gt;

So by carefully choosing &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; we can eliminate some terms of order &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.





Now we try to solve for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; the equation &lt;math&gt;G= R T - T R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; s a map containing unwanted terms in &lt;math&gt;R+S&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has eigenvector &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; and eigenfunction &lt;math&gt;l_k=\sum_n L[k][n] x_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the linear map that diagonalize  &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, then
* &lt;math&gt;R l_k = l_k(R) = \lambda_k l_k&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;l_k R= R(l_k) = \lambda_k l_k&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can be represented using polynomial on the variables &lt;math&gt;l_k&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;T[i] = \sum_j T_R[i][j] \prod_k l_k^{j[k]}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;G[i] = \sum_j G_R[i][j] \prod_k l_k^{j[k]}&lt;/math&gt;

To recapitulate, in this notations:
* &lt;math&gt;T_R[i][j]&lt;/math&gt; is a complex number being the coefficient of the monomial &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; function of the map&lt;math&gt;T_R&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;T_R&lt;/math&gt; represents a map in the basis &lt;math&gt;l_k&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;l_k&lt;/math&gt; is either formal variable or a linear function of &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;. The set of &lt;math&gt;l_k&lt;/math&gt; represents a map that diagonalize &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.


Using
* &lt;math&gt;R \prod_k l_k^{j[k]} = \prod_k \lambda_k^{j[k]} l_k^{j[k]}  &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; (T_R R)[i] = (R(T_R))[i] = \sum_j \lambda_i T_R[i][j] \prod_k l_k^{j[k]}  &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; (R T_R)[i][j] = ((T_R(R)))[i][j] = T_R[i][j]  \lambda_k^{j[k]} l_k^{j[k]}  &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;G_R[i][j]= \left( \prod_k \lambda_k^{j[k]} - \lambda_i \right) T_R[i][j]&lt;/math&gt;

yields
* &lt;math&gt;T[i] = \sum_j \frac{G_R[i][j]}{ \prod_k \lambda_k^{j[k]} - \lambda_i} \prod_k l_k^{j[k]}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this equation gives us &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. We can then re iterate this algorithm for the next order term.

== Normal forms,  another derivation ==

If
*  &lt;math&gt;M = R \exp(:a f:)&lt;/math&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;A = \exp(:a F:)&lt;/math&gt;
then
* &lt;math&gt;N = A M A^{-1} = R \exp(:a f - a (E-R^{-1})F + O(a^2):)&lt;/math&gt;

If
*  &lt;math&gt;T = E-R^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;f = f_r + f_0&lt;/math&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;F = T^{-1} f_r&lt;/math&gt;
then

&lt;math&gt;N = R \exp(:a f_0 +O(a^2):)&lt;/math&gt;

If
* &lt;math&gt;R = exp(:f_2:)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f_2= \sum f_2^k = -\lambda_k h_k^+h_k^-&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;:f_2: |m,n&gt; = (n-m)\cdot \lambda |m,n&gt;&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f_r=\sum A_{m,n} |m,n&gt;&lt;/math&gt;
then
* &lt;math&gt;F = T^{-1} f_r =
\sum_{m,n} \frac{A_{m,n}}{1-\exp ( (n-m)\cdot \lambda )}  |m,n&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;


TPSA formulation

M x = R x + F x
R_i = R^{-1}
R_i M x = x + F(R_i) x = x + G(x)
        = \exp(:a f:) x = x + a [ f,x ]


G(x) = [ f,x ] = -J \nabla f


Change of notation!

If
* f=\sum A[j] \prod_k x_k^{j[k]}
* j=(m1,n1,m2,n2,...)
* a(j)+ib(j) = \frac {1}{1-\exp ( (n-m)\cdot \lambda )}

== Analyses from tracking data ==

* Frequency maps
* Tune diffusion
* Action diffusion
* Emittance growth
* Dynamic aperture

Hello, and sorry for bothering you. I don't even know if this is the correct place to ask this question. If it's not feel free to tell me and I will remove or repost it in the correct place. I am not asking for permission to become an editor but I would like to know how I can tell if I have become one. Is there a notable difference in the pages or the bar that tells the level of accuracy, completeness, etc? Or is it something that you have to be looking for? I have been wanting to update the Wikijunior:All Books page because more books have been added and the format has been redone.

== Help needed with book making ==

Hello Mike,

I'm hoping you can spare us some attention with an issue we are having in trying to generate a PDF and book from a wikibook we created. I have left [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Technical_Assistance#Print_to_book_contents_page|details on a technical forum]], but am unsure if I am in the right place. You must be very busy, but we would really appreciate it if you, or someone as experienced as you could lend us a hand with this? We are trying to prepare for classes here at Otago Polytechnic but have hit a bit of a problem with the print to PDF feature. 

Many thanks. --[[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 22:05, 21 January 2009 (UTC)

== Project name and slogan in Serbian ==

Hi, you asked me to translate name and slogan for WikiBooks to Serbian, from [[m:File:Wikibooks-logo-en.svg]]. The project name is &quot;Вики књиге&quot;, as you can see at WikiBooks in Serbian [http://sr.wikibooks.org/wiki/%D0%93%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0 here]. The slogan, however, reads &quot;Размишљај слободно, учи слободно&quot; (literally translated as &quot;Think freely, learn freely&quot;). It's very &quot;open&quot; translation, I am not sure I like it, but another translation could be &quot;Слободне књиге за слободан свет&quot; (Free books for a free world). I don't know who, when and why translated it as &quot;Think freely, learn freely&quot;, but &quot;Free books for a free world&quot; (Слободне књиге за слободан свет) sounds much better and is practically a direct translation from the original slogan, which, as I said, sounds much better. --[[User:Дарко Максимовић|Дарко Максимовић]] ([[User talk:Дарко Максимовић|talk]]) 15:16, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
:I'm sorry, I don't speak Serbian so I have simply asked [[m:User:Dungodung]] for a translation.

== www-2.net Spam block ==

Re: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:COIBot/XWiki/www-2.net

Hi, I have donated a bunch of pictures to wikipedia (de, en, commons) and all my source-links to www-2.net have been removed! 

I was very careful to choose VERY appropriate pictures and some of them are real gems, '''my best photos''' and are very rare (For example the 1973 poster for [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkpop Pinkpop] and the concert poster for the [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallenstein_(Band) Krautrock band Wallenstein].

It was a lot of work, and I would hate to manually restore the source-links, can you please, '''please remove the spam-filter''' and '''restore all''' my edits? 

Presumably you will insist that your decision was correct and not rash. I just hope you have a heart and you intend to encourage the donation of pictures -- and not discourage me. [[User:Y23|Y23]] ([[User talk:Y23|talk]]) 08:05, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

==Royal House of Portugal==
Dear Mike: Presently, in Portugal, there are two families descending from Kings. One is the &quot;Braganza's&quot; Family (please check: [http://www.casarealportuguesa.org/ House of Braganza - www.casarealportuguesa.org], from the old House of Braganza, and other is the &quot;Braganza-Wettin's&quot; Family (please check: [http://www.casarealdeportugal.org/ House of Braganza-Wettin - www.casarealdeportugal.org]), from the last Reignant House in Portugal, the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. It is natural that their websites are included in their respective articles on Wikipedia, and I think that you should accept both. Remember also that Wikipedia sould be neutral in this type of discussions. Please replace the information and used it to show the difference between this pretenders. Thank you.

::I thought this was the encyclopedia that ''anyone'' could edit, not just registered users. It seems to me that IPs and new users are viewed with some contempt/animosity.

::Lastly, it seems to me for things to be in pretty bad form to semi-protect your own page and/or block someone with whom you disagree.

There is oversight and a forum for discussion. Here there didn't seem to be any discussion, just a kneejerk accusation and block based solely on an admin's desire/preference, not policy or guidance. Perhaps I just don't understand too. In any case, If you could explain that one to me I'd appreciate it. If not, could you direct me to where I ''can'' find such information?

:::Commons isn't Wikipedia - it's not an encyclopedia for one thing. As well, most projects don't have the dogmatic view about &quot;uninvolved&quot; administrators (which is misguided, IMO). I do agree with you about protecting one's talk page, but not because she's &quot;involved&quot;. Similarly, Cirt's block was in error (though an understandable one), but that has nothing to do with whether he's &quot;involved&quot; or not. Nevertheless, if you have concerns about administrative actions, there are forums for review. [[commons:COM:AN/U]] is one, as you know.

      <text xml:space="preserve">how to prevent reflection to access privated methods and members in java classes?

— You first learn how to ask a question. A question like this starts with &quot;How do I&quot;, &quot;How would one&quot; or &quot;Is it possible to&quot;, instead of &quot;how to&quot;. As for your question: You don't. At least not directly - you can however dive into Java's Security Manager, which is consulted before reflection is executed.</text>

The intention of this textbook is to present an overview of Tibetan grammar, the script, word structure, nominal phrase structure, clause and sentence structure, using only examples culled from the two texts the &lt;big&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;bo&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Jomolhari, Kailash, 'Tibetan Machine Uni'; font-size=larger;&quot;&gt;སེམས་ཅན་ཆེན་པོས་སྟག་མོ་ལ་ལུས་བྱིན་པའི་ལེའུ་&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt; and the &lt;big&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;bo&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Jomolhari, Kailash, 'Tibetan Machine Uni'; font-size=larger;&quot;&gt;ཁྱིམ་བདག་དབྱིག་པ་ཅན་གྱི་ལེའུ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.

=The Grammar=
==The Tibetan Script==
The Tibetan script, like many of the writing systems of India and South East Asia is a syllabic alphabet. That is each of the consonants has an inherent vowel sound /a/. Other vowels are indicated using additional vowel markers that appear either above or below the main letter.  The table below shows the thirty basic consonants arranged in traditional from.

{| cellpadding=&quot;8&quot; style=&quot;font-size: x-large; font-family: Jomolhari, Kokonor;&quot; face=&quot;Jomolhari&quot;
|-
|ཀ ka ||ཁ kha &lt;/span&gt;||ག ga ||ང nga
|-
|ཅ ca ||ཆ cha &lt;/span&gt;||ཇ ja ||ཉ nya &lt;/span&gt;
|-
|ཏ ta||ཐ tha ||ད da &lt;/span&gt;||ན na &lt;/span&gt;
|-
|པ pa ||ཕ pha ||བ ba ||མ ma
|-
|ཙ tsa ||ཚ tsha ||ཛ dza ||ཝ wa 
|-
|ཞ zha  ||ཟ za  ||འ 'a  ||ཡ ya &lt;/span&gt;
|-
|ར ra  ||ལ la ||ཤ sha ||ས sa  &lt;/span&gt;
|-
|ཧ ha  ||ཨ a  &lt;/span&gt;
|}

Tibetan is written as a series of syllables, each separated by an inter-syllabic dot called a ''tseg''.  No spaces are left between words.  Each syllable may contain up to seven letters.
At its most basic a Tibetan syllable my contain a root letter, ''ming gzhi'', corresponding to one of the thirty consonants in the table above, and, possibly:
* a vowel marker,
* a superscribed letter, ''mgo can'',
* a subscribed letter, ''dogs can'',
* a prefixed letter, ''snon 'jug'', and
* one or two suffix letters.

==Vowel Marks ''(dbyangs yig)'' ==

There are four combining vowel marks, which for purposes of illustration and discussion are usually shown combined with the basic letter  &lt;big&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;bo&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Jomolhari, Kailash, 'Tibetan Machine Uni'; font-size=larger;&quot;&gt;ཨ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &quot;a&quot;. 

''viz.'': &lt;span font-size=larger;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;bo&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Jomolhari, Kailash, 'Tibetan Machine Uni'; font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;ཨི&lt;/span&gt; &quot;i&quot;,་ &amp;nbsp;    &amp;nbsp;&lt;span lang=&quot;bo&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Jomolhari, Kailash, 'Tibetan Machine Uni'; font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;ཨུ&lt;/span&gt; &quot;u&quot;, ་ &amp;nbsp;    &amp;nbsp;&lt;span lang=&quot;bo&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Jomolhari, Kailash, 'Tibetan Machine Uni'; font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;ཨེ&lt;/span&gt; &quot;e&quot;,་ &amp;nbsp;    &amp;nbsp; and &lt;span lang=&quot;bo&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Jomolhari, Kailash, 'Tibetan Machine Uni'; font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;ཨོ&lt;/span&gt; &quot;o&quot;&lt;/span&gt;.

==Syllable Structure==

A written syllable consists of one or more graphemes occupying up to seven positions as follows:

==Word Structure==


==Personal pronouns==
===First person===
&lt;big lang=&quot;bo&quot;&gt;ང་&lt;/big&gt; (nga)&lt;br &gt;
ངེད་ (nged)&lt;br &gt;
&lt;big lang=&quot;bo&quot;&gt;ངོས་&lt;/big&gt; (ngos)&lt;br &gt;
&lt;big lang=&quot;bo&quot;&gt;ཁོ་བོ་&lt;/big&gt; (kho bo) [masculine]&lt;br &gt;
&lt;big lang=&quot;bo&quot;&gt;ཁོ་མོ་&lt;/big&gt; (kho mo) [feminine]&lt;br &gt;
&lt;big lang=&quot;bo&quot;&gt;བདག་&lt;/big&gt; (bdag) self, I&lt;br &gt;
&lt;big lang=&quot;bo&quot;&gt;ང་&lt;/big&gt; is the most common and generic and may be employed by all people in written and spoken discourse, ངེད་ appears for the most part to be preferred in elegant speech, ངོས་ is very common in modern letter writing, བདག་ ,when speaking to an esteemed person occurs very often in written texts, but had in large disappeared from the vernacular, except in the province of [[w:Tsang|Tsang]] as also the following, ཁོ་བོ་, ཁོ་མོ་ in easy conversation with persons of equal rank, or to those one considers of less social standing.

===Second person===
ཁྱོད་ (khyod) thou, you&lt;br &gt;
ཁྱེད་ (khyed), thou, you&lt;br &gt;
ཁྱོད་ is used in written text in addressing even esteemed persons, but in modern conversation only among equals or to those one considers of less social standing; ཁྱེད་ is elegant and respectful, especially in written texts.

===Third person===
ཁོ་ (kho)&lt;br &gt;
ཁོང་ (khong) he, she, it&lt;br &gt;
The plural is formed by adding ཅག་, རྣམས་ ཅག་རྣམས་ or ཆོ་, but very often, if circumstances show the meaning with sufficient certainty, the sign of the plural is altogether omitted. The declension is the same as that of the substantives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|Unknown|Unknown|Household Arts|South Pacific Division/Island Ed.}}

==1. In your culture name the materials which are used in mat making. ==
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Singapore coconut.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Coconut&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Bulrush Soos 01.JPG|&lt;center&gt;Bulrush&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Hanfstengel.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Hemp&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Rice straw.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Straw&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Phoenix dactylifera2.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Date palm&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Pandanus dsc03667.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Screw pine&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Mats are made of many, many different types of material, including:
* Coir (coconut fibers)
* Reeds
* Bulrushes (including cattails)
* Hemp
* Rattan (cane)
* Various grasses
* Straw
* Palm leaves
* Screw pine (Pandanus) leaves

==2. Explain and demonstrate how to prepare this material. ==
===Coir===
Green coconuts, harvested after about six to twelve months on the plant, contain pliable white fibres. Brown fibre is obtained by harvesting fully mature coconuts when the nutritious layer surrounding the seed is ready to be processed into copra and desiccated coconut. The fibrous layer of the fruit is then separated from the hard shell (manually) by driving the fruit down onto a spike to split it (''De-husking''). A well seasoned husker can manually separate 2,000 coconuts per day. Machines are now available which crush the whole fruit to give the loose fibres. These machines can de-husk up to 2,000 coconuts per hour.

;Brown fibre:
The fibrous husks are soaked in pits or in nets in a slow moving body of water to swell and soften the fibres. The long bristle fibres are separated from the shorter mattress fibres underneath the skin of the nut, a process known as ''wet-milling''. The mattress fibres are sifted to remove dirt and other rubbish, dried in the sun and packed into bales. Some mattress fibre is allowed to retain more moisture so that it retains its elasticity for 'twisted' fibre production. The coir fibre is elastic enough to twist without breaking and it holds a curl as though permanently waved. Twisting is done by simply making a rope of the hank of fibre and twisting it using a machine or by hand. The longer bristle fibre is washed in clean water and then dried before being tied into bundles or hunks. It may then be cleaned and 'hackled' by steel combs to straighten the fibres and remove any shorter fibre pieces. Coir bristle fibre can also be bleached and dyed to obtain hanks of different colours. 

;White fibre:
The immature husks are suspended in a river or water-filled pit for up to ten months. During this time micro-organisms break down the plant tissues surrounding the fibres to loosen them — a process known as ''retting''. Segments of the husk are then beaten by hand to separate out the long fibres which are subsequently dried and cleaned. Cleaned fibre is ready for spinning into yarn using a simple one-handed system or a spinning wheel.

===Reeds, Bullrushes, and Grass===
===Hemp===
===Rattan===
Generally, raw rattan is processed into several products to be used as materials in furniture making. The various species of rattan ranges from several millimetres up to 5-7 cm in diameter. From a strand of rattan, the skin is usually peeled off, to be used as rattan weaving material.

===Straw===
===Palm leaves===
===Screw pine===
==3. Name plants that can be used for making dyes in your culture. Tell where they come from and how to prepare them for dying. ==
===Rattan===
The fruit of some rattans exudes a red resin called dragon's blood. This resin was used as a dye for violins, among other things. The resin normally results in a wood with a light peach hue.

Dragon's blood resin is produced from the rattan palms of the genus ''Daemonorops'' of the Indonesian islands and known there as ''jerang'' or ''djerang''. It is gathered by breaking off the layer of red resin encasing the unripe fruit of the rattan. The collected resin is then rolled into solid balls before being sold.

==4. Show how to use native and synthetic dyes in dyeing mat making material. ==
===Using Natural Dyes===
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Natural dyes}}
===Using Synthetic Dyes===

==5. Make two mats showing two different types of weaving. One of the mats must have a reasonably fine weave. ==

The following is a list of pages from wikipedia which contain good stuff.  Could take stuff (e.g. pictures!) or simply link to some of these.

Maybe one day it would be useful to setup a system for recording when a page has been (a) linked to (b) harvested (c) has a link back to the wikibooks? [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 20:39, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

I think that is OK to take material from wikipedia as long as it appears in the acknowledgements (which it now does) [[juliusross|juliusross]]

== Problem Sets? ==

I'm taking calculus 3 from a real text book right now. The only way I can learn anything thing is through problem sets and the solution sets. Also This book needs more fully typed examples just like a real text book.

== Chapter Organization ==

I think the current organization is not ideal.  If I wanted all things involving Differentation, I would type Differentation in the search bar and click go.  This would yield 5 pages of search results, so I would probably just start with the first option, Calculus:Differentation.  Now that I am more knowledgeable, I would go to the Calculus:Differentation contents page, and see all the topics there, with each article listed like so: Calculus:(insert specific title here).  I suggest that we change these to Calculus:Differentation/(specific title).  This would require some major reformatting of all the contents pages, but I feel this would lead to easier navigation, especially for the casual reader.  --[[User:SimRPGman|SimRPGman]] 02:32, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

:: That seems a good idea.  You might want to look at the naming convention on the community portal page to see what they suggest. [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 15:25, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

== Substitution rule ==

I understand the substitution rule, but there is one sitution I dont understand. Say we have f(x) whose integral is F(x). Let f(x) be for example 1/(1+x^2). Everyone knows its integral is arctan(x), but I dont undertand the method. First, they substitute x to tan(u), so that dx=sec^2du and the whole thing become 1, which has an antiderivative of u = arctan(x). But doesnt the substitution rule only apply if one changes f(x) to u? And not x to f(u)? Because the chain rule states the derivative of F(g(x)) is f(g(x))g'(x), it makes no sense to change x to f(u). Also if one had the function (x^3)/(thirdroot(x^3+4)), my book says:

The substitution u=thirdroot(x^2+4) leads to the following equivalent equations:

u^3=x^2+4,    x^2=u^3-4

Taking the differential of each side of the last equation we obtain

2xdx=3u^2du

Is it legitimate to do that? All I can make of this is that they implicitly differentiated x^2 with respect to u and then multiplied both sides by du, but obviously you cant treat dx/du as a fraction? Or can you?

:The way I learned it is this:
:First, let's define a function &lt;math&gt; f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and it's inverse &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  So, we know that:
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=g^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
:and, therefore,
::&lt;math&gt;g(f(x))=x&lt;/math&gt;
:so, using the chain rule:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;g'(x)=\frac{1}{f'(g(x))}&lt;/math&gt;
:Now, you know that: 
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}arctan(x)=\frac{1}{sec^2arctan(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
:And, using this variant of the pythagorean theorem:
::&lt;math&gt;sec^2x=1+tan^2x&lt;/math&gt;
:You then get:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}arctan(x)=\frac{1}{1+(tan(arctan(x))^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:and voila!

== Hello- Problem sets and Implicit Differentiation. ==

Hello. I was thinking about adding some problem sets with worked out solutions to the differential calculus sections. Also, no one has added an i mplicit differentiation section or worked problems/problem sets. I was thinking about doing that in the section after the chain rule. Good or bad idea?

:Sounds like a good place for it since implicit differentiation is basically just the chain rule applied. (PS it's a good idea to 'sign' entries on talk pages with three tildes, like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; It will show up on the page as your username, adding a forth tilde will add the date and time.) [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

== Move to new naming policy ==

I believe it's time to consider converting this entire book to the new [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] (using slashes instead of colons &amp;mdash; for example, [[Calculus/Differentiation/Exercises|Calculus:Differentiation:Exercises]] would become [[Calculus/Differentiation/Exercises]]). There appear to be 80 pages starting with &quot;Calculus:&quot; that would need renaming (i.e., moving). The changing of individual links can be accomplished with a bot (it's around here somewhere) or worked on &quot;by hand&quot; at a leisurely pace, since redirects will exist from the old names. Any strong objections? - [[User:Dcljr|dcljr]] 19:57, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
: Looks like [[User:Jguk]] has [[Special:Prefixindex/Calculus|made the required changes]]. Thanks. (Although, as I suggested above, I would have left redirects in place so that links from external sites to the old page names would still work.) - [[User:Dcljr|dcljr]] 18:09, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

==sources of GFDL'd or PD problems==

Several people have commented on the need for problem sets. One source of problems, available under GFDL, is [http://www.lightandmatter.com/calc/ m own book]. The latex source code is available through its web page, and I would imagine it would be pretty easy to convert problems for use here, since mediawiki uses latex for math. Solutions are given in the back of the book for all the problems in the early chapters. Another source of problems is Thompson's Calculus Made Easy, which is public domain (at least the original editions are).--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 17:47, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

:I agree that problem sets would be great, seeing as practice is the most important part of any calculus course.  The answers should not be presented immediately, either (i.e. problem-solution-problem-solution), but in separate chunks so a motivated individual could go through and solve them en masse and actually learn something by it (i.e. problem-problem-problem, solution-solution-solution).--[[User:Fyedernoggersnodden|Fyedernoggersnodden]] 19:11, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

:: I started [[Calculus/Infinite series/Exercises]], once upon a time. My format: a section of several problems, followed by a section of hints, then a section with answers only, and finally a section of complete solutions. - [[User:Dcljr|dcljr]] 02:22, 18 November 2007 (UTC)

== L'Hospitals rule? ==

Does this book have a section on L'Hospitals rule? I looked in the &quot;applications of derivatives&quot; page, but it wasnt there (that i could find). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

: I thought I created for L'Hôpital's when I first joined the project. The book has changed a lot since then, though. I am going to go through [[Special:Prefixindex/Calculus|all the pages]] next week. I know a couple pages are orphans, I think others are effectively orphans, and I'm pretty sure there is some redundant material. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 05:27, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

== Infobox has been created ==

I am not familiar with this book's history and would like for a usual editor to enter the infobox information. Help can be found at this [[Infobox|link]]. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 21:34, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

== Archive ==

I am going to archive this page if there are no objections--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:18, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

== Less than optimal state ==

I have been working on this book for about 5 hours now and there seems to be no end to the work needed. Clean up of existing sections is desperately needed as well as expansion on anything marked 25% . This is not a textbook as it stands now, but it can be, if a concerted effort is made. cheers --[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:39, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

Pictures are desperately needed, cull them from wikipedia--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:41, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposed style ==

See my user subpage [[User:Cronholm144/Calculus]]--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:39, 20 June 2007 (UTC)

== Explanations ==
I would like to see a little more explanations and discussion to go along with the simple theorums. In general there are three ways to understand any mathematical method. by its proof, its graphical geometry, or its algorithm. There needs to be explanations of all three ways. Preferably these explanations should be written by someone who remembers what it is like to not know these things. Someone who learned this and has been using it for a few years but not long enough to think it is self explanatory.

==Worked on Adding a Limits Section==
Dear Calculus co-authors:  I have expanded the book to include limits section because the limits page was getting quite long.  If another approach to the book's organization is better, let me know [[User:Gwilm|Gwilm]] ([[User talk:Gwilm|talk]]) 03:29, 20 February 2008 (UTC)

== Newton vs. Leibniz ==

There's no mention in the introduction of the two notations. Should this be added? In most of the differnetiation articles, Leibniz notation is used but not in the article devoted to [[Calculus/Implicit differentiation|Implicit differentiation]]. Should this be fixed?
[[User:Battlebison|Battlebison]] ([[User talk:Battlebison|talk]]) 01:38, 30 March 2008 (UTC)

:Common notations are mentioned in [[Calculus/Differentiation#The Slope at a Point]] (edit: and have a heading at [[Calculus/Differentiation#Understanding the Derivative Notation]]). I think pages should use one notation or state their reasons for using another. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 00:05, 29 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

Bg6 is almost always played as the only sensible place for the bishop to retreat to, although defending the bishop with g6 is a very rare alternative, leaving black with an inferior pawn structure.

While Nd7 seems inferior because of the weak bishop, this was never tested in the only instance this move was played at master level, between Rustam Kasimdzhanov and Mikhael Mchedlishvili in the European Clubs Cup (Men) in 2003. (That game quickly transposed back to a main line, continuing: ''6...Nd7 7. Nf3 h6 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 11. Bf4 Ngf6 12. O-O-O Be7 13. Kb1 O-O 14. Ne4 Qa5 15. g4 Nxg4 16. Ne5 Ndxe5 17. dxe5 Rad8 18. Qh3 Qb4 19. Rdg1 Qxe4 20. Rxg4 Qh7 21. Rhg1 Kh8 22. Qg3 Rg8 23. Be3 a6 24. a3 Rd7 25. Qg2 Rd5 26. Qg3 Rd7 27. Qg2 Rd5 28. Qg3 1/2-1/2.'')

It may appear at first that White can trap the bishop, but this is not the case after 7. h5 Bf5 8. Nxf5 Qa5+! +=.

Viktor Korchnoi has played 5...exf6 many times (including in a world championship match). 5...exf6 is sounder than [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...c6/2. d4/2...d5/3. Nc3/3...dxe4/4. Nxe4/4...Nf6/5. Nxf6/5...gxf6|5...gxf6!?]] of the Bronstein-Larsen Variation and offers Black rapid development.

Black has voluntarily opted for an inferior kingside pawn structure and a practical necessity of castling queenside, but also has some compensation in the form of the open g-file for the rook and unusually active play for the Caro-Kann. It is generally considered somewhat more unsound than [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...c6/2. d4/2...d5/3. Nc3/3...dxe4/4. Nxe4/4...Nf6/5. Nxf6/5...exf6|5...exf6]], but former top-10 player Bent Larsen employed it with some success during the 1970s.

Once you can answer all questions, you should be ready to defend your disseration. However, you need to start somewhere!
#What is your area of interest? Why do you care about THAT? Why do YOU care about that?
#What is the practical problem you want to address?
#What is the theoretical problem you want to address? In other words, what knowledge we are lacking?
#What is you hunch about a possible the theoretical solution?
#What are the two-three key concepts you are planning to use to think about this problem? 
#Why do you need each of them? What is each concept’s purpose? How all of them fit with each other, and why do you need all three?
#What do you think is already known about your topic? 
#Which fields or subfields, which “schools” or research traditions crated this knowledge? Do you know any big shots?
#What can you add to what people have already found?
#What is your impression of the state of the field(s) with which you’re working?
#What is the title of your dissertation?
#What are your empirical methods? What’s the project?
#What is the hypothesis?
#What is your conceptual framework? Please use narrative, not a picture.
#What is the foundational literature for your topic? 
#How do you evaluate the state of foundational literature? 
#What are the core research findings you will be using?
#What is new in your project? 
#Divide literature in groups in a logical way; explain how these different groups of lit have a job to do in your dissertation. 
#Tell a short narrative about the research literature you will be using.

We talked about subroutines and code references earlier, but there is a lot more material to cover with these issues then we had room for in that chapter. Now we're going to cover some of the more advanced features of subroutines and code references.

#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
void* bsearch( const void *key, const void *base, size_t num, size_t size, int (*compare)(const void *, const void *));
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function bsearch() performs a search within a sorted array, returning a pointer to the element in question or '''NULL'''. 

''*key'' refers to an object that matches an item searched within ''*base''.  This array contains ''num'' elements, each of size ''size''.  

The ''compare'' function accepts two pointers to the object within the array - which need to first be cast to the object type being examined.  The function returns -1 if the first parameter should be before the second, 1 if the first parameter is after, or 0 if the object matches.

#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
void* qsort( const void *base, size_t num, size_t size, int (*compare)(const void *, const void *));

}}

The function qsort() performs a [[w:quicksort|Quick sort]] on an array.  Note that some implementations may instead use a more efficient sorting algorithm. 

''*base'' refers to the array being sorted.  This array contains ''num'' elements, each of size ''size''.  

The ''compare'' function accepts two pointers to the object within the array - which need to first be cast to the object type being examined.  The function returns -1 if the first parameter should be before the second, 1 if the first parameter is after, or 0 if the object matches.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
void *calloc( size_t num, size_t size);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function calloc() allocates a block of memory that can store ''num'' objects of size ''size''.  In addition, the block of memory allocated is set to all zeros.  

If the operation fails, calloc() returns '''NULL'''.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
void *realloc( void *p, size_t s);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function realloc() resizes a block created by malloc() or calloc(), and returns a pointer to the new memory region.

If the resize operation fails, realloc() returns '''NULL''' and leaves the old memory region intact.  

{{NOTE|realloc() does not have a corresponding operator in C++ - however, this is not required since the standard template library already provides the necessary memory management for most usages.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Globalization and Migration==
===Globalization===
The term [[Wikipedia:Globalization|globalization]] was first defined in the Merriam-Webster Third International Dictionary, 1961 edition.  It is said, however, that the phenomena of globalization started with the first humans.  A general definition of globalization is “the process of integrating nations and peoples--politically, economically, and culturally--into a larger community.”&lt;ref&gt;&gt;&quot;Globalization.&quot; Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy. 3 vols. 2nd ed. Charles Scribner's Sons, 2002. Reproduced in History Resource Center. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale. http://galenet.galegroup.com.access-proxy.sno-isle.org/servlet/History/.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary globalization is fueled by the increases in technology (especially concerning communication and transportation).  Scholars in political science, economics, linguistics, anthropology, geography, law, art, and film studies have all helped to define the term.  Many have identified techno-economic globalization as the beginning of other forms of globalization, such as transnational cultural exchange.  &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Globalization.&quot; Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy. 3 vols. 2nd ed. Charles Scribner's Sons, 2002. Reproduced in History Resource Center. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale. http://galenet.galegroup.com.access-proxy.sno-isle.org/servlet/History/.&lt;/ref&gt;    

The focus is not only toward individual nations but rather the entire globe. Therefore, a better definition perhaps would emphasize that contemporary globalization is a complex, controversial, and synergistic process in which improvements in technology combined with the deregulation of markets and open borders bring an increased stream of people, money, goods, services, and information. Globalization combines people, businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and nations into larger networks. Globalization promotes convergence, harmonization, efficiency, growth, and in some cases, democratization and homogenization.  &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Globalization.&quot; Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy. 3 vols. 2nd ed. Charles Scribner's Sons, 2002. Reproduced in History Resource Center. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale. http://galenet.galegroup.com.access-proxy.sno-isle.org/servlet/History/.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that Globalization has historically and currently caused extremely negative and destructive outcomes on certain peoples. This is especially true when contact is between industrialized mass consumption societies, and foraging or horticultural groups.

'''An example of globalization aiding an indigenous group:'''
The Kayapó: people are the Gê-speaking native peoples of the plain lands of the Mato Grosso and Para in Brazil, South of the Amazon Basin and along Rio Xingu and its tributaries. The Kayapó are nomadic people who still live in the rain forests using a sustainable slash-and-burn horticulture [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cultural_Anthropology/Production,_Inequality_and_Development#Modes_of_Production mode of production]. Using global media and international attention, they have established political power over their own land. At one time, mining and logging threatened to destroy the rain forest, and their way of life. However, the Kayapó people used forceful tactics to banish loggers and miners in some areas, as well as establishing themselves as an economic force. Later, they were again threatened by secretive government plans to build a series of hydro-electric dams on their land. However, a large demonstration was created by the Kayapó that caught the attention of the media world-wide. This demonstration, at the site for the first dam in Altamira, Pará, lasted several days and brought much pressure upon both the World Bank and the Brazilian government. As well, the rock star Sting made an appearance at the demonstration. As a result, the World Bank denied the request for a loan which was to be used to build the dam and the Brazilian government backed out of its original plans.  As well, the Kayapó have relations with The Body Shoppe: they supply the chain with the Brazil nut oil used in their best-selling line of hair conditioners.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayapo_people.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''An example of Globalization not aiding an indigenous group:'''
A very good historical example of the negatives of globalization is the European colonization of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. European diseases to which the native populations had no natural immunity paired with technological superiority in especially military weapons and tactics caused the extermination of roughly 90% of the natives. &lt;ref&gt;http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Globalization has also harmed many cultures that are exploited by big businesses from other countries.  The working conditions of laborers in Indonesia who make shoes are very harsh, as they work 60+ hours a week and live in fear of their supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;Promotional Culture - Seminar in Intercultural Management&quot;, Copenhagen Business School.http://www.anthrobase.com/Browse/Thm/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===How Globalization Affects the Five Modes of Production===
=====The Five Modes of Production:=====

1.        [[w:Foraging|Foraging]]- hunting and gathering food and provisions. 
[[en:Image:Farming-on-Indonesia.jpg|thumb|300px|right]]

2.	  [[w:Horticulture|Horticulture]]- “slash and burn”, gardening, plant cultivation as a means to harvest food and resources.

3.	  [[w:Pastoralism|Pastoralism]]- a system of agriculture based on raising stock such as cattle, sheep, or goats.

4.	  [[w:Agriculture|Agriculture]]- the practice of cultivating soil, producing crops, and raising livestock in preparation of marketing the resulting product.

5.	  [[w:Industrialism|Industrialism]]- capitalism, specialized manufacture, technological processing

=====Globalization's Affects on Modes of Production:=====

1.	'''Foraging''': Foraging societies have been impacted by globalization through an increased amount of contact with others from various cultures around the globe. This vastly increased contact most often involves severe reduction in available territory to support the foraging lifestyle. Foraging supports a much less dense poulation than do other modes of production.

2.	'''Horticulture''': Horticulture is affected by globalization much in the same manner as foraging. The Horticultural society depends on the practices of migratory slash and burn farming as well as hunting and gathering, and the amount of available land to produce food in theis manner becomes more and more strained and globalization continues.             

3.	'''Pastoralism''': This is affected by globalization because the animals herded, raised and butchered in this mode of production can be exported out of their original region. Having important things in common, such as food can further ‘the process of integrating nations and peoples’. Furthermore, the wool sheared from sheep can be used in the international textiles industry. Material from one place can be made into clothing that can be sold in an abundance of locations around the world.

4.	'''Agricultural''': Globalization affects this because through agriculture food can be grown or raised in surplus, and sent around globally. Drugs(legal and illegal) are also sent around the world.

5.	'''Industrialism''': This is affected by globalization because many cultural aspects are spread by industrialism, especially through technological means, which is one of the most efficient modes of communication and exchange.

====Tourism====
Tourists are defined as people who stay in locations that are outside of their normal environment without intent to settle there. They travel to new places for recreational or leisure purposes. 

Many nations, such as Greece, Thailand and The Bahamas heavily depend on the revenue created through global tourism. Employment in these areas is heavily reliant on associated areas of work (i.e. hotels, transportation services like cruise ships and taxis.)
[[Image:Pacific Princess 1987.jpg|thumb|''[[Pacific (ship)|Pacific Princess]]'' off the [[United States of America|U.S.]] West Coast.]]

There are three classifications for locations of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism tourism]:
:'''Domestic tourism''' - residents of a certain country travel within their country. (i.e. an American living in California visits New York)
:'''Inbound tourism''' - non-residents travel within the borders of a given country. (i.e. an Australian tourist visits a Chinese resident)
:'''Outbound tourism''' - residents of one country travel within another country (i.e. a Canadian resident visits Greece)

Additionally, there are five types of tourism: &lt;ref&gt;Smith, Lavene L. Hosts and Guests: The Anthropology of Tourism. 2nd ed. Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania P, 1989. Google Books. Google. 4 Mar. 2009 &lt;http://books.google.com/books?id=YONSh9ItwWAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA4,M1&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

:'''Ethnic tourism''' - visits to see native people from a very foreign/ different environment (i.e. traveling to Nahua Indians and their local and national governments) &lt;ref&gt;NANCY OJEDA-MACIAS. ETHNIC TOURISM: THE CASE OF CUETZALAN, MEXICO. https://www.msu.edu/user/schmid/ethnic.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Cultural tourism''' - visits to experience other cultures on a general level (i.e. traveling to New Orleans, Louisiana for [[w:Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]])
:'''Historical tourism''' - visits to historical sites or monuments (i.e. traveling to Paris to see the [[w:Eiffel Tower|Eiffel Tower]] or traveling to Rome to see the [[w:Colosseum|Colosseum]])
:'''Environmental tourism''' - visits to experience a completely different environment than the traveler is accustomed to in their home country (i.e. traveling to Antarctica) This also includes going to a national park that is preserved for environmental sight seeing by the National Park Service (i.e. traveling to Yellowstone or Yosemite)&lt;ref&gt; U.S. Department of the Interior.http://www.nps.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Recreational tourism''' - visits to partake in activities unique to the destination (i.e. traveling to Pamplona, Spain to see the [[w:Running of the Bulls|Running of the Bulls]])

The [http://www.unwto.org/index.php United Nations World Tourism Organization] (UNWTO) is one of the leading tourism organizations that regulates and informs tourists around the world.

Oftentimes tourists are drawn to a country by an attraction within that nation. Some of the most popular international tourist attractions include the Eiffel Tower (France), Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italy), and the Great Wall (China.) The Great Wall of China draws around 10 million visitors a year. Other cultural aspects, such as tasting the cuisine, experiencing traditional events or learning the language, may also attract tourists. 

Throughout history, people with an elevated level of affluence have had greater ease traveling. Wealthier people have both the money and the time needed to visit other areas, whereas people in lower classes do not have this luxury.

Tourism is largely beneficial to the worldwide economy, but there are also risks associated with it for both the tourists and country being toured. For tourists, issues such as security and health are present whenever they are in a country different than their own. In some cases, cruise ships have dealt with [[w:cruise ship|outbreaks]] of contagious diseases. For the country being toured, there are many issues as a result of annually inviting millions of strangers across their borders. Inviting strangers into their country is not their only danger, though. There are a variety of things that can happen to countries who rely on tourism as their main source of economic income. Natural disasters and terrorism are both great dangers when it comes to tourism. For example, hurricane Katrina kept many people from visiting the hot tourist spot, New Orleans, which had been destroyed due to a natural occurrence. In addition, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, many people were reluctant to visit the super city of the world, New York. It is risky for countries to rely solely on tourism because there are unexpected and uncontrollable things that can happen that will keep people from traveling to certain parts of the world. &lt;ref&gt; Knox, Paul L. and Marston, Sallie, A, Human Geography: Places and Regions in Global Context, 4th Ediition, Pearson Prentice Hall, NJ 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism is a central industry to the island nation of Jamaica. It is among the leading foreign exchange earners for the nation, and draws many tourists from the English speaking nations as well as from other nations. The island is home to many luxury resorts located on the white sand beaches, and guests to these resorts are treated to many aspects of the Jamaican culture. However, these relaxing settings are far different from the environments of the majority of the inhabitants of Jamaica. The island is urbanized and many citizens earn extremely low wages; this is coupled with the problems the nation faces in the financial sector, such as extremely high inflation and a low GDP.

The country of Thailand is also a tourist hotspot. It has been called the “backpacking capital of the world”, and most of its tourism expenses are directed towards those that could accommodate a backpacker. Because of this, many of Thailand’s attractions are remotely cheap, especially around the city of Bangkok. Tourism is central to Thailand, and many civilians sell their own goods in the markets located throughout the country. All across Thailand you can find amazing scenery, delicious food, and low prices, if you know where to look, and Thailand thrives on the income it receives solely from its tourists.

====Consumer Culture====
[[Image:Fredmeyer edit 1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Packaged food aisles of Fred Meyer in Portland at Interstate and Lombard]]
[[w:Marxist_philosophy|Marxian and neo-Marxian theory]] leads to the view that one of the major driving forces behind globalization is the corporate need in capitalism to show increasing profitability through more, and more far-reaching, economic imperialism…  enhancing profitability by increasing cultural hegemony nationally and ultimately throughout the world.” &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  Once organizations have economically dominated their own nation, a culturally driven need to expand outward to other nations occurs.  Mostly driven by American corporations, industries continue to expand by the exportation and exploitation of other countries.  Mere exportation is no longer enough to feed the companies, and a new aim to globalize consumerism and evoke a demand for the same products all over the world has arisen.  Thus a global market and consumer culture has emerged and flourished.   Companies like Wal-Mart, Disney, McDonald's and Visa MasterCard all spend enormous amounts of time and resources to entice customers with a desire for freedom, lower prices or a quality experience, in affect, causing all people to consume in similar ways.  This market culture is bought by consumers as a way of life, and poses underlying assumptions that money and products buy us a better life, and corporations are designed to make consumers always feel dissatisfied with what they have and ready to buy more, and is therefore able to reproduce and sustain itself.

This widespread sense of a consumer culture has not always existed. It is largely an outcome of America's wealth and status coming out of WWII. Corporations were at the height of their manufacturing capacity after the war, and had made a fortune funding the military/industrial complex. They stood to make an even more considerable amount of money if this monumental demand for products could be sustained. This demand was created by impressing on the American people, and soon after people around the world, the association between acquiring material goods with increased social standing. Since corporations also control the means through which we view the world, i.e. the media, they could easily make this consumerist mindset a habit in society. This lifestyle has now been through a few generations of people, and for the most part we now short-sightedly assume that we have always, and will always live this way. 
	
This mass migration of goods, people and especially information has resulted in continual negative repercussions on cultural diversity and the environment.   The companies that have created and sustained this market have received a lot of money and power which they use to pursue expansion and make more profit to satisfy few people.  As a result, the world of consumption affects an increasing number of people who relocate to work for their business, concentrate in cities and consume which creates waste and uses energy and resources.  Consequences of “Americanization” as concluded by critics, are the irreversible impacts on the strength of cultural diversity, as well as the environmental sustainability of our planet.

An example of this culturally invasive global trend  can be seen in the plastic surgery rooms in Iran.  During the Islamic Revolution[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_revolution], make-up was confiscated from Persian women and their faces were extensively covered in the name of Islamic culture.  Today, Iran is the nose job capital of the world.  Iranian women spend an average of $1,500 to achieve the 'perfect nose'.  With the introduction of satellite television from the west and the increasing forces of globalization, Persian women have adopted the idea that “a western nose is more beautiful.” The naturally large Persian nose is considered “out of style… and the hot look is inspired by Hollywood… the smaller noses of western women.” &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;   The nose job craze strips women of undermines the charm of recognizably Persian features and creates a more uniformed beauty, desirable to obtain better social standings and presumed success.

=====Globalization of Hip-Hop=====
[[File:Sundiata hip-hop 2007 - 33.jpg|thumb|Dance competition at the Third Anniversary of Zulu Nation Seattle Celebration of Hip Hop Culture, part of Festival Sundiata, a Festál event at Seattle Center, Seattle, Washington 2007.]]
Hip-hop is a potent example of the capacity for popular culture to cross national boundaries. Fed by the fashion and entertainment industries and reworked by successive generations, hip-hop is more than a musical form; it is a way of life. Originating in 1970s New York City, hip-hop emerged from inner-city art expressed through graffiti, block parties, break dancing and rapping - all carried out in public areas - to an international cultural entity. Now in the twenty first century, hip-hop is seen not only in the urban areas of the United States, but all over the world like in South Africa, Brazil, England, India, and Italy. Ian Condry, a cultural anthropologist spent a year and a half, starting in mid 1995 studying the hip-hop culture in Japanese culture. In his article &quot;Japanese Hip-Hop and the Globalization of Culture,&quot; Condry investigated how the culture of hip-hop has been translated and adopted by Japan. 

Although on the surface the Japanese hip-hop culture looks quite similar to American hip-hop culture, there are major differences between the two. The two cultures share the same characteristics such as the loose baggy clothing, large amounts of jewelry or 'bling,' and the classic Nike sneakers. But unlike American hip-hop participants, Japanese hip-hop culture comes secondary to traditional Japanese customs and values. At night between the hours of 1 and 5 am in the morning, a Japanese hip-hop participant is fully indulged in the hip-hop culture. But when the next day begins, they return to their daily traditional Japanese lifestyle - living at home with their parents and being the products of the Japanese educational system. This traditional Japanese lifestyle is strangely being incorporated into hip-hop culture, as Condry's article documents: &quot;Japanese cultural practices do not just disappear&quot; just because people seem to conform to the style of global hip-hop. Much like American culture, Japanese cultures, both traditional and hip hop, are blending together to form a new collecting culture, thus demonstrating the globalization of hip-hop in Japan. Condry provides an excellent example of this by telling how these hip-hop participants went to one another in one of the &quot;genbas&quot; and in the middle of a hip-hop scene exchanging traditional New Year's blessings.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Condry: Japanese Hip-Hop and the Globalization of Popular Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization of hip-hop has reached the country of Italy. Hip-hop in Italy is taken after a type of poetry called ottava rima where stanzas have 8 lines of 11 syllables in a rhyme scheme of abababcc. Ottava rima is a very polished form of hip-hop that sounds almost sing-songy. At first rap in Italy was almost directly the same as it was in the United States, but since the 1980s, the Italians have molded it to be their own. Different dialects of Italy bring out a great variety of the music. Italians use hip-hop as a way to convey what happens in their everyday lives, very similarly to that of American hip-hop, which can be distinguished from rap. Rap generally focuses on living a rich life, partying, and putting down women. The people rap about the Mafia, government corruption, homelessness, and drug addiction. Italian hip-hop artists look at their art as a social protest. &lt;ref&gt;ELISABETTA POVOLEDO. NEW YORK TIMES. http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/23/arts/music-in-italy-a-long-tradition-of-homegrown-hip-hop.html?scp=1&amp;sq=globalization%20of%20hip%20hop&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=1&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that Americans do not recognize hip-hop outside the states but that hasn’t stopped other nation, such as Latin America from trying to get onto the hip-hop map.   With time, reggaeton beats are being mixed with American hip-hop and have become quite popular in the clubs.  Although these new artists may not be from the “streets” considered appropriate for the scene they are making an impact nonetheless.  An American DJ, Wesley Pentz, stumbled across a demo tape while in Brazil finding a brand of music all its own. It consisted of hip-hop, carnival rhythms, and even a bit a samba. The image of hip-hop is no longer just the American “hood” it had begun to take on a global meaning.&lt;ref&gt;MARTIN EDLUND. SLATE MAGAZINE. http://www.slate.com/id/2119464.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural Imperialism vs. Cultural Hybridization===
To understand the spread of culture, ideologies, and lifestyles around the world, anthropologists have developed the theories of cultural imperialism and cultural hybridization. Cultural imperialism states that some cultures dominate, and eventually replace, other cultures. This became a popular way to understand the spread of Western culture to the rest of the world. However, its notions are flawed. First, cultural imperialism assumes that non-Western peoples are powerless against the spread of Western culture. Second, it implies that Western culture never changes. Third, it ignores cultural trends that occur around the world completely outside of &quot;the West.&quot; Because of these flaws, anthropologists developed a different explanation called [[Wikipedia:Hybridity|cultural hybridity]]. This new understanding states that cultures don't just blindly adopt dominant cultural traits, but rather borrow parts of different culture that complement or contribute to their own. Another term used to define this method is cultural creolization. This perspective focuses on the creativity and motivation involved in hybridization. Rather than culture-change being explained as the accidental domination of one culture over another, it shows how native people purposefully adopt and domesticate foreign ideas.

One example of cultural hybridization could include the fact that Kanji, one of the three writing systems in the Japanese language, was first developed from Chinese characters. Many characters have the same meaning in Japanese and Chinese but the pronunciations are different.
==== Addtional Information- Taiwanese People and Culture ====
Human habitation in Taiwan dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years, and evidence suggests that the ancestors of today’s indigenous peoples came from southern China and Austronesia. There are currently 11 major indigenous groups in Taiwan: the Atayal 泰雅族, Saisiyat 賽夏族, Bunun 布農族, Tsou 鄒族, Thao 邵族, Paiwan 排灣族, Rukai 魯凱族, Puyuma 卑南族, Amis 阿美族, Yami 雅美族, and Kavalan 葛瑪蘭族. Collectively, they comprise less than 2 percent of Taiwan’s total population. 

Both the culture and lifestyles of Taiwan’s indigenous peoples have continued to change as the descendants of Taiwan’s earliest inhabitants adjust to rapid modernization. Young people are leaving traditional occupations, such as farming, hunting, and fishing, for jobs in the cities. Indigenous languages are still spoken in Taiwan, but the number of native speakers is rapidlly declining, with younger generations usually not as fluent in their own ancestral tongue as they are in Mandarin or Minnanese 閩南語.

===Cosmopolitanism===
[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cosmopolitanism Cosmopolitanism]is a concept that was first used by the Stoic philosophers of ancient Rome. In the Stoic sense, cosmopolitanism means that every human being, “dwells […] in two communities – the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration”. &lt;ref&gt; Nussbaum, Martha C. (1997). Kant and Stoic Cosmopolitanism, in The Journal of Political Philosophy, Volume 5, Nr 1, pp. 1-25 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt; During the Enlightenment, Eighteenth century philosopher Immanuel Kant revisited the term and defined it as being versed in Western ways, promoting a kind of “First World” culture. Cultural anthropologists use the term today to include alternatives to this elite Western culture. Cosmopolitanism can be thought of as being comfortable in more than one cultural setting and being able to handle multiple perspectives or new ways of thinking

===Migration===
Human migration refers to any movement of humans from one area to another. This can occur over any distance and in various group sizes. It is now more common for families to migrate together. Nuclear families move from one area to another in response to economic and social needs. 

One prominent example of migration was the Holocaust[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust] in World War II. The genocide that was inflicted upon people of Jewish descent and religion in Europe at the time reflected the necessity for Jewish people to migrate. The Holocaust that occurred in Europe is an example of forced migration of people of Jewish descent or religion because of the threat of death of not moving away from Hitler's forces. All across Europe Jewish people were forced out of their homes. Some were taken to concentration camps while others fled to other countries reflecting the necessity to move away from death or enslavement. As a result of the United Nations Partition Plan[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Partition_Plan] for Palestine, many people migrated to the British Mandate of Palestine, which is now modern day Israel.

World War II resulted in voluntary migration as well. After the war ended, in 1945, Germany was in a state of economic collapse and needed rebuilding. The country had lost over 4.5 million people in the war and many more; especially the Jewish population had left the country for fear of persecution. Germany used aid from abroad to develop new industries in many cities. However, there was a big shortage of labour that threatened the industrial recovery because there were more job vacancies than workers so extra labour was needed. Germany solved this problem by importing ‘guest workers’ especially from Turkey, Italy and Greece. These countries were less developed than Germany so people migrated to gain work, earn money and live in a more developed country. &lt;ref&gt; BBHS CASE STUDY -  Voluntary Migration - Turkish Migrants into Germany by Rachael Scarisbrick http://www.sln.org.uk/geography/schools/blythebridge/ASCSTurkey.htm &lt;/ref&gt;
    
Another example would be during the [[w:Chinese_Civil_War|Chinese Civil War]], the [[w:Kuomintang|Kuomintang]] (KMT), led by [[w:Chiang_Kai-shek|Chiang Kai-shek]], escaped from China and fled with the ROC government from [[w:Nanjing|Nanjing]] to [[w:Taihoku|Taihoku]] (Taipei), Taiwan's largest city, along with some 2 million refugees from China, consisting mainly soldiers, KMT party members and some most important intellectual and business elites.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan#History]

Yet another example of migration in the United States was In the early decades of the twentieth century, movement of blacks to the North increased tremendously. The reasons for this &quot;Great Migration,&quot; as it came to be called, are complex. Thousands of African-Americans left the South to escape sharecropping, worsening economic conditions, and the lynch mob. They sought higher wages, better homes, and political rights. Between 1940 and 1970 continued migration transformed the country's African-American population from a predominately southern, rural group to a northern, urban one. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam008.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theories of Migration====
In Adams Smith's concept of the [[w:Invisible Hand |Invisible hand]], he described the reality of economy where people act in their own interest. People who seek wealth mostly follow their own interest and well being. Based on [[w: neoclassical economics|neoclassical economics theory]], capital moves from high wage countries to low wage countries. Conversely, flows of labor move from low wage countries to high wage countries. People in poor countries are willing to work for low wages, so factories are built in these places to cut costs. Two possible effectors to migration are push factors and pull factors. The push factor is where there is a lack of jobs, political fear, or the threat of natural disaster which forces people to move from their country of origin.  The pull factor is where there are job opportunities with higher pay and better living conditions. 

Companies such as Nike build sweatshops in poor countries such as in Vietnam in order to cut costs of labor, while effectively increasing their net revenue. Nike has about four times as many workers in Vietnam than in the U.S. An article by Johan Norberg, mentions that people in Vietnam like their new jobs because not only do they receive better pay but also they do not have to work in the sun.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; There are many more companies that build sweatshops in poor countries mainly because there is a great demand for work and the people are willing to work cheap because in their eyes, it is advantageous to work for a little than not at all.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200306/ai_n9251504

====Diaspora====
The term diaspora refers to the forced or voluntary movement of any population sharing a common ethnic identity who leave their settled territory and become residents in new areas disconnected from their former home. This is converse to the traditional nomadic culture. Diasporic cultural development assumes that a group or community takes a different course compared with the population of the original settlement. Evidence of a Disporic culture is the community's resistance to primary language change and the maintenance of their religious and cultural practices. Some examples of this include, Tibetan monks living in Nepal, India since the Chinese invasion of Tibet, as well as the large populations of Hongkongese people living in Vancouver, London, Sydney, Singapore, New York and Los Angeles. 

=====Jewish Diaspora=====

[[W:Jewish Diaspora| Jewish Diaspora ]] began when the Assyrian conquered Israel in 722 BC and the Hebrew people were scattered all over the Middle East.  These victims seemed to always be ignored in history books. When Nebuchadnezzar[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebuchadrezzar_II] deported Judeans in 597 BC, he allowed Jews to remain in Babylon, while others fled to the Nile. This was considered the beginning date of Jewish Diaspora. There were now three groups of Hebrews. Some were in Babylon, Judea, Egypt, and other spread around the Middle East. All of these Jews retained their religion under Persian and Greek law. Some converted to different religions but were faithful to the new-found Torah. The Romans discriminated against the Jews. Governors wanted to get as much money revenue as possible and took any money they could get. The Judeans revolted and in 73 AD the last of revolutionaries were holed up in the mountain fort of Masada. 1,000 men, women, and children starved in the besiegement for two years. Rather than surrender to the Romans, the remaining people in the mountain killed themselves. The Romans destroyed Jerusalem, annexed Judea, and drove Jews from Palestine. The Diaspora would continue as Jewish people spread over Africa, Asia, and Europe.

=====Armenian Diaspora=====
The Armenian diaspora is a term used to describe the groups or communities of Armenians living outside of Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh region of northern Azerbaijan. It mostly refers to the migration of Armenians during and after the Armenian Genocide.

======History======
The Armenian diaspora has existed since the loss of Armenian statehood in 1375, it grew considerably in size after the Armenian Genocide. Most Armenians stayed on the Armenian plain remaining in historical Armenia under control of the Ottoman Empire. Armenians survived as peasant farmers in rural Anatolia, but others mostly merchants resettled in the major Ottoman cities such as Constantinople, Smyrna, and Tarsus. Through upward social mobility they were able to gain wealth and status even as a non-Islamic minority. This changed when in the mid to late nineteenth century, the change political climate in the Ottoman Empire prompted political paranoia. Fears of uprising revolts and coup left the Ottoman's looking for a scape goat. They found this in the Ottoman-Armenian population. The Young Turk government in an attempt to solidify their power massacred or forcibly removed the vast majority of Armenians from the eastern Anatolian provinces to the South West during the Armenian Genocide.

[[Image:ArmenianDiaspora.png#file|right|thumb|500px|Map of Armenian Diaspora]]

Today estimates range from half to two thirds of the world's Armenians live outside of historical Armenia.[http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/] Armenian communities have emerged all over the world with the largest communities existing in Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Russia, Poland, Western Europe, India, and North America. Of the total Armenian population living worldwide estimated to be 9,000,000, only about 3,000,000 live in Armenia and about 130,000 in Nagorno-Karabakh. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_diaspora] The rest of the populations appear to be equally dispersed around the world with approximately two million living in former Soviet states.[http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/] The post communist Republic of Armenia has officially defined the Armenian nation to include the far-flung diaspora, a policy in accord with the feelings of many diaspora Armenians. Armenia officially considers all of the displaced Armenians to be part of Armenia and in 2008, Armenia created a Diaspora Ministry to strengthen ties with the Armenian Diaspora.

====Long-Distance Nationalism====
Long-Distance Nationalism came about when members of a [[w:diaspora|diaspora]] would decide to support their homelands’ struggles. The immigrants being citizens of a state different than their homeland have been known to show little citizenship participation towards their homelands.  However, they normally feel more of an attachment to their homelands than to where they currently live, which then leads them to support the struggles in their homeland. They tend to participate in the current conflicts of their homelands by propaganda, money, and weapons, any way besides voting.  
	
=====Trans-border states=====
Immigrants who are members of Long-Distance Nationalism are also known as Trans-border states. They are people who are citizens of another state, but claim that even though they have left the country, their descendants remain part of their ancestral state. Therefore, they still have the right to participate in homeland struggles for they are expected to return home bringing with them new skills to help build their nation. In many nations trans-border states are permitted the right to vote in their country of origin. In the Dominican Republic emigrants that have become citizens of other countries are expected to vote in the Dominican elections. People of Trans–border States have the right to participate in decisions that will ultimately affect them, no matter where their decisions are made.

Long Distance Nationalism has outgrown its definition and is now known as Trans-border states with the only difference between the two being that the citizens show more loyalty towards their homeland. Citizens of another state who claim that even though they have left their homeland country, their descendants remain part of their ancestral state are citizens involved in Trans-border states. They want the right to participate in their homeland struggles for they are expected to return home bringing with them skills to help build their nation. In many nations people involved in Trans-border states are permitted the right to vote in their country of origin. In the Dominican Republic emigrants that have become citizens of other countries are expected to vote in the Dominican elections. People of Trans-border states have the right to participate in decisions that will ultimately affect them, no matter where their decisions are made. The reason Trans-border states has become more easily carried out on a global scale is because advances in communication and transportation have increase in size allowing the ability for more of an impact in their homeland. Trans-border states are able to remain in the national struggles of their homeland more than ever before. In Mexico and the Philippines it can be vital for emigrants to attribute to Long-Distance Nationalism by remitting money to sustain their families and communities. It is encouraged in Mexico for emigrants to participate in homeland politics. Although it is encouraged in Mexico it is also discouraged in many other countries, such as the United States soon after September 11th. After September 11th, dual loyalties began to be re-examined and the USA took precautions with countries that had Long-Distance Nationalism inside the US.

====Different Types of Migration====
#Internal Migration&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Covered_wagon_at_the_High_Desert_Museum_Outside.jpg#file|right|thumb|200px|Replica of a covered wagon used to travel west.]]
Internal migration is the movement from one part of a country to another.  Moving is a long, difficult process, and so in order to make it worth a family's or a people's while to move, the promise of wherever they are moving to has to far outweigh the promise of wherever they are moving from.  Reasons for internal migration are varied, but may include economic hardship, religious persecution, someone's job forcing them to move, or any combination therein.&lt;br&gt;
An example from American history is the Westward Movement, where there was mass migration by settlers from the eastern part of the country out west via the Oregon Trail.  The reasons for pioneers moving west were also varied, but most were motivated to move in hopes of economic gain.  It was thought that the western United States had a near infinite amount of space, and so there would be room for anyone who wanted to settle in Washington, Oregon, and California to have a large farm of his own.  Some minority groups, such as the Shakers and the Mormons, moved in hopes of settling communities of their own, free from persecution because of their religious ideals.&lt;br&gt;

#International Migration--- I'd like to do this term [[User:Curtis Wisser|Curtis Wisser]] ([[User talk:Curtis Wisser|talk]]) 05:59, 9 March 2009 (UTC)Curtis Wisser

Migration can occur for many reasons such as work, rights, religion, and family. One of the most known types of migration is international migration. This kind of migration occurs when persons cross international state boundaries.  In some cases, people stay in the new country for a short period of time. There are also many people who migrate permanently and work in order to bring their families to their new destinations.  (Requirement 2a)

It’s common knowledge that many Latin American Hispanic citizens migrate to the United States in order to find work to provide for their family. An anthropologist by the name of Eurgenia Georges examined another example of migration, on people from Los Pinos to the United States. In most households, the husband would migrate and work until they could bring their family to America; “This sometimes took several years because it involved completing paperwork for the visa and saving money beyond the amount regularly sent to Los Pinos.” Some families however, preferred to stay in Los Pinos after getting their feet moving, but returned to the States for a month or more annually in order to keep their visa. (Requirement 2b)

#Transnational Migration

====Different Types of Migrants====

*'''Labor Migrants'''
[[Image:Migrant Worker by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|Migrant farm worker, New York]]
[[w:Migrant worker|Labor Migrants]] are workers who move from region to region in order to find work. Labor migrant workers focus on jobs that are the most plentiful depending on the time of year or season. In other words migrant workers are primarily seasonal workers (1). The United Nations defines a [[w:Migrant worker|migrant worker]] as anyone working outside of their country of origin. The definition of [[w:Migrant worker|migrant workers]] is different for all parts of the world but is usually considered someone who moves looking for seasonal work.
&lt;(1)ref:http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/migrant_labor.aspx&gt;

In [[w:Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]], [[w:Washington|Washington]] there are many migrant workers. There has always been a large number of them because of the vast agricultural base in [[w:Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]]. Over time the number of migrant workers has increased greatly because of the up and coming wine industry. The workers there are now settled and have ceased to migrate seasonally because there is so much work. All of these workers are field workers. They harvest grapes, asparagus, and apples which falls into the unskilled workers category. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker] [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/381844/migrant-labour] 

Another example of labor migrants from [[w:Washington|Washington]] is in [[w:Pasco, Washington|Pasco]]. The drop out rates of the school are largely influence by seasonal migrant workers. When the crops need to be harvested workers move to [[w:Pasco, Washington|Pasco]] and bring their families with them. Then when they leave the students drop out instead of transferring. It is believed that some of the workers are [[w:Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] and this puts a lot of strain on the school system to support the students. Although so many Hispanic students may make classes larger immigration also leads to an exchange of cultural values. It results in an exchange of knowledge and expertise between two nations. Immigration serves as an opportunity to interact with people of other countries. It gives a platform for people from diverse backgrounds to come together and share their views. &lt;ref&gt;Manali Oak. http://www.buzzle.com/articles/pros-and-cons-of-immigration.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Refugees'''
A refugee is someone who is forced to leave his or her country. Many things can cause this forcing of migration, some of which include: fear, stress and violence. People leave their homes for their own safety. Refugees are migrants that cross borders. People who leave home but do not cross borders are called internally displaced persons.  The majority of refugees will leave their home country but still remain within their region of origin. Three-quarters of refugees love in the developing world.  Syria for instance had received the majority of Iraqi refugees with about 1.4 million. Iran and Pakistan are also major receiving countries for Afghan refugees. Germany and the United States are the Western countries which host the most refugees. States that have signed the 1951 Refugee Convention[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention] are legally committed to protect the rights of refugees who arrive in their country. The convention also enforces the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits the deportation of refugees to places where their lives or freedoms could be in danger.

Today millions of Iraqi refugees have fled their homes for either safer locations within Iraq or to neighboring countries. Five years into the United States military intervention of Iraq, the country is facing the largest humanitarian and displacement crises in the world. There are approximately 1.5 million Iraqi refugees living in Syria, Jordan and other neighboring countries. Some Iraqis who have tried to return to their homes have found them either destroyed or occupied. The likelihood of violence in areas of Iraq is still high and these refugees are living in increasingly desperate circumstances.[http://www.refugeesinternational.org/where-we-work/middle-east/iraq] Pictured below is a family of refugees near the Jordanian border.

It is very common for refugee camps to be unsanitary and not livable places. Although they are better than the country the people fled from. Many people die of disease. Refugees also are at high risk for crime and violence. With small rations and short supply of everyday items people are turned against each other in the fight for survival.

*'''Internally Displaced Persons'''

	As defined by the United Nations, internally displaced persons are persons or groups who have been forced or pressured to leave their homes or places of residence, generally to avoid armed conflict, generalized violence, violations of human rights, or natural or human-made disasters, yet unlike refugees, they do not cross any internationally recognized state borders. The aid and assistance of IDP's is extremely difficult. This is because in international law, it is the responsibility of the government of the state that the people are within to provide assistance and protection. However, many are displaced as a result of civil conflict or violence in states where the authority of the central government has been undoubtedly undermined. So it is unlikely that the countries involved are capable or willing to help these IDP's. There is also the issue that, unlike refugees, a binding legal international legal regime on internal displacement is absent. The Guiding Principles of Internal Displacement was drawn up by the United Nations in 1994 but it is not binding, leaving these people unprotected unless individual organizations such as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR] or the International Committee of the Red Cross[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICRC] elect to provide assistance.

Although it is nearly impossible to accurately record how many IDP's there are in a given country, it is estimated that Sudan is at the top of the list with around 6 million IDP's. This country has been experiencing a civil war for over 25 years and in 2005 things worsened when neighboring country Chad attacked. The Sudanese government itself is uncapable and unwilling to help its citizens and has been charged with crimes against humanity. The government's militia, as well as the rebel groups it is fighting, are both accused of killing innocent civilians and humanitarians. Although programs have been put in effect to relocate the IDP's, they are being reintegrated in small numbers and it is clear that this country has a long way to go. The lack of housing and employment as well as the destruction of schools, health facilities, and water sources due to the civil war are all huge barriers to progress. {{cite web|url=http://www.landinfo.no/asset/748/1/748_1.pdf|title=Sudan-Internally Displaced Persons in Khartoum|accessdate=2009-03-4}}

*'''Institutional Migrants'''

Migrants workers in America are usually (unofficially) defined in the same way as the United Nations defines a foreign worker, as &quot;a person who works in a country other than the one of which he or she is a citizen.&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_worker] Institutional migrants are migrants with cultural practices and social lives, keeping some of their former country and traditions with them. These can be internally displaced persons, as well as labor migrants and people from out of the country. These peoples would be classified under anthropologists Richard Wilk and Lisa Cligget's economic &quot;camp&quot; of the social model of human nature. This suggests that the person is motivated, at least in part, to improve the condition of the whole society that they belong to, rather than just their own standing.[http://books.google.com/books?id=ahUNthKmzWcC&amp;dq=wilk+and+cliggett&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EnbH9-eB2P&amp;sig=1PSskNHM4GVWCXiyeFJqVe6eWVc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=07q0SYDTMInOsAPIsYV4&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1] Institutional migrants follow societal rules and regulations of power and tradition in the economic field. People see themselves as a part of a group, and put efforts toward improving that group.

Institutional migrants are seen throughout our own United States today. Many of these migrants are from out of the country, though some people who move around within the United States for work could be classified as such. The huge numbers of these migrants have helped give the U.S. its &quot;melting pot&quot; nature. They travel here for work, or a variety of other reasons, and bring with them their cultural ideas, social systems, and often their families. This is usually accepted by people who were already citizens, as long as the new migrants take in some American culture as well. An example of institutional migrants within our country could be truck drivers or families/workers moving around the country according to agricultural seasons. These people are working around the country, but usually have a home (and family) that they return to at least once a year. Their ties are kept strong even though they migrate.

====Substantive Citizenship====

Substantive [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship Citizenship] is linked to the idea of forming an identity and cultural distinction. In this type of citizenship it shows that minority groups are at a disadvantage because it can ascribe “imagined labor market identities to workers with different nationalities” &lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;. Which ends up causing a lot of problems and unfair treatment. This concept “implies the notion of equality in that citizens are said to share a common status in respect of the rights and duties that they hold”, but instead it deals with who gets to “enjoy the rights that ensure effective membership of a national community” &lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;.

An example of this seen in the world is that countries like the United States, France or England see working on a farm or the growing of crops as a lower job. While in places like Central and South America, farming is seen quite frequently and is accepted as an equal job. Which means that when the people from that nation move to the United States, or places in Europe, and this is the only job that they know how do, leads to discrimination of these groups, like racial discrimination, which may discriminate against their citizenship.

====Immigrant's Rights: Education====
Historically, the United Sates is a nation that has hosted immigrants, for a variety of reasons.  The government allowed immigrants to work the fruit fields during the 1930s when there were worker shortages, recruited aliens to be in the army in exchange for citizenship, allowed refugees to stay here during times of trouble.  However, there are problems that immigrants face while here.

They face some struggles while they are here in the United States. If they do not obtain the proper legal status this affects them in their jobs, in schools and social.  In their jobs they can’t get a high paying job despite any level of expertise they may have in the area that was studied in their country of origin. If an immigrant doesn’t have a social security number, which is for taxing purposes, and then you cannot be employed for a decent job. Getting residency takes up many years and a lot of money, that’s time and income that they may not have at hand.  They are left in limbo for several years, unable to really do anything to provide for their families. These struggles continue with the children in school because children can’t attain higher educational for many reasons, lack of financial aid, fear of deportation, and lack of motivation to further their schooling. Social it affects immigrants in particular these children who where brought over to the United States when they were really young at from no choice of their own may consider themselves “Not American.” Even if they have lived the majority of their lives here, they are considered by many as “not Americans”. What does it mean to be American?  A piece of paper that allows you to pay taxes? Or your values, beliefs, likes and dislikes, your life history? If we bring it back to history this is a nation of immigrants, it is the melting pot. And if look to who was here first they we are all foreigners except Native Americans who’s this is their land first.  Furthermore, if these students do not obtain an education within society most that do not have an education are seen as low meaning not smart, ignorant and not worth your time.  So what can we do about this to make sure these students to obtain a higher education? 

There have been laws in congress that have been made to help immigrant in their education. Here are a few, starting 1954, Brown v Board of Education when blacks and whites weren’t the only ones separated, Asians, Natives, Chicanos, etc. In this case the court ruled that “separate is not equal” and therefore segregation unconstitutional. In 1982,  Plyer vs. Doe where Texas denied school enrollment to anyone who didn’t show proper legal documentation. In this case, the Supreme Court guaranteed K-12 education for all children regardless of their residence or immigration status.  The reason to why they ruled this was because they believed that children couldn’t control their parent’s behavior or reasons for bring them to the United States, thus their undocumented status. Also, that withholding education from them takes a toll on their social, economic, intellectual, and psychological well-being. Social they were seen low in society. Economic they couldn’t get a good job later and people will look down on someone uneducated. Intellectual there is no source to which prepare for the world. Finally, psychological it affects their self-esteem, making them degrade themselves. This is great but it now leaves the question to collage. In 1996, Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) , the Supreme Court passed a document that said that anybody that is unlawfully present in the US, cannot receive  instate tuition in colleges and universities unless they are eligible for it “without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.” However, many states interpreted in different ways.  Some states took it as a means to deny instate tuition to anyone not of legal status. In 2001 Texas became first to interpret residency based on domicile (a steady place to live –one need a home address) and high school graduation. Others now include: New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Utah, Washington, California, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska. Only 10/50 states have this interpretation. In 2003, WA – Student Residency Tuition Adjustment Act, grants undocumented students to pay instate tuition. Under the conditions that they must have graduated from high school or gotten their GED within the state, lived in the state for at least 3 years and signed an affidavit saying they will correct their immigration status as soon as possible. All of these are great but there is still the question of money, how will they pay for collage if they can’t get financial help. Even if undocumented students find a way to pay for college, without a social security number, they may not be able to get a job and this is creating and perpetuating a lower class of people that will never be able to move out of poverty.

Recently there has been a new act that been presented to congress in 2002 called the Development Relief Education for Alien Minors (D.R.E.A.M.) Act. This is the second time that it is in congress. The D.R.E.A.M.  Act is a bipartisan bill that would allow undocumented students conditional legal status (and eventual citizenship granted with certain requirements. The purpose is to help young people who have no way of obtaining legal residency (even if they have lived here most of their lives), because of the immigration status of their parents that are either undocumented or in immigration limbo. If this act passes the students must meet the following requirements: 

-Brought to the U.S. before age 16

-Lived in the U.S. continuously for 5 yrs before the D.R.E.A.M. Act passes

-Graduated from a U.S. high school or obtained a GED

-Have good moral character with no criminal record

-Complete 2 yrs of college (comm/Tech/vocational/university) or military service

-student must be under age 35

So how will the D.R.E.A.M. Act help undocumented students? Well first of all it is a path to legal residency. First they will gain conditional (temporary) residency. In order for them to obtain regular legal permanent residency, by the end of conditional period, permanent residency would be given if during the six years they maintained good moral character, and kept a clean record, avoided lengthy trips abroad, and graduated from a 2 years college or certain vocational colleges, or studied for 2 years toward a B.A. or higher degree, or have served in the military for at least 2 years. If they meet all of these requirements, then they will get their permanent residency. This will help the 65,000 undocumented students who graduate form for a high school every year to be able to work, drive, go to school, and participate as a normal American. I it is life changing and it will impact these students by increase their average future earnings and they will have the opportunity to major in anything like education. By keeping them in school, it would reduce gang membership. And finally they will be able to call the U.S. their home. 

Right now it is in congress and 52 members of Congress (U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives) have co-sponsor the DREAM Act and for it to pass we need 60 members of Congress to co-sponsor it. President Obama even supports it, he said &quot;Creating an educated workforce will stimulate our economy, increase productivity, and help the U.S. compete in the global economy. Students who would benefit from the Dream Act are our future teachers, doctors, nurses, and lawyers. The Dream Act will allow thousands of immigrant students to access higher education and maximize their contributions to our economy and communities.&quot; Ways in which you can help are by going into http://www.change.org/ideas/932/view_action/ten_things_you_can_do_for_the_dream_act and singing petitions and calling in your local representative to support the Dream Act. By supporting the D.R.E.A.M act, these students will be able to further their education and have a chance to succeed and overcome barriers that they weren’t able to before.

====Flexible Citizenship====
Flexible citizenship[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship]] was defined by anthropologist Aihwa Ong as “ the strategies and effects employed by managers, technocrats, and professionals who move regularly across state boundaries who seek both to circumvent and benefit from different nation-state regimes.” This concept allows the nation-states to work together to move toward a better economy and global success. This is closely related to the concept of globalization[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization]. It seemed before that in order for the nation-states to become globalized they would need to be independent, this has proven to be very contradictory due to flexible citizenship. This concept allows people such as business owners and managers to better their company and do so on a much larger scale.  It calls the concept of nationalism[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism] into question for some, due to their dispersal within other countries but has been proven to be very beneficial. 

This is exemplified in the Chinese culture. Chinese elite families are large components for the successes in the economy of the Pacific Rim. This all began when Chinese began moving into European empires, while doing so the Chinese were required to strengthen their bonds within their family and business partners in order to be successful. The Chinese did not feel as though their citizenship should hold them back from doing business overseas. They felt that it was their right to “promote familial interests apart from the well being of society.” Many of the Chinese do not feel as though they have a commitment to nationalism on any level. The Chinese feel as though “making money in the context of globalization required the flexibility to take advantage of economic opportunities wherever and whenever they appeared.” For example, a Hong Kong family business owner had their son run a part of the hotel chain in the Pacific regions, while another brother lived in San Francisco and managed the hotels that were located within Northern America and Europe.

====Postnational Ethos====
Within the Chinese Culture and Flexible Citizenship there can sometimes be a few negative effects.  When families are dispersed all throughout the world it is hard to stay happy and close when things such as support, relationships, and parental responsibilities are neglected.  It seems as though the success sometimes gets out of control and all that is seen by them is success. It is forgotten what it is like to think of things other than globalization [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization], a capitalist economy, and money. The concept of nationalism can completely lose its meaning and they seem to follow a postnational ethos. This happens when “an attitude toward the world in which people submit to the govern mentality of the capitalist market while trying to evade the govern mentality of nation-states.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mapudungun is a [[w:polysynthetic language]] where words are made up of particles, small words that changes different aspects of the word. By the use of these particles a verb can be turned into a noun, a noun into a verb and a adjective into a noun. A verb can be changed from present tense to past or future, alot of changes are made by adding these particles.

Amun - To go, I went or I have gone.

Amu'''a'''n - Im going to go.
Amu'''le'''n - I am going.

== Transition Metals ==

The transition metals are found in the middle of the [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table|periodic table]].  There are two definitions of ''transition metals'':

# All d-block elements (Groups 3-12)
# Elements with partially occupied d-orbitals or that can form cations with partially occupied d-orbitals

The first definition is more common and is used casually, but the second definition emphasizes the unique properties of transition metals and is the one used by IUPAC (The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry). The second definition is commonly considered to exclude Zn, Cd and Hg because these elements have a ''d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'' electronic configuration (the d-orbitals being fully, not partially, occupied). However, recently reported fluoride Hg(IV) compounds, which have a ''d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'' configuration put this exemption into doubt and make it reasonable to consider Hg (and possibly Zn and Cd too) as transition metals.

Transition metals behave differently than other metals because of their partially occupied d-orbitals.  Adding electrons to a transition metal does not affect its valence shell because the electrons go into the d-orbital (which is not part of the valence shell).  All transition metals have one or two valence electrons.

=== Electrons and Oxidation ===

Transition metals are interesting because they can have several [[General Chemistry/Redox Reactions/Oxidation state|oxidation states]], unlike most other metals.  This happens because the transition metals can lose their d electrons in addition to their s electrons when forming ions.  

[[Image:Transition metal oxidation states 2.png|center|frame|The solid dots show common oxidation states, and the hollow dots show possible but unlikely states.]]

Remember that an electron orbital is most stable when it is full or half-full (or empty).  Studying the electron configurations of the transition metals shows an interesting pattern:
&lt;center&gt;
{|
| Sc: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Ti: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| V : || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Cr: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;'''5'''&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Mn: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Fe: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Co: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Ni: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Cu: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;'''10'''&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Zn: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

To be more stable, an s-electron &quot;jumps up&quot; to the d-orbital in chromium and copper.  This also occurs in in heavier transition metals like molybdenum, tungsten, and platinum.  With heavier transition metals in Periods 5, 6, and 7, the effects of ''relativity'' cause changes in the energy levels of the orbitals.  In those elements, s-electrons &quot;jump up&quot; to d-shells more often than expected with the full/half-full rule.

When ions of the transition metals form, they lose their s-electrons first, then they lose their d-electrons if further ionized.  For example, copper can form two different ions, and titanium can form three:
&lt;center&gt;
{|
| Cu:              || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; 
|-
| Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:  || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; 
|-
| Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; 
|-
| Ti:              || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
|-
| Ti&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
|-
| Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 
|-
| Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;: || [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; 
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Colors ===

Transition metals and their oxides, when dissolved, form colored compounds.  Group 1 and 2 metals are clear when dissolved and white when precipitated.  Other metals, like lead, are clear when dissolved and may have color when precipitated (lead precipitates are yellow).  Transition metals, on the other hand, are colored when dissolved.  Different metals are known for their specific colors, finding use as inks or paints.

[[Image:Coloured-transition-metal-solutions.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Left to right: cobalt(II) nitrate (red); potassium dichromate (orange); potassium chromate (yellow); nickel(II) chloride (green); copper(II) sulfate (blue); potassium permanganate (purple).]] 
&lt;!-- maybe mention ligands and crystal field theory--&gt;

== Families ==

===  Coinage Metals ===

The &quot;coinage metals&quot; are [[w:Copper|copper]], [[w:Silver|silver]], [[w:Gold|gold]], and [[w:Roentgenium|roentgenium]].  These elements are used for much more than just coins, and many other elements besides these are made into coins.  Furthermore, roentgenium is radioactive with a half-life of 3.6 seconds, making it useless for commercial applications.  Consequently, the &quot;coinage metals&quot; are more appropriately called '''Group 11 (IB)''' elements.

Copper, silver, and gold, although relatively rare (copper), rare (silver), or extremely rare (gold), are among the longest-known and most familiar elements. They are soft, shiny, dense metals resistant to corrosion and very good conductors of electricity. Roentgenium, a recently-discovered synthetic element, is so short-lived that its physical and chemical properties are ill-defined.

Copper is by far the most heavily used of these elements due to its electrical properties, its commonness (contrasted to silver and gold) and the attractiveness of its alloys brass and bronze. Until aluminum became commonplace, copper was second only to iron in production among the metals.    

&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=150px&gt;
Image:Kupferfittings 4062.jpg|Copper pipes
Image:SilverUSGOV.jpg|Silver, the shiniest
Image:Gold1oz.jpg|Gold
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

They are easy to identify when found because copper (reddish) and gold (yellow) are the only two colored metals that people are likely to encounter. Silver is the shiniest of metals, and it is usually found in the presence of copper or gold and gives an obvious contrast. They are often found uncombined.

Because of their softness they are easily struck as coins, and their comparative rarity and attractiveness, along with their resistance to corrosion make them compact stores of wealth. They are too soft to have structural value, but copper alloys with such elements as zinc and tin to form harder brasses and bronzes. Brass and bronze were essential in the earliest metal tools; without them, civilization as we know would be impossible. Gold and silver, due to their attractiveness and their resistance to oxidation, have been used heavily in jewelry and other ornamental works. Gold, although extremely expensive, is so malleable that at modest cost a small amount can be pounded into a foil of extreme thinness that allows it to be used as a covering of some architectural objects; a little gold goes a long way.    

Copper oxidizes with some difficulty to the +1 state in halides and an oxide and to the +2 state in salts such as copper sulfate CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Soluble copper compounds are easily identified by their distinctive blue-green color. Silver oxidizes to the +1 state in such substances as silver nitrate AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and silver sulfide Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, the latter the typical blackening of silver. Gold oxidizes to the +1 and +3 state with great difficulty.

These elements are poor (copper) to extremely-poor (gold) reducing agents and their compounds are very good oxidizing agents. Copper ions oxidize most metals:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Cu}^{2+}_{(aq)} + \hbox{Fe}_{(s)} \to \hbox{Cu}_{(s)} + \hbox{Fe}^{2+}_{(aq)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

The reaction is even stronger with either silver or gold. In effect a solution of one of these metals' salts plates most other metals.

Silver is most electrically conductive metal, followed by copper then gold.  This makes copper a favorite material for electrical wires.  Gold-tipped wires are employed in situations that need electrical precision (like high-quality audio) because gold will not tarnish (the tarnish of copper is much less conductive).

=== Zinc Family ===

The ''Zinc Family'' is '''Group 12 (IIB)''' and consists of [[w:zinc|zinc]], [[w:cadmium|cadmium]], [[w:mercury|mercury]], and [[w:copernicum|copernicum]].

Zinc, cadmium, and mercury are metals with low melting points for metals. This is because they have an especially stable electron configuration.  Mercury is so poor at forming metallic bonds that it is liquid at room temperature.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:10 Pfennig 1921.jpg|A zinc coin
Image:Cd,48.jpg|Cadmium pieces
Image:Hg Mercury.jpg|A puddle of mercury
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Zinc and cadmium are soft metals that easily oxidize to the +2 oxidation state. Neither of these two metals appears uncombined in nature. Zinc is heavily used in alloys with copper to create a harder metal known as brass; as a coating for iron (the process is called &quot;galvanizing&quot;), it oxidizes to form a protective layer of zinc oxide (ZnO) that protects the iron from oxidation, also known as rust. Zinc oxide is much safer than lead oxide and is often used in white paint. Since 1982, zinc has been the main metal used in American pennies. It is now used in new organ pipes.

Cadmium forms two substances, cadmium yellow (cadmium sulfide, CdS) and cadmium red (cadmium selenide, CdSe) that appeared in paints. These paints had strong colors that many of the great artists of the Impressionist periods cherished in their paintings. But these substances are very poisonous, and painters who used them often died young and crippled. Modern painters ordinarily use different paints that do not use these two poisonous chemicals.    

Mercury, in contrast, is a shiny liquid at room temperature and oxidizes with some difficulty. It conducts electricity well. Because it is liquid it is an unusual metal—but it is a metal. It has been used in thermometers (but not so often after it has been identified as a dangerous poison) because it expands with heat and in switches where it can flow into a closed space to close a circuit. Mercury oxidizes to the +2 state in mercuric chloride (HgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); in some strange compounds, two mercury atoms share an electron and offer their &quot;spare&quot; electrons to form substances in the +1 state, such as mercurous chloride (Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  

Zinc is an essential trace element for living things; it has some germicidal properties and is toxic (poisonous) in large quantities. Zinc pennies should never be swallowed. Cadmium, mercury, and their compounds are very dangerous poisons. Although mercury is attractive and has remarkable properties, it should be used with extreme care, and only by workers who have appropriate knowledge of its hazards.

The artificial Element 112 named copernicum in 2010 is probably part of this group in its properties, but it is extremely difficult to produce and too unstable to have a well-defined chemistry. Few atoms of this element have ever been made.

The elements of Groups 8, 9, and 10 are in two distinct groups: the common elements iron, cobalt, and nickel of the upper row of transition metals and the platinum metals of the second and third rows, and the far-scarcer platinum metals of the two lower rows of transition elements.

== Iron, cobalt, and nickel ==
 

These elements are fairly-good reducing agents -- so good that they rarely appear uncombined in nature. [[w:iron|Iron]] is by far the most common of these. One of the most common elements in the universe, it is the heaviest metal that forms in normal fusion in stars (but only the largest stars). Once a star begins to produce iron in its core, that star is doomed in short order to a violent explosion that destroys the star and scatters its matter, including all of the elements that it has formed in fusion. 

Uncombined iron, cobalt, and nickel -- but especially iron -- are to be found in meteors, solid objects that strike the earth. Iron is by far the most common of the transition elements, and one of the most useful. It's hard to count all the uses of iron, the metal most used (whether pure or in alloys) in almost all machines. Giant &quot;glass box&quot; skyscrapers depend upon iron bars within their concrete &quot;skeletons&quot; to give them strength and stability. The rails of railroads are long iron bars. Concrete highways and airstrips have iron re-enforcing bars to give them the strength to hold heavy vehicles. The vehicles themselves are largely iron and a harder material known as steel, an alloy of iron, carbon, and often metals other than iron.   

Iron is the cheapest of all structural metals. With some skill of an artisan known as a [[blacksmith]] it can be worked into many useful objects such as horseshoes, nails, plows, chains, pails, ladders, and many tools. In foundries, iron and steel are shaped in far greater quantities into such objects as furniture and parts of aircraft, ships, motor vehicles, and appliances.

Iron has one fault as a structural material: it rusts easily. In the presence of water (especially salt water) it corrodes into oxides:

Fe&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → FeO&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;
2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 3/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

and a mixed oxide known as hematite 

2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 3/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

one of the most common ores of iron. Iron oxides are mildly alkaline, so iron resists attacks by alkalis; acids attack it. For example, 

Fe &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4(l)&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/s&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;

Even a comparatively weak acid, like phosphoric acid, can attack iron oxide. This is the &quot;naval jelly&quot; reaction that removes rust from iron:

FeO&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4(l)&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + HPO&lt;sub&gt;4(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt;

A great advance of humanity, the beginning of the Iron Age, began when people found that they could separate iron from oxygen by burning it with carbon (usually charcoal) which can reduce iron oxides to iron:

Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 C&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 Fe&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 CO&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;

Much of existing economic activity depends upon the extraction of iron ore, the reduction of iron ore to iron, the strengthening of iron to steel, the creation of iron and steel objects, and the various practices used in protecting iron from corrosion. 

Important as that activity is, our lives would be impossible without an important compound of iron known as hemoglobin which carries oxygen through the bloodstream to cells where the cells can use the oxygen to release energy from food also delivered to cells through the bloodstream. 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=150px&gt;

Image:OldPlow2006-05-21.JPG|an old iron plow
Image:Redbloodcells.jpg| red blood cells contain hemoglobin
Image:Industrial lifting magnet.jpg|an electromagnet attracting scrap iron
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The earth itself has a hot, dense core of largely iron and nickel. At the temperatures characteristic of the Earth's core the iron and nickel form a giant natural magnet that creates a magnetic field that goes beyond the Earth itself into the atmosphere. That magnetic field drives off much dangerous radiation that would kill life on the Earth's surface if it reached the Earth's surface.  

Cobalt and nickel are both far scarcer than iron and not as extensively used in commerce as iron, although they have specialized uses.           


=== Platinum Family ===

The Platinum group metals are [[w:ruthenium|ruthenium]], [[w:rhodium|rhodium]], [[w:palladium|palladium]], [[w:osmium|osmium]], [[w:iridium|iridium]], and [[w:platinum|platinum]].  These elements are found in the second two rows of '''Groups 8/9/10 (IIIB)'''. 

Unlike their lighter counterparts in Groups 8, 9, and 10 of these elements are resistant to corrosion and tarnish.  They serve as '''catalysts''' for many chemical reactions, speeding up the reaction without being consumed by it.

Palladium, osmium, and the other platinum group metals absorb hydrogen when powdered.

Rhodium is used in ''catalytic converters''—metallic structures found inside vehicles.  Catalytic converters convert nitric oxides (which are toxic pollutants) into elemental nitrogen and oxygen (both of which make up breathable air):

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{NO}_x \to x \hbox{O}_2 + \hbox{N}_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

That reaction would not occur without rhodium to serve as a catalyst.

== Hydrogen ==

{{Info|Hydrogen is an element like no other.  It does not fit into any of the groups.}}

[[w:Hydrogen|Hydrogen]] is by far the most common element in the universe; as a gas it is too light for Earth's gravity to hold. It is by far the largest constituent of the Sun and all other stars and of the gas giant planets of our solar system. It exists on or just under the surface of the Earth as a component of water and in innumerable compounds of carbon, many essential to life. 

The heat and light from the sun (or any other star) arises largely from the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium.  Nuclear reactions are [[General Chemistry/Chemistries of Various Elements/Inner Transition Metals#Nuclear Chemistry|discussed later]].  Essentially, the nuclei of two atoms can combine at very high temperatures, which releases tremendous amounts of energy in the form of heat and light.

== Reactions ==

Hydrogen, although having one outermost electron, does not fit into the alkali metals or any other group. It forms compounds analogous to those of the alkali metals, but such hydrogen compounds are much less alkaline (or more acidic), much less ionic, and more volatile.  Sodium chloride, common salt, is neutral and clearly ionic; hydrogen chloride is a non-ionic gas under normal conditions and is a strong acid. The hydrogen analogue of sodium hydroxide is a volatile liquid (water, its most common compound) under normal situations—unlike the strongly alkaline and solid sodium hydroxide, water is slightly ionic and effectively neutral.

Hydrogen is a non-metal, forming a diatomic gas which results from the sharing of the single electrons of hydrogen atoms. It can achieve a stable ionic structure (no electrons!) by losing an electron or by gaining an electron and achieving the completed shell configuration of helium. The hydrogen molecule is best described as sharing the two electrons between two hydrogen atoms. This structure is highly stable and has little inclination to form bonds between other hydrogen molecules; hydrogen is a gas down to some of the lowest temperatures known. It is also the lightest of gases, weighing less even than helium.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_{2 (g)} + \hbox{F}_{2(g)} \to 2 \hbox{HF}_{(g)} + heat&lt;/math&gt;
| Hydrogen readily shares its electron with a strongly electronegative element, like any halogen, oxygen, or sulfur. The combination with fluorine is particularly violent and possible down to very low temperatures.  Light is enough to force combustion between hydrogen and chlorine, and a spark is enough to cause combustion between hydrogen and oxygen. 
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{H}_{2 (g)} + \hbox{O}_{2 (g)} \to 2 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(g)} + heat&lt;/math&gt;
| Due to the ''Hindenburg'' disaster of 1936, helium has long replaced hydrogen in lighter-than-air aircraft. The reaction responsible for that disaster was simply the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen. (Note that at the temperatures associated with such a combustion, water is in the gaseous state)

== Compounds ==

{{Info|Hydrogen forms more chemical compounds than any other element including carbon.}}
Almost all carbon compounds contain hydrogen, and vice versa, but more substances containing hydrogen (without carbon) exist than do compounds of carbon (without hydrogen).  Hydrogen forms bonds with most non-metals, including oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Although a hydrogen atom can bond with only one other element, and then only in a single bond, hydrogen allows very long chains of carbon atoms to form.  Most of the hydrogen compounds with carbon alone are combustible gases or volatile liquids or waxy solids that can be vaporized and burned to produce water, carbon dioxide, and much heat. Natural gas, gasoline (a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons), and waxes as found in candles make suitable fuels. With such other elements as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and in some cases metals, hydrogen allows the formation of substances necessary for life, including carboxylic acids, sugars, proteins, nucleic acids, haemoglobin, and chlorophyll. 

Such complex compounds are ordinarily discussed in [[Organic Chemistry]], a study associated more obviously with carbon.

== Forms ==

Hydrogen has three ''isotopes''.  All hydrogen atoms contain exactly one proton in the nucleus, but there can be zero, one, or two neutrons.  99.98% of all hydrogen atoms naturally found on Earth have no neutrons.  This is called ''protium'', or '''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H'''.  It is stable, along with ''deuterium'', or '''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H'''.  Deuterium has one neutron.  It behaves exactly like regular hydrogen, but it weighs twice as much.  Thus, &quot;heavy water&quot; is D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, where D is deuterium.  ''Tritium'', or '''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H''', has two neutrons.  It is unstable (radioactive) and decays into helium.

If hydrogen loses an electron, it becomes H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, simply a bare proton.  In an aqueous solution, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; forms hydrogen bonds with a surrounding water molecule to create ''hydronium'' H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  As the hydronium concentration of a solution increases, so does its [[General Chemistry/Properties and Theories of Acids and Bases|acidity]].

Although uncommon, hydrogen can gain an electron to become an H&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ion.

== Alkali Metals ==

[[Image:Na_(Sodium).jpg|thumb|Sodium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife.]]
The ''alkali metals'' are the elements in '''Group 1 (1A)'''.  They are [[w:Lithium|lithium]], [[w:Sodium|sodium]], [[w:Potassium|potassium]], [[w:Rubidium|rubidium]], [[w:Cesium|cesium]], and  [[w:Francium|francium]].  

These elements are best marked by their reactivity. Physically they are soft, shiny (when freshly prepared) solids with low melting points; they conduct electricity well. They all have one valence electron that they lose easily to almost any electronegative substance. Alkali metals are never found in their elemental form outside the lab because they are too reactive.  Even the smallest amount of oxygen or water would react with the metal. For this reason, alkali metals have no structural use.  They must be kept under inert liquids such as kerosene or in inert gases (nitrogen suffices for any of these elements other than lithium). 

Alkali metals have many uses in both biological life and industry.  Francium, however, is radioactive and decays rapidly to other elements, so it has no commercial use and its chemical properties are vaguely understood.

All oxidize easily to the +1 oxidation state.

{{Info|The alkali metals have very similar chemical and physical properties.  They can be studied as a whole, rather than element-by-element, due to this similarity.}}

== Safety ==

Leave experiments with alkali metals to the experienced chemists.

{{Warning|Alkali metals are dangerous.  Their reactions release enough heat to cause flames, and may produce explosive byproducts like hydrogen gas.  Never cast any alkali metal into water or acids. These metals should never be allowed to touch flesh because they react with any water upon them and yield corrosive hydroxides that damage flesh.}}

== Reactions ==
Alkali metals react violently with water, halogens, and acids.  The reactions release surprising amounts of heat and light.  In a chemical equation, alkali metals are represented with an M.  Here are some example equations:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;4 \hbox{M}_{(s)} + \hbox{O}_{2(g)} \to 2 \hbox{M}_{2}\hbox{O}_{(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Alkali metals react with oxygen to form '''oxides''', which have a duller appearance and lower reactivity.  The oxides are much less reactive than the pure metals.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{M}_2\hbox{O}_{(s)} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 2 \hbox{MOH}_{(aq)}&lt;/math&gt;
| However, the oxides do react vigorously with water to form a '''hydroxide'''.  The resulting hydroxides of these elements dissociate completely in water to form some of the strongest [[General Chemistry/Properties and Theories of Acids and Bases|bases]] known. &quot;Lye&quot; is an industrial-strength base, which is sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NaOH}_{(aq)} + \hbox{HCl}_{(aq)} \to \hbox{NaCl}_{(aq)} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;
| These hydroxides react readily with acids to form water and their corresponding alkali '''salt''' in a [[General Chemistry/Reactions of Acids and Bases#Neutralization|neutralization]] reaction.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{M}_{(s)}+ 2 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 2 \hbox{MOH}_{(aq)} + \hbox{H}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
| The pure alkali metal can also react directly with water.  In this case, the metal is a [[General Chemistry/Reactions of Acids and Bases#Anhydrides|basic '''anhydride''']].  Gaseous hydrogen is released, which is flammable.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{M}_{(s)} + \hbox{Cl}_{2(g)} \to 2 \hbox{MCl}_{(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Exposing an alkali metal to a [[General Chemistry/Chemistries of Various Elements/Group 18|halogen]] will cause an extremely exothermic reaction that results in an [[General Chemistry/Ionic bonds|ionic '''salt''']].
|}

Almost every salt of an alkali metal is highly soluble in water.  They form conducting solutions, proving their ionic nature.

=== Flame Tests ===

When burned in a flame, the alkali metals give off a unique color that can be used to identify them.

== Alkaline Earth Metals ==

[[Image:Magnesium crystals.jpg|thumb|Pure magnesium crystals]]
The ''alkaline earth metals'' are the elements in '''Group 2 (2A)'''. They are [[w:Beryllium|beryllium]], [[w:Magnesium|magnesium]], [[w:Calcium|calcium]], [[w:Strontium|strontium]], [[w:Barium|barium]], and [[w:Radium|radium]].  They are less reactive than [[General Chemistry/Chemistries of Various Elements/Group 1|alkali metals]], but they form (except for beryllium) alkaline oxides and hydroxides.

Alkaline earth metals all have two valence electrons, and they easily oxidize to the +2 state.  With increasing mass, these elements become softer, have lower melting and boiling points, and become more reactive.  None appear uncombined in nature, and all are separated from their compounds with difficulty.  Alkaline earth metals react with halogens and (except for beryllium) with water and oxygen.  Magnesium, being less reactive, reacts only at higher temperatures than the other alkaline earth metals.  Radium is radioactive, so its chemical properties are difficult to study.

{{Info|The alkaline-earth metals have very similar chemical and physical properties. They can be studied as a whole, rather than element-by-element, due to this similarity.}}

The alkaline earth metals are chemically and physically similar to the [[General Chemistry/Chemistries of Various Elements/Group 1|alkali metals]], but they are less reactive.

== Safety ==

{{Warning|Alkaline earth metals are very flammable. Their reactions could release enough heat to cause flames, and may produce explosive byproducts like hydrogen gas. Use caution when handling these metals. Calcium, strontium, and barium react with water and form corrosive hydroxides. Salts of beryllium are toxic, and water-soluble or acid-soluble salts of barium are toxic.}}

== Reactions ==
The alkaline earth metals undergo reactions similar to the alkali metals, but their +2 oxidation state causes their compounds to be different.  The following reactions use magnesium as an example, but the other alkaline earth metals undergo the same reactions as well.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;2\hbox{Mg}_{(s)} + \hbox{O}_{2(g)} \to 2\hbox{MgO}_{(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Magnesium '''oxide''' forms slowly unless ignited.  Powders or thin slices of magnesium can be ignited with a match, so magnesium is used in fire-starting devices.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;3\hbox{Mg}_{(s)} + \hbox{N}_{2(g)} \to \hbox{Mg}_3\hbox{N}_{2(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Magnesium burns readily in oxygen, and surprisingly nitrogen as well.  Air is composed mostly of nitrogen, but most elements will not react with nitrogen because nitrogen is so stable.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{MgO}_{(s)} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)} \to \hbox{Mg}(\hbox{OH})_{2(aq)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Magnesium oxide is a [[General Chemistry/Reactions of Acids and Bases#Anhydrides|basic '''anhydride''']].  Magnesium hydroxide is a [[General Chemistry/Properties and Theories of Acids and Bases|strong base]], although its [[General Chemistry/Solubility|solubility]] is too low for this property to be significant.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{Mg}_3\hbox{N}_{2(s)} + 6\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 3\hbox{Mg}(\hbox{OH}) + 2\hbox{NH}_{3(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Magnesium '''nitride''' will react with water or the moisture in air.  This reaction is detected by the pungent smell of ammonia.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{Mg}_{(s)} + 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Mg}(\hbox{OH})_{2(aq)} + \hbox{H}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt; 
| Magnesium metal reacts with water to form a '''hydroxide''', but only at high temperatures or in the presence of acid.  Calcium, being more reactive, will react with water as long as its hot.  The other elements will react in warm water.  Notice the flammable hydrogen gas that is released.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{Mg}_{(s)} + 2\hbox{HCl}_{(aq)} \to \hbox{MgCl}_{2(aq)} + \hbox{H}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Magnesium will react exothermically with acids to form an [[General Chemistry/Ionic bonds|ionic '''salt''']] and hydrogen gas.
|}

Remember that all of the alkaline earth metals can undergo these reactions; magnesium was just an example.  Beryllium, however, is much ''less'' reactive than the other metals, so it might not react.

== Uses ==

Beryllium is rare and its compounds are toxic, so it is in little use.

Magnesium metal has some use in applications needing a soft, light metal. Magnesium metal can be used an easily-burned substance with a bright light in photographic flash bulbs. Magnesium hydroxide is commonly used as a strong but generally safe antacid. Magnesium sulfate is commonly known as Epsom salts.

Even more significantly, magnesium appears in a compound known as [[chlorophyll]], the greenish pigment in plants and algae that allows plants to perform [[photosynthesis]]. It is essential to animal life.

Calcium has no use as a structural metal, but its compound calcium carbonate is a major building material as limestone. Calcium carbonate is essential to bones and to plant life. Calcium and heavier elements in this group react with warm water to form highly-alkaline hydroxides.

Strontium, much rarer than calcium, has few uses. Barium, also rarer, has few uses other than its sulfate, a coating used for lining the digestive organs for X-rays. Compounds of barium soluble in either water or acids (but not the sulfate) are highly toxic. 

Radium is rare and strongly radioactive; it is extremely dangerous due to its intense radioactivity.

'''Group 13 (IIIA)''' consists of [[w:Boron|boron]], [[w:Aluminum|aluminum]], [[w:Gallium|gallium]], [[w:Indium|indium]], and [[w:Thallium|thallium]].  Boron is a metalloid, but the other elements are metals.  All elements in this group have three valence electrons.

{{Info|Because these elements have varying properties, they will be studied element-by-element, rather than as a group.}}

== Boron ==

[[Image:Borax_crystals.jpg|thumb|A borax crystal.  Borax (a mineral containing boron) has many uses including laundry detergent.]]
[[Image:Boroxin.png|100px|thumb|''Boroxin''.  Notice boron's three bonds.]]
Boron is a '''metalloid''', exhibiting characteristics of both metals and non-metals.  It is never found in its pure form in Earth, but it is a component of some minerals.  However, pure boron can form as a result of chemical reactions.  It can be a brown amorphous solid, or a crystalline solid.  In the crystalline form, it is black and very hard.

Boron is a poor conductor of electricity at normal temperatures, but at high temperatures it does conduct electricity.  Its chemical properties are mostly, but not entirely, non-metallic.  Boron is the least electronegative non-metal, so it readily loses electrons when reacting.  Boron is almost entirely in the +3 oxidation state.  Boron has an oxide B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and it is acidic.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{BCl}_3 + 3 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{B}(\hbox{OH})_3 + 3 \hbox{HCl}&lt;/math&gt;
| Boric '''halides''' are volatile substances that attack water with the formation of boric acid B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and hydrogen halides.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{B}(\hbox{OH})_3 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{B}(\hbox{OH})_4^- + \hbox{H}^+&lt;/math&gt;
| Boric '''acid''' reacts with water to release a proton.  It is a [[General Chemistry/Properties and Theories of Acids and Bases|weak acid]].
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2\hbox{B}_2\hbox{O}_3 + 7\hbox{C} \to \hbox{B}_4\hbox{C} + 6\hbox{CO}&lt;/math&gt;
| Boric oxide, at extremely high temperatures, can react with carbon to form boron '''carbide'''.  Boron carbide is incredibly strong, finding use as tank armor.
|}

{{Info|In a manner similar to [[General Chemistry/Chemistries of Various Elements/Group 14|carbon]], boron can form stable [[General Chemistry/Intermolecular bonds|covalent network]] solids.  Each boron atom bonds to three other borons, forming a large crystal.}}

Boron has interesting properties when it bonds covalently.  It has three electrons, so it usually forms three single covalent bonds, an [[General Chemistry/Octet Rule and Exceptions|exception to the octet rule]].  Substances like boron trichloride (BCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), boric acid, and the borate ion (BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sub&gt;) are examples of boron's tendency to form three covalent bonds.

== Aluminum ==

Aluminum (British spelling aluminium) is a metal, although it is too reactive to exist in pure form.  Instead, it is found in a wide variety of minerals including ''bauxite'', the primary source for extracting aluminum.  Aluminum is the third most abundant element in Earth's crust.

[[Image:Aluminum_Metal_coinless.jpg|thumb|Aluminum metal]]

Unlike boron, aluminum is an almost [[General Chemistry/Metallic bonds|stereotypical metal]] in its physical properties:  it is malleable and ductile, and it conducts heat and electricity very well.  Because of its lightness, resistance to corrosion, attractiveness (approaching that of silver),  and inexpensiveness to process along with adequate strength for many commercial and domestic uses, it is the third-most used of all metals.  Only iron and zinc exceed it in production.

Aluminum compounds typically exist in the +3 oxidation state.  Because of its durability and light weight, aluminum is used in many '''alloys''', mixtures of metals.  Two metals, each with desirable characteristics, can be mixed together to produce an alloy that has the properties of both metals.  Aluminum used to be used for household wiring, but it expands too much when heated.  The expansion causes the wires to come loose, and house fires can start.

Aluminum seems unreactive because of a thin, hard surface of aluminum oxide Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; which does not react with water or oxygen and preserves the aluminum metal underneath it from chemical attack.  Pure aluminum will immediately form this layer when exposed to air. Although aluminum is very conductive, aluminum oxide does not conduct electricity.

| Reacting aluminum with a [[General Chemistry/Chemistries of Various Elements/Group 18|halogen]] results in an aluminum '''halide'''.

| Molten aluminum reacts violently with some metal oxides in the '''thermite reaction''', in which a substance like iron oxide is [[General Chemistry/Chemical Reactions|reduced]] to iron and aluminum is oxidized to its oxide.  This is a highly exothermic reaction, releasing enough heat to weld metal.
|}

Generally, aqueous aluminum is found as a hydroxide Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Others ==

[[Image:Gallium1_640x480.jpg|thumb|Gallium]]
Gallium is a brittle metal that melts slightly above room temperature, so holding it in your hand would liquefy it. One magic trick, the 'melting spoon' involves stirring a hot liquid (usually hot water) with a spoon specially made of gallium. The spoon melts in the water and 'disappears'. (The gallium simply sinks to the bottom of the cup; after the magic trick is done the 'magician removes the water and the molten gallium and pours the gallium into a mold that makes a new spoon for doing the trick again).     Gallium is used in many semiconductor devices and LEDs (light emitting diodes).  Gallium(III) arsenide is an important semiconductor used in many electronics.

Indium's most common isotope is radioactive and decays slowly into tin.  Indium typically has the +3 oxidation state.

Thallium tends to appear in the +1 (thallous) oxidation state as well as the +3 (thallic) oxidation state. Oddly, thallium acts much like an [[General Chemistry/Chemistries of Various Elements/Group 1|alkali metal]] in its physical and chemical properties. Thallous oxide (Tl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and the metal react violently with water to form a hydroxide TlOH that completely dissociates into Tl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  ions as if it were an alkali metal hydroxide. Its halides are quite salt-like, dissociating  into ions into solutions that, like solutions of salts of the alkali metals, conduct electricity.

{{Warning|Thallium has a violent reaction with water that could release enough heat to cause flames, and may produce explosive byproducts like hydrogen gas. Thallium hydroxide that results from this reaction is as strongly alkaline as alkali-metal hydroxides and is similarly corrosive. In addition, thallium compounds are extremely toxic.}}

Neither thallium metal nor any thallium compound is readily available in the United States because it is so dangerous and has few legitimate uses.

== The Carbon Family ==

'''Group 14 (IVA)''' consists of [[w:Carbon|carbon]], [[w:Silicon|silicon]], [[w:Germanium|germanium]], [[w:Tin|tin]], and [[w:Lead|lead]].  Carbon is a non-metal, silicon and germanium are metalloids, and tin and lead are metals.

With 4 valence shell electrons, elements of the carbon family tend to form covalent compounds.  With increasing mass and atomic radius these elements become increasingly metallic and have lower melting and boiling points.

Group 14 elements form gaseous hydrogen compounds with difficulty. These are either unstable or combustible.  All but lead form oxides, sulfides, and halides in the +4 oxidation state. The +4 oxidation state predominates in carbon, silicon, and germanium; the +2 and +4 oxidation states both appear in tin, and the +2 oxidation state prevails in lead. Halides in the +4 state form for all of these elements, and they are covalent. 

Carbon compounds are much more [[General Chemistry/Covalent bonds|covalent]] than analogous compounds of silicon, germanium, tin, or lead. Even more significantly, carbon forms double and even triple bonds with itself or other elements, forming compounds that the heavier elements of this group cannot form like acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Silicon and the heavier elements of this group can form only single bonds. 

Thus carbon dioxide CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a gas at normal temperatures because the double bonds between carbon and oxygen create single molecules, but silicon dioxide SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forms a hard rock known as quartz because it is a [[General Chemistry/Intermolecular bonds|covalent network solid]].  Each silicon atom bonds to four different oxygen atoms with single bonds, and each oxygen atom bonds with two silicon atoms.  Similar properties apply to the oxides of germanium, tin, and lead. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form carbonic acid, a weak acid that reacts with bases to form carbonates; oxides of the other elements of this group are practically nonreactive in water.

{{Info|Because of its unparalleled importance in chemistry, carbon is the main focus of our study of the Group 14 elements.}}

== Carbon ==

Carbon is a very important element.  It is abundant in the earth and atmosphere, and it is found in the substances that make all living things.  Carbon has many properties that make it different from other elements, so it deserves thorough study.

=== Allotropes ===

[[Image:Eight_Allotropes_of_Carbon.png|thumb|200px|a) diamond; b) graphite; c) lonsdaleite; d/e/f) buckyballs; g) amorphous; h) nanotubes]]

''Allotropes'' are different forms of a pure element.  Carbon has several allotropes, three of which are common.

* '''Amorphous''' carbon is coal and soot.  The carbon molecules are covalently bonded, but there is no order or arrangement.
* '''Graphite''' occurs when carbon forms flat covalent networks.  These flat &quot;sheets&quot; are not bonded to each other, making them free to slide past each other.  Graphite composes the &quot;lead&quot; in pencils.
* '''Diamond''' occurs when carbon forms a three-dimensional covalent network.  Diamonds are much different from graphite and amorphous carbon.  They are transparent, brilliant-looking, and incredibly hard.  Diamond only forms at heat and intense pressures.

There are also several rare and exotic allotropes of carbon, including:

* '''Buckeyballs''', or fullerenes, are spherical shaped balls of carbon.  Covalent bonds join the carbon atoms into a soccer ball pattern that looks much like the geodesic domes of Buckminster Fuller.   The most common buckeyball has the molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;.  Buckeyballs are large enough for a small atom to get trapped inside.
* '''Lonsdaleite''' forms upon meteorite impact with the Earth.
* Carbon '''nanotubes''' are incredibly small but rigid tubes made of carbon.  They are created in labs and are a subject of research.

Keep in mind that allotropes are composed of only one element.  In this case, these allotropes contain only carbon atoms and no other elements.

=== Inorganic Compounds ===

Although carbon is known mainly for its organic compounds, it does form many important inorganic compounds.

==== Oxides ====

''Oxides'' of carbon contain only carbon atoms and oxygen atoms.  There are two oxides that occur commonly:

* Carbon monoxide ('''CO'''): a poisonous gas released when carbon-based fuels burn in limited oxygen.
* Carbon dioxide ('''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''): found naturally in the air, but too much is considered pollution.  Animals exhale carbon dioxide, and plants absorb it.  It is slightly acidic.  Carbon dioxide, when solid, is &quot;dry ice&quot;.

There is other oxides that could form, but they are unstable or unnatural:
[[Image:Co3-geometries.png|thumb|150px|Carbon trioxide]]

* Carbon suboxide ('''C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''): Consists of double bonds, with oxygens at the ends. O = C = C = C = O.  It breaks apart into carbon dioxide and dicarbon monoxide.
* Dicarbon monoxide ('''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O'''): Very reactive.  Contains only double bonds, but the end carbon has a non-bonding pair.  [[Image:Dicarbon-monoxide-2D.svg|1000x12px]]
* Carbon trioxide ('''CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''): Exists in three different shapes, very unstable

==== Compounds Derived from Oxides ====

'''Carbonic acid''' forms when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water.  It is given by the reaction:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{CO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \leftrightarrow \hbox{H}_2\hbox{CO}_3&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Carbonic-acid-2D.svg|100px]]&lt;/center&gt;

'''Carbonate''' and '''bicarbonate''' are two ions that carbon forms.

[[Image:Carbonate-ion-localised-2D.png|100px]]  [[Image:Bicarbonate.png|100px]]

Their formulas are CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.

==== Ionic Compounds ====

Along with the oxyanions (carbonate and bicarbonate), carbon can form several other [[General Chemistry/Ionic bonds|ions]].
[[Image:Carbid.jpg|thumb|Calcium carbide CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

* Cyanide ('''CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''')
* Cyanate ('''OCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''')
* Thiocyante ('''SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''')
* Carbides ('''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;''' and '''C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sup&gt;''')

==== Alloys ====

Carbon is used in some '''alloys''', mixtures of metals.  If a small amount (between 0.2% and 2.1% by weight) of carbon is mixed into iron, the result is '''steel'''.

=== Organic Compounds ===

[[Image:Methane-2D-stereo.svg|thumb|150px|Methane]]
Compounds containing carbon (except for the above inorganic compounds) are considered '''organic'''.  They were once thought to be produced only by living things, but they have since been created in laboratories.  Most organic compounds contain hydrogen as well as carbon.

Many substances are organic compounds.  '''Polymers''' are organic compounds consisting of long chains of repeating patterns containing carbon and other atoms.  Plastics, rubbers, and nylon are all organic polymers.  '''Hydrocarbons''' are compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon, methane being a simple example.  Crude oil is a sludge of various hydrocarbons mixed together.  Propane, butane, and octane are well-known hydrocarbons used for fuel.  Perhaps the most interesting type of organic compound is the '''biomolecule'''.  Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids (fats), and nucleic acids (like DNA) are the most basic biomolecules.  They, too, are polymers (except for lipids), being made of long chains of small, repeating chemicals that have bonded together.  Biomolecules make up the chemicals found in the living cells that compose all living things.

Organic chemistry and biochemistry are very broad and thorough topics.  They are far outside the scope of General Chemistry.  Fortunately, your knowledge of General Chemistry is sufficient to begin the Wikibooks [[Organic Chemistry]] and [[Biochemistry]] if you are interested.

== Silicon ==

[[Image:Surface Mount Components.jpg|thumb|Transistor electronics exist because of silicon's semiconductor properties.]]
'''Silicon''' is found in ''semiconductors'', the basis of all electronic devices.  Its electron configuration allows it to donate or accept electrons.  When pure silicon is &quot;doped&quot; with elements that have more or fewer electrons than silicon, the slightly-impure silicon becomes a semiconductor.  These substances make up complex electronics by acting like a switch that can turn on or off depending on electrical signals.

Silicon does not exist uncombined in nature; it most commonly occurs in silica (including the very common rock quartz and most sand grains) and in silicates. Most silicates are insoluble. So-called 'magic rocks' react with dissolved sodium silicate in water reacts with the ions of some dissolved metal salts to form columns of rock-like silicates.    

Silicon dioxide, a hard substance that melts only at high temperatures, is very different in its chemical properties from carbon dioxide, a gas until it freezes into dry ice. Molten silica can be cast as glass, a hard and useful material resistant to attack by almost all chemicals except fluorine, hydrofluoric acid, and strong alkalis. Glass is extremely useful in household containers and drinking utensils because it is resistant to chemicals, heat, and the attack of micro-organisms. Glass can be very clear if pure or containing certain chemicals, or it can take on attractive colors, making it a favorite material for art objects. Some small living creatures turn dissolved silica in the sea into their shells to create structure. A great variety of silicon compounds known as [[w:silicone|silicone]]s have widespread and varied uses.

== Others ==

'''Germanium''' is another element used in semiconductors.

'''Tin''' is considered a &quot;poor metal&quot;. It has two allotropes at STP: ''grey tin'' and ''white tin''.  Grey tin has non-metallic characteristics, but white tin is metallic.  Tin is used frequently as an alloy.  &quot;Tin cans&quot; are actually steel cans with a tin plating to resist corrosion.  ''Pewter'' is an alloy of copper and tin, containing mostly tin.  ''Bronze'' is an alloy of copper and tin containing mostly copper.  ''Solder'' is an alloy of tin and lead used for its low melting point for attaching wires.

'''Lead''' is a heavy, gray metal.  It had a tremendous number of uses, but it is now known to be a neurotoxin if ingested.  Water-carrying pipes were made out of lead, but they are now made from copper or plastic because lead could contaminate the water. Lead compounds especially if soluble in water (like lead acetate used as a preservative and sweetener of wines in Roman times) or stomach acids (like the lead oxide once used in paints) or in gaseous or liquid form (like tetraethyl lead once used in gasoline), and powdered lead are very dangerous. Use of lead in foodstuffs, paint, and vehicle fuels is now illegal almost everywhere.
 
{{Warning|Lead compounds and vapors are insidious poisons that accumulate in the brain and create learning disabilities and personality disorders.}}

Lead-crystal glass has lead oxide in it but so tightly bound with silica that it can't escape easily. Pencil 'leads' are not lead at all, but instead harmless graphite (really carbon) bound with clay. Lead remains useful in automobile batteries (that contain necessary sulfuric acid much more dangerous than lead) and in nuclear use as a shield against radiation much more dangerous than lead metal.

== The Nitrogen Family == 

'''Group 15 (VA)''' contains [[w:Nitrogen|nitrogen]], [[w:Phosphorous|phosphorous]], [[w:Arsenic|arsenic]], [[w:Antimony|antimony]], and [[w:Bismuth|bismuth]].  
Elements in Group 15 have five valence electrons. Because the elements can either gain three electrons or lose five to gain a stable configuration, they more often form covalent compounds unless bonded to an active metal. Their electron affinities are not very large. Metallic properties increase markedly from gaseous nitrogen to barely-metallic bismuth with increasing size and mass. Nitrogen and phosphorus are non-metallic, and arsenic and antimony are metalloids.

Elements of this group are known as '''pnicogens''' and their compounds as '''pniconides'''. The name is derived from from the Greek word '''pnicomigs''' meaning '''suffocation'''.

{{Info|The Group 15 elements are unique enough to be studied individually, rather than as a group.}}

These elements are much less reactive than the elements of [[General Chemistry/Chemistries of Various Elements/Group 16|Group 16]], and their chemistries are more complicated. Most of the chemistry of these elements is in the +3 or +5 oxidation states, although they form gaseous compounds with hydrogen in the -3 oxidation state: ammonia NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, phosphine PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, arsine AsH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, stibine AsH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and bismuthine BiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; these all burn in oxygen to give oxides or the free element (in the case of nitrogen).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;4 \hbox{NH}_3 + 3\hbox{O}_2 \to 6 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + 2 \hbox{N}_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


All form oxides—nitrogen with difficulty, the others with ease.  Most of the oxides are acidic, exceptions being nitrous oxide N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, nitric oxide NO, and bismuth oxide Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Except for nitrogen, typical oxides are in the +3 or +5 (bismuth excluded) oxidation states. All form [[General Chemistry/Chemistries of Various Elements/Group 17|halides]]—nitrogen with difficulty, but those of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony fully hydrolyze in water.

Nitrogen and phosphorus form important acids in the +5 oxidation state. Nitrogen forms nitric acid HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a substance used to create medicines and explosives (but this acid is corrosive and dangerous, so don't touch it or even spill it on anything), and salts known as '''nitrates''' such as potassium nitrate KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, an important fertilizer. Phosphorus forms phosphoric acid, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; '''phosphates''' are salts of phosphoric acid.  Some phosphates are essential to respiration and thus life itself.

== Nitrogen ==

[[Image:Nitrogen_Cycle.jpg|thumb|The ''nitrogen cycle'' shows how nitrogen is passed along organisms and the atmosphere.]]
Nitrogen occurs naturally as the diatomic gas N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It composes about 70% of the air we breathe.  The bond holding the two nitrogen atoms together is triple covalent, so it is very strong.  Because of that, nitrogen is very unreactive.  It is used in many places when an inert gas is needed.  However, nitrogen will react with some substances:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;6 \hbox{Li}_{(s)} + \hbox{N}_{2(g)} \to 2 \hbox{Li}_3\hbox{N}_{(s)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3 \hbox{Mg}_{(s)} + \hbox{N}_{2(g)} \to \hbox{Mg}_3\hbox{N}_{2(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
|Although nitrogen gas is usually considered inert, it does react with some elements by burning.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Li}_3\hbox{N}_{(s)} + 3 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 3 \hbox{LiOH}_{(aq)} + \hbox{NH}_{3(g)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Mg}_3\hbox{N}_{2(s)} + 6 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to 3 \hbox{Mg}(\hbox{OH})_{2(aq)} + 2 \hbox{NH}_{3(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
|The '''nitrides''' react violently with water to form ammonia gas and a [[General Chemistry/Properties and Theories of Acids and Bases|basic]] solution.
|}

In its pure form, nitrogen is not very useful.  It is much more important when it is a component of ammonia, nitrate, oxides, or biomolecules like protein.  Due it is very unreactive nature, it is difficult to get nitrogen to react and form these useful substances.  Any process that can convert elemental nitrogen into a nitrogen compound is called '''nitrogen fixation'''.  Nitrogen fixation is biologically important because amino acids, proteins, and enzymes contain nitrogen.  It is commercially important because it is used in explosives, rocket fuels, and fertilizers.  

There are many nitrogen fixation reactions:
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_2 + 8 \hbox{H}^+ + 8 \hbox{e}^- + energy \to 2 \hbox{NH}_3 + \hbox{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;
| This occurs in bacterial enzymes.  The ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) quickly becomes ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  The nitrogen in the bacteria enters the soil where plants can absorb it.  Humans and animals that eat those plants can get the nitrogen.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_2 + 3 \hbox{H}_2 \leftrightarrow 2 \hbox{NH}_3&lt;/math&gt;
|The '''Haber process''' is used for commercially producing ammonia.  This reaction only occurs at very high pressures and temperatures (around 20 MPa and 500 °C) and in the presence of an iron catalyst.  Also, the reaction occurs in somewhat complex equipment that must input pure reactants and extract the ammonia.
|}

Keep in mind that ammonia is a gas at STP.  The household product called &quot;ammonia&quot; is actually an [[General Chemistry/Aqueous Solutions|aqueous solution]] of ammonium hydroxide (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH) that forms when ammonia gas is dissolved in water.  Ammonia, quite unlike hydrogen compounds of Groups 16 and 17, is a base in its reactions, forming salts with weak and strong acids alike. Such a substance as ammonium chloride (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl) is a soluble, strongly ionic salt.

Nitrogen compounds are often extremely unstable because nitrogen atoms in nitrogen compounds tend to seek each other to recombine as nitrogen gas.  Many nitrogen compounds are literal explosives, including TNT and nitroglycerin. These explosives are in common use in construction projects for the demolition of buildings and other obstacles to new construction, or to get access to minerals in mining operations. 

{{Warning|Handling of any explosive or making them is appropriately left to experts.}}

== Phosphorus ==

[[Image:White_phosphrous_molecule.jpg|thumb|90px|left|White phosphorus atomic structure]]
Phosphorus has two common allotropes: red phosphorus and white phosphorus.  White phosphorus (P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) has a waxy appearance and turns yellow when exposed to light.  When exposed to oxygen in the dark, it glows pale green. 



{{Warning|White phosphorus is extremely dangerous. It causes severe burns and is very toxic. It ignites with a very hot flame and can be explosive. Leave all experiments with white phosphorus to experienced chemists}}.

White phosphorus ignites under all but the most delicate conditions.  The combustion of white phosphorus produces phosphorus(V) oxide:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{P}_4 + 5 \hbox{O}_2 \to \hbox{P}_4\hbox{O}_{10}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

One of its most common uses is in military weapons that cause severe burning of the object hit by the weapon. 


Red phosphorus is an amorphous solid.  It is more stable and explodes at temperatures higher than those of white phosphorus.  It is still, however, dangerously reactive.  Both forms of phosphorus are insoluble in water and can be interconverted with various applications of heat, pressure, and light.

There also exist black phosphorus and violet phosphorus.  Unlike nitrogen, phosphorus will not readily form a diatomic molecule with a triple bond.  Diphosphorus does exist, but only between a temperature range of 1200 °C and 2000 °C.

Phosphorus is essential to life in the form of phosphates in bones and in substances known as ADP and ATP that transform food into useful energy in cells.

== Others ==
[[Image:Bismuth-crystal.jpg|thumb|A crystal of bismuth, showing its colorful ''iridescent'' tarnish.]]

Arsenic is similar to phosphorus.  It has three allotropes: grey arsenic, yellow arsenic, and black arsenic.  Grey arsenic is the most common form.  Its structure is similar to graphite.

Antimony has the physical properties of a metal, but behaves chemically as a non-metal.

{{Warning|Arsenic and antimony, as well as practically all of their compounds, are dangerous poisons.}}

Bismuth is a brittle, silvery metal. Bismuth ''is'' actually radioactive, decaying into thallium-205.  Because its ''half-life'' is 19 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; years, about a million times the age of the universe, bismuth is usually considered stable.

Bismuth is much less radioactive than the nearly-harmless and unavoidable radioactive isotopes of carbon and potassium in living things.  Unlike arsenic and antimony, its compounds aren't toxic unless something else in the compound is itself toxic or the substance is very acidic or alkaline. In fact, a bismuth compound is very common in a heavily-used stomach medication that requires no prescription.

== The Oxygen Family ==

'''Group 16 (VIA)''' is made of [[w:Oxygen|oxygen]], [[w:Sulfur|sulphur]], [[w:Selenium|selenium]], [[w:Tellurium|tellurium]], and [[w:Polonium|polonium]].  Oxygen, sulphur, and selenium are non-metals.  Tellurium is a metalloid and polonium is a metal.

Group 16 elements have 6 valence electrons, meaning that they require two more electrons to complete a stable electron octet. They still have relatively large electron affinities and are rather reactive, forming ions with a -2 charge. All form volatile compounds with hydrogen: water H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, hydrogen sulphide H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, hydrogen selenide H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, hydrogen telluride H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te, and polonium hydride PoH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Electronegativity decreases in this group with increasing atomic mass, and oxygen is more electronegative than any element except fluorine; it acts much like a halogen except for its -2 oxidation state. Fluorine and oxygen oxidize these elements (except oxygen) to the +6 oxidation state, resulting in such substances (for sulfur) as sulfur hexafluoride SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and sulfur trioxide SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and its derivative sulfuric acid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, one of the most heavily-used industrial chemicals. (Note that use of sulfuric acid requires extreme care because it causes chemical burns upon flesh, cloth, and paper).  Typically, these elements will attain an oxidation state of -2.

Oxides of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium are acidic. Strong radioactivity largely masks the chemical properties of polonium.

{{Info|The elements of Group 16 have somewhat varied properties; however, our study of these elements will focus on oxygen because of its abundance and significance.}}

== Oxygen ==

Oxygen is a diatomic gas that makes up about 20% of the air we breath.  It is essential for the life of animals, and plants release it.  Plants absorb sunlight and produce ''glucose'' (sugar) and oxygen.  Cells of plants and animals alike &quot;burn&quot; glucose with oxygen to gain energy.

| &lt;math&gt;6 \hbox{CO}_2 + 6 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + sunlight \to \hbox{C}_6\hbox{H}_{12}\hbox{O}_6 + 6 \hbox{O}_2&lt;/math&gt;
| '''Photosynthesis''' is actually a series of complex chemical reactions, involving several substances found in the chloroplasts of plants.  This is the overall reaction.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{C}_6\hbox{H}_{12}\hbox{O}_6 + 6 \hbox{O}_2 \to 6\hbox{CO}_2 + 6 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + 2880~kJ/mol&lt;/math&gt;
| Cellular '''respiration''' is the reverse process: converting glucose into energy.
|}

Oxygen has a few allotropes, but only two are common: dioxygen and ozone.  Dioxygen is the regular form of oxygen, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, held together with a double covalent bond.  Ozone, O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is found naturally in the upper atmosphere and can form when normal oxygen is exposed to high voltage.

=== Ozone ===

Ozone is not very stable.  It will decompose: 2 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Ozone is a very powerful [[General Chemistry/Redox Reactions/Oxidation and Reduction equations|oxidizing agent]].  Metals and non-metals are both susceptible to oxidation when exposed to ozone.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{C} + 2 \hbox{O}_3 \to \hbox{CO}_2 + 2 \hbox{O}_2&lt;/math&gt;
| Carbon is oxidized by ozone.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NO} + \hbox{O}_3 \to \hbox{NO}_2 + \hbox{O}_2&lt;/math&gt; 
| Nitric oxide becomes nitrogen dioxide.
|}

Although considered a pollutant when at ground level (it is toxic), ozone is a very important chemical found in the upper atmosphere.  The Sun emits dangerous ultraviolet light that would damage living cells, but ozone absorbs the light energy and converts it safely into heat energy:
[[Image:Ozone cycle.jpg|thumb|The ozone cycle]]

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{O}_3 + radiation \to \hbox{O}_2 + \hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| High-powered radiation from the sun splits ozone molecules.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{O}_2 + \hbox{O} \to \hbox{O}_3 + energy&lt;/math&gt;
| Atomic oxygen can reattach itself to dioxygen to recreate ozone.
|}

You can see that the net result of the above reactions is a system of ozone that converts dangerous radiation into heat energy.

Atomic oxygen is extremely unstable and will attach itself to form O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; immediately:
* &lt;math&gt;\hbox{O}_3 + \hbox{O} \to 2 \hbox{O}_2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\hbox{O} + \hbox{O} \to \hbox{O}_2&lt;/math&gt;

The amount of ozone in the atmosphere is small, but solar radiation will split O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into two O atoms, so there is a small but steady supply of ozone.  Unfortunately, many man-made products called ''chlorofluorocarbons'' (CFCs) have entered the upper atmosphere over the years.  The chemicals release chlorine radicals that act as catalysts for an ozone-destroying reaction.  As a result, the amount of ozone in the atmosphere has decreased, which could lead to an increase in dangerous solar radiation.

| A chlorine '''radical''' forms from a CFC.  ''Radicals'' have a single non-bonding electron (instead of the usual pair), so they are extremely reactive.  A chlorine radical is simply a single atom of chlorine (which has seven electrons).

|}

As you can see, chlorine radicals convert ozone into regular oxygen without being used up.  Over the years, products have been created that replace CFCs and cause less environmental damage.

=== Oxides ===

Any chemical compound consisting of oxygen and some other element covalently bonded is an '''oxide'''.  Metals form oxides easily, except for a few including gold, platinum, and mercury.  Besides being called [[General Chemistry/Redox Reactions/Oxidation and Reduction equations|''oxidation'']], the process is also called ''tarnishing'' or ''rusting''.  In other words, an iron nail that turns to rust has formed iron oxide.  The dull, dirty-looking film that coats otherwise shiny copper is copper oxide.  Oxides form because oxygen is so electronegative.  When substances burn (including hydrocarbons and metals), they oxidize and release large amounts of heat quickly.

The oxide ion is O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;.  There is also peroxide O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; and superoxide O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Sulfur ==

[[Image:Cyclooctasulfur-above-3D-balls.png|thumb|S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]
Sulfur behaves similarly to oxygen, but it has over 30 allotropes.  The most common is S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.  Sulfur is a solid at STP.  It is yellow and is actually odorless.  The distinct odor of sulfur is actually H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, hydrogen sulfide.  Sulfur is a part of many organic and inorganic compounds. Sulfur is part of some proteins necessary for life. 

Chemical names beginning with &quot;thio&quot;- mean an oxygen atom has been replaced with a sulfur atom.  For example, cyanate is OCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas thiocyanate is SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Others ==

Selenium conducts electricity better in the light than in the dark, so it is found in photocells, electrical components that detect light.

Tellurium is extremely rare and very poisonous.

Polonium is dangerously radioactive and very rare. It is usually associated with uranium ore as a product of radioactive decay of uranium.

== Halogens ==

The ''halogens'' are found in '''Group 17(VIIA)'''. The halogens are [[w:Fluorine|fluorine]], [[w:Chlorine|chlorine]], [[w:Bromine|bromine]], [[w:Iodine|iodine]], and [[w:Astatine|astatine]].

Like the [[General Chemistry/Chemistries of Various Elements/Group 1|alkali metals]], the halogens are extremely reactive.  They have seven valence electrons, meaning they require only one more electron for a noble configuration.  This gives them very large electron affinities and extreme reactivity to form ions with a -1 charge. They are so reactive that in their homogeneous state, UV light will catalyze a radical reaction. 

The halogens exist in '''diatomic''' form.  Under normal conditions, they will always occur in pairs, covalently bonded.  The covalent bond allows them to share an electron and possess a complete octet.  F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a pale yellowish-brown gas.  It is highly reactive, causing organic compounds and hydrogen gas to explode, even without a spark.  Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a pale yellow-green gas.  It reacts with water to form disinfectants and bleaches.  Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a reddish-brown liquid, but, being '''volatile''', it readily evaporates into a reddish vapor.  I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a gray solid that forms a violet gas if heated.

Fluorine is the most [[General Chemistry/Electronegativity|electronegative]] of all elements, and it is so reactive that it attacks almost any other element (noble gases, oxygen, nitrogen, and gold are the exceptions) to form fluorides. Chlorine is somewhat less reactive, bromine somewhat less reactive than chlorine, and iodine even less, but even iodine is a formidable ionizer. Extreme radioactivity masks the chemical properties of astatine. With increasing atomic weight for these elements, the elements have higher boiling and melting points. At normal temperatures, fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid.

{{Info|The halogens have very similar chemical properties. They can be studied as a whole, rather than element-by-element, due to this similarity.}}

== Safety ==

{{Warning|All of these pure elements are dangerous and should never be touched. Fluorine is extremely dangerous in that it corrodes almost anything—even glass. Breathing the vapors of these elements, even in minute amounts, can cause death.

Soluble fluorides are highly toxic to living things and hazardous to the environment.

|}

== Other Compounds ==

Halides of metals are known as '''salts'''. Sodium chloride, better known as &quot;table salt&quot;, is the crystalline substance often used to enhance the flavor of food.  Note, however, that not all salts are halides (for example, sodium sulfate Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and not all halides are salts (carbon tetrachloride, CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

'''Interhalogens''' are molecules composed of two or more different halogen atoms.  They are similar to the diatomic halogens.  Some examples are chlorine monofluoride ClF and bromine monochloride BrCl.  There are many others, and they are all very reactive and somewhat unstable.  Interhalogens take the form XY&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, where n is 1, 3, 5, or 7.  X and Y are both halogens, X being the less electronegative.

'''Noble gas compounds''' have been formed using fluorine.  Although noble gases are supposedly inert, the larger ones like xenon will form covalent bonds with a very electronegative element like fluorine.  Xenon difluoride XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, xenon tetrafluoride XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and xenon hexafluoride XeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; are among the noble gas compounds that have been created.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Chemistries of Various Elements/Group 17|next=Chemistries of Various Elements/Hydrogen}}

== Noble Gases ==

The ''noble gases'' are in '''Group 18 (8A)'''.  They are [[w:Helium|helium]], [[W:Neon|neon]], [[w:Argon|argon]], [[w:Krypton|krypton]], [[w:Xenon|xenon]], and [[w:Radon|radon]].  They were once called ''inert gases'' because they were thought to be completely '''inert'''—unable to form compounds.  This is a reasonable belief because the noble gases have a complete [[General Chemistry/Octet Rule and Exceptions|octet]], making them very stable and unlikely to gain or lose any electrons.  However, some compounds have been formed with the larger elements of this group, like xenon tetrafluoride (XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). No normal compounds of helium, neon, or argon are stable at any but the coldest of temperatures.  

Radon is dangerously radioactive; it causes cancer. It is so unstable that its radioactivity makes any chemical experiments with it nearly impossible.  

{{Info|Noble gases all have a complete octet (eight valence electrons), except for helium (which has only two electrons).  Because this configuration is extremely stable as well as symmetrical, the noble gases are very unreactive.}}

== Ionization ==

If an electric current is passed through a gas, its electrons will become excited.  The electron will jump to a higher energy level, but then it falls back down to a stable state and releases the energy that it had absorbed.  The energy is released in the form of a ''photon'', or particle of light.  In other words, gases can be used to convert electricity into light—the concept of &quot;neon signs&quot;.  Neon signs are not necessarily filled with neon.  They are filled with any mixture of gases to get the desired color.  Each gas has a unique color that it emits.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery caption=&quot;Colors of different noble gases when used in &amp;quot;neon&amp;quot; signs&quot; perrow=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
Image:HeTube.jpg|Helium (pink)
Image:NeTube.jpg|Neon (red-orange)
Image:ArTube.jpg|Argon (blue)
Image:KrTube.jpg|Krypton (pale green)
Image:XeTube.jpg|Xenon (pale blue)
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Of course, other gases can be used besides the noble gases.

== Helium ==

[[Image:Helium-II-creep.svg|thumb|120px|Helium will not freeze.  Instead, it becomes a superfluid.]]

Helium is a unique noble gas.  It is the second most abundant element in the universe.  Lighter than air, it is used in blimps because it will allow them to float without the risk of an explosion.  Neon is the only element less reactive than helium.

Helium will not freeze under normal pressure.  There cannot be enough [[General Chemistry/Intermolecular bonds|intermolecular force]] to lock the atoms into a solid.  It remains a gas until 4 K, then becomes a liquid.  With the right conditions, helium becomes a ''superfluid''.  It is a liquid that will creep along the edges of its container with zero viscosity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== setjmp ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;csetjmp&gt;
int setjmp( jmp_buf env );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function setjmp() stores the current execution status in ''env'', and returns 0.  The execution state includes basic information about which code is being executed in preparation for the longjmp() function call.  If and when longjmp is called, setjmp() will return the parameter provided by longjmp - however, on the second return, variables that were modified after the initial setjmp() call may have an undefined value.  

The buffer is only valid until the calling function returns, even if it is declared statically. 

Since setjmp() does not understand constructors or destructors, it has been superseded with the C++ exception system, which uses the ''throw'' and ''catch'' keywords.  

{{NOTE|setjmp does not appear to be within the '''''std namespace'''''.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Chemistries of Various Elements/Transition Metals|next=Chemistries of Various Elements/Synthetic Elements}}

== Inner Transition Metals ==

The inner transition metals are found in the '''f-block''', usually put at the bottom of the [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table|Periodic Table]].  These elements were sometimes called ''rare earth metals'' due to their extremely low natural occurrence. Except for extremely-unstable promethium which quickly decays to another lanthanoid metal, these elements are not rare. Indeed cerium is abundant in Earth's crust.)  Many of them do not occur naturally, but are instead created in labs artificially.  Furthermore, these elements all have nearly identical properties, both chemically and physically, making them very difficult to identify and separate.  They are almost as reactive as the alkali metals, and all actinoids are radioactive, so they have little commercial significance.  However, the radioactive elements can be used in nuclear power plants or as weapons.

Most of the inner transition metals form ions with a +3 charge.  Some of the lighter actinoids can use their f-electrons for bonding, giving them a wider range of oxidation states, but the rest do not use f-electrons and have only a +3 oxidation state.  Cerium is a notable exception: it has a somewhat common +4 oxidation state, seen in curium(IV) oxide CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

These elements tarnish quickly in oxygen.  Some will ignite in oxygen.  They react with water to release hydrogen:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{M} + 3 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{M}_2\hbox{O}_3 + 3 \hbox{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Lanthanoids ===

Lanthanoids burn in oxygen easily and react violently with non-metals.  They are used in lasers and sometimes steels depending on the element.

Neodymium magnets (Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B) are the strongest known permanent magnets.  Gadolinium exhibits ''ferromagnetism'' below room temperature.

The terbium(III) cation is very ''fluorescent''—it glows in the dark.

'''Lanthanoid contraction''' is a phenomenon that causes the lanthanoids (and all elements after them) to have much smaller atomic radii than expected.  The f-electrons do not shield the nuclear charge as much as expected, so the outermost electrons are attracted to the nucleus more.

=== Actinoids ===
Only thorium and uranium occur naturally in Earth's crust (along with neptunium and plutonium in trace amounts).

The actinoids are radioactive and decay into more stable elements.  The actinoids that do not occur naturally have been created in labs for experiments and research.

== Nuclear Chemistry ==
[[Image:Nuclear_fission.svg|thumb|A nuclear reaction]]
Throughout your study of General Chemistry, you have undoubtedly heard of &quot;radioactive elements&quot; and &quot;unstable isotopes&quot;.  These elements are the study of '''nuclear chemistry'''.  Normal chemical reactions occur between atoms and electrons.  Atoms gain, lose, and share electrons to form different substances.  Chemical reactions are essentially interactions of electrons.  ''Nuclear reactions'', on the other hand, occur within the nucleus of an atom.  They involve the gaining, losing, and transformation of protons, neutrons, and sometimes other particles (electrons and photons).  Nuclear chemistry is something that you can study only within your textbook—radioactive substances are deadly to living things, can cause explosions, and are difficult to procure.

You should already know what '''isotopes''' are:  elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons (and a different total mass).  Some isotopes are ''stable'' and do not decay.  They last indefinitely.  Other isotopes are ''unstable'', meaning that they are radioactive.  They will undergo nuclear reactions to become a more stable isotope.  Some elements are always unstable, regardless of how many neutrons, so all of their isotopes are unstable.

For example, carbon-12 (6 protons, 6 neutrons) is stable.  Carbon-14 (6 protons, 8 neutrons) is unstable and decays into nitrogen-14.  This is unusual from a chemical point of view—there is no way for an atom to change into a different element.  This is nuclear chemistry, though, and elements ''do'' change frequently in their quest to become more stable.

=== Stability ===

There is no formula or exact rule to determine which isotopes are stable and which are unstable.  That must be determined experimentally.  Patterns have emerged throughout the study of the elements, and there are some general guidelines you can use to guess if an isotope will be stable or radioactive:

* Lighter elements are stable when they have roughly equal numbers of protons and neutrons.
* Heavier elements are stable when they have more neutrons than protons in about a 3:2 ratio.
* Elements that have a &quot;magic number&quot; of protons or neutrons are especially stable: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126.

In regard to the magic numbers, notice how helium-4 (2 p, 2 n) is the most abundant isotope in the universe.  Lead-208 is the heaviest stable isotope known (82 p, 126 n).  The air we breathe is filled with oxygen-16 (8 p, 8 n).  The stability of these isotopes is no coincidence.


=== Fusion and Fission ===

[[Image:FusionintheSun.svg|thumb|left|The fusion reaction that powers the Sun]]
'''Fusion''' reactions take two small nuclei and &quot;fuses&quot; them together into one large nucleus.  '''Fission''' reactions split a large nucleus into smaller nuclei.  Fission releases tremendous amounts of energy, which is why fission reactions are used in both nuclear power plants (to provide electricity to an entire city) and nuclear bombs (to destroy an entire city).  Fusion reactions release even greater amounts of energy, but they only occur at unfathomably high temperatures.  Fusion reactions occur in stars in outer space.  Our sun is basically one giant fusion reactor.  Hydrogen nuclei fuse together into helium nuclei, releasing the light and heat that warms our planet.  Here are some example nuclear reactions:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;^2_1\hbox{H} + ^6_3\hbox{Li} \to 2 ^4_2\hbox{He}&lt;/math&gt;
| Fusion
|-
|&lt;math&gt;^{235}_{92}\hbox{U} + ^1_0n \to ^{141}_{52}\hbox{Te} + ^{91}_{40}\hbox{Zr} + 3 ^1_0n&lt;/math&gt;
| Fission
|}

Notice that the Law of Conservation of Matter is bent but not broken.  If you add up the mass numbers, they will be equal on both sides of the reaction.  The total charge numbers will also be equal.

=== Decay Modes ===

An unstable isotope will decay to become more stable.  There are many decay modes, but a few are common:

{{TextBox|1=
; Common Decay Modes
* '''Alpha decay''' releases an alpha particle (helium-4, 2 p + 2 n).  Occurs when the isotope is too big to be stable.
* '''Beta&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay''' converts a neutron into a proton, releasing a beta particle (electron).  Occurs when there are too many neutrons to be stable.
* '''Beta&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt; decay''' converts a proton into a neutron, releasing a beta particle (positron).  Occurs when there are too many protons to be stable.
* '''Gamma decay''' releases a gamma particle (photon).  Occurs when the nucleus has too much energy.
* '''Electron capture''' converts a proton into a neutron by absorbing an electron.  Occurs when there are too many protons to be stable.
}}

As far as health concerns, alpha particles are the most dangerous.  They can be inhaled, causing bodily damage.  They are heavy and have a double positive charge, but they are easily stopped by a piece of paper or skin.  Beta particles are simply electrons (or positrons, an antielectron).  They are somewhat dangerous, and they are stopped by a piece of wood or aluminum foil.  Gamma rays are only stopped by thick slabs of lead.  They are essentially x-rays that have extreme amounts of energy.  Although they have the most energy, they only cause damage to things directly exposed to a radioactive substance.  The other particles are worse because they can travel through the atmosphere.

A particular isotope always uses the same decay mode.  These reactions will summarize the decay modes (notice the law of conservation):

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;^{238}_{92}\hbox{U} \to ^{234}_{90}\hbox{Th} + ^4_2\hbox{He}^{2+}&lt;/math&gt;
| Alpha decay
|-
| &lt;math&gt;^{238}_{92}\hbox{U} \to ^{234}_{90}\hbox{Th} + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;^{137}_{55}\hbox{Cs} \to ^{137}_{56}\hbox{Ba} + ^0_{-1}e^-&lt;/math&gt;
| Beta&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt; decay
|-
| &lt;math&gt;^{22}_{11}\hbox{Na} \to ^{22}_{10}\hbox{Ne} + ^0_{1}e^+&lt;/math&gt;
| Beta&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay
|}

== Short-lived  natural elements and synthetic elements ==

91 elements of the known 118 elements occur naturally on Earth.  The other seventeen -- all elements beyond plutonium on the Periodic table, and three others -- technetium (43 electrons), promethium (61), and neptunium (93) -- are too unstable to exist on Earth and  are not among the rare elements that are parts of the nuclear decay process of either thorium or uranium. The elements that do not occur naturally are '''synthetic'''.  Synthetic elements are elements that have been created in a laboratory by artificial means. Synthetic elements are very unstable and have few commercial purposes.  They decay into other elements in a fraction of a second.  Most are created purely for research and experiment.

Synthetic elements are created in ''particle accelerators''.  Two smaller elements are accelerated to incredible speeds and collided into each other.  Their nuclei merge together into a larger element.  The element is studied by lab equipment before it decays.

Seven of the 91 naturally-occurring elements (polonium, astatine, radon, francium, radium, actinium, and protactinium) exist only in the presence of naturally-occurring radioactive elements uranium and thorium. These comprise all elements with atomic numbers 84 through 91 except for thorium (90). All isotopes of these elements are very short-lived, and those of them in use are used only for their radioactive properties (most notably in radium, and then as a desperate therapy for some cancers).  Because of their short half-lives and the hazards associated with their radioactivity the chemistries of these elements are often extremely difficult to study.   


=== Naming ===

Most synthetic elements have been named by the IUPAC, the international authority for naming chemicals.  They are named after famous scientists or places where the element was formed.  For example, einsteinium (Es, 99) and americium (Am, 95).  Some elements are too new to have official names.  Before it can be named, an element must be discovered and proven to exist by a scientist or team.  Then, the element's discoverer(s) will be allowed to choose a name.  Until the element has a name, it is given a ''provisional name''.  Provisional names are made of a chain of words, each representing a digit in the element's atomic number.  For example, [[ununseptium]] is element 117 , [[unnilpentium]] was element 105 (since renamed as dubnium), and unbioctium would be element element 128 (not believed to exist).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== longjmp ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;csetjmp&gt;
void longjmp( jmp_buf env, int val );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function longjmp() behaves as a cross-function {{C++ Programming/kw|goto}} statement: it moves the point of execution to the record found in env, and causes setjmp() to return ''val''.   Using longjmp() may have some side effects with variables in the setjmp() calling function that were modified after the initial return. 

longjmp() does not call destructors of any created objects.  As such, it has been superseded with the C++ exception system, which uses the ''throw'' and ''catch'' keywords.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Refrigeration Recommendation: Summary==
'''Summary'''
Install an economizer in a simple refrigeration cycle to increase the cycle efficiency by increasing the refrigeration effect at a given suction temperature. Economizers only apply to screw compressors with an unused secondary suction port.

'''When to Apply:'''
When a secondary section port is available on screw compressor and suction temperature is &lt;-15 degrees F.

'''Key Engineering Concepts:'''

* Refrigeration system is determined by the mass flow rate of the refrigerant and the refrigeration effect at a given suction temperature.
* The refrigeration effect is the enthalpy change between the expansion device exit and the compressor inlet (suction).
* During the isenthalpic expansion process, refrigerant evaporates to cool the liquid-gas mixture to the saturation temperature at lower pressure. The remaining vaporization is the refrigeration effect.
* An economizer vessel at an intermediate pressure is used to separate the saturated liquid and gas after the refrigerant is partially expanded to lower temperature.
* Less refrigerant mass flows through the evaporator for the same load or system capacity is higher at full flow.

'''Preparation:'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== signal ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;csignal&gt;
void (*signal( int sig, void (*handler)(int)) )(int)
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The signal() function takes two parameters - the first is the signal identifier, and the second is a function pointer to a signal handler that takes one parameter.  The return value of signal is a function pointer to the previous handler (or SIG_ERR if there was an error changing the signal handler).

By default, most raised signals are handled either by the handlers SIG_DFL (which is the default signal handler that usually shuts down the program), or SIG_IGN (which ignores the signal and continues program execution.) 

When you specify a custom handler and the signal is raised, the signal handler reverts to the default.  

While the signal handlers are superseded by ''throw'' and ''catch'', some systems may still require you to use these functions to handle some important events.  For example, the signal SIGTERM on Unix-based systems indicates that the program should terminate soon.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;csignal&gt;
int raise(int)
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The raise() function raises a signal specified by its parameter. 

If unsuccessful, it returns a non-zero value.

== Deletion nomination ==

Hi Sskiles22,

I noticed your [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A-level_Chemistry%2FAQA%2FModule_4%2FAmino_Acids&amp;diff=1407658&amp;oldid=1395552 nomination for speedy deletion]. You mentioned that the page was redundant with an &quot;amino acid&quot; page ... which happens to be the name of the page you nominated. I couldn't find what this was redundant with and the page didn't seem to be a course assignment like you stated. Could you clarify that, please?

Happy editin, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:26, 14 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Big hole at the top==
At the end I have a big hole at the top of the parachute. Could someone explain that please?

:I've fixed the steps, it should work correctly now, follow the pictures [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 00:59, 29 July 2010 (UTC)

==Start off with a UVsphere==
Why does the tutorial provide such a complicated way of making the parachute? All you really need to do is delete the default cube, add a UVsphere, delete half of it, extrude four opposite edges downward and merge at center. Takes around 20 times less time and provides a much nicer looking parachute imo.''


why working from a cylinder??  Just make a UV sphere (in the right orientation - &quot;poles&quot; alligned on Z axis).  Then, looking on side orthographic view, use the box selection method (Key B) to select all the vertices &quot;south of the Equator&quot;, then delete vertices (X -&gt; Vertices).  The ropes can be made as described above.
'''Another noob:''' That would work, although note you'll not have as much control over the chute's shape that way; in fact, it'll produce a rather different shape that way.



==Start with a cylinder==
An alternative method to make a parachute. Start with a cylinder (''basic settings''), delete the center vertex on the bottom. Press '''B-KEY''' and select the bottom vertices, then press '''SKEY''' and scale to a value of 2. Extrude down to a value of 1. Subsurf the result and that will give you your basic shape.&lt;br&gt;
Next, select the four corner vertices and extrude down as stated in the tutorial. Select all of the edges created by the extrusion and press SHIFT + EKEY to edge crease using a value of 1. You now have a completed parachute (that happens to look identical to the tutorial).}}


==Start with a circle==
Instead of a cylinder you might want to add simply a circle, and jump directly to the next step.


==Solid on the bottom and not concave==
I followed the instructions and the resulting parachute is solid on the bottom and not concave as it should be (am I the only one with this result?). Anyway, I fixed it by going to the bottom view (Ctrl, NUM7) and deleting the vertex in the middle of the bottom view. Now it is nice and concave!


==Touch of finesse==
At the first circle (or cropped cylinder) I subdivided every other edge and moved those vertices inward on the XY plane (grab and then SHIFT-Z). these add some crinks to the parachute. In addition you can make a nice fabric texture with wrinkles, at your own discretion. --&gt;Dagonite

== Nothing new ==

There does not seem to be anything new in this tutorial that was not covered in previous ones. Not sure why it is here.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Proof for irrationality far too advanced ==
This is supposed to be an elementary school text, but this proof employs algebraic manipulation very casually. This should be removed or rewritten. [[User:Papna|Papna]] ([[User talk:Papna|talk]]) 02:22, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
:I was thinking the same thing. Another question: How does this even relate to geometry? It appears to be mostly redundant to [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Mathematical Proofs#.E2.88.9A2 is irrational]], so maybe this page could be deleted. [[User:Belteshazzar|Belteshazzar]] ([[User talk:Belteshazzar|talk]]) 20:17, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

::It is also at [[Famous_Theorems_of_Mathematics/√2_is_irrational]], but I don't see this a redundancy.  Different books should be encouraged to cover material as appropriate even if it was covered elsewhere.  The number of modules here that introduce the concept of a set is also quite high.  Believe it or not I did follow [[User:Papna|Papna]]'s suggestion and rewrote the article somewhat (compare the current article to how it looked [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Geometry_for_Elementary_School/A_proof_of_irrationality&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=1471404 when Papna made the above comment] .   I tried to make this proof more accessible by recasting it terms of even and odd numbers instead of using words like &quot;coprime&quot; and trying to make clear exactly which  number divides both the numerator and denominator.  As far as appropriateness of the subject goes, I can only say that I have taught the same subject to sixth graders with some success, but whether or not sixth grade is stilled considered elementary school varies by district.  But I am sure the other active editors agree with you.  If the consensus is to delete it I will not take it too personally. 

::As far as geometry goes there is some this was historically a rather important result.  In fact it was so startling geometrically (to the ancient greeks) that the drowned the person who discovered this.  Remember, in Greek times they only used a ruler and compasses.  The greeks believed that '''every''' pair of line segments were [[w:Commensurability_(mathematics)|commensurable]].  Meaning you could choose a very little line segment and measure any two line segments by a whole number of these little line segments. 

::Or if you prefer you could choose a new unit of length so that those two particular line segments would both have lengths that are whole numbers.  You might need to choose a new system of measurement for every pair of segments, for any fixed two line segments you could find some unit of measure giving them both whole number lengths.  This idea still seems to appeal to many peoples geometric intuition, and this theorem shows it is false.  Specifically the right triangle whose side lengths were (1,1,√2) has the property that there is no unit unit of measure that makes its hypotenuse and one of its legs have whole number length.  For the greeks this would have been a very real counterexample to their intuition. The greeks would have been uninterested in the fact that there was an irrational number, but the fact that there was a triangle ''that they could construct'' whose sides were not commensurable was a real problem.  Historically this lead the greeks to make their first study of ratios.  From which we have come about the modern notion of fractions.  (Believe it or not fractions have a long involved history. But I will try to restrain myself from launching into it here.)

::The other reason this page was here was that this book at one point in time was attempting to give an introduction not so much to geometry, but to Euclidean geometry.  Even more it was trying to stick to things that appear in Euclids elements and this proposition is in the later books. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:21, 26 May 2010 (UTC)

::My main concern about this module is not its level of relating to geometry, but its difficulty. Anything beyond the Pythagorean Theorem, I believe, is too difficult for young learners. The only irrational number one should learn at that age would be pi, and even proving that pi is irrational would be too difficult. Introducing ''e'' to elementary school students would be, to use a Chinese phrase, pulling on the sprouts to help them grow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most obvious problem faced by a Seventh-day Adventist who wishes to participate in organized sports is the tendency for games to be scheduled during Sabbath hours.  Competitive sports and Sabbath observance are not compatible with one another.  An alternative would be to participate with a group of like-minded individuals.  Many towns offer city leagues, and it may be possible to form a team with other members of your church, with the understanding that you will not compete on the Sabbath.

The Adventist athlete may also enjoy individual sports instead, or engage in informal pick-up games.

== Notes on vocabulary and grammar ==

=== The verb '''olla''' (to be) ===

* Pay attention to how the verb has been used in the dialogue: &quot;Oletko sinä...?&quot; (are you...?), &quot;olen&quot; ( (I) am), &quot;hän on&quot; (she/he is). 
* Basic conjugation goes as follows:

{| class=wikitable
|-
|(minä) olen || I am || || (me) olemme || we are
|-
|(sinä) olet || you are || || (te) olette || you are
|-
|hän/se on || she/he/it is || || he/ne ovat || they are
|}
{{audio|Fi-olla.ogg|Hear the above conjugation of the verb &quot;olla&quot;}} 
{{inline player|Fi-olla.ogg}}

* Note that the pronoun (minä, sinä, me, te) is often omitted in a sentence because conjugation of the verb already indicates, who we are talking about. This means that when we say &quot;olen&quot;, it goes without saying that we mean &quot;minä olen&quot;: we are talking about &quot;minä&quot;. When we talk about &quot;sinä&quot;, the verb conjugates differently: &quot;olet&quot;, and that form only corresponds the second person of singular. 

* See full [[Wiktionary:olla#Conjugation|Conjugation of '''olla''']]
* Use an [http://www.romania-sanakirja.net/online/verbs/conjugate_verb.php| online conjugator of Finnish verbs]
* Read more about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_verb_conjugation Finnish verb conjugation]

=== The word '''hei''' ===

The word &quot;hei&quot; can be a greeting like &quot;hello&quot; in English or &quot;hej&quot; in Swedish. Here Sakari used it to draw someone's attention to himself in order to ask a question &quot;are you Markku?&quot;. It's a little bit like the English &quot;hey&quot;, but there is no rude or impolite connotation in Finnish &quot;hei&quot;. Later Tiina says &quot;Hei!&quot; to Sakari after they have been introduced to each others, meaning &quot;hello&quot; or &quot;hi&quot;. Later, when she leaves, she says &quot;hei hei!&quot;, that is equivalent to the phrase &quot;bye bye!&quot;

=== Cases of nouns in this dialogue  ===

* '''luokkatoverisi''' (classmate) is [[Wikipedia:nominative_case|nominative]]. Don't be misled by the possessive suffix &quot;-si&quot; in the end. It only indicates &quot;'''your''' classmate&quot;. Same with the word '''isosiskoni''', that means &quot;my big sister&quot;. You can use the word &quot;minun&quot; (my) or &quot;sinun&quot; (your) but you would still have to use the possessive suffix in standard Finnish, so using only the possessive suffix is very convenient. The possessive form of a word is only the headword and the suffix when the word itself ends with a vowel other than /i/.
* '''saksan''' is [[Wikipedia:genitive_case|genitive]] of '''saksa''', German language. Note that names of languages are written without capitalization.  Other genitive cases here are '''Tiinan''' ja '''Markun''' isä. Note genitive of '''Markku''' will be '''Markun''' (with one k only). 

*  '''opettaja''' (teacher) is a nominative, as well as '''opiskelija''' (student) and most of the nouns used in this dialogue, apart from the phrases.

=== Forming questions ===

There is always an interrogative in the beginning of a question. It can be either an interrogative pronoun (like &quot;[[Wiktionary:kuka#Finnish|kuka]]&quot;, &quot;[[Wiktionary:mikä#Finnish|mikä]]&quot;, &quot;[[Wiktionary:missä#Finnish|missä]]&quot;, &quot;[[Wiktionary:milloin#Finnish|milloin]]&quot;, &quot;[[Wiktionary:mistä#Finnish|mistä]]&quot; etc.) or if it is a yes/no question, you add the suffix &quot;-ko&quot; or &quot;-kö&quot; in the predicative of the sentence. The ending depends on the other vowels in that specific word. If there is /a/, /o/ or /u/, you should use &quot;-ko&quot;. In other cases it is always &quot;-kö&quot;. This is because of a phenomenon called &quot;[[Finnish/Grammar-Vowel_harmony|vowel harmony]]&quot;. In compound words, the ending depends on the latter part.

This means that &quot;to eat&quot; it is &quot;syödä&quot;, so &quot;Do you eat&quot; is &quot;Syötkö?&quot;, but as &quot;to drink&quot; is &quot;juoda&quot;, &quot;Do you drink?&quot; is &quot;Juotko?&quot; You can also add these into other words, for example &quot;Minäkö?&quot; (Me?), &quot;Tiekö?&quot; (Road?) and &quot;Yövuoroko?&quot; (Night shift?). Basically, questions can't be formed with only raising the intonation neither do questions have to have a rising intonation, as you can hear on the recording.


1. Form an indicative sentence, like &quot;Sinä olet Markku.&quot;

2. Replace the word you want with an appropriate interrogative word or add a suffix after it.

3. Put the word you changed in the beginning of the sentence.

Questions that can be formed using this sentence:
* Kuka sinä olet?
* Oletko sinä Markku?
* Markkuko sinä olet?
* Sinäkö olet Markku?

Questions in this dialogue (followed by the corresponding indicative sentence):
* Oletko sinä Markku? (Sinä olet Markku.)
* Kuka sinä olet? (Sinä olet Sakari.)
* Mitä kuuluu? (Kuuluu hyvää.)
* Kuka hän on? (Hän on Tiina.)
* Missä te olette? (Te olette metroasemalla.)
* Onko hän malli? (Hän on malli.)

== Finnish names ==
In this story we have the following names. At first they look unique Finnish but in fact they all are Finnish derivatives of international names, usually coming from Greek, Latin, or Hebrew via Swedish, German or English.

* Tiina &lt;- Tina
* Markku &lt;- Mark, Marcus
* Sakari &lt;- Zachary
* Juha &lt;- John, Johan

'''CRFL''', often augmented to '''CaReFuL''', is a memory aid for English-speaking students of [[French language|French]] as a foreign language. Students use it to remind themselves of which final consonants (aka ''terminal consonants'' or ''word-ending consonants'') are usual exceptions to the general rule that in French pronunciation, final consonants are usually silent.

Final '''K''' is, in fact, normally pronounced as well, but has probably been ignored because the letter is rare in French, generally appearing only in borrowed or learned words. In borrowed words, final consonants often retain their pronunciation because the borrowing occurred after the transformation that led to the dropping of final consonants in native words.

==For example==
In the following French words, the final consonants are silent:
*coup
*devant
*maintenant
*part
*prix
*restaurant
*salut

However, in the words below, the final consonants are heard:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width = &quot;50&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;| C
| width = &quot;150&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;chi'''c'''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;par'''c'''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;se'''c'''
|-
| width = &quot;50&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;| R
| width = &quot;150&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;bonjou'''r'''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;au revoi'''r'''
|-
| width = &quot;50&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;| F
| width = &quot;150&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;acti'''f'''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;bre'''f'''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;che'''f'''
|-
| width = &quot;50&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;| L
| width = &quot;150&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;espagno'''l'''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ma'''l'''
|-
|}

==Exceptions==
===Infinitives ending in ''-er'' and words ending in ''-ier''===

The main exceptions to the CaReFuL rule are:

#It does not apply to infinitives ending in ''-er'', which end in an /é/ sound. For example: ''parler'' (/par·lé/); ''manger'' (/man·gé/).
#It does not apply to words ending in ''-ier'', which is pronounced as /ié/. For example: ''panier'' (/pa·nié/); ''gibier'' (/ji·bié/).

===Words in which the F is not pronounced===
The ''F'' is not pronounced in ''cerf'', ''clef'', ''nerf'', in the plurals ''œufs'' and ''bœufs'', and in the compound words ''cerf-volant'' and ''chef-d'œuvre''.

===Words in which final letters other than C, R, F, and L are not silent===
Below are examples of words in which a final consonant other than C, R, L, or F is pronounced. Most frequently these words are learned words from Latin and Greek, borrowings from other languages, or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopeia onomatopeia].

{|
|-
! B
| ''club'', ''toubib''
|-
! D
| ''bled''
|-
! G

|-
! K

|-
! M

|-
! T

|-
| X

|-
| Z
| ''Metz''
|}

===''Plus''===
The word ''plus'' is pronounced differently based on its meaning and context. An [http://66.46.185.79/bdl/gabarit_bdl.asp?Th=3&amp;id=3066 overview of the rules], in French, is on the website of the Office québécois de la langue française.</text>

'''Stovies''' is a traditional Scottish dish - originating mainly from the North Eastern counties of Angus and Aberdeenshire where even today the dish is still most commonly found and served. Recipes and ingredients vary widely between regions, and even families, but the dish usually consists of potatoes and onions and some form of cold meat (especially sausages or leftover roast; mince or corned beef in the east). The potatoes are cooked by stewing with fat ''stove'' being the old Scots word for an oven - i.e &quot;Yer dinner's oan the stove&quot;. A regional variation is to serve the stovies with oatcakes. 

==Ingredients==
*50g (2 oz.) beef dripping or butter
*3 medium onions, roughly chopped
*1 kg (2 pounds)potatoes
*125-250g (4-8 ounces) cooked beef or lamb (leftovers from a roast dinner)
*2 -3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley, chives, or spring onions
*Seasoning salt, freshly ground black pepper, allspice, or grated nutmeg

==Procedure==
#Heat fat in a large heavy-base pot (one with a tight-fitting lid) and add the onions. Cook until lightly brown. Peel potatoes if they are &quot;main crop&quot;, but leave the skins on new potatoes. Slice about 5mm (1/4-inch) thick. Or slice roughly in different thickness so that the thin go into a mush, while the others stay whole. Add them to the pot with the onions and stir well. coating all sides with the fat.
#Put the lid on and cook over a very low heat, shaking the pot once or twice to prevent sticking, until the potatoes are cooked. Add the meat, mix through, and turn up the heat to brown a little. Serve with brown sauce. 

The same recipe can be adapted to use steak, beef or pork sausages instead of leftover meat.  If making stovies this way, brown the sausages with the onions at the start.

__NOTOC__
Dal Makhani is a delicacy from Punjab in India. Traditionally this dal was cooked slowly, for hours, on charcoal. This gave it a creamier texture. It had ‘malai’ (cream) or fresh butter added to it. When cooked at home these days, more moderate amounts of cream or butter are used. When prepared in restaurants, it is cooked slowly on low heat and often has a large amount of cream and butter added. Lentils and beans were soaked overnight for at least 8 hours and gently simmered on low heat along with ginger, garlic and a few other spices (garam masala). These are then combined with a tangy masala base which includes onions, tomatoes (chopped or puree) or dried mango powder or even pomegranate seeds. 

Dollops of fresh cream and butter lend the rich finishing touch. It is garnished with finely chopped coriander leaves and fresh cream. It is a sumptuous meal and a staple diet in Punjab and most of Northern India. It is commonly eaten with roti, rice, naan chapatis.

==Ingredients==

*1 cup whole urad or black gram lentil
*1/3 cup kidney beans (Rajma)
*1 tbs grated [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*Red chili powder (according to taste)
*1 tsp. turmeric powder
*red chili powder (daggi mirch)
*cumin powder, coriander powder
*3-4 tbs. ghee or clarified butter or oil
*A large pinch of hing (Asafoetida)
*2 bay leaves, 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] stick and 3 cloves
*1 tbsp minced ginger and garlic
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (thinly chopped, optional)
*2-3 medium [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], finely chopped
*1 1/2 tsp. Garam Masala (this can be altered as per taste)
*1/2 cup fresh cream.
*2 tbs. chopped coriander leaves (optional)
*Salt to taste
*5-6 cups water (to cook dal)

==Procedure==

#Wash and soak black urad (beans) and rajma (red kidney beans) overnight in an adequate amount of lukewarm water.
#Cook the soaked dal and rajma and chickpeas in 5-6 cups of water with salt, red chili powder, turmeric, and grated ginger until soft. 
#Keep the cooked dal aside. 
#Heat oil or butter in a thick bottomed pan. Add hing, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 cinnamon stick and 3 cloves, and chopped onions and cook until light golden brown in color and just when onion turns brown add ginger garlic paste and sauté. 
#Add chopped tomatoes. Sauté and add 2 tsp of coriander powder and remaining half quantity of the red chili powder as per taste and sauté until tomatoes are well mashed. 
#Add cooked dal and, water as needed. 
#Mix it well and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
#This dal generally requires more salt then we usually put in for other dal and this should be added as per taste.
#Add fresh cream and 1 tbsp of clarified butter and let it simmer for 5 minutes and turn off the heat. Garnish with coriander leaves before serving. 
#Serve hot with naan, paratha or rice.

==Other Facts==
This dish is extremely popular not just in North India but elsewhere as well. It tastes very good the following day after reheating properly. Soaking the beans overnight reduces cooking time. You can make it in slow cooker but make sure that you boil it briskly in a pan for the last 10 minutes, to neutralise the toxins in kidney beans / Rajma.

==Alternative recipe==
You can substitute garam masala with cumin-coriander powder and cream with sour cream or low fat yogurt. This dal is rich in starch and minerals, it is also considered heavy for digestion, however ginger solves this problem and makes it easy to digest. Use olive oil instead of ghee or butter and omit cream.

{{recipesummary|Pork recipes|4 Servings|prep: ~15 minutes&lt;br/&gt;cooking: 1 hour|3}}
'''Hongshao Rou''' (lit. red-cooked meat) is a traditional Chinese pork dish. It is a very popular homemade dish, but it is rarely found in Western restaurants. Often a family's exact recipe is a secret and passed down the generations. It consists of pork belly in a thick, sweet, dark sauce, simmered for a long time to soften the normally tough meat. Frequently other meats such as tripe or beef tendon are used in addition to the pork.

==Ingredients==

*700g pork belly, cubed
*3 tbsp vegetable oil
*2 tbsp white sugar
*350 ml pork or chicken stock
*1 tbsp minced ginger
*2 tbsp dark soy sauce
*50 ml Shaoxing rice wine
*3 star anise
*4 small spring onions, sliced

==Procedure==

*In a medium saucepan, over high heat, heat the oil and sugar together until the sugar melts and turns brown.
*Add the cubed pork to the sugar and oil and brown all over.
*Reduce the heat, add the stock, ginger, star anise, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine to the pan.
*Cover tightly and simmer for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent it burning at the bottom.
*Remove the lid and add the spring onions.
*Boil the sauce off until only a thick, dark gravy is left.
*The dish may be served now, but if possible, refrigerate for a day to allow the flavours to develop.
*Serve with rice, garnish with sliced spring onion.

==Variations==

*Add 500g sliced tripe. If the tripe was frozen, boil vigorously for about 40 mins until tender and not chewy. If fresh tripe is used (highly recommended) this is not required. Add to the pan about halfway through the simmering.
*Add 250g beef tendon, cut into small cubes. Boil vigorously for about 40 mins until translucent and not too chewy. Add this to the pan about halfway through the simmering.

      <comment>/* Views */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A room is created simply by clicking on a create room button - this is the first step that you must do when creating a game.

The creation of the room will add an entry to the list of resources - the default name of your first room is &quot;room0&quot;, with the number incrementing it for each step.  To avoid confusion, it is recommended to rename the room as soon as possible - either giving an English-readable name or with your own naming convention.

On the left hand-side of the room design window, you have a set of 5 tabs available.
*'''Background''', which allows you to assign 8 background/foreground elements on the screen.
*'''Views''', which allows you to define up to 8 camera positions.
*'''Objects''', which allows you to add objects that you have already defined.
*'''Settings''', which allows you to adjust the size and framerate for a given room. (You can also add custom room creation options as well.)
*'''Tiles''', which are images that are displayed but do not interact with other objects.  You can have multiple layers of tiles, where lower depths are displayed on-top of higher depths.  In some cases, you can display tiles in front of objects.

== Settings ==

The settings of the room contain the basic information about the room.  You can set the name, window title (or caption), the width, height, speed (in steps per second), and it's persistence flag.

{{NOTE|By default, the window size is exactly equal to the Width and Height of the room.}}

== Backgrounds ==

By default, the background color of a room is a single gray color.  While you can modify it directly, you may want to use a picture as part of a background.

* Create a new background in the backgrounds folder.  You should see the background properties of a blank background.  
* Click on ''Load Background'', and choose any background you want.  You may want to rename the background.
* Return to the room properties, and open its background tab.
* Click on the background selection, and choose the background you created.

If you have a transparent or semi-transparent background, you can choose up to eight background slots - ones lower down the list are drawn in-front of higher ones.  

You can also tag a certain background layer as a &quot;foreground&quot;, which causes it to be rendered after the rest of the scene is created.  This can be used to create HUDs or other possible decorations. 

== Tiles ==

For advanced control over a room's display, you can open the tiles tab.  While they use the background resource set, they can appear between objects. Tiles are slightly faster than using objects for display purposes, since they do not require collision checking.  

Tiles are located on layers which have a given depth value.  The highest depths are rendered first, and lower depths are drawn on-top of existing layers.  They normally use images from the Backgrounds image set. 

== Objects ==
You can place an object in the room by selecting an object from the list of available objects, and clicking within the room.  A left-click will create an object, while a right-click will delete it; you can also use the Shift, Ctrl, and Alt modifier keys to change what you want to do with an object. 

== Views ==

A view allows you to control the camera on screen - to enable it, you first need to check ''Enable the use of Views'' at the top of the tab. If ''Enable the use of Views'' does not appear, you are likely not in advanced mode. Note that if this is checked, you need to ensure that at least one view is visible when the room starts or is otherwise made visible in-game.

In each of the seven views available, you can modify three different sets of options:
* '''View in Room''' - this indicates the coordinates of activity in the game itself.  
* '''Port on Screen''' - this indicates the coordinates and size on the display screen. 
* '''Object Following''' - if set to an object, the view will move the camera to keep the given object on screen.

== Changing rooms ==

{{TODO|Add reference to a later portion of the book...|Game Maker Programming}}

To change a room, you need to create an object and assign an event to an object; you can create events by opening the object's properties.  When it's created, find the room change actions (available by going through the tabs on the far right) and add one of the change room actions.

=== Persistent rooms ===

By default, rooms will reset once they are left; platforms return to their original position, items will reappear, etc.  A persistent room will remain in the exact way as it was left, and will only reset if the game restarts. If you need to reset a persistent room, it may be done manually via scripting. 

Persistent objects will not remain with the previous room; they will be transferred to the new room.

'''Container gardening''' can be ideal for people living in apartments or rented homes without the space to plant gardens outside. Containers gardens allow for easy access to plants that enhance a space and can be moved easily to accommodate the sun exposure as the plant grows and seasons change.

==Soil==
Container gardens have very specific soil needs.

Hi All,

My Name is Rajaa Krayem. I am an Electrical engineer graduated from California State University Long Beach in 1990. I turned to education on 1996 to help my beloved son with his learning difficulties. I am a devoted mother of three and a compassionate teacher who live to learn and to connect with challenged young minds. I am an advocate for love and knowledge. I love to make learning fun and accessible for every one. All can learn , but some need a different approach or a special attention to trigger the creative learning abilities that each of us have.. I enjoy teaching Math and Physics. I consider Mathematics as the Language of Science and I want to teach student how to apply it as an easy language. If teachers believe in their student abilities to learn this will lead students to believe in themselves and they will give the best out naturally and spontaneously. This can be achieved by constant motivations, assigning an inspiring and challenging tasks, and supporting an atmosphere of fun interactive classroom discussion with topic- relevant activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Implements the Apprixmated Mean Filter for background modeling described in 
N. J. B. McFarlane1 and C. P. Schofield1, Segmentation and tracking of piglets in Images. 

Median is better for background subtraction because it does better rejection of outliers. This algorithm recursively approximates the median image, and then subtracts the background model from the current frame to find foreground objects.  Its disadvantage is that it takes a long time to update the background when an object starts moving after being still for a long time.  Combine it with BackgroundSubtractionCheungKamath to reject that type of noise.

I am Rajaa from Lebanon,I have been teaching since 1996. I taught Math and Physic 2 years at AIS of kuwait,Then moved to Egypt,and I taught Math, Chemistry ,physic and general science at two different American high school(Future American and Rajac Amirican school). I am having problem with using the wikibook.I am so behind in Technology it is a shame.can you help me please. Or is there away I can talk to you and walk me through some of my problems,in posting pictures or posting  comments . I am not sure if I am witing to you now .  I am all over the place. Thank You.

== File upload ==

I noticed your upload of [[:File:San Diego State.JPG]] and just wanted to thank and commend you for adding sufficient licensing information. Judging from the number of people who have trouble with this, our documentation seems to be a little lacking. If you have any comments on what might be better explained, please comment on it on the appropriate [[Help:Contents|help-page]] [[Help:Talk pages|discussion page]] or let me know directly.

In case it might be of any use, I'm leaving you a belated welcome message at the top of the page. It has a number of useful links ... though you may know about these things already. In that case, feel free to remove it.

Happy editing! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:50, 5 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

== [[A Textbook of Classical Tibetan]] ==

Congratulations on starting a new book, Tibetologist! I noticed that some parts of it look like verbatim copies from [[w:Tibetan script]]. As Wikipedia articles are licensed under the GFDL, there needs to be propers attribution to former contributors. The easiest way is to [[WB:RFI|request for an import]] and then edit the imported version.

The Tibetan text you included similarly needs to be cleared for copyright. Please clarify where you got these texts in your edit summaries and/or on the talk page.

Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:52, 16 February 2009 (UTC)

== [[Research on Tibetan Languages: A Bibliography]] ==

Bibliographies usually belong in books. Is this supposed to be a page in [[A Textbook of Classical Tibetan]]? Please let me know if you'd like some help moving the page. See also [[Help:Editing#Subpage links]] for more on sub-pages. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:18, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

: No, I have meant to start a book length (analytic) bibliography. Such things exist ''Die Erforschung des Tocharische' or Stary's big Manchu bibliography leap to mind.

:: I see. I've added {{tlx|new book}} tags to both your books. These have tips on how to catalogue your books. They also add them to the {{tlx|new}} books list which gives them a little bit of extra publicity.
:: Seeing how you have well your text is referenced, you may be interested in [[Help:Editing#References]].
:: For discussions on [[Help:talk page|talk page]]s, you can add four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) to insert a handy signature with timestamp.
:: Feel free to ask me or request assistence in the appropriate [[Wikibooks:reading room|reading room]] if you have any questions. I doubt the community will be of much use on such a specialised topic, but we're all more than happy to help. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:22, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

}}
This book is not linked to from any other, so it is not apparent what it is a bibliography for.  Most of it is not in English, so I am unable to tell whether it is the start of a book or a mistake.  Please clarify the situation as described above. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:14, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

:Not all bibliographies need to be appended to books. Sometimes they are created as scholarly resources. I could perhaps point to Shafer's Bibliography of Sino-Tibetan Languages, or Stary's bibliography of Manchu studies. This is the intention of this book. In fact two such books have already been published as you can see in the entries under Arakawa and Kwanten. Much of it is not in English because much of Tangut studies is not done in English. You will notice that all Chinese and Japanese are transliterated into the standard anglophone systems (Pinyin and modified Hepburn respectively) and that many of the entries have English translations (the intention is to have translations for all Chinese and Japanese and maybe Russian, one assumes that most educated people know French and German, or at least one assumes that in works like this). [[User:Tibetologist|Tibetologist]] ([[User talk:Tibetologist|talk]]) 13:54, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

:: Thanks for the information.  I'm trying to categorize all the books.  I hope it's all right if I file your page in [[:Category:Cultural anthropology]]? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:12, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

==Hi==
I have Tibetan Unicode TTF installed on my computer. One of my browsers Oprah enables me to see Tibetan in the Classical Tibetan Wikibook. I am going to be travelling tomorrow and I thought it a good opportunity to read this book. I exported it as PDF and all of the Tibetan is squares. I save it as a webpage and it is all visual noise when I open it in a browser. Do you have any insight into this?&lt;br &gt;
Thank you&lt;br &gt;
[[User:B9 hummingbird hovering|B9 hummingbird hovering]] ([[User talk:B9 hummingbird hovering|talk]]) 17:00, 28 August 2009 (UTC)
::I got it working I had to change how the page was encoded to Unicode-8 or something and then tweak the html file extension type. Your advice to copy and paste was good and I will do that in future as it is somewhat easier. Do you have any information handy on the 9 cases of Tibetan? I have learnt the script and am typing happily in Tibetan though I am still tweaking Devanagari. I have secured a copy of the 30 Verses, the traditional grammar that is to be memorized by traditional students of Classical Tibetan and am considering working on a translation of that. Jumping straight in the deep end is my way.

==Grammar==
Thank you so much for your kind offer regarding emailing me some grammars. My email is Please delete it from here when you receive this message. I get enough unsolicited email as it is. *chuckle* I would prefer a webcrawler doesn't pick it up. I have noticed some user's chatpages on those mirror sites. I have taken stock of your advice that no grammar is very good and that I best read several to form my own opinion. &lt;br &gt;
I appreciate this very much. Thank you.&lt;br &gt;

I am transcribing the Ngondro of the Longchen Nyingtig. There is text of a standard size, then there are what appears to be annotations and practice instructions etcetera in little text of smaller font. I appreciate that the texts such as this Ngondro were living documents and that annotations slowly became incorporated into the text proper. Do you know what this is called? What is its functionality etc? If I have the name for it then I can research it myself. Also, I couldn't find any convention in the EWTS for marking such smaller text, what conventions are you familiar with? Thank you very much for Beyer as well.&lt;br &gt;

== File uploads ==

Hi Suomipoika. I noticed your file uploads. Sound-bytes are great resources for language textbooks. In case you weren't aware of it, I just wanted to bring to your attention that free license content can also be uploaded to Wikimedia [[Commons:|Commons]] where it becomes transparently available across all Wikimedia projects (such as Wikibooks and our sister project Wikipedia). Happy editing. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:26, 26 February 2009 (UTC)

:Thank you for your reminder about the audio files. Usually I upload to Commons and there are quite a few of my uploads already. I actually assumed that when I am editing a page and adding a still non-existing media file and then click on the link, that it would offer me to create the non-existing content under commons, but not wikibooks. For example, if I want to make the file behind test only (help·info) to work by just clicking the link, the file would be uploaded here. Similarly I have uploaded tens of files to Russian wikipedia for a Finnish course there. I actually wanted to transfer them to commons but don't know how to do it automatically without having to manually re-submit each file. Do you know whether there is an easier way to do that? Suomipoika (talk) 23:36, 26 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Ah, I see. I guess the naming convention should have been a hint! If you want to use red-links to upload files, I guess you can replace &quot;en.wikibooks&quot; with &quot;commons.wikimedia&quot; after clicking on the link. Not terribly user-friendly, I'll admit.
:: I've never used it, but it seems that the [http://toolserver.org/~magnus/commonshelper.php Move-to-commons assistant] is your friend. After moving them over, you can tag them with {{tlx|nowcommons}} and an admin will get around to deleting the local copy. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:24, 27 February 2009 (UTC)

== A book on books ==

You may also have come across this already, but seeing how you're enthusiastic about language education, I figured I'd leave you a link to the textbook on [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]]. I stitched this together from a couple of incomplete, single-page books on the subject. It's still in poor shape, but still of some use for ideas, and with some love and care might turn into a great resource. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:24, 27 February 2009 (UTC)

== [[Finnish]] ==

This book seems to have preceded the current [[Wikibooks:naming policy]] which stipulates that book pages be gathered into sub-pages ([[Finnish/Aakkoset]] rather than [[Finnish:Aakkoset]] or something similar). Many of the links point to the old pages with the &quot;colon&quot; convention which redirect to the new. It might be a good idea to update these as you go, or even make a bot run on them to fix it.

The [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] recommends placing the cover page on a sub-page and rather place the main contents on the main page. I've been slowly changing some of the abandoned language textbooks to use this form. Let me know if you'd like help on either of these. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:24, 27 February 2009 (UTC)

== Thank you! ==

Thank you for all the good advice and tips above!  The move to commons assistant seems to be a little bit helpful when moving from en.wikibooks to commons. However it can't help with ru.wikibooks files, because at the time I was uploading I did not give any licensing information. But transferring them manually won't be that big job either. Even with the commons assistant you still need to do the upload manually. The assistant just helps with retrieving the information.  [[User:Suomipoika|Suomipoika]] ([[User talk:Suomipoika|talk]]) 10:00, 27 February 2009 (UTC)

: You're welcome! How many files are we talking about here? If this is a question about hours of work, you might want to have a look at [[commons:Commons:Bots]] and [[commons:Commons:Tools/Commonist]] for something to save you some time. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:19, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

::Now, when I counted them, only about 100 and I have already transferred one third of them. Not an overwhelming task at all to do just manually. Though Commons tools are still interesting! [[User:Suomipoika|Suomipoika]] ([[User talk:Suomipoika|talk]]) 01:00, 1 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

=Grünfeld Defence - Nadanian Variation=
==5. Na4!?==
This strange looking move was first employed by [[w:Ashot Nadanian|Ashot Nadanian]] in 1996. Usually it is not recommended to put Knights on the edge of the board, but here it is meaningful. White takes the important c5-square under control and going to banish black's Knight from the center with е4 move. In the further the a4-Knight can occupy the c5-square and attack the pawn on b7.

==Sources==

The section on the script has been copied from the Wikipedia page, but will eventually change. The text of the two Tibetan texts is most easily available in Michael Hahn's ''Lehrbuch der Tibetische Sprichtsprache''. It comes however from the Derge Kanjur an 18th century xylograph. This edition is my own work, adding noun phrase breaks and quotations. [[User:Tibetologist|Tibetologist]] ([[User talk:Tibetologist|talk]]) 17:13, 16 February 2009 (UTC)

Might want to take more time on the alphabet. (Each of the consonants is a word.) 
Tibetan calligraphy (how to write each letter) [http://lrc.cornell.edu/medialib/ti/twc Cornell University Tibetan Language Resources]
&lt;br /&gt;
Most excellent beginner course, including pronunciation on youtube [http://www.tibetanlanguage.org/ The Tibetan Language Institute]

      <text xml:space="preserve">This might be a useful resource for teachers, or someone designing a course. The ideal way to introduce these words would be through examples; the very easy words can be introduced incidentally, without requesting the student to memorize it. This encourages the student, by giving them something they can discover and understand without it being spelled out.

== Essential words ==

These are very common words - learn these early on and it will make understanding and learning easier.

{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot;
!Indonesian!!English!! Suggested association
|-
|sudah || already || Indonesian has no &quot;tense&quot; - words such as sudah and belum are used instead.
|-
|belum || not yet ||
|-
|lagi || again; (happening) now ||
|-
|ada || there is; present ||
|}

== Easy words ==

{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot;
!Indonesian !!English !! Notes
|-
|sarung || sarong || (sarong is the Malaysian form)
|-
|nama || name ||
|-
|orang || person || ''Orang hutan'' (&quot;orang utan&quot; in English) means ''forest person''.
|-
|hutan || forest || ''Orang hutan'' (&quot;orang utan&quot; in English) means ''forest person''.
|-
|bir || beer ||
|-
|mata hari || sun || Heard of the famous spy Matahari? She took her name from Malay.
|-
|mata || eye || ''mata hari'' means ''eye of the day''
|-
|hari || day || ''mata hari'' means ''eye of the day''
|-
|lampu || lamp or light ||
|-
|kecap || soy sauce
|-
|sekolah || school ||
|-
|nasional || national || Indonesian has many words which have come from Dutch - some are very similar to the English equivalents.
|-
|kulkas || refrigerator || Sounds like &quot;cool case&quot;. Another Dutch word.
|-
|bakteria || bacteria || Many medical and scientific words are similar to the English word - with practice, you can often guess them.
|-
|guru || teacher || Any teacher is a &quot;guru&quot; - so a school teacher is a ''guru sekolah''. One of dozens or hundreds of Sanskrit words.
|-
|mantra || Magical prayer, for example by a ''dukun'' (shaman) || from Sanskrit
|}

== Speakers of other languages ==
If the learner speaks:
* Portuguese (or Spanish), 
* Dutch (or Flemish) 
* Sanskrit (or Hindi or Urdu)
* Chinese (Mandarin? Hokkien?), or 
* Arabic

then they can find some words they might recognize at [[Wikipedia:List of loan words in Indonesian]].

If you do yoga and know some Sanskrit terms, you may recognize some words such as:
* &quot;gajah&quot; meaning elephant
* &quot;surya&quot; meaning sun

This '''Printable Huge Table''' is a detailed periodic table that does not fit on most computer screens. However, in print with a small font, or in landscape mode, this table can be printed onto a single normal-sized paper (A4 or 8.5 x 11&quot;).  It makes minimal use of color and can be printed with only black ink. ''Click '''Printable Version''' on the left under &quot;Toolbox&quot; before printing.''&lt;/span&gt;

== Queen Elizabeth I ==
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;Queen Elizabeth's Early Life&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Elizabeth was born September 7th, 1533, Greewich Palace. Her parents were Henry VIII and Ann Boleyn. Elizabeth's died when she was just 3 years of age. Her mother was beheaded for accusation of witchcraft, insecst, and adultry. Elizabeth became queen on Novemeber 17th of 1558. She was queen for 44 years and 44 months. She was called &quot;The Goood Virgin Queen, or Queen Bess.&quot; Queen Elizabeth was the fifth and last Monarch of the tudor dynasty. Elizabeth's greatest achievement was defeating the Spanish Armada in 1558. She went to Tillbury during the fighting and after the fighting in the English Channel, the Spanish suffered and the English won. Elizabeth was amazing at political science, Which she inhererited her father's supremacist view of the monarchy, but she showed great wisdom by refusing to directly antagonize parliment. Elizabeth always waited till the last minute to minute, which she used as to her advantage. Her main palace was the White Hall, where she mostly stayed and spent most of her Christmas vacations. She inheirited over 60 royal palaces. Her hobbies were playing tennis and hunting deer.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Fish|Fish]]
__NOTOC__
This is a fish [[Cookbook:Casserole|casserole]], baked in the [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]]. It goes well with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].
A [[Cookbook:Salad|green salad]] is a good side dish.

==Ingredients==
* 500-700 gr. white [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] fillet (e.g., [[Cookbook:Cod|cod]], haddock, [[Cookbook:Hake|hake]], pollock (Boston bluefish))
* 2-3 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]] (neutrally tasting, e.g. [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]], [[Cookbook:Sunflower Oil|sunflower oil]], [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|corn oil]], [[Cookbook:Soy|soybean oil]])
* 2-3 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] sliced to make 1 cup
* 2 green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]], sliced
* 1 [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]], finely chopped
* 6 medium [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], sliced
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic cloves]], thinly sliced
* 1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon juice]]
* 1 (heaping) Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 2 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* (Optional) 2 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] or [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] sprig, finely chopped

== Procedure ==
* Prepare all vegetables.
* Combine lemon juice, tomato paste, sugar and turmeric in small bowl, mix until smooth. Set this sauce aside.
* Preheat oven to 350 F.
* Heat the oil in a large pot.
* [[Cookbook:Saute|Sauté]] the onions until golden-brown and they begin to loosen their moisture. Then, remove using a slotted spoon, and layer in a oven-proof dish.
* In the same oil, sauté the bell and chili peppers for 2 minutes or until softened, transfer using a slotted spoon to oven-proof dish, layering over the onions
* Layer half of the raw tomatoes over the peppers.
* Spread the garlic over the tomatoes, and season with half of the salt and pepper.
* In the same oil, sauté the fish for 1 minute, then transfer to dish, place on top of tomatoes, season with remaining salt and pepper.
* Top the fish with the remaining tomato slices.
* Spread the lemon-tomato-paste sauce over the top layer.
* Cover dish with aluminum foil, bake for 20 minutes.
* (Now is a good idea to start cooking the rice.)
* Remove aluminum foil, continue baking 10 more minutes, or until the fish flakes easily when tested.
* (Optional) sprinkle with parsley or cilantro garnish. 
* Serve immediately.

== Optional / Replacements ==
* The [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]] can be replaced by [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]] or completely omitted if a less spicy dish is desired.
* A can of tomatoes can replace the fresh tomatoes.

== Translations ==

Hi SoylentGreen,

Regarding [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Coordinate Spaces in Blender]], I noticed the German templates and figured that this might be a translation of a German Wikibook module. Please keep in mind that translations are also derivative works and need to give attribution to past authors. I'm not sure if we can transwiki between the language versions, but maintaining the edit history would make it easier to fulfill the requirements of the GFDL. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:24, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
: Yeah, it is a german wikibook module, I will give credit where credit is due (i.e. I wrote most parts myself). I've just checked it, I wrote everthing besides some spelling corrections, so I think I may omit any credits. Thank you for watching. Regards --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 18:08, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

:: OK, great! Nice work, by the way. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 22:39, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

== Blender Noob to Pro cleanup notice ==

I hope you don't mind, but I moved the cleanup notice to the top of the book.  This was mainly to keep other editors from overlooking it and to avoid accusations that the cleanup was done without letting everyone know. --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 21:37, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

== Blender 3D: Noob to Pro -- Coordinate Spaces in Blender ==

I am the person who edited the page named in the header, correcting the grammar and axis labels.  I have now created an account on this site with the intention of joining the editing team for the book.

Now that I have an account, I want to point out to you that the axis labels on this page truly are incorrect.  Not only does your identification of the Y and Z axes disagree with what I was taught in school, but it directly contradicts the information in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Understanding_Coordinates Blender 3D: Noob to Pro -- Understanding Coordinates].  I suggest you discuss the subject with the author of that page or a member of the editing team at your next opportunity.  Consistency is vital, after all.

I look forward to working with you and the others on the book, and learning to use Blender while I'm at it  :P

As to your English language skills, I'll work with you to best represent your intended meaning with any edits I make...my German isn't what it used to be either.

Vielen danke,
[[User:Robstafarian|Robstafarian]] ([[User talk:Robstafarian|talk]]) 18:38, 8 March 2009 (UTC)
: Welcome here, and great that you will work at Noob to Pro! I've worked since 2005 continuously at the German manual for Blender, and contributed also to the English manual. Thank you for pointing me to the &quot;Understanding coordinates&quot; page, which is basically confusing at best. I know that other programs have their axes orientated some other ways, but what I've written on the page is correct for Blender. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 19:57, 8 March 2009 (UTC)
:: Interesting, I would never have guessed that Blender labels the axes differently than everything else with which I've come in contact.  Please post on my talk page with any tips you can give me for working on this site.  I am new to non-anonymous wiki editing and don't even know how to introduce myself to the team.--[[User:Robstafarian|Robstafarian]] ([[User talk:Robstafarian|talk]]) 20:32, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

== RE: Image Depository ==

Hello, SoylentGreen. Hope your doing okay&lt;br&gt;
:The Image Depository is still very much incomplete, as is obvious to see. My idea was to categorize these images into columns along the page, each column with a subject (e.g. Renders, screenshots, buttons/menus, et cetera.) which would make it much easier to skim and find an image. Borders could also be added on images, such as green to mean attribution required, and gray means no attribution. It would be very useful, I believe, because it would be a way to very easily have someone who is editing illustrate their point quickly by just grabbing an image (such as one of the default Blender screen, and then one of the initial &quot;box&quot;) and throwing it in their tutorial. It would also help to clarify what is meant by &quot;default&quot;, as some people's default has been set to clear, and some people have the Blender default.You see where I'm going with this. Do you believe this is a useful concept, or unnecessary?&lt;br&gt;
:--[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 22:32, 20 March 2009 (UTC)
:: Good morning! (at least here it is in Germany :-) ). I think it is a good idea, as long as the images are uploaded on commons.wikimedia. The only point is, it may be quite much work and it is questionable whether it is worth the effort. I have uploaded about 500 images to commons in the four years that I'm writing on the German manual now (maybe even more). Though I know which Images I have made, I rarely use an image on more than one page - but it may be different for me because in a manual you show on each page different settings. 
:: To summon: a good idea and may be useful, but I don't know whether it is worth the effort. Regards --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 07:34, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

::: If I may cast in my two cents: For the Commons images, you guys could always just set this portfolio up on Commons. Pages in the main namespace are meant as galleries.
::: As this may have something to do with the idea I put forward on Bullercruz1's talk page, I think I should clarify that my thoughts were restricted to the Wikibooks specific files. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:52, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

== Rugs ==

The page has no useful content and hasn't been updated for over a year. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 10:52, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

: It seems like a potentially useful stub. Is this redundant (like the particle pages)? Would it possibly be useful to future contributors to other books? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:52, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
:: I think that we should be realistic about the potential of this page:
::# If anybody is going to write a tutorial, he will not invest (or only in the rarest cases) in a page, he hasn't started and has probably no interest in.
::# The topic of this page is already covered in the book.
::# We &quot;fight&quot; with many stubs in the book. If this book contains many stubs it's very difficult for any reader to find the little well formatted and well written content we have.
:: In theory we could move all stub pages somewhere where they don't hurt, but this will lead to 50 pages content and 100 pages stubs. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

::: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;The above section was moved from [[Talk:Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Rug]] for the sake of the reply below.&lt;/span&gt;
::: While we have lots of abandoned pages, we tend to keep them around anyway. Deleting pages doesn't save us any server space and should they not save much work, they may be an incentive for a knowledgeable user who comes along to join the project. However, as the topic is already covered, the stub servers no real purpose.
::: As for &quot;fighting&quot; stubs, I feel your pain. The [[Japanese]] book I've been involved with (though not much in the last few weeks) suffered from the same and organising the available content is a huge task. Stubs needn't be renamed to be taken out of view. [[Japanese/Contents]], for example, lists all the available content &amp;mdash; not (specifically) for readers, but contributors who may be looking for a page to build on. The modules listed there are incomplete and don't fit in the grand scheme of the book, but may save some work.
::: Keep up the good work! All the best, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:45, 25 March 2009 (UTC)


== Thanks for the upload info ==
I created an Wikibooks Common account and uploaded the images. I'm re-editing the &quot;Noob-to-pro&quot; page now. If you hadn't mentioned it I wouldn't have been able to figure it out. I tried at first, but then got a page telling me stuff about how images need to be approved by a Steward and Administrators. So I decided &quot;well, maybe I can link it.&quot; Thanks again! :0

      <text xml:space="preserve">NCEA is split up into multiple levels. NCEA Level 1 is typically done by year 11 students, NCEA Level 2 by year 12 students and NCEA Level 3 by year 13 students. There are also scholarship exams available, usually open to year 13 students.

==The Basics==
NCEA unlike the previous School Certificate qualification is gained by earning credits. These credits may be earned internally (in class or assessed and marked by teachers at the school) or externally (assessed at end-of-year examinations). There are two types of standards that may be met in order to gain credits: Achievement Standards (A.S.) and Unit Standards (U.S.). Achievement Standards may be achieved at 3 levels: Achieved, Merit and Excellence. Unit Standards can only be Achieved or Not Achieved.

==NCEA Level One==
To pass NCEA Level One students require 80 credits including 8 literacy (english) credits and 8 numeracy (maths) credits.

==NCEA Level Two==
Level Two requires 60 credits at level 2 or above plus 20 credits at any level.

==NCEA Level Three==
Level Three requires 60 credits at level 3 or above plus 20 credits at level 2 or above.

==Scholarship==
NCEA offers scholarship exams. In these the top 3% for each subject will receive $500 for every year they are at a New Zealand University. The top 0.3% for each subject receive  $2000 for every year they are at a New Zealand university.

==Endorsements==
Students are able to get an endorsement with their certificate. If 50 or more of the credits gained at one level are gained from assessments where the student achieved at a Merit or Excellence level than they will get NCEA endorsed with Merit. If they get 50 or more at Excellence level then they get NCEA endorsed with Excellence.

== [[World War I]] ==

I am a new user to Wikibooks and I have been working on writing a [[World War I]] Wikibook. I would like to split the [[World War I/Causes|causes page]] into multiple pages (one for each cause), as once I have included all the important causes it will be a '''very''' long page if I do not split. What would be the correct way to split the parts of the page I have already written - should I just move the text to a new page, or is there a different way which is preferred? Thanks, --[[User:Anonymous101|Anonymous101]] ([[User talk:Anonymous101|talk]]) 19:07, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

: The only issue is with attribution. As far as I know, we don't have the ability to copy version history (without exporting a page and importing it again) so usually content is just copied to the new page and the attribution mentioned in the edit summary. Happy editing. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:47, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

== Circumstances which will allow me to produce text pages for biology/ecology and one laboratory manual ==

Hi
I don't know if this will end up right, but I'll give it a whack.
I am a retired science teacher of 30 years, all sciences, hold an earned M.S. in Ecology and am now teaching biology and ecology at a college in the U.S.
I have been provided with a situation in which I can produce a complete laboratory manual and also edit biology/ecology texts as desired.
I assume that discussion about this might be on an IRC as mentioned elsewhere. If someone could reply with some specifics as to a time, I'm central time zone in the U.S., then I could visit and get started.

: Hi. Could you elaborate a bit further? Are you asking for collaborators, or just whether this is the right venue for your work?
: If it is the latter, you should have a quick look over [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] and the available material on the topics you're interested in adding to. [[WB:SEARCH|Searching]] and browsing through the [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office|Card Catalog Office]] should be a start. There is a subject page on [[Subject:biology|biology]], but none on ecology.
: Discussion about page development takes place on their corresponding [[Help:talk page|talk page]]s, but you're welcome to join us on IRC (see [[Wikibooks:Contact us]] for more).
: Should you find dormant books, feel free to adopt them. If you plan to pick up or start a new book, you can place an announcement in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects|projects reading room]].
: I'll leave you a welcome message on your talk page. Please have a glance through the links there. Happy editing! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:38, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
== Reporting bug with source highlighting ==

What's the best way to report a bug with the source code highlighter in [[Perl Programming/Data Types]] - in particular, it highlights variable names prepended with ''$'', ''@'', and ''%'', but not the ''*'' used by the typeglobs.  --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 01:27, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

== New user, I am a bit lost ==

Hi!

I hope this is the right place for my question 
I am reading the Blender_3D-_Noob_to_Pro_-_Beginner_Tutorials, if i clic on a link to download an image, I have got a message saying that i am not a register user, but I am.

Can you help

Jeanclaude

Ps i am french, hope my english is acceptable

: The links in the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Beginner Tutorials]] module don't work for me either.
: I would skip that page for now, and go on to the next page: [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Tutorial Syntax]].

: You and I are registered users here at Wikibooks. But those links take us to an IRC discussion channel.
: The &quot;not a register user&quot; message is not coming from Wikibooks.
: Perhaps that message comes from the IRC discussion channel.
: Perhaps that message comes from your IRC client -- perhaps a different client would work better for you ( [[Wikipedia:fr:Liste de clients IRC]] ).

== Confusing subjects ==

After responding half-ignorant to a [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Assistance#How_do_I_put_my_book_on_the_bookshelf.3F|request for assistance]], I started looking into the whole subjects thing. I was away when the project abandoned the bookshelves/departments and only recently heard that they'd been deprecated in favour of subjects.

Well, not completely deprecated. There still linger remnants of these old systems and they make understanding how things are done somewhat more complicated than they need be. I wanted to raise this here to draw this to the community's attention. Please share what you can to shed a light on what has been done and what still needs to be done to complete this move.

[[Wikibooks:Subject pages]] seems to be the canonical page for this, but it is [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Wikibooks:Subject_pages|poorly linked to]] (currently: one meaningful link) and could use expanding.

Something which confused me is that on module pages, the list of categories is preceded by a link to [[Special:Categories]] with the link title &quot;Subjects&quot; (other pages still have the link title &quot;Categories&quot;). Is this a feature, or a remnant of the past?

Other relevant pages that I found are
* [[Subject:Major Subjects]]
** {{tl|All subjects}} is [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:All_subjects|hardly used]] and should maybe be deleted.
* [[:Category:Cataloguing]]
** [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]]
** [[:Category:Subjects]]: Pages and templates in this category are used to help keep the Subject: space organized.
** [[:Category:All_Subjects]]

Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:50, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

: While I like the idea of keeping Subject pages up-to-date by generating them automatically with Dynamic Page Lists, I'm against moving to Subject pages unless we have a way of alphabetically sorting the lists. It just doesn't seem very reader-friendly to present apparently randomly ordered lists of books. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 11:09, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
:: There isn't a requirement that subject pages use DynamicPageList even though most do. The CategoryTree extension could just as easily be used for instance: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#categorytree:Mathematics|namespaces=-|hideroot}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Also for what its worth, the sort order that DynamicPageList uses isn't random its by the time each page was added to the category. DynamicPageList also can sort pages by the time each page was last edited. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:44, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
:::Thanks, I wasn't aware of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#categorytree}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 13:20, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

: Well I think the intent was to deprecate bookshelves slowly to make sure most things are in place for subject pages first. Which I think means as more things are in place [[Wikibooks:Subject pages]] and [[Subject:Major Subjects]] would be linked to more.

: Subject/Subjects only replaces Category/Categories in category listings in the main namespace and the Wikijunior namespace IIRC. Both namespaces consist of books and the intent is to have people think of categories in those two namespaces in terms of what subject(s) a book covers. {{tlx|subject}} is also intended to support this way of thinking about categorizing books. I would consider this a feature, but maybe other people would disagree?

: I updated [[Wikibooks:Requested books]] awhile ago to better reflect the major subjects listed at [[Subject:Major Subjects]] and to link to subject pages instead as one step towards deprecating bookshelves. IMO [[Main Page]] should be updated last, after everything else has. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:44, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

:: Well, I am new enough that I don't completely follow this discussion, so allow me to ask a few foolish questions.  My main interest is mathematics, currently when I click on mathematics the main wikibooks page I get the mathematics bookshelf.  If I first click on subjects, then go to the top level subject of mathematics, then I get the subject page.  Is the bookshelf page intended to disappear at some point?  This would be a shame because of the two pages the bookshelf page is by far more useful then the subject page.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:03, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
::: Yes I believe the intention is for the mathematics bookshelf page to disappear at some point. However I think by the time that is ready to happen, the subject page will be in a lot better shape than it is now. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:30, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

:: Thanks for the clarification, Darklama. So it would appear that the bookshelves haven't been deprecated yet. While I'm sure that those involved in the discussion at the time are well on top of things, might it be a good idea to describe this move on [[Wikibooks:Bookshelves]] and [[Wikibooks:Subject pages]] (a link to relevand discussions could also help) so that users will be able to do their part on subjects that contribute in?
:: Regarding the category listings; The use of &quot;subject&quot; as a synonym for &quot;category&quot; really confused me when I found that there are also &quot;subject-pages&quot;. It seems that these are supposed to complement each other, but using the same term for both seems a little odd. I don't think &quot;category&quot; organising books into subjects is in any way misleading and it would be useful to have separate terms.
:: On a somewhat related note. I seem to recall seeing a wiki setup with two rows of &quot;categories&quot; in the bottom (one called &quot;category&quot; the other something else). Does anyone know if I'm just mis-remembering, or is this an available MediaWiki feature? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:50, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

::: In a way yes subject and category pages complement each other. In another way I think subjects are suppose to replace the need for most people to think about categories and categorization too. Not sure on the best way to describe the concept. Perhaps think about it like this: Writers write books. Catalogers catalog books. Writers aren't suppose to be concerned with the details of how books are cataloged, just assured that books will be cataloged. Basically a separation of interface from the details of how its implemented (does the average person really care how their OS makes it possible to read and write files for instance). IOW to the average user the difference between subject pages and categories shouldn't matter in theory. Only catalogers need to know the difference and how to assure the correct books show up on the correct pages. I think changing it back to &quot;Category/Categories&quot; would be a step back rather than a step forward. I think a step forward would probably be to have the categories that people see on book pages go to the subject page instead, assuming that were possible. Does that at all help reduce your confusion and explain why the same term is being used for both?

::: If the wiki setup is the same wiki setup that I am thinking of, the wikis that have multiple rows of categories are using an extension. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:31, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: It would, indeed, be ideal if writers didn't have to worry about the internals of cataloging their pages. We are, however, not quite there yet.
:::: Having the bottom-of-the-module links point to the subject pages, effectively hiding the categories behind them, would be an idea. Do you know if this is currently implementable?
:::: But then what would the categories be used for? It then seems like the subject pages are just taking over from the categories. Do they have a different purpose, or are they just implementing the representation of their contents differently? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:49, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

::::: I know Wikibooks isn't quite there yet. I guess you could say people were thinking big and long term, and why the decision seemed to be to take things slowly. I know category links could be changed to point to subject pages using javascript, but I much rather try to see if this could be done by changing a mediawiki page instead.
::::: I think book categories will still be used as an index of sorts for books, like they are now. I think categories will also serve a vital role in making book listings on subject pages more automated. Yes I think subject pages will implement and represent category contents differently. Subject pages can display books from one or more categories or cross sections of categories. Most &lt;s&gt;categories&lt;/s&gt; subject pages right now for instance have a general list of books, a list of featured books on the subject and a list of books on the subject that have versions available for print, which uses multiple categories. There might be other interesting uses of category cross sections people will find for subject pages as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:01, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

:::::: Oh, I didn't mean to imply that I thought things were going too slowly. I was just stating my reason why I'd like to clarify things. Seeing how people are a bit confused by this, I'd like to add to the documentation where this is all going, what needs to be done, and how people (such as myself) who weren't involved in the discussion can pitch in.
:::::: So if I understand you correctly, subject pages would correspond to a sub-set of categories and are mainly for the purpose of being able to manually tweak the presentation. These would still have corresponding categories to help with maintaining these.
:::::: If this is the case, then having links direct to subject pages would be a big step forward. How about just redirecting from those category pages? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:45, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

=== More than presentation ===

I didn't think you were implying anything. I was also trying to be clear in hopes that you and anyone else whose confused might understand some of the rationals and thoughts behind what's been going on with the subject namespace.

Yes I think you basically understand the intended correlation between subject pages and categories. I think there is a bit more to the purpose than presentation though. With bookshelves at some point there became so many that people started creating departments to organize bookshelves. I think unavoidably department would eventually have the same problem which would require more and more complexity to organizing books while making finding books more and more difficult. Also with bookshelves, I think people tended to feel like books only belonged on one bookshelf. Subject pages on the other hand could link to each other branching out creating more of a tree structure or web-like structure, rather than a hierarchy like bookshelves or categories do, and the notation that books only belong in one place is easier to get rid of. Also by being in there own namespace limiting searches to just subject pages is possible, which is not something so easily done with bookshelves and departments.

I think being able to view and link directly to categories is still going to be useful at times. Besides that would require a lot of work. FWIW I was just talking about changing the automatic list of categories generated by using &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on a book to point to Subject:Foo instead if the page exists, while &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; would still point to Category:Foo. I think at the very least we should hold off on redirecting categories until that's been tried and see where people want to go from there after awhile.

: Great. This is all becoming much clearer. Thanks for taking the time to bring us (me) up to speed!
: This still leaves one question: We should probably encourage Wikibookians to take an interest in the subject pages to which their books belong, but to what extent can they help with deprecating the bookshelves?
: &quot;''I think at the very least we should hold off on redirecting categories [...]''&quot; Fair enough. It would, indeed be a hassle to maintain that. How do you suggest we modify that? Do you know if there are settings available to change those links, or would that take some modification of MW scripts? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:23, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

:: This is a very interesting discussion, but I will have to read this thread a few more times before I really get the distinctions.  But let me ask some specific questions just to get my bearings. The current mathematics book shelf page currently lists books roughly by sub-subject (Algebra, Geometry, calculus, etc) and makes some rough cutoff to distinguish how advanced the book is (Currently it is, and I am  not a fan of the term, &quot;Higher Mathematics&quot;)  So if I was interested in really working improving the subject page for mathematics it seems like I should do the following things: Create subject pages for the sub-subjects (like the already existing [[Subject:Geometry]]).  Also place books into categories like &quot;elementary school level&quot;, &quot;high school level&quot;, &quot;college level&quot;, &quot;graduate level and beyond&quot;.  Then we add some pazzaz to the mathematics subject page (not my specialty) and the bookshelf is ready to go? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 12:00, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
:: PS And is one of the categories a module is supposed  be a part of a category that simply lists the modules in the book? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 12:02, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

::: Yes, you could create subject pages for each math subject. You would place books into categories like [[:Category:Algebra]] or [[:Calculus]], and place each of those categories and each subject page in [[:Category:Mathematics]]. Yes you would than add some magic to each subject page you created to have the books from each category show up on the corresponding subject page. By placing the subject pages in the Mathematics category the magic on the Mathematics subject page would cause the related subject page to become listed. Yes than the subject pages would be ready to go. I'm not sure what you're asking in your PS but I'll see if I can try to answer anyways. If you had a book named &quot;An Introduction to Algebra&quot;, that book would have all its pages placed in &quot;Category:An Introduction to Algebra&quot;, and &quot;Category:An Introduction to Algebra&quot; would be placed in [[:Category:Algebra]].

:::I think trying to divide books by school level isn't going to work well. Keep in mind that people who use Wikibooks come from different parts of the world and have different backgrounds. At what age or school level a subject is taught at might be high school where you're at while being also being taught at the elementary level or college level somewhere else. Even in the same city at what point a subject is taught could just depend on the school or whether you attend a public school or a private school. In other words, eventually a book would be included in each category in order to better represent the world. I think instead an approach that depends on what you know already would work better because it doesn't depend on age or where you are in the world. Something like prerequisites or [[Wikibooks:Reading Levels|reading levels]] would work better. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:39, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

:: I guess people could help to depreciate bookshelves by ensuring there is subject page for every subject that there is currently a book on. Again though there is some difference between bookshelves and subject pages. Some bookshelves include two related subjects like &quot;Games and Athletics&quot; together, but with subjects these can be split apart into smaller and more specific subject pages like with [[Subject:Games]] and [[Subject:Athletic Games]]. Like with Thenub314's question above, if a bookshelves divides books into subsections the best approach is probably to create a new subject page that corresponds to each subsection rather than keeping books together on one subject page. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:39, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
== DropBox template not working? ==

I noticed this morning that a droptext (corr: DropBox) I use doesn't have the hide/show control (i.e., is showing without any control to hide, but should have been hidden by default with a control to show.). It's not just my usage. All the examples on [[Template:DropBox|the page describing the template]] is broken too. Can someone confirm this isn't just my browser? Thanks. --[[User:Az2008|Az2008]] ([[User talk:Az2008|talk]]) 21:59, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

:: I'm sorry, but I don't understand. I may have started the confusion by saying &quot;droptext.&quot; But, if you go to the link I provided ([[Template:DropBox|Template:DropBox]]), the examples are broken. There is no show/hide control. I've viewed it using IE and Firefox. That page has examples saying &quot;renders as:&quot; and there's no show/hide control.

And you see show/hide controls in the examples where it says &quot;renders as?&quot; I can change to Dropbox (b). It's not a problem. But, something changed because I use DropBox (B) and it had a show/hide control until yesterday (I just noticed it this morning). And, for me at least, the examples aren't rendering.

:No, its not a set notation. There are three conditional expressions involved:

:# Is N less than 1?
:# Is N greater than 3?
:# Is either of these true?

:However if the first condition is true the second condition doesn't get checked, because &quot;Is either of these true&quot; can already be determined to be true without needing to check the second condition.

Thanks for the response.  I use this while loop so select 1,2 or 3.  Let me show you my program.  It is simple.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main (int)
{
     float     Tax[3]={7.25, 7.5, 7.75};
     int       N = 0;
     
     printf(&quot;\n Welcome to Kudler Fine Foods checkout.\n&quot;);
     printf(&quot;\n Your purchase is $125.00\n&quot;);
     printf(&quot;\n\n\n Enter the number of the selected store and press the return (Enter) key:\n&quot;); 
     printf(&quot;\n For instance:\n&quot;);
     printf(&quot;\t\t press 1 for Del Mar\n&quot;);
     printf(&quot;\t\t press 2 for Encintas\n&quot;);
     printf(&quot;\t\t press 3 for La Jolla\n \n?&quot;);

     while ((N &lt; 1) || (N &gt; 3))
     { 
          scanf(&quot;%i&quot;, &amp;N ); 
           
          if ((N &lt; 1) || (N &gt; 3))
               printf (&quot;\n Enter the number associated to the store: &quot;);
     } 

     printf(&quot;\n\n\n\n The sales tax on your purchase at the selected store is $%.2f\n&quot; , 125*(Tax[N-1]/100));
     printf(&quot;\n\n\n\n Thank you for your purchase at Kudler Fine Foods.\n&quot;);     
     printf(&quot;\n\n\n Have a nice day!\n&quot;);
     getchar();
     
     return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, it is a simple program to display tax.  My books on C don't explain the  while and if ((N &lt; 1) || (N &gt; 3)) statements.  

I especially don't know what the two lines mean.  Which is still a question.

Can you enlighten me further?

== Mass deletions ==

Hi all,

We've been hard at work over at the [[Japanese]] wikibook, refactoring the layers of content. I think it's starting to pay off. As part of this effort, we've deleted gobs of duplicate content (we recently passed the 100 page mark!). That era is finally coming to a close, but I recently came across a bunch of character images: [[Special:PrefixIndex/File:Japanese]]. These all exist on Commons as well, I've made sure none of these are used here, and they are nowhere nearly as nice as the ones we now use from the [[commons:Commons:Stroke Order Project|Commons:Stroke Order Project]].

I'd like to try my hand at mass-deleting these by bot. [[Wikibooks:Bots]] permits this, but as it's a potentially disruptive action, I wanted to request comments from the community. I plan to use the [[meta:Using the python wikipediabot|pywikipedia]] framework which ran on [[w:User:SwiftBot|Wikipedia]] a long time ago to update links and deprecate outdated templates whose functionality I'd merged (linking to Wikibooks, think this was one of my first WB-related cleanup jobs). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:10, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

: There is no such policy (the closes thing would be [[Wikibooks:Be bold]]). Just consider whether the content would be more useful as seperate books. If you'll be cross-referencing a lot, keep it in one. If the book parts are independent or have a clear difference in audience, seperating them up could help. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:13, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

: Splinting a book project is commonly considered a fork if done to another (in project) namespace or outside location, if I'm getting your meaning of split correctly. Since the resulting parts of the split would probably constitute a derived work of the previous version of the book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:03, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

::: We have already discussed this. It all depends on how you see a book project and a fork. Each edit to a book automatically generates a revision to the previous version of the book, that revision could be directly considered a fork (since both version are still present on the project and should be assumed by default &quot;as published&quot; to a third party/location) then we have the situation of a split or a breakdown of a book in several parts, this can still be called a fork, the original version exists and derived works sharing parts of the old version were created (this is the situation Null Point is advancing) and then there a direct copy fallowed by a distinct evolution path that is more common on software forks. A Fork consists on the  branching of a root work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:05, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

:Splitting a larger book up into several non-overlapping smaller books is perfectly fine. In this case, it is a '''split''' and not a '''fork'''. A fork is when a book is copied in whole and allowed to develop along two completely different paths. Splits are acceptable and in some cases are actually recommended.

::I've read you essay (or opinion piece) and it is very supportive of book splits, I don't have nothing against that view but on very specif contexts. Books that are abandoned or stalled or lack o cohesive prose/structure as was the case of [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]]. this is very common on Wikibooks by the sole fact on how books are supposed to evolve and the very small number of works that get a long term commitment from contributors, so it will indubitably ease contribution and &quot;proper&quot; evolution in those cases (the majority of works). On the other hand there is a number of very extensive works that have a very good structure and a committed group of editors (ie: [[Nanotechnology]], [[Rhetoric and Composition]], [[Radiation Oncology]] and a few others) that wouldn't be expected to improve by a split, your text doesn't mention the positive factors of keeping very close related material in a single work. As a rule of thumb I agree with the recommendation to start small and avoid red links but I am not convinced that creating stubs from other books from the start is a good thing, as example of a evolutions contrary to that you propose I point out the OOP book that was created from the evolution of the C++ Programming book there are other books that with time could evolve from that very large book, for example a book about UML or the Boost Libraries and others. If done as you propose those subjects would have less visibility and on my view have a lesser chance to evolve as separated entities from the start, or be merely irrelevant as stubs...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:18, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

== Copyright Question ==

Hello, Wikibooks community. I am new to Wikibooks, and I have a question which I can't seem to locate the answer to in the Wikibook &quot;manual&quot;; If you have acquired knowledge from a physical textbook in &quot;real life&quot; (i.e. you have read a textbook in a class that you have taken) and have used the information (that is general knowledge about the topic (In my particular case, I have learned about the topic of Pantomime acting in the Theater category and had gotten some information that I would like to share with the Wikibooks community from a physical textbook made for Theater students) to help expand an existing Wikibook, is it necessary to credit the original author/ publishers of said book on the page that you create? If so, how would One go about crediting someone for work done.

== Common Mistakes - Improve the Help Sections ==

After a quick discussion with Jomegat we thought it might be useful to note some of the common &quot;mistakes&quot; that new contributors seem to make, with the aim of being able to improve the Help sections. This discussion was on my talk page, but would be better here  I think:

My thoughts on newcomer common mistakes:

*Images. Typical mistakes include:
**Assuming that content found on the internet on a &quot;public&quot; website is &quot;public domain&quot; - i.e., failing to comprehend that public domain is a specific legal status rather than a descriptive term.
**Uploading images with the author as &quot;self&quot; on the presumption that the &quot;author&quot; refers to who uploaded it rather than the original creator
**Not providing a proper source. For example, the source is described as &quot;the internet&quot; rather than the actual URL where the content was obtained
**Not attaching a license tag
**Attaching a license tag as if they are the author giving up rights rather than the license of the true author. For example, stating that they found it on a web site then attaching a CC attribution or GFDL license instead of the true license.
*Thinking this is Wikipedia. Typical mistakes include:
**Applying the WP manual of style. For example, converting headings from title case to sentence case
**Wikilinking everything
**Not piping links to WP so they appear as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Wikipedia Link]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
**Writing in an encyclopedic style instead of a book style. For example, slavishly applying the third person, not providing a book like introduction
*Not thinking &quot;book&quot;
**Most new &quot;books&quot; are actually a single page article with no possibility of expansion. Guidance along the lines of &quot;search for the subject you are interested in, then add new content / pages / modules to the existing books. If no book on your subject exists, before starting a new book consider whether your subject is sufficient to fill a whole book. Try writing the table of contents first to get the structure right... blah blah&quot; might be useful.

Jomegat then added &quot;Another common &quot;Image&quot; error I see is that people tend to upload images here instead of at the Commons (when the Commons would have been a better place)&quot;

Can I suggest we spend a while adding thoughts to the list then try and get consensus on where the Help should be expanded?

&lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:30, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

:Here's a few more:
::* Starting a book but not following the [[WB:NC|Naming convention]] (therefore making each page seem like a different book).
::* You mentioned sourcing but particularly problematic is people claiming fair use of images without a source or a rationale for the fair use.
::* I'm not really sure how many newcomers know what the GFDL is and its implications are (i.e. anyone can use for commercial purposes as long as they attribute you and allow others to do the same), which they should before conributing. It may be worth explaining this.
::* Moving pages without changing the link to them (although this isn't a huge deal if we have a bot to deal with double redirects).
::* Listing substantial pages as speedy delete candidates instead of listing them on [[WB:VFD|VFD]].

== Hello &amp; Editor status ==

I just got a welcome message suggesting I come by and introduce myself.  I have watched wikibooks for a long time, but until fairly recently I mostly contributed on Wikipedia.  (So I read the above section with some interest.)  But on a personal note I find this whole FlaggedRev's Editor status a bit discouraging.  I have been working hard and looking forward to the point when I am automatically upgraded to an editor, which hasn't happend yet.  I don't understand why because I think I should meet most of the criteria.  This has specifically prevented me from helping with checking through wikijunior books.  Also the criteria don't make a lot of sense to me.  (Why require the account to be 30 days old if the number of edit intervals requires the account to be 42 days old?, etc.)  Anyways I thought I would suggest the the current setup seems a bit too strict.  It might scare away actual editors away.  On a side note it seems a bad terminology to call the editors int he flagged revs extension editors.  Anyone can edit, a few people can publish the changes, and the reviewers can review.  I suggest publishers/reviewers, it fits with the whole book theme a bit better anyways.

On another separate random thought.  I have noticed the the micro-graphic that appears on my Firefox tabs and in the url bar are the old logo and not the new one.  Well, hope that was an interesting rant/introduction. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:48, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

: Hi Thenub314, and thanks for stopping by. Please feel free to put the reading rooms on your watchlist and join us in the discussions.
: There is general agreement that the FlaggedRevs criteria are poorly set. The extension is fairly new and there is a discussion at [[Wikibooks talk:FlaggedRevs Extension]] about modifying the criteria.
: The [[w:favicon]] is indeed out-dated and a [[bugzilla:17049|bug]] has been filed. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:25, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

== Hi New and need help ==

I am looking for an early period artist that drew a picture of a girl, could be charcoal, little girl was sitting on a big chair, as if she just got up there and had big eyes with a sad look in them, at least my interpretation.  I need this for homework assignment.  I don't have name of drawing or artist....sorry.  I also may have joined the wrong group, which I apologise, but this is a bit confusing.  Any help would be apreciated.  Who better than those who know alot about books.  Oh yeah, this came from an art book.

== Is a classroom a public or private place ==

I was browsing through the [[Special:Log/upload|upload log]] and came across [[:File:840.jpg]] which displays an adult and several children in what appears to be a classroom. [[commons:Commons:Photographs of identifiable people]] forbids photographs of &quot;identifiable people&quot; in places &quot;where the subject has a reasonable expectation of privacy&quot;. Commons has stricter media policies than we do (no fair use or non-commercial over there). Does the privacy clause also apply to Wikiboooks, and is a classroom a &quot;private place&quot;? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:16, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

: I think the answer to your question could depend on the school or on what laws apply. There could also be more to consider than just whether the subject has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Since the photo includes children, some places might require permission from the parents or guardian before a photograph can be taken and they might also have a say in how or for what purposes their children's photo can be used.
: Commons is only stricter about fair use. No Wikimedia project is suppose to allow non-commercial use now due to a WMF resolution awhile ago. NC images or media would need to meet fair-use requirements to be used on Wikibooks. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 09:49, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

:::Wow, this seems thorny! Is the school public or private? (Should that matter?) Do students/parents realize that pictures of the students may end up posted on the internet?  My opinion borders on unreasonably harsh (even to me), but my gut says that I would expect a reasonable amount of privacy when my daughter is at school.  I would not expect her to be photographed at school for the purposes of writing a book (commercial or otherwise).  Not to mention that the picture is being released into the public domain so it could be used in all sorts of way (commercial and artistic) that the parents of the children may never even have guessed.  I think the picture should probably go.  It is also my opinion that it is not so vital for the content that is written there. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:57, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: Schools generally don't allow the general public to come and go freely on school grounds (although the degree of security varies greatly), so, to my mind, the interior of a classroom clearly is not a public place; putting it another way, there is a &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; in a classroom.  (This might be a somewhat tougher call if the picture were taken in an outdoor playground; in that case, I suppose, one might need to know more about the venue.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:07, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

== Bad image source links ==

Some images form sites such as Flickr that have been uploaded to Wikibooks under acceptable licenses have bad/outdated links. Examples: [[:File:Punishment2.jpg]] (links to [http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=dunce+cap+page=2 here]) and [[:File:Corner.jpg]] (links to [http://www.flickr.com/photos/sirelroka/23481371701 here]). Now, the only thing that matters is that the image was free under that particular license when it was uploaded to Wikibooks. Even if the image is relicensed or taken off the source website, that doesn't change it's state here. The simple fact that the link goes dead is not enough to require us to deleted the image.

In the case of the two images mentioned above, however, they were both uploaded less than two weeks ago. The first link is rather evidently not a direct link, but the latter possibly a link to removed content. Does anyone have experience with this type of situation? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:38, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

: The easiest thing to do is to try searching for them yourself. Like I found rather quickly the [http://www.flickr.com/photos/somethingcheeky/2925000101/ first] and [http://www.flickr.com/photos/sirelroka/2348137170/in/set-72157603968057140/ second] image. Neither image can be used here. The first has all-rights reserved and the second image doesn't allow commercial use or derivatives to be made. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 09:25, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Rather than just clearing up the issue with these two, I'd be interested in the general case where the link is broken (or the license status has changed). Can we at some point do we just take the uploaders' word for it that things were OK in the past, or are we going to require uploaders to maintain sources and provide proof of past license status? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:01, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

::: Well if other information is present I would say try your best to fix the link based on available information, otherwise delete the work. I doubt a past license status would stand up to a court challenge without some kind of proof if the copyright holder demanded people stopped using their work. For that reason I think either the uploader has to provide proof of past license status should the license status change, or else the work has to be deleted if the change in license becomes incompatible with Wikibooks' requirements. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:23, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

Actually, I need all kinds of textbooks in the Spanish language. I'm finding it difficult to find them in paper, new, used, online, or anywhere. I would LOVE to see it as a Wikibook.

== &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Confused]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ==

I am a bit confused again about the category/bookshelf/subject distinction.  After editing a book I am interested in for a while today, I decided to take a break and categorize some uncategorized pages.  So, for example, if I look at [[Algebra]] At the bottom I see a list of &quot;Subjects&quot;.  These subjects really seem to be categories.  But is perhaps more confusing is the the actual subject page is not linked on this list (but the mathematics category is).  So... am I missing something? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:18, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

: The fact that you're confused means you're on the right track! ;-) The links down below are simple category links (like every categoriesed) page has. [[WB:MODULE|Modules]], however, label these as &quot;subjects&quot; which gets confusing because we also have [[Wikibooks:subject pages|subject pages]] which are separate from categories.
: This is one of the things that confused me as well and why I started the [[#Confusing subjects]] topic above where we discussed this to some extent. It would be nice if we could make this clearer. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:32, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Well I don't know who has such uber privileges, but clearly there is some way to configure the software.  For example someone installed flagged revisions, and decided to call these &quot;Modules&quot; (and I often wonder why? why not sections, or chapters, or pages?  but I digress)  Can't we submit a bug asking to rename these categories as categories instead of subjects? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:34, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

::: I believe one or all of Whiteknight, Mike.lifeguard and darklama have access to the configuration but I have no idea how that is decided. Darklama stated before that he thinks renaming that system message &quot;categories&quot; would be a step back. In my opinion it would be a useful temporary solution. Perhaps more stories of people being confused by this might help bring about some change. :-) --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:41, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: It is time I go back and re-read that thread.  I knew at the time there was something I was missing out on.  I agree that renaming the system message would seem to be the minimal temporary fix.  Why would this be a step back?  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:40, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

(unindent) Ok, after re-reading the thread I think I understand a bit better.  Clearly, what we want is an implementation that allows subjects instead of categories to appear at the bottom of the page.  
In the meantime, I think it doesn't help to have Categories appear as &quot;Subjects&quot; or to have an idea that &quot;the intent is to have people think of categories in those two namespaces in terms of what subject(s) a book covers.&quot; 

Here are my reasons.  First being a wiki, we should hope all our readers are also editors and catalogers, etc.  We don't want to assault readers with how the wiki works, but this seems to be a bit of misdirection.  Secondly to take the example that I first noticed that confused me, [[Algebra]], we are currently calling &quot;Books to be merged&quot; and &quot;Algebra textbook ''pages''&quot; subjects.  By no stretch of the imagination they are those concepts subjects.  The links there are useful, shouldn't go away, but they are really categories and not subjects. Also when I click on Mathematics I am immediately confronted a bold &quot;Category:Mathematics&quot; and I think, &quot;This isn't where I was trying to get to!&quot;  Until we find an implementation that doesn't list categories and list subjects, or something that lists both, we should change the bottom of the page to say &quot;Categories:&quot;.

== Editorial Question ==

I have been autopromoted to editor and I am still getting used to the tools.  I noticed that I do not seem to be able to give a rating of:
* composition:correct spelling and grammer
* accuracy: acceptable
* coverage: poor or unrated
Is there a reason for this?  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:18, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

: Only that combination, or any of these?
: By the way, which pages are you trying to review? There is some support for the view that Wikibookians shouldn't review their own work. I'm of the opinion that editors shouldn't be doing reviewing at all, and that be handled by people interested in reviewing other people's work. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:22, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

:: That particular combination, I haven't tried other combination where one of the choices is poor or unrated.  In this case I was looking at [[Real analysis/Rational Numbers]] whose page title is a misnomer, I have done some small editing there, but I fell this particular rating applies to applies to many pages I look at, and I thought I would in some small way warn the reader this is so incomplete it borders on not making any sense.

:: I am also a bit squimish about reviewing my own work, but I am not sure how many other people are working on books I am interested.  (My guess is very few to none) so sometimes I don't really see who else would do it. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:29, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

::: I just tried on the new [[Revision review testbook]] (I think it'll be a candidate for featured by the end of the year ;-) ) and it seems that you can't rate a page if one of the criteria is at the lowest level. I'm not sure if this is a feature or a bug. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:49, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
 
:::: I suppose my comment would be, if this is a feature why provide us with the option of poor at all.  Why not start off the reviewing process with simply the choice of acceptable?  I have some sympathy with the idea that if there is poor spelling/grammer, poor accuracy, poor coverage then perhaps we should fix it if we can.  But with a module this may take a lot of work, and we may just want to say what needs to be fixed.  I understand the images of 0-4 blocks also gives us a way to warn the reader about how rough a module/book is, but it seems tool could also give us a way to pass on more specific information.

Would it be possible to create a freeware category?

I looked around at

I don't see much easy-to-use software that is free. Software for average people not working in the field. I see a lot of middleware, programming languages, server stuff, other advanced tools, etc.. --[[User:Timeshifter|Timeshifter]] ([[User talk:Timeshifter|talk]]) 02:18, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

: Did you try [[:Category:Computer software]] or [[:Category:Open source software]]? Categories are typically created after a book on a subject has been created rather than before. If there is something particularly you feel is missing you could start a book on it yourself, or [[Wikibooks:Requested books|make a request]] and see if anyone else might be interested in starting one. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:32, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

::Thanks. I don't see much easy end-user stuff there in those categories either. Thanks for the link to [[Wikibooks:Requested books|make a request]]. It is almost impossible to navigate that page, though. The table of contents has been eliminated with &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; wikicode. 

::How do people help out on a book that has only a &quot;chapter&quot; or page? I mean how do they find the &quot;book&quot; if it is only categorized after it is written?

::: I don't mean after a book has been fully written if that is what you thought I meant. If you were to create a category on any project, the category would be empty until there are pages to put in the category. I mean that before you create the category there should be books to go in it first, even if those books might only have one chapter or page right now. The organization here might be unintuitive because Wikibooks has to deal with organizing both books and pages, while projects like Wikipedia can be looked at as a single book, and because Wikibooks is undergoing some changes in its organization right now. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:03, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

::::Ok, thanks again. If I am remembering correctly I believe I saw some pages that deal with some freeware. Can I start the category? 

::::About the changes in organization Wikibooks is undergoing. I suggest focussing on categorizing pages better. For example; [[The GIMP/Saving]] has some great charts of image file formats. That page would help a lot more people if it were categorized under [[:Category:Image formats]], and not just [[:Category:The GIMP]].

::::People do not often read nonfiction how-to books in order by chapter. When I go to the library to get such books I get several books on related topics, and skip around all over in all the books to learn what I find interesting at the moment. Those interests change even as I am skipping around. Categorizing the individual pages in multiple categories acts like a detailed book index, and allows people to skip around, just as at Wikipedia. 

::::The books also have a more general organization called tables of contents. But the real action for most people is the index at the back of a book. In Wikipedia the equivalent is the category system. This is now intuitive for most people coming here from Wikipedia. --[[User:Timeshifter|Timeshifter]] ([[User talk:Timeshifter|talk]]) 01:05, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

== [[Template:Navlist/Doc|Navlist]] ==

I'm hoping for a bit of community feedback on a package/family of templates I've been developing.  (This didn't seem to belong at the projects reading room, because it isn't meant to be restricted to any one book.)

Following up on an (offhand?) remark a while back that it would be great if navboxes were dynamic, the package allows the table of contents for a book to be kept on just one dedicated page (with a specific, but hopefully manageable, format), from which templates can be used to automatically generate the TOC for the book and top- and bottom-navboxes for each content module.  For lack of a better name I've been calling the one dedicated page a &quot;navlist&quot;.  Change the navlist, and the book's TOC and module navboxes are all automatically updated.  I'm actually using the package for the [[Conlang]] book.

For example &amp;mdash; Do people think this might be useful?  (Has someone already done this?)  Are there particular kinds of features, or changes of technique, that would make it more useful?  (There's a list on the [[Template talk:Navlist/Doc|documentation talk page]] of upgrades I already have in mind.) --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:03, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

: I've actually been contemplating doing something similar myself with javascript so that navigation boxes wouldn't have to be placed on every page. Just change one page in a book interpreted as a TOC and have navigational boxes added automatically to ever page listed using javascript. Ultimately I was thinking down the road if people liked the javascript navigation of trying to make a mediawiki extension to do it instead. I am a bit curious how you would do this using only templates though. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:14, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Ah, yes, whereas I tend to think of javascript as an 'extra' feature that everything should function properly without; I normally operate with javascript turned off myself (to minimize tracking and malware), only turning it on when I really want to use a site that refuses to work without it (and then I grumble about sites that aren't designed to degrade gracefully).  My package only uses {{tlx|Navlist/Top}} at the top of each module and {{tlx|Navlist/Bottom}} at the bottom, with no need for parameters on either &amp;mdash; and both of those transclude {{tlx|BookCat}}, so that hopefully they'd be the only such administrative markup needed on the modules.

:: This is a fairly vigorous exercise in templating (though I won't claim templates can't be stretched further &amp;mdash; I've gotten from this a pretty deep respect for the versatility of the template facility).  Each module entry on the navlist page is actually itself a template call to a template whose name is the null-named parameter, i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{{}}}| ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  The client templates like Navlist/Top, etc., call the navlist as a template, providing a null-named parameter that is the name of a template to call for each module; for example, to generate the TOC for the Conlang book, the Navlist/Contents template would call that book's navlist providing [[:Template:Navlist/Map/Contents|Navlist/Map/Contents]] as the null-named parameter:  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Conlang/Navlist|=Navlist/Map/Contents}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:11, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

== Language Courses Need Some Fixing ==

Wikibooks really needs to start working on its language courses; some are only 5 lessons long! How are you supposed to learn a language in that manner?

A few courses need to be completely rewritten from the ground up, such as [[Dutch]] and [[Mandarin]]. In Dutch, for some reason, a lot of the definitions are in [[Farsi]] and the Mandarin course is just unorganized. Some courses have a title page, others don't.

Furthermore, the curriculum for the languages should be similar. Of course, grammar would need to be adapted per language. It would be pointless to mention the accusative case in the Mandarin course, while it is absolutely necessary in [[Greek]] and [[German]].

All native speakers should pitch in as well to make audio files to accompany the lessons.

Abandon the vocabulary lists. Vocabulary can't be properly learned like a phone book.

The [[Catalan]] course is a great example of good planning - the lessons are already planned out in a manner that builds upon itself to achieve proficiency in the language. Now all we need is implementation :)

I am currently working on a separate, fully-featured [[Brazilian Portuguese]] course that I will later implement in Wikibooks. 

[[User:Theunixgeek|Theunixgeek]] ([[User talk:Theunixgeek|talk]]) 14:22, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

: I agree that the language books are in disarray. That said, Wikibooks is a forum for ''collaboration'' of authoring educational textbooks. It would be great if we could attract more contributors to this area, but we haven't in the past.
: It is neither productive, nor realistic to place a a requirement on curriculum. Not only can each book differ in terms of how the languages differ, books with differen approaches on a single language can also exist. There are, I believe, more than one book for both [[Subject:Spanish|Spanish]] and [[Subject:German|German]].
: See [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] for a book (in progress) with thoughts on this. It is currently piecework of old single-page books on the subjects and would benefit from more thoughts on the subject.
: It would be great to get native speakers to pitch in, but this is naturally ''English'' Wikibooks and most people here are English speakers. I've considered putting out requests for help on our language books. Just as how most Wikibookians on en: are pretty busy with their own little corner of Wikibooks, I'm not too hopeful that there would be too many takers.
: Please feel free to put whatever you have up at Wikibooks and work on it here. You might even get collaborators that way. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:36, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

: I agree the language books need a lot of work. I think the current approach for most of the languages books is more suitable for Wikiversity because the focus seems to be on teaching the language through short lessons, rather than intended as an in depth guides to learning languages. I think the language books need to be redesigned to build knowledge from one page to the next and with a more chapter-ordinated approach in mind. Maybe this could be partially done by using more descriptive pages than Lesson 1, Lesson 2, etc. I think a lot more elements need to be in English as well, like link names, section names, etc. as well. I only know English so these criticisms is more from a usability perspective. I would probably never use any of the language books as books in there current form because they don't seem like books to me. I doubt I would use them to learn another language because I think the use of another language right away in different elements of books would turn me off as being too advanced for me. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:54, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

:I'm looking very much forward to your fully-featured Brazilian Portuguese course! :) With regard to the existing courses, the typical pattern is: a new wikibookian comes and sees the bad state in which the language books are; the new wikibookian starts to change bits and pieces; the new wikibookian realizes that this is far too much work for a single person; the new wikibookian gives up, leaving the language books in an even worse state than before. This has happened before; thus, ''please'' don't work on multiple language books at the same time but improve (or create) one after another.

      <comment>/* Floating point Numbers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Assembly/Page}}
{{x86 Assembly/Stub}}

Strictly speaking, assembly has no predefined data types like higher-level programming languages. Any general purpose register can hold any sequence of two or four bytes, whether these bytes represent numbers, letters, or other data. In the same way, there are no concrete types assigned to blocks of memory – you can assign to them whatever value you like.

That said, one can group data in assembly into two categories: integer and floating point. While you could load a floating point value into a register and treat it like an integer, the results would be unexpected, so it is best to keep them separate.

== Integer ==

An integer represents a whole number, either positive or negative.  Under the 8086 architecture, it originally came in 8-bit and 16-bit sizes, which served the most basic operations.  Later, starting with the 80386&lt;!-- maybe 286, not sure --&gt;, the data bus was expanded to support 32-bit operations and thus allow operations on integers of that size.  The newest systems under the x86 architecture support 64-bit instructions; however, this requires a 64-bit operating system for optimal effect.

Some assembly instructions behave slightly differently in regards to the sign bit; as such, there is a minor distinction between signed and unsigned integers.

== Floating point Numbers ==

Floating point numbers are used to approximate the '''''real numbers''''' that usually contain digits before and after the decimal point (like π, 3.14159...). Unlike integers where the decimal point is understood to be '''after''' all digits, in floating point numbers the decimal ''floats'' anywhere in the sequence of digits. The precision of floating point numbers is limited and thus a number like π can only be represented approximately.

Originally, floating point was not part of the main processor, requiring the use of emulating software.  However, there were floating point coprocessors that allowed operations on this data-type, and starting with the 486DX, were integrated directly with the CPU.

As such, floating point operations are not necessarily compatible with all processors - if you need to perform this type of arithmetic, you may want to use a software library as a backup code path.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== vscanf, vfscanf, and vsscanf ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdarg&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int vscanf( const char *format, va_list arg_ptr );
int vfscanf( FILE *stream, const char *format, va_list arg_ptr );
int vsscanf( const char *buffer, const char *format, va_list arg_ptr );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

{{NOTE|These functions are not supported on all libraries.}}

These functions are very much like [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/scanf|scanf]](), [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/fscanf|fscanf]](), and [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/sscanf|sscanf]](). The difference is that the argument list is a pointer to a list of arguments. '''va_list''' is defined in cstdarg, and is also used by (Other Standard C Functions) [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/va_arg|va_arg]](). 

For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void error( char *fmt, ... ) {
  va_list args;
  va_start( args, fmt );
  fprintf( stderr, &quot;Error: &quot; );
  vfprintf( stderr, fmt, args );
  fprintf( stderr, &quot;\n&quot; );
  va_end( args );
  exit( 1 );
}   
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vscanf status==

Apparantly, I have conflicting reports on whether this is a standard function or not: IBM reports it's ANSI (http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iadthelp/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.etools.iseries.langref.doc/rzan5mst304.htm), the C-faq reports it's a C99 addition (http://c-faq.com/varargs/vscanf.html) and IIRC, C++ doesn't include everything from C99 just yet.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I chose to elaborate more one the topic of Carnivals as a sub-topic of the Rituals and Inversions section.  I felt as though the idea of the whole Carnival needed a little bit more explaining in the sense of what it exists for and how the standards for the celebrations can often differ throughout different religions and cultures.

== Answers to Gas Laws Questions ==

1.  The '''Ideal Gas Law''' accounts for chemical change.  The Combined Gas Law accounts for changes in pressure, volume, and temperature.  These are physical properties.  The Ideal Gas Law accounts for these properties along with molar mass.  Although molar mass is a physical property as well, the amount of molecules in an isolated gas would only change in the event of a chemical reaction.  Thus, the Ideal Gas Law can account for chemical reactions.

2. Density is mass divided by volume, and the number of moles equals the mass divided by molecular weight.  So: 
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; D = \frac{m}{V} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; PV = nRT &lt;/math&gt;

so

&lt;math&gt; \frac{n}{V} = \frac{P}{RT} &lt;/math&gt;

and 

&lt;math&gt; D = \frac{P \times (MW)}{RT}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Substituting and solving gives us a density of '''80.7 g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''.  Remember that hydrogen is diatomic, so its molecular mass is 2.0 g/mol.

3. Simply substitute into the Ideal Gas Law and solve.  '''0.144 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

4. Stoichometrically, one mole of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is needed for each mole of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.  We must determine the number of moles in 7.4L of hydrogen sulfide, then convert that number of moles into liters of hydrogen.  This is a two-step problem, both using the Ideal Gas Law.

Solving for moles of hydrogen sulfide: 0.330 mol

Solving for liters of hydrogen: '''7.39 L H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''

I'm editing this page and I'm leaving most things in place, but there are a few things that seem wrong or confusing, so I will remove them. I'm posting them here for the record though.
: ''ص (Saad) sounds exactly like the English word &quot;sod&quot;'' — What does? The name for the letter? That doesn't make sense because &quot;sod&quot; is not pharyngealized at all.
: ''In special circumstances it can be pronounced as a nasal &quot;n&quot;.'' — This makes no sense whatsoever, &quot;n&quot; is nasal already.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Interview with Dustin Kassman (Project.net)==

===Interview notes by Brian Rurik===

Dustin is the engineering manager for project.net.  Project.net is a software company that offers open-source as well as server-based project management software.  The company was started in early 2000 and is a subsidiary of ICS.  Project.net employs 10 engineers distributed around the world.

The project.net software has three main components, the schedule, the wiki, and the blog.  The schedule element is very similar to all other project management software packages.  It manages the tasks, deliverables, timeline, and resource for a project.  The wiki is an open area for project goals and definitions to be established and communicated.  Because everyone on the project has access to the wiki, it can be written and modified as needed to best suit the needs of the project team and stakeholders.  The blog is used to post progress updates and challenges.  Progress is posted by the team members working on the tasks assigned.  This allows the project manager to quickly assess the progress on each task and how each team member is contributing.

Project.net relies on online forums with the open source users and direct client contact with paying clients to receive customer feedback on their product.  The customers’ needs are written into customer stories.  These stories are used to define updates or improvements to their software.  Developments to the software are done in 4 week sprints.  The first three weeks are spent coding the next round of updates.  The final week is spent debugging and getting the update ready for release.  The content produced in each sprint is determined by the user stories created from customer feedback.

During the development sprint, the team uses the Project.net software to communicate progress and issues that arise.  Daily conferences are held using Skype.  This open dialogue allows larger issues to be resolved more quickly.  Also, by using their own product to aid in the projects and team communication, Project.net is able to more easily identify useful improvements without direct customer input.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome message ==

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:26, 18 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Exceptions ==

In the most basic sense, exceptions represent errors that are caused by your program. However, instead of crashing your program, exceptions have the opportunity to be caught and handled gracefully. Exceptions are said to be '''raised''' or '''thrown''', and special code blocks called '''handlers''' can '''catch''' them.

== Inheritance ==

Basic class systems enable data and the code routines that operate on that data to be bundled together in a logical way. However, there are more advanced features of most class systems that enable inheritance too, which allows classes to build upon one another. '''Inheritance''' is the ability for classes to form logical hierarchies. Perl 6 supports normal inheritance of classes and subclasses, but also supports special advanced features called '''mixins''', and '''roles'''. We are going to have to reserve some of the more difficult of these features for later chapters, but we will introduce them here.

=== Class Inheritance ===

== Roles and &lt;code&gt;does&lt;/code&gt; ==

== Mixins ==

== Parametric Roles ==</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Perl 6 Programming/Page}}

== Property Blocks ==

We've seen in the previous chapter the special &lt;code&gt;CATCH&lt;/code&gt; block that is used to handle exceptions thrown from the block that the &lt;code&gt;CATCH&lt;/code&gt; lives in. In addition to &lt;code&gt;CATCH&lt;/code&gt;, there are a number of other special '''property blocks''' that can be used to modify the behavior of the block they live in.

Property blocks are lexical in nature: They modify the behavior of the block they are defined in, and they do not effect outer scopes.

== NEXT and LAST Blocks ==

== PRE and POST Blocks ==

== KEEP and UNDO Blocks ==

== Order of Execution ==</text>

Check to make sure they actually make sense

=== Marie and Pierre Curie ===
Radioactivity

=== Henry Moseley ===
Protons and atomic numbers.  Proved physical existence of the atomic number using x-rays.

=== James Chadwick ===
Discovered the neutron.

== Reading in between the lines.  ==

Within this first presentations of concepts,I can see my understandings of universal structure ideas forming to become all truths. I had to hit myself in the head in three near fatal accidents to understand that this universe can be easily explained through the time space continuum, explaining that though there is a signature called matter, the residue left behind, or changing within, in its own signature self, dose have a pattern we know of, and that is also carried along, as we do see this in the differences in space observations of heat, gravity, and the bending  of light by the interactions of the mass and patterns of energy directly proportionate in changes as there is to chemical interactive outcomes as we have been classifying. This shows to me that we are right on the door step of the key to all science, respectively that it is, all been in writing for many years have we not understood this, are we scared to explore the slightest bit further than just watching? No guts no glory, yet who will pick up the heavenly element contained in the hottest of the stars in small quantity minus the stability by time heat and therefore a single (is it called proton?)piece when the fucker blows itself to hot to handle its other chemical structures. I don't pay to much attention to my environment on this planet yet now that I've been forced too by near death experiences. I see that we should all be on the same page if you can understand my wordings into truths of the universe in comparison of a quick overview of the short dissertation I had the pleasure of rating. Thank you for confirming that I have an easy-going understanding of the concept called science(or is it called psychology?)in the end result of your article on atomic structure.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intro==
A network of two resistors connected as shown

==Analysis==
: V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = I R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V_i}{R_1+R_2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_o = I R_2 = \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} V_i&lt;/math&gt;

==Formula==
:; &lt;math&gt;V_o = \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} V_i&lt;/math&gt;
 

==Choosing Value for R==
*  R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
::; R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 , V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 
::; R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; =  V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

* R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
::; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 , V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; 
::; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0

* R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
::; V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = ½ V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

::When R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , the output voltage is exactly halved of the input voltage

==Summary==
There is no gain for this network, since V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; never greater than V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; . 

This network can be used as Voltage Attenuator, Voltage Follower, Voltage Halved, or Voltage Ground

* When the value of R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, this network acts as Voltage Attenuator

* When the value of R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 or R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, this network acts as Voltage Ground

* When the value of R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 or R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, this network acts as Voltage Follower

* When the value of R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R then this network acts as Voltage Halved

::There is current flow from V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;


This network can be used as Controlled Current Voltage Comparator . 
* When the two voltage are the same no current flow . 
* When there is difference between the two voltages current is non zero and flow in the direction of high voltage to low volatage

This network can be used as Adjust Voltage Zero Current
:From V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, I = 0
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R_2}{R_2+R_1} = \frac{R_4}{R_4+R_3}&lt;/math&gt;

:R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; provided R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

This network can be used to turn current to zero by adjusting the value of R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equal to the value of R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; provided that R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

This network can be used as Resistance Indicator
:From &lt;math&gt;\frac{R_2}{R_2+R_1} = \frac{R_4}{R_4+R_3}&lt;/math&gt;
:Hence, &lt;math&gt;R_2 = R_4 \frac{R_2 + R_1}{R_4 + R_3}&lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
This network can be used as Controlled Current Voltage Comparator , Adjust Voltage Zero Current , Resistance Indicator

I'm editing this page and I'm leaving most things in place, but there are a few things that seem wrong or confusing, so I will remove them. I'm posting them here for the record though.
: In the section on Hžaa, the letters were mixed up. Also, Hžaa and Haa are technically both fricatives, the difference is place of articulation.
: ''It is NOT a voiced glottal stop (some books mistake it to be). '' — There's no such thing as a voiced glottal stop. The vocal equipment can't really do it.

Opening image size is large for aesthetic and educational purposes, large images offer detail and context and are the norm in Intro to cultural anth textbooks. 

Key terms that are currently Wikipedia links should be migrated to the [[Cultural_Anthropology/Glossary]] http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cultural_Anthropology/Glossary before they are deleted !!!

==Marriage==
I agree with both of you, it should be much more detailed on such a broad topic. There is a lot to say about marriage other than just marriage in itself. [[Hookl2]]

I agree that the person who wrote the marriage section should elaborate on what they mean about traditional/non traditional roles, shaping a child's standing. --[[User:Shearer2868|Shearer2868]] ([[User talk:Shearer2868|talk]]) 05:41, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I made edits to the marriage section to make the reading flow. However I think the person who wrote the marriage section should elaborate on what they mean about Traditional/non traditional roles, shaping a child's standing. It would help to make the last paragraph flow better. --[[User:CampbellKirs10|CampbellKirs10]] ([[User talk:CampbellKirs10|talk]]) 02:11, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I made some grammer edits to the divorce secion --[[User:Chandler5416|Chandler5416]]

Thanks for making the table of contents more organized, jimersj. [[User:Laurenhuff|Laurenhuff]] ([[User talk:Laurenhuff|talk]])

I added some information to the ghost marriage section. -Cami Marinella

I pointed out that monogamy is the most common practice in the United States. -Marissa Federspiel

I moved my part about divorce under the Divorce and Children section. [[User:Whitee7|Whitee7]] ([[User talk:Whitee7|talk]]) 04:35, 8 March 2009 

I tried to make the table on contents more organized.--[[User:Jimersj|Jimersj]] ([[User talk:Jimersj|talk]]) 22:25, 6 March 2009 (UTC)jimersj

I added more information to the arranged marriage section: “This however may be due to factors relating to the beliefs and traditions of the cultures in which arranged marriages are more common.” and  “Often the two parties will grow together, and learn to accommodate one another’s needs.”
-[[Hykal0597]]

I reviewed and evaulated the section on Polygamy. I found that the word &quot;woman&quot; was used when &quot;women&quot; should've been used. I also added some commas where I found approprate to make the flow better. I also added some clarification words and phrases to also help flow and make the idea more clear to those reading. [[User:Moore0762|Moore0762]] ([[User talk:Moore0762|talk]]) 03:04, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I expanded on the different types of monogamy instead of just marrital.  [[User:Healowl|Healowl]] ([[User talk:Healowl|talk]]) 03:19, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I moved the picture and words in the Trobriand Islands section to make it look cleaner. [[User:Whitee7|Whitee7]] ([[User talk:Whitee7|talk]])  04:55, 8 March 2009

I expanded on the ghost marriage section a bit. [[User:Yarwood1029|Yarwood1029]] ([[User talk:Yarwood1029|talk]]) 02:07, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I fleshed out and edited the arranged marriage section. [[User:Yarwood1029|Yarwood1029]] ([[User talk:Yarwood1029|talk]]) 01:56, 5 March 2009 (UTC)


I added an example to endogamy because I thought you were finished which is probably incorrect.... -Robert76

I added the two specific types of polygamy to the end of the definition to create better flow between it and the subsections.--[[User:Whitlev|Veronica Whitley]] ([[User talk:Whitlev|talk]]) 22:47, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

I would like to talk about how individualism is viewed and demostrated in cultures and how that relates to kinship and other relationships. I think I'm just going to add a new heading or subheading...I'm going to use examples cultures i have leard in lectures and my own personal experiences in my culture. I'm going to talk about in terms of kinship --[[User:Woolsey8578|Woolsey8578]] ([[User talk:Woolsey8578|talk]]) 17:44, 8 March 2009 (UTC)
 
I agree with the additions to the Polygamy definition. It does have a better flow and it connects to the next section which defines two types of Polygamy. - Ellie Shane

I added info about divorce/seperation among the Inuit in the marriage section. I think we need more information in that section.  We'll probably get more information in the next few days in lecture.-Ben Bothwell

I expanded the Matrilineal Decent and Patrilineal Decent as well added a few examples to exogamy and endogamy. -Robert76

I cleaned up the section on monogamy a bit and added a section on ghost marriage. §Ben Bothwell

I added another subheading in the Kinship section for types of kin to seperate out some of the information. i re-read and changed a few things so it would read easier. The addition in kinship on the specific types of it was a good in deapth addition.-Savannah Wilson

--Thanks, I was trying to figure out how to segue into that; a heading makes sense. Silly me.
I also added &quot;ambilinial descent&quot; to the types of descent section.-- [[User:Hamilton8152|Hamilton8152]] ([[User talk:Hamilton8152|talk]]) 19:47, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for not freaking out on me for taking Matrilineal and Patrilineal Descent! Robert76

I was wondering why someone wrote their username under the section that I wrote for Polygyny. If someone was trying to edit it, I didn't see any changes and I was confused. I someone could help clarify this. Thanks. [[User:Shane8364|Shane8634]] ([[User talk:Shane8634|talk]]) 16:27, 4 March 2009 (UTC) 

thanks whoever filled in stuff for arranged marriages. i liked the summary you gave at the end. In response to the post above mine, I think this is more or less a free for all.  Someone tried to &quot;claim&quot; a section that I started. If you want to write about a topic you just have to get there before somebody else does it seems.

I cleaned up the monogamy section and fixed some crucial spelling errors! I also rearranged it into a more organized format. [[User:Barrona|Barrona]] ([[User talk:Barrona|talk]]) 04:51, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a definition of serial monogamy to the section on monogamy. Katherine Jacobs [[User:Inkblossom|Inkblossom]] ([[User talk:Inkblossom|talk]]) 17:19, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

In the monogamy section, I reorganized the section and refined the wording a little because it seemed a little choppy in some parts. [[User:Loves|Loves]] ([[User talk:Loves|talk]]) 20:57, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I added the Greek etymology of the word Polygamy and also added a Wikipedia link to the word Polygamy.

I wikipedia linked Exogamy [[lancelot027|lancelot027]]

Somebody addded a first-hand account about living with divorce. Although this is good info, it is written in the first person while it should be in  third person.  There were also a few typos and whatnot.  I thought about editing it myself, but I thought that since it's such a personal subject I would just let you know so you can make the judgement call on how to edit it.

==== Monogamy and Polygamy ====
I talked a bit about serial monogamy and polygamy.  I thought this was important because anthropologist do use this term and they the two meanings can be confused.--[[User:Jimersj|Jimersj]] ([[User talk:Jimersj|talk]]) 22:33, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a bit more information --[[User:Petit00865229|Petit00865229]] ([[User talk:Petit00865229|talk]]) 02:30, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed the wording around for some sentences, as well as made a wiki. link to Joseph Smith. (Scar8719)

I added a link to mormons--[[User:White5975|White5975]] ([[User talk:White5975|talk]]) 00:24, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I made the Polygynous Families section read a little more smoothly and fixed some grammar.--[[User:Shearer2868|Shearer2868]] ([[User talk:Shearer2868|talk]]) 04:13, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link to the Wikipedia Monogamy page. Holmesa2

I added a link to Mormonism, so people could read up on what it is and find more information on this religion. I also added a link to Brigham Young, in the case that people do not know who he really is, how he came so influential in the Mormon religion, etc. I also cleaned up the wording on some of the sentences. [[User:Moormas2|Moormas2]] ([[User talk:Moormas2|talk]])

===examples of polygamy===
I added a bit more information to make the section regarding the Tiwi people clearer and easier to understand. --[[User:Petit00865229|Petit00865229]] ([[User talk:Petit00865229|talk]]) 03:49, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I added internal links to both the Bathurst and Melville Islands, as well as one to the Tiki people. I also cleared up some confusing wording in the section about Hugh Hefner. [[User:Anthronut12|Anthronut12]] ([[User talk:Anthronut12|talk]]) 23:12, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I also cleared up some confusion in the Hugh Hefner section. Added a link to playboy because not everyone may not he was the founder of the magazine. --[[User:Rohde2807|Rohde2807]] ([[User talk:Rohde2807|talk]]) 01:12, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I rewrote the second paragraph about polygamy in the United States because it was unclear and slightly biased. [[User:Harveya5|Harveya5]] ([[User talk:Harveya5|talk]]) 19:58, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I edited about children being involved in polygamy and that plays a key part in polygamy lifestyle.

I added a specific recent example of polygamy in the U.S. to make this section more detailed and give proof that this really does currently go on illegally. Although there was a lot more information i could've included about the situation in this example i chose not to because i wanted to focus on the polygamy going on as it is the main topic, and less on the child abuse and immorality that was occurring; i was trying to stay objective. [[User:Harts4|Harts4]] ([[User talk:Harts4|talk]]) 04:06, 2 May 2009 (UTC)Harts4

===endogamy===
there was a typo and endogamy was spelled wrong in the first section of this section so i corrected it ([[user:Alicia Troske|Alicia Troske]])

===Dowry===

I made a few changes to simplify the wording a little bit. And Deleted some that wasn't necessary. Saying &quot;that women marry into higher social ranking&quot; already implies &quot;than that in which they reside before marriage.&quot; I also added an internal link, since in the explanation the writer gives an example of Patrilocal Residence. --[[User:CampbellKirs10|CampbellKirs10]] ([[User talk:CampbellKirs10|talk]]) 03:28, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

===Sexualities Other than Heterosexuality===
I made Family Rights its own section and put in Cultural Examples of LGBT Relationships as its own section. [[User:Yarwood1029|Yarwood1029]] ([[User talk:Yarwood1029|talk]]) 01:03, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I moved the paragraph about same-sex marriage to fall under the marriage section instead. [[User:Yarwood1029|Yarwood1029]] ([[User talk:Yarwood1029|talk]]) 00:56, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed and expanded on the LGBT section under marriage and added a section about same sex marriages and their ability to raise children. - Morgan Johnston

Thanks for expanding on the LGBT section that I wrote; I think it covers more ground this way. [[User:Yarwood1029|Yarwood1029]] ([[User talk:Yarwood1029|talk]]) 00:46, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

In the starting of the LGBT section I noticed that the abbreviation LGBT wasn't ever spelled out in the article so I simply added the unabbreviated version of it. - ([[user:Lancelot027|lancelot027]])

Thanks! I didn't realize it hadn't been defined. [[User:Yarwood1029|Yarwood1029]] ([[User talk:Yarwood1029|talk]]) 01:08, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I added an example of polygamy within the US.[[User:Barrona|Barrona]] ([[User talk:Barrona|talk]]) 04:55, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

In the LGBT(Q) section, I added Questioning to the abbreviation because that encompasses more of the gay/transgender/transexual community that way. I also reworded a few things, and added information about Gay Straight Alliances.--[[User:Emily Pierce|Emily Pierce]] ([[User talk:Emily Pierce|talk]]) 00:53, 7 March 2009 (UTC) 

I added more to the endogamy section as well as re did the titles so they would show up as separate topics under the heading.--[[User:Rutha2|Rutha2]] ([[User talk:Rutha2|talk]]) 02:38, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for adding to the endogamy section. It seemed to clarify what I wanted to say simply and also added organization. K Gannon

I think that a more scientific definition of &quot;Ghost Marriage&quot; besides just an example would be better. [[User:Flintp3360|Flintp3360]] ([[User talk:Flintp3360|talk]]) 07:49, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I cleaned up a few word choice issues in the Same-Sex marriage section. [[User:Eck4068|Eck4068]] ([[User talk:Eck4068|talk]]) 22:47, 9 March 2009 (UTC) Eck4068

I added an internal link for LBTGQ, as well as adding a map of the state of gay marriage in the U.S. I also revised the section about which states recognize gay marriage and civil unions, and added a bit about California's Proposition 8. [[User:Anthronut12|Anthronut12]] ([[User talk:Anthronut12|talk]]) 23:40, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added an internal link to Gay-Straight Alliance. Holmesa2

==== Sexual Orientation ====
I added some definitions last night and then got interrupted before I could explain here. I also thought maybe labeling this section Sexual Orientation provides a more objective approach... I don't know if it is best to define various orientations in comparison to what is considered normal in the US, especially in an anthropological perspective.--[[User:Cavea|Cavea]] ([[User talk:Cavea|talk]]) 20:08, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I revised this section a bit more and expanded the concepts, I tried to make it flow better with the rest of the  paragraph. --[[User:Cavea|Cavea]] ([[User talk:Cavea|talk]]) 22:13, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the Ancient Greece section a bit.  I added some commas, semi-colons, and a few other grammatical errors. - Cami Marinella

Thanks! It definitely made the section easier to read. --[[User:Cavea|Cavea]] ([[User talk:Cavea|talk]]) 02:49, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I fixed the reference error on the Greek Mythology and added another vresion to the story of Apollo. Macdonm5[[User:Macdonm5|Macdonm5]] ([[User talk:Macdonm5|talk]]) 04:57, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

I added another type of polyandry about secondary marriage in the polygamous section --[[User:Mallahp|Mallahp]] ([[User talk:Mallahp|talk]]) 05:36, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I made some grammar edits the the Gay Marriage section --[[User:Chandler5416|Chandler5416]]
I edited some of the isogamy section to relate it more to relationships and not just information on the cellular level. [[User:Kiaraeanthro210|Kiaraeanthro210]] ([[User talk:Kiaraeanthro210|talk]])

Added the section on the Sambia. The library only had the one reference on the selves, and the section itself is not totally complete yet. Feel free to jump in here. 23:08, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added some links to Sambia for clarity. ([[User talk:JoelSheppard|JoelSheppard]])

I added some information to the gay adoption section, including an overturned law in Florida. I think it gives some information on what is going on legally with this issue. whiteb8[[User:Whiteb8|Whiteb8]] ([[User talk:Whiteb8|talk]]) 21:38, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

I added some information after the terms about how one may identify with one term but not anouther. I learned that little bit of information from my LGBT class at the begining of the year.[[User:Frenchl5|Frenchl5]] 
([[User talk:Frenchl5|talk]]) 18:49, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

Moved transgender to the bottom of the 'sexual orientation' list and added text clarifying that it is not actually a sexual orientation and that transgender people may identify as any sexual orientation.  [[User:Mortonr3|Mortonr3]] ([[User talk:Mortonr3|talk]]) 04:19, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I edited the part about Ancient Greece. I felt like it was important to state that men were allowed to take lovers outside the marriage but women weren't.

== Divorce ==

Fixed some statistics and added some more statistics [[User:Robert77|Robert77]] ([[User talk:Robert77|talk]]) 23:30, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

Changed from &quot;get out of marriage&quot; to &quot;terminate a marriage&quot; in order to sound more respectful [[User:Ladnerk|Ladnerk]] ([[User talk:Ladnerk|talk]]) 03:41, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

I added more personal information to make the understanding clearer and give it more substance. [[[User:Berryk3|Berryk3]] ([[User talk:Berryk3|talk]]) 02:20, 30 April 2009 (UTC)]

I fixed some grammatical errors, 'to' to 'too.' I also fixed some of the spacing such as there were spaces added then needed. Made it flow more and easier to read. [[User:Cschnuck|Cschnuck]] ([[User talk:Cschnuck|talk]]) 23:12, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

I revised where it talked about dysfunction in a family because it takes more than that to break up a family.

== Conflicting Views on Sexuality ==
I expanded some information on the Sexuality section and added my own experiences.[[User:Gebreks]] 9:39 pm, 5 March 2009&lt;br&gt;
I changed the picture of the rainbow flag in the same-sex marriage section, as the one that was there was a broken link and I couldn't fix it.  Hopefully the effect is pretty much the same. [[User:Stacycbreland|Stacycbreland]] ([[User talk:Stacycbreland|talk]])

==== Cultural Examples of LGBT Relationships ====
I just elaborated a bit on this intro to set up the topics that are written about. --[[User:Cavea|Cavea]] ([[User talk:Cavea|talk]]) 21:56, 7 March 2009 (UTC)


====Same-sex Marriage====
I corrected which states allow same sex marriages. It just needed to be updated. [[User:Juarezn|Juarezn]] ([[User talk:Juarezn|talk]]) 00:19, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

I added the new increase in Domestic Partnership rights for Washington State. [[User:Graebez|Graebez]] ([[User talk:Graebez|talk]]) 11:28, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

===Lesbianism in Mombasa===
I just corrected some grammar issues.([[user:Hinn9612|Hinn9612]])

===Puberty===
I added a link to the section on puberty.  The link goes to the Wikipedia article on the cultural aspects of menarche, which I felt was an important link that could supply more information on the subject of cultures and their responses to puberty.

Instead of making the link in a number next to the word you can make the link the actual word.  I can change the first one so you can see how that works.  [[User:Hinn9612|Hinn 9612]] ([[User talk:Hinn9612|talk]])

I specified the timing of onset. I thought providing more specific information could make the &quot;puberty&quot; section more accurate.  [[User:Leew3|Leew3]] ([[User talk:Leew3|talk]]) 08:20, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

===Inis Beag===

I edited one of your sentences to make it flow better. [[User:Petit00865229|Petit00865229]] ([[User talk:Petit00865229|talk]]) 03:19, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

===Reproduction===

Look up a source to support statement 'In Judaism as well there is a transition into adulthood that takes place at the age of thirteen (whether or not this is meant to be synchronized with puberty is unknown to me). For a boy this is called a Bar Mitzva and for a girl it's called a Bat Mitzva. For the individual it is one of the most important traditions in Judaism, rivaled only by marriage.
Under Puberty section --[[User:Paul James|Paul James]] ([[User talk:Paul James|talk]]) 22:16, 10 March 2010 (UTC)


I added to the information about rural Chinese people and premarital sex. The original author did not mention the use of western porn as a way to learn about sex. [[User:Shuberd|Shuberd]] ([[User talk:Shuberd|talk]]) 07:54, 4 June 2009 (UTC)



I added the universal breast feeding symbol to the section of Breast Feeding --[[User:Shearer2868|Shearer2868]] ([[User talk:Shearer2868|talk]]) 05:55, 10 March 2009 (UTC)
I added a section concerning breast feeding. 
I edited the Childbirth section.  I tried to clean up the spelling and grammar mistakes.  - Cami Marinella


I made some spelling corrections.  Also the very last sentence is incomplete (at the end of the section).  You might want to either delete it or finish the origional thouht you had. [[User:Hinn9612|Hinn9612]] ([[User talk:Hinn9612|talk]])

I bolded the topics in Differences in Birthing Practices, to make it easy to differentiate between the topics. [[user:wilber6199]] 8 March 2009

===Birthing===
I fixed a spelling error and added a few sentences about reasons for planning a C-section. This sub-topic seemed to be lacking information on probable reasoning for C-sections.[[User:Wildfim|Wildfim]] ([[User talk:Wildfim|talk]]) 07:12, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I changed the wording in the section about abortion because it sounded a little choppy and didn't flow smoothly. [[User:larson41|larson41]] ([[User talk:larson41|talk]]) 9:50, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

Put in a research example for breast-feeding and how it can be related to childhood obesity[[User:Dammara|Dammara]] ([[User talk:Dammara|talk]]) 03:12, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

I went in and changed the wording in the C-Section section because i felt that the use of slicing the mothers abdomen was a little harsh. [[User:Dammara|Dammara]] ([[User talk:Dammara|talk]]) 01:42, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

I changed the part about natural birth positions for the baby because it originally said that breech was the correct way for a baby to be born and that would be misleading. The safe way for a baby to be born is head first position. All better now! [[User:Reynola5|Reynola5]] ([[User talk:Reynola5|talk]]) 06:53, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

I added to the different types of reproduction for example A sexual that had been left out [[User:Healowl|Healowl]] ([[User talk:Healowl|talk]]) 03:23, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I made the four types of birth into bullet points so that they could be read better. [[User:Yarwood1029|Yarwood1029]] ([[User talk:Yarwood1029|talk]]) 01:29, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I added to the section on birthing.  There didn't seem to be much on any natural birthing processes so I added some about HypnoBirthing.  I was hoping that by adding this I could expand the views of birthing to something outside just the medical view of it. --hilla24

===Kinship===
I revised the part about kinship, because the example given was just from America and I thought that a view from somewhere else around the world would be beneficial as well. [[User:Lockera2|Lockera2]] ([[User talk:Lockera2|talk]]) 05:45, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I refined the paragraph on kinship.  I corrected grammatical errors and refined the flow of the information to make the paragraph easier to read.  I also reworded the ethnographic example so that it remained objective and could apply more throughout time and would not become outdated.

I am confused to why someone wrote their username under my entry about polygyny. I wrote that section and I don't know if someone was trying to claim it or not, but I am just very confused. I was wondering maybe if they were adding material but when I read the section, I noticed no changes that I wasn't already aware of. If someone could explain thanks. [[User:Shane8364|Shane8634]] ([[User talk:Shane8634|talk]]) 14:11, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

There was a broken link on the paragraph about Seperation among the Inuits. It looked like someone tried to link it to a photo of some sort but failed. §Ben Bothwell

I added a section about Arranged marriage but don't have that much info. Can someone help me fill in the gaps?

I really liked the paragraph on Individualism. I thought that it flowed well and I really liked how it was compared to other cultures. -Robert76

I agree with Robert. I really like that Individualism paragraph.However,I got rid of the “for example” at the end of the paragraph because it sounded redundant. I also fixed some grammatical errors. --[[User:Reeh8419|Reeh8419]] ([[User talk:Reeh8419|talk]]) 06:03, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

All i did was add the Japanese symbol for &quot;ie&quot; after you introduced the term. (家) [[user:Lancelot027|Lancelot027]]

Thanks for revising the section on Kinship, the re-wording of the ethnographic example makes much more sense. [[user:Wilson5745|Wilson5745]]

I edited the arranged marriage section. I fixed a few sentances so they would make more sense and I changed all the &quot;you&quot; in the modern with courtship type to make it more formal.[[user:Wilson5745|Wilson5745]]

Under a subtopic in Kinship, I fixed the links to divorce and remarriage so they take you to a wiki site with the deffinition of these terms. -kingman7089

I made some grammatical changes to improve the flow of the reading.[[User:Schwabk|Schwabk]] ([[User talk:Schwabk|talk]]) 00:16, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I added more information on how my mom has kept us working hard even when we were not the typical family. I would have liked there to be more representation of different families no the typical families, but the Latino/a families and how they may work different compared to a Chinese family, but more representation of different families. In my case I can talk about how the Latino/a families are really big and united. 
===Hypogamy===
I changed the grammar of the second sentence.-manderd

===Divorce in Islam===

I made grammar and punctuation edits to make the section flow better.

===Abortion===

I dont think there is any need to put the cost of the abortion in this section thought it is very interesting I think its misplaced --[[User:Knight9366|Knight9366]] ([[User talk:Knight9366|talk]]) 23:49, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

Okay, I just added a section about Abortion in the United States for the ethnographic requirement and I will transfer the information about cost there.  It makes more sense to put it there. Thanks for pointing that out. --[[User:Hinn9612|Hinn9612]]

I reviewed and edited the section on marriage, moved things around so that they had a better flow. [[User:Anderson2917|Anderson2917]] ([[User talk:Anderson2917|talk]]) 05:08, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I fixed a couple hyperlinks so they worked better. [[User:Petit00865229|Petit00865229]] ([[User talk:Petit00865229|talk]]) 03:32, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I just added a sentence or two in the abortion in America section, nothing big but just wanted to mention the pro-choice and pro-life sections. Also I just added a link to a news article at the bottom of the Abortion section, I thought it was interesting and gave good in sight on how other countries deal with abortion.--[[User:Grotjahn2975|Grotjahn2975]] ([[User talk:Grotjahn2975|talk]]) 22:33, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added the part to abortion in America dealing with the recent murder of a late term abortion doctor. I thought this was a good thing to add because it shows how controversial the issue still is and the length people are willing to go to prove their point. [[Uder:Kosarem|Kosarem]] (User talk: Kosarem|talk]])

===Geneology===
There were a lot of unnecessary spaces between sentences so I just claened that up a bit. Troeppl0637

=== Friendship ===
I added Friendship and Examples of Friendship. Holmesa2

I added a little to friends within the family section because western societies focus more on trying to get siblings to be friends, rather than trying to have them not be friends. Bushc</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Within this book the authors will address the following required North Carolina Standard Course of Study goals and objectives:

Competency Goal 1: The learner will conduct investigations to build an understanding of the interdependence of plants and animals
Objectives
*1.01 Describe and compare several common ecosystems (communities of organisms and their interaction with the environment).
*1.02 Identify and analyze the functions of organisms within the population of the ecosystem:
**Producers.
**Consumers.
**Decomposers.

*1.03 Explain why an ecosystem can support a variety of organisms.
*1.04 Discuss and determine the role of light, temperature, and soil composition in an ecosystem's capacity to support life.
*1.05 Determine the interaction of organisms within an ecosystem.
*1.06 Explain and evaluate some ways that humans affect ecosystems.
**Habitat reduction due to development.
**Pollutants.
**Increased nutrients.

*1.07 Determine how materials are recycled in nature.

Competency Goal 2: The learner will make observations and conduct investigations to build an understanding of landforms
Objectives
*2.01 Identify and analyze forces that cause change in landforms over time including.
**Water and Ice.
**Wind.
**Gravity.

*2.02 Investigate and discuss the role of the water cycle and how movement of water over and through the landscape helps shape land forms.
*2.03 Discuss and consider the wearing away and movement of rock and soil in erosion and its importance in forming:
**Canyons.
**Valleys.
**Meanders.
**Tributaries.

*2.04 Describe the deposition of eroded material and its importance in establishing landforms including:
**Deltas.
**Flood Plains.

*2.05 Discuss how the flow of water and the slope of the land affect erosion.
*2.06 Identify and use models, maps, and aerial photographs as ways of representing landforms.
*2.07 Discuss and analyze how humans influence erosion and deposition in local communities, including school grounds, as a result of:
**Clearing land.
**Planting vegetation.
**Building dams.

== Anthroposphere ==
The anthroposphere is one of the many &quot;spheres&quot; of the planet Earth. The Anthroposphere is the people on our Earth. The Earth is home for many humans. (Over 6 billion.)

The population on Earth increases at a dangerous rate. Imagine the construction workers and the architects all over the world who have to make and sell houses to most of them! That would be very stressful, don't you think? Well, soon we will out grow our Earth, and the world will be too small! Scientists are trying to make an alternative planet for us to live on when we outgrow our big, blue, mid-sized planet.

== Atmosphere ==


== Biosphere ==


== Cryosphere ==
The cryosphere is a very important part in the world. The cryosphere is all of the ice on planet Earth. The hydrosphere has a huge impact on the cryosphere, because without water, you can't have ice! Ice plays a huge role on our environment's health. The ice is home for many animals such as the penguin, the seal, the walrus, yes... and even the polar bear. The cryosphere has such a huge impact on our environment.

== Hydrosphere ==
Why is planet Earth nicknamed “The Blue Planet”? Well, that all has to do with the hydrosphere.

The hydrosphere is all the water on planet Earth. Not in the water bottles, but all the water in lakes, rivers, oceans, and all other water sources in the ground. The hydrosphere takes up 71% of Earth. The other 26% is land, or as we call them, continents. Then there is only 3% of fresh water on earth.

The water on Earth stays in its liquid state because of sun. We are close to the sun, so we have a good climate for water. Most of our water is not frozen, except near the North and South Poles.

On other planets where scientist “claimed” there is water on, is frozen. We are 3rd in line of the sun, so other planets are much colder than us, which makes Earth a perfect place to live at (temperature/climate-wise.)

== Lithosphere ==
Some people just say that the lithospere is the Earth crust, and it is, but it is more than that!

      <text xml:space="preserve">You are aware that those who claim to be insane are the ones who are more clear headed than the rest! I love the Harry Potter anime.  I also like your idea of teachers being good cop and bad cop.  Your right but I never thought of it like that. You have to care more about the end result than how much they like you.  It would be easy to fall into being the teacher everyone likes as opposed to the teacher that everyone respects.

      <comment>replaced &quot;effect&quot; by &quot;affect&quot; where required</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Financial Permaculture is an approach to economics that emphasizes personal investment and community development. For example, a person may choose to walk away from a full-time job at a multinational corporation in order to purchase or acquire through other means land, and then grow their own food. By quitting the job the person has an abundance of time to focus on gardening or other creative pursuits. Further, due to the change in lifestyle, organic food and lots of exercise, their health improves. Of course there will still be bills to pay, but now this individual is independent enough to take on a part-time job that is more meaningful to them. This change of behavior would promote happiness and a more stress free existence. Or maybe instead the person chooses to start their own business. Success here leads to a greater sense of self-confidence. This persons happiness becomes infective, as s/he goes through their day smiling and having a positive attitude. This person's attitude towards the community may then change. Perhaps now there is more opportunity for volunteering, or helping neighbors. Making life easier for others is repaid with other intangibles such as friends or favors. Through these actions the individual is wealthier than s/he was when working full-time.

There are as many examples of Financial Permaculture as there are people. The following is a list of other examples:
-Paying off debt.
-Anything promoting health and wellness (besides &quot;snake oil&quot;).
-Rather than saving money in a bank, entrusting it to gold/silver stored in a home safe.
-Saving money in tangible form other than precious metals (guns, ammo, seeds, livestock, food, medicine, land, buildings, etc).
-Practical education.
-Things which free up time, and make for less work or expense in the future. &quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&quot;

Another good example of Financial Permaculture would be giving up driving a car and instead riding a bike. By driving a car one impoverishes themselves through the costs of fuel, insurance, and maintenance. By buying a new car and taking on a loan, one further impoverishes themselves by selling their future time for paper money today. Even further poverty develops through stress from traffic and possible lack of exercise all leading to health complications. The only people who profit are the oil magnates and private banking interests.

By riding a bike instead this all changes. Rather than spending money on fuel, one can instead spend that money on healthy organic foods. No insurance and practically free maintenance clears up capital for investment elsewhere (maybe on a garden or a steer, goodbye &quot;fuel&quot; cost). The exercise leaves the person in good physical shape and much less stress filled. Riding a bicycle has the further effect of making the community less oil dependent, which means less war.

A further example of Financial Permaculture on the community scale is the Local Food Movement. By purchasing vegetables from local farmers, one receives a higher quality product, promoting health. The community, however, is who truly profits. More people buying local means more people growing local. This means greater community resilience in the event of a national emergency, such as the disruption of oil supplies from the Middle East. I would encourage everyone interested to read the article &quot;The Oil We Eat.&quot;

This is by no means an exhaustive discussion of Financial Permaculture, but I believe the examples provided should give the reader a general idea. One interested in Financial Permaculture should choose first to look at how their time and money is spent now, and how it can be freed up and reinvested in ways which make sense, not only financially, but also from the stand point of free time, health, and the enjoyability of one's day-to-day experience. Doing this tends to affect the individual on a level that makes sense financially, but also promotes further personal and community development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Social Stratification===
i edited the first two sentences. the first sentence was edited to flow more smoothly. the second sentence i used lower instead of low because it made sense that way. --[[User:Giovanni Del Valle|Giovanni Del Valle]] ([[User talk:Giovanni Del Valle|talk]]) 01:46, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added more concerning the social stratification concerning men over women, including societies which are matriarchal and differentiated between the two. --[[User:Aagardk|Aagardk]] ([[User talk:Aagardk|talk]]) 20:42, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

==Ascribed Status==
In the first sentence I added a coma to make the sentence read more clearly. [[Dachenhausen4129]]

I did a couple of changes to this section. First i put it as a separate section from the achieved status to emphasize the difference between the two. I also reorganized the subsections so that it is reflected in the table of contents. I included a formal definition of ascribed status for easier understanding.

I also added into the defination at the beginning, adding a ...&quot;for instance&quot; not sure if it's justifiable or not [[User:Craiga2|Craiga2]] ([[User talk:Craiga2|talk]])

I separated the written list of different status types into a bulleted list so that it is easier to read. [[User:Lianalewis|Lianalewis]] ([[User talk:Lianalewis|talk]]) 06:22, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed the wording of the first sentence to be more descriptive than the broad terms that were used prior to my edit. [[User:Forshaw8176|Forshaw8176]] ([[User talk:Forshaw8176|talk]]) 
===Race===
I added a definition of racism [[User:Healowl|Healowl]] ([[User talk:Healowl|talk]]) 03:34, 5 March 2009 (UTC)
I am responding to the additional information added to my section on race, under ascribed status.  Thank you to the person who added the supplementary information about racism.  I felt it was a good topic to add in, as it additionally defines the status of race anthropologically.
Yes, this helps to clarify the topic quite a bit!

I made the picture here bigger so you can see what it is :) [[User:Whitee7|Whitee7]] ([[User talk:Whitee7|talk]]) 05:12, 8 March 2009

I made a separate heading for Racism so that it was easier to identify within the Race category. Troeppl0637

I added a prominent example of racism to the page. I hope it helps clear the air about racism. [[User:Herrion2680|Herrion2680]] ([[User talk:Herrion2680|talk]]) 22:36, 8 March 2009


I fixed the tenses that were used. They were present and should have been past. --[[User:Robirds0244|Robirds0244]] ([[User talk:Robirds0244|talk]]) 08:36, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added some additional information to the definition of race. --[[User:Druckman4161|Druckman4161]] ([[User talk:Druckman4161|talk]]) 13:28, 9 March 2009

I changed a date in the racism section concerning Rosa Park's bus seat refusal. It said 1960's but it happened in 1955. [allumbt]

I went through and added some more indepth information on racism that includes discrimination and prejudice, as well as bringing light to the dominant and minority group aspects of racism. [[User:Robertf3|Robertf3]] ([[User talk:Robertf3|talk]]) 17:36, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

===Ethnicity===
I edited the quote in this section. The period was on the inside of the parenthesis but it belongs on the outside. --[[User:Maurer7597|Maurer7597]] ([[User talk:Maurer7597|talk]]) 04:15, 9 March 2009 (UTC) [[maurer7597]] melissa maurer

I refined the content of this section to make the information flow easier.  I also fixed some grammatical errors and maintained the objectivity of Wikibooks.  I added in an anchor in the article that connects to the bottom of the page where the references are located.  That way, the reader can click it and be transferred to the citation information.

I added a wikipedia link to ethnicity and made a few grammatical changes.

I changed the reference number from [5] to [6] to link to the proper reference.

Thank you very much, I was struggling a lot with the HTML aspect of this in terms of adding links and the anchors.&lt;br&gt;-Craig Gorder

I reorganized some of the content so that it flows better and added a couple things to the section. --[[User:Druckman4161|Druckman4161]] ([[User talk:Druckman4161|talk]]) 13:59, 9 March 2009

I changed the overall structure of the sentence and added further detail to the sentence. I did so because I felt the statement lacked some defining quality and details so I added what I thought would make it more correct.[[User:Underwk4|Underwk4]] ([[User talk:Underwk4|talk]]) 04:34, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

===Caste System===
i edited the grammar of this section. original opening sentence made hinduism a country. reworded awkward sentences. --[[User:Giovanni Del Valle|Giovanni Del Valle]] ([[User talk:Giovanni Del Valle|talk]]) 01:55, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I deleted the repetition of the Dalit picture because it was redundant. [[User:Douglas772727|Douglas772727]] ([[User talk:Douglas772727|talk]]) 07:22, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a wiki-link for caste system, added a few things, and changed sentence structure. (Scar8719)

I rearranged some sentences to allow better transitions and added a bit to the overall content --[[User:Druckman4161|Druckman4161]] ([[User talk:/Druckman4161|talk]]) 18:04, 9 March 2009

I fixed a few tense errors in this section.[[User:clue1478|clues1478]]

I fixed a few grammatical errors as well as restructured some sentences to make them easier to understand.--[[User:Marianna White|Marianna White]] ([[User talk:Marianna White|talk]]) 07:02, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I Changed the tense from present to past in the discussion about other countries practicing Caste-Systems. Many of the countries mentions no longer practice this system and is not apparent anymore in their culture.

===Religion===
I contirubted to this section by making some of the details about baptism more clear and accurate. [[User:adamsk9]]

I added this section because I thought it was an interesting way to look at ascribed status.  ([[User talk:Forshaw8176|talk]])

I added to this section because religion is also used as a power tool at the same time it is used in the separation of church and state. [[User:DycheJ|DycheJ]] ([[User talk:DycheJ|talk]]) 04:50, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

===Nation, Nationalities and Nation-State===
I made some minor spelling corrections, then cleaned up the sentence defining nationality so that the meaning was clearer.  [[User:Laurenhuff|Laurenhuff]] ([[User talk:Laurenhuff|talk]])

I changed the headings to bold so that they are easier to differentiate from the text. I also rearranged some sentences to make the content flow a little better. --[[User:Druckman4161|Druckman4161]] ([[User talk:Druckman4161|talk]])

===Gender Typing===


==Achieved Status==
I just made some minor detail and grammar changes, and I also thought that something should be mentioned about the contrast between achieved and ascribed status so I just put in a little bit about that.

I added a few details to the &quot;conflict&quot; section.

I just change around the wording so it flowed better.

I changed the wording at the end of the paragraph to say what achieved status is not, to therefore not describe a different section by saying what ascribed status is.  [[User:Forshaw8176|Forshaw8176]] ([[User talk:Forshaw8176|talk]])

I fixed some punctuation, capitalization, and spelling errors. I also added some more information about Chris Gardner and &lt;u&gt;The Pursuit of Happyness&lt;/u&gt;. --[[User:Robirds0244|Robirds0244]] ([[User talk:Robirds0244|talk]]) 08:29, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

===Education and Employment===
I added wiki-links for Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, and Master's degree.

===Income===
I tried to keep the general idea of this paragraph, but did change it a bit so it made more sense to me. You can change it back if you think it makes less sense.

I also deleted the last sentence because I don't think that people who already have money are generally less motivated than those that don't start out with a lot of money. People always want more!

I moved the wiki-link to within the first sentence of the paragraph to improve the appearance of this section.

===Cultural Example of Achieved Status===
i added some links to India's caste system classes --[[User:Giovanni Del Valle|Giovanni Del Valle]] ([[User talk:Giovanni Del Valle|talk]]) 01:36, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I tweaked your first sentence a little to flow a little better. I added a few words and changed &quot;yours&quot; to &quot;ones&quot; to help keep it third person. Minor I know, but I thought it helped the flow!

I thought that the caste system was really inflexible and people remain in the same caste they are born into for the rest of their lives? I know in the U.S people can work to attain higher social status, but I'm pretty sure the caste system does not work the same way. Do you have any sources to back this up? I deleted the part about working up to a new caste, sorry!

Isn't the caste system an example of ascribed status anyway? Maybe you could copy and paste it into that category so all your work isn't wasted?

The caste system is an example of ascribed status, as stated above... I added an example of achieved status in addition. Yeah, perhaps you could move it to the ascribed status section? It's good info, just in the wrong spot. --[[User:Druckman4161|Druckman4161]] ([[User talk:Druckman4161|talk]]) 18:30, 9 March 2009

Added the point that the actual odds of a person being able to work from lower class to upper class are very small [[User:Monierc|Monierc]] ([[User talk:Monierc|talk]]) 21:41, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

===Power intro===
I deleted the questions at the end of the paragraph because it seemed too text-bookie.

I made a few grammatical changes.

==== Types of Power ====
I added the word was to a sentence in &quot;money&quot; section, because the sentence did not make sense without it. --[[User:Giovanni Del Valle|Giovanni Del Valle]] ([[User talk:Giovanni Del Valle|talk]]) 01:29, 9 March 2009 (UTC) -looks good, thanks for the change.

I made some spelling corrections.  [[User:Laurenhuff|Laurenhuff]] ([[User talk:Laurenhuff|talk]])

I made a wiki-link to &quot;Harijan.&quot;


==== Social Class ====


==== Physical Force ====
I fixed some punctuation and helped fix a couple of run-on sentences. --[[User:Robirds0244|Robirds0244]] ([[User talk:Robirds0244|talk]]) 08:34, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Added some information about the new era of force in terms of a country, aka nuclear arsenal. --[[User:Graebez|Graebez]] ([[User talk:Graebez|talk]]) 10:15, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

==== Pursuasion ====


==== Fame ====

I added a link to  ethnographic. --[[User:White5975|White5975]] ([[User talk:White5975|talk]]) 00:09, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

==== Tradition ====
I changed the spacing for the title so it matched the rest of the section--[[User:White5975|White5975]] ([[User talk:White5975|talk]]) 00:00, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

There was a bit of punctuation that needed to be fixed, so I did that. --[[User:Robirds0244|Robirds0244]] ([[User talk:Robirds0244|talk]]) 08:36, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

===Power: Money===
I'm changing some minor grammar problems and sentence structure to make it more cohesive.[[User:Luna6045|Luna6045]] ([[User talk:Luna6045|talk]]) 04:50, 5 March 2009 (UTC)
I changed most of the paragraph that someone put up about money before me because it seemed very biased and it only came from a limited cultural perspective. I made it a bit more open and added some facts about money that I thought were interesting.
I changed some minor grammar errors.[[User:clue1478|clues1478]]
I changed some of the punctuation, sentence structure, and there were some repetive words that I took out and replaced with others. --[[User:Robirds0244|Robirds0244]] ([[User talk:Robirds0244|talk]]) 08:24, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

===Kinds of Social Power===
There were certain unnecessary commas that I took out but other than that it was really good!

I bolded the three subtopics to make it more catchy to the eye. [[user:wilber6199]]


The subsection about Interpersonal Power cites text sources (Weber 1968, Dahl 1957, Simon 1953...) which is great, but the full citations aren't listed on the page.  Can the original author supply those references? [[user:Rosen1347]]

===!Kung===
I changed a few awkward sentences.

I changed a spelling error, and put a link to the article, Eating Christmas in the Kalahari by Lee.--[[User:Ely4205|Ely4205 Contribution]] ([[User talk:Ely4205|talk]]) 00:20, 6 March 2009 (UTC)
===Types of Conflict===
I removed the name tags from the text that I contributed under Diplomatic and Economic Conflict.

I added a link to the definition of Shiite's --[[User:White5975|White5975]] ([[User talk:White5975|talk]]) 00:15, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I just cleaned up a tiny bit in the paragraph of Iraq. 

==Social Groups==
I added more to the broad definition of social groups. [[sandlij|sandlij]]
===Types of Political Organization===
I went back and added wiki-links to band society, tribe, and bushmen.

I added a little more information about chiefdoms and states.

===Work Groups and Cooperatives===
I added a better definition and a little information about cooperatives to help differentiate between them and work groups.  [[sandlij|sandlij]]

===Countercultural Groups===
I added the group of youth gangs and street gangs to the examples of counterculture groups and described them.  [[sandlij|sandlij]]

I added the Body Modification group in to the counterculture group section because I forgot to include them in an earlier post.   [[sandlij|sandlij]]

I removed the group of youth gangs and street gangs as they are more oriented towards carrying out organized crime for profits than for &quot;opposing the dominant form of a social system&quot; - that is, it seems less a culture oriented movement, as most counter culture groups are.

I added information of the counter culture of the 1960s and 1970s as it is one of the best known examples of counter culture, and added additional forms of body modification and body modification communities to the entry on body modification, making it more comprehensive.

[[User:Kelleya3|Kelleya3]] ([[User talk:Kelleya3|talk]]) 07:17, 1 May 2009 (UTC)kelleya3

===Self-Help Groups===
I made some grammatical and spelling corrections to this section. [[Clampittj|Clampittj]]

===Online Communities====
I added the online dating services, an interesting and significant group. [[Clampittj|Clampittj]]

===References===

      <comment>/* What is a handle? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This book discusses some ways of manipulating graphics in MATLAB.

== What is a handle? ==

All of the graphics capabilities explained thusfar are ways to generate plots without worrying much about the details. However, very often, you will want a plot that looks a very specific way. You can go into the GUI and change all of the settings every time, but this gets very tedious and wastes a lot of time. If you want a way to generate a plot that has the same look all the time, it is time to delve into the realm of '''handle graphics'''.

A '''handle''' is a floating-point scalar that points to a large list of different properties. Each element of a plot has its own properties, and its own handle. Handles are organized into a tree-structured hierarchy, starting from the handle for your monitor (named '''0''') and branching down to separate handles for '''children''' like axis labels, text annotations, error bars, and anything else that can go on a plot. Handles at all levels can be controlled interactively or adjusted programmatically, by changing the values of the handle properties using specific functions.

== Monitor properties: the '''0''' handle ==

Monitor properties are useful to know when designing graphic user interfaces. For example, you may want to check that a figure window fits inside the user's screen. In order to get a list of the properties of the screen, type:

 &gt;&gt; get(0)

To get a specific property, type

 &gt;&gt; get(0, 'propertyname');

See the documentation for a complete list of property names and what they mean.

== Figure handles ==

A '''figure''' is essentially a window that acts as a container for one or more plots, uicontrols, and so on. It is the second highest level object you can create

To create a figure, use the '''figure''' function like so:

 &gt;&gt; fhandle = figure;

This creates a new figure window and stores all the figure data in the variable ''fhandle''. You can also tell MATLAB to give the figure any number of properties at the same time as it's created using the syntax:

 &gt;&gt; fhandle = figure('Propertyname1', value1, 'Propertyname2', value2, ...);

See [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/figure_props.html the documentation &quot;figure properties&quot; page] for a list of valid property names for figures.

You can close a figure and destroy its handle programmatically by using the ''close'' function:

 &gt;&gt; close(fhandle);

{{NOTE|If you close the figure, either by using the close function OR by hitting the 'X', you can no longer access the data, and attempts to do so will result in an error. Closing a figure also destroys all the handles to the axes and annotations that depended on it.}}

=== The '''get''' and '''set''' functions ===

MATLAB allows you to get any property of a figure handle (or actually any type of graphics handle, including axes, line objects, text objects, and so on) by using the 'get' function in the following manner:

 &gt;&gt; h = figure;
 &gt;&gt; propvar = get(h, 'Propertyname');

will store the property with name 'Propertyname' in the variable ''propvar''. With the 'get' function you can only get one property at a time.

The ''set'' function allows you to set any number of properties of figures and other graphics handles. You can change as many properties as you want by calling the set function like this:

 &gt;&gt; set(h, 'Propname1', propval1, 'Propname2', propval2, ...);

You can also modify the same properties to the same values for any number of handles, if you simply create an array of handles first:

 &gt;&gt; handlevec(1) = figure;
 &gt;&gt; handlevec(2) = figure;
 &gt;&gt; set(handlevec, 'Name', 'Figure window')

will create two new figures and give them both the same title: 'Figure window'.

See the documentation for valid property names and values for figure properties.

=== gcf ===

Even if you don't assign a figure to a variable, you can still access it by using the internal MATLAB variable '''gcf'''. This is mostly for convenience, so you don't have to pass the figure handle from one function to another to make modifications. However, due to the warning below, you must be VERY careful in use of gcf so that you make sure you are modifying the correct figure in the case of multiple figure programs:

{{warning|The current figure is the last one to be modified, not necessarily the one that's open}}

To get a list of the current properties of the current figure, use the syntax:

 &gt;&gt; get(gcf)

You can also get or set a specific property by using:

 &gt;&gt; get(gcf, 'propertyname');
 &gt;&gt; set(gcf, 'propertyname', value);

See [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/figure_props.html the documentation &quot;figure property&quot; page] for valid figure property names and the format for their values.

=== Saving the contents of a figure ===

To save the entire contents of a figure, use the '''saveas''' function:

 &gt;&gt; saveas(fhandle, 'X.fig');

will save the contents of the figure with handle ''fhandle'' as X.fig. .fig files can be opened and edited manually later if desired, although it is often difficult to open them and re-edit them programmatically in a consistent manner.

You can also use the saveas function to save image formats such as .jpg, .tif, .bmp, .png, and so on.  The saveas function is essentially a command line version of the &quot;file --&gt; save as...&quot; option in the figure window itself, but there are some possible resolution differences. Using either of these two methods of saving a figure to a file, the quality of the resulting image is often insufficient for purposes such as inclusion in publications.

In the event that a high quality version of the figure is necessary, it is possible to use MATLAB's '''print''' function to print the figure to a vector format (such as Adobe Illustrator's format, obtained with the -dill flag) or to a raster format with a specified resolution (for example, using the two flags -dpng and -r300 would tell MATLAB to print the figure to a PNG file at 300dpi). See the documentation for that function [http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/print.html here] for more details on the supported output formats.

As an alternative to MATLAB's print function, SVG files can be obtained from many figures (not just simulink models) using the '''plot2svg''' function from MATLAB's contributor central (available [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7401 here]). SVG files can be edited using freeware tools such as Inkscape, and also can be opened in Illustrator.

== Axis handles ==

See [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/axes_props.html the documentation] for a list of valid axis properties and values of those properties.

=== gca ===

== Other types of handles ==

=== Text handles ===

=== uicontrols ===

      <comment>raising objection to relevance of material in article - amps</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amp talk only marginally relevant to harp amplification.'''  The stuff on mics in this article is great, but the stuff on amps is much more applicable to guitar amplification and seems to have been lifted wholesale from that sort of article.  A 2x 12&quot; combo is clearly NOT the best amp for harp; except for Magic Dick and Paul Butterfield, both of whom used Fender Twins, almost no legit blues harp pro uses that configuration.  Most prefer 4 x 10&quot; or smaller.  [[Special:Contributions/74.229.164.106|74.229.164.106]] ([[User talk:74.229.164.106|talk]]) 11:39, 19 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nominative is a grammatical case that tells us who or what performs the action in the sentence. It isn't hard to learn Nominative case, in fact, it has no endings nor sound changes. When you learn a new noun, it is actually already in Nominative.


*'''Dječak''' čita knjigu.

Translation: The '''boy''' reads a book.


Noun in bold, the boy, indicates Nominative, the one who (''or even what'') does the action.
More examples:


*'''Kiša''' pada. (''lit. Rain falls; tran. It is raining.'')

*'''Jedan''' od njih je otišao. (''One of them left.'')

*'''Najljepši''' je izabran. (''The most beautiful was chosen.'')

*'''Visok čovjek''' šeće ulicom. (''A tall man walks down the street.'')

==Plural form==
Croatian nouns are divided in three types: first or a-declination, second or e-declination and third or i-declination.
===First or a-declination===
&lt;b&gt;Most masculine&lt;/b&gt; nouns and &lt;b&gt;all neuter&lt;/b&gt; nouns belong to this declination.
Nominative plural of masculine nouns is created by adding -i to noun.
&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
glagol (m, verb) = glagol&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
plesač (m, dancer) = plesač&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nominative plural of neuter nouns is created by adding -a to noun.&lt;br&gt;
selo (n, village) = sel&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
nebo (n, sky) = neb&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;
====Masculine nouns====
=====Sound changes=====
1) &quot;a&quot; doesn't appears (&quot;&lt;b&gt;nepostojano a&lt;/b&gt;&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Example&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
p&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;s (dog) - ps&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2) &lt;b&gt;vocalization&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt; is replaced with &lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Example&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
anđeo (angel) - anđe&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3) &lt;b&gt;sibilarization&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;h&lt;/b&gt; in front of &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt; change to &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;z&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt; [k,g,h-&gt;c,z,s/_i])&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
junak (hero) - juna&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;c&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
vrag (devil) - vra&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;z&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
orah (walnut) - ora&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;s&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
4) &lt;b&gt;assimilation&lt;/b&gt; (because of &quot;nepostojano a&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Example&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
vrabac (sparrow) -&gt; vrab&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;c + i -&gt; vrab ci (b is voiced, but c is unvoiced, so b must be changed to unvoiced - this is p) -&gt; vra&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;p&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;c&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
5) because of &quot;nepostojano a&quot;, appears that one consonant dissapears (&quot;&lt;b&gt;gubljenje suglasnika&lt;/b&gt;&quot;):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Example&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
otac (father) -&gt; ot&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;c + i -&gt; ot ci (here will t disappear) -&gt; oc&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
More about sound changes will be in separated lessons.&lt;br&gt;
=====Other plural forms (short,long and shortened)=====
1) &lt;b&gt;short plural form&lt;/b&gt; - mostly disyllabic and polysyllabic words&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Example&lt;b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;

*but there are also some monosyllabic words that can use both short and long plural form (both forms are used)
**examples: brkovi/brci (brk - moustache), kraci/krakovi (krak - leg {like octopus's leg}), sni/snovi (san - dream), zvuci/zvukovi (zvuk - sound)
3) &lt;b&gt;shortened plural form&lt;/b&gt; - mostly words that in N. sg. ends with -in (nation, religious...)&lt;br&gt;

Hi MR. CVRO95,

I noticed your work on the [[Croatian]] wikibooks. You might also be interested in the [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] wikibook which has some tips. Happy editing! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:04, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

I like languauges, and I'll contribute as much as I can. Thanks for infos! [[User:MR.CRO95|MR.CRO95]] ([[User talk:MR.CRO95|talk]]) 21:25, 25 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: peice → piece, privilaging → privileging, of it's → of its, contruct → construct (2) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">: The purpose of this book is to be an instant, working glossary of terms for Fine Art students within Byam Shaw School of art, London. The language used in crits, tutorials, critical reviews, and interviews with artists shifts with usage, history and context. This glossary is in continuous flux, needing constant updates and information, in order to open up a conversation around these terms, to pin point what they mean at a particular moment, and within the context of university at Byam Shaw.

: The instant, decentralised medium of Wikibooks is the perfect arena to open up this dialog. A printed, bound book would not only be problematic to produce, but very difficult to sustain. Students might have less input and responsibility, and the whole project would be sluggish. By publishing this list on the internet, however, the language can be instantly documented by anyone who has an interest in the project, and easily accessed by students and staff. This medium allows for a comprehensive description of a word to be built by as many people as possible, as quickly as possible, and creates and elastic, diverse voice within the discourse. 

: Some suggested approaches to defining terms might include writing about the history of the word, and what context it was used in eg., in London, in a tutorial, or to describe a particular work. Another approach might be to write how the term was used, if it was used ironically, or how the word was interpreted and put into practice- the outcome or practical experience of the term. (Eg., how you interpreted someone telling you your work ought to be more 'process driven,' and what you produced around that idea.)  This is an experiment, and any contribution to the conversation is appreciated. Words are ephemeral, decentralized, irregular and evade definition. Creative or experimental writing for these articles is warmly welcomed.

: Below are some suggested terms that need clarifying and editing, but additional words are welcome. 



== Table of contents ==
=== Process ===
* Process, broadly, is a series of actions and reactions.
* It is a way of interacting with materials in a way that allows for an open conversation and an unknown outcome. 
* It is a working method. It is an approach to creating work.
* It is the opposite of thinking of an idea, and following the idea through with no alterations or amendments from conception to realization.
* Process means you make room in your work for ‘happy accidents’ or interruptions; for example, in printmaking, there is sometimes ‘found writing’ on a print plate where an accidental, or unintentional scratch has occurred.
* Process can be a way of generating ideas; for example, you might not know what to write about in your essay until you’ve begun to write it, and the words begin to suggest form and content.
* Process means sometimes getting de-railed or redirected by drips, holes, sloshes, scratches or tears, or the way paper moves, or how metal bends, or in what way cement dries; it means being open to what materials might suggest the next move to be, leaving the materials a generous amount of space to direct the work.
* Process is a way of encountering otherness, a way of dialoguing outside of oneself.

=== Collaborative ===
Collaboration is when two or more people work together; it is a sharing of ideas and expertise.

=== Filmic ===

Having the qualities or characteristics of a film; grainy; framed; emotive; a mechanical stillness.

=== Mawkish ===
Sentimental; in bad taste. An over simplified, melodramatic way of explaining reality; you might say the Jeremy Kyle show was mawkish, or Disney films.

=== Avant Garde ===
Ahead of the times.  Innovative.  Experimental.  A work that is described as being &quot;avant-garde&quot; is thought to be pushing the boundaries of a style or medium beyond the conventional and into a new, unexplored territory.

=== Frame (verb)===
To frame something is to construct a set of parameters in order to explore a concept. For example, you might frame a discussion about Francis Bacon in terms of the sacred and the profane, and use those terms as a way of interpreting the imagery and initiating a discussion. Framing gives ideas a motor by constructing a single viewpoint to focus on, and by privileging some content over other content as a means of systematising and extracting further content.

=== Crafty ===

Usually used as a criticism. Used to describe an object that relies heavily or exclusively on the language and materials of craft, or has a 'country' or 'traditional' or ' handmade' aesthetic. in the past, 'craft' has been a way of separating 'high art' and 'low art', terms coined during the Modernist period to distinguish supposedly superior or inferior aims and methods in art. But now, perhaps the criticism in the word 'craft' has shifted to imply chliched use of 'traditional' art school materials such as wood, plaster, printmaking, steel etc. and a lack of engagement with new media, technology and methods.

=== Figurative ===
=== The space in between ===

A felt tension between two objects in a space. Strtegically placed objects that have a relationship to one another. A bus trundling towards a burning cigarette on Shoreditch High Street at dusk.

=== Crit ===

=== Wider context ===

Creating work to engage with a wider context, as opposed to a subjective, individual context, an 'ivory tower', where art does not reference anything outside of itself. Considering a wider context for your work means looking around you and noticing what you look at and interact with every day, from East Enders and popular TV programs, to crisp packets. Newspapers, your walk to college, manufacturing methods, systems, commercials, jokes, where William Blake walked in London, pseudo nostalgic journals sold at Paperchase, cheap meat at Tesco, plasma TVs, the war in Iraq, all of these things are the wider context which you may want to place your art into. How you place your work- how you reference wider culture and practices- is what an art degree is for.

=== Dialog with materials ===
=== Dry ===
=== Bitty ===
Refers to undeveloped work. Scraps of thoughts, initial sketches or ideas, objects or images not pushed to their limit. A piece of art that hasn't filled out or reached it's full potential. Developing an idea fully can take years, and some times ' bits' is all you have. However, when an idea or object or image is 'bitty' it can be stretched a little more, experimented with a little more, and translated into different media a little more to make use of its full content.

=== Abstract ===
&gt;&gt; An abstract is a self-contained, short, and powerful statement that describes a larger work. Components vary according to discipline; an abstract of a social science or scientific work may contain the scope, purpose, results, and contents of the work. An abstract of a humanities work may contain the thesis, background, and conclusion of the larger work. An abstract is not a review, nor does it evaluate the work being abstracted. While it contains key words found in the larger work, the abstract is an original document rather than an excerpted passage.

&gt;&gt; Consider a concept without thinking of a specific example; consider abstractly or theoretically
pilfer: make off with belongings of others existing only in the mind; separated from embodiment; &quot;abstract words like `truth' and `justice'&quot;
Consider apart from a particular case or instance; &quot;Let's abstract away from this particular example&quot;
abstraction: a concept or idea not associated with any specific instance; &quot;he loved her only in the abstract--not in person&quot; not representing or imitating external reality or the objects of nature; &quot;a large abstract painting&quot;
Outline: a sketchy summary of the main points of an argument or theory dealing with a subject in the abstract without practical purpose or intention; &quot;abstract reasoning&quot;; &quot;abstract science&quot;

=== Formal ===
=== Ironic ===
=== Real ===
=== Authentic ===
=== Experiment === 
=== Indexical Trace ===
An indexical sign in semiotics is a physical sign that can bear no resemblance to the object that is signified, but that has a sensory feature that POINTS TO the signified, i.e., a smell, or a physical reaction such as a sign that is produced by the signified. For example, a weather vane (sign) being moved by the wind (signified), used to signify wind. Or squeaking floorboards might signify the presence of a person. The concept of an indexical trace was introduced in a series of lectures by Paul Kane at Camberwell College of arts in 2007 to describe the relationship between photography, traces of dust and existentialism. Photographs of Duchamp’s studio, photographed by Man Ray were shown; they were covered in dust, residues interested Duchamp as a sign to signify passing time, the ephemeral and even existence itself.

Hi Cyndi,

About Editing Wikitext; I note with surprise that somebody has contributed to the edits - I was beginning to think that I was the only one who could access it.

Perhaps you could advise on this point: After many mixed efforts at deciding whether to use 'which' or 'that' for the material, I must confess that I have changed the whole series of pages to 'that'. I hope that this is a correct form, since I notice that there have been some changes back to 'which'? A seemingly trivial point, but if it is inappropriate there are lots of other pages to do. What is the best choice for this type of material?

Another point; are all english speakers using the 'en' version of Wikibooks or is it the intention for strictly american english? Armchair (talk) 16:40, 8 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Object Oriented Programming ==
The purpose of an object oriented design is to allow the components to be as modular as possible.  In particular, when a new object type is created, it is expected that it should work without problem when placed in a different environment or new programming project.  The result of this is a reduced time spent in redevelopment. 

JavaScript uses objects to represent complex data types.  Some objects are created manually, while others are built-in to the language itself, like the &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; object. Objects are small structures of data with their own fields and functions to access or modify these fields.  A benefit of objects is that they use a &quot;black box&quot; approach where the internal variables are protected from most forms of outside interference.  This helps to prevent them from being altered by program code ''outside'' of the function or object, which provides a better integrity for the data itself.

Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript does not provide implicit protection levels on members of an object.  In particular, JavaScript uses a prototypical form of Objects, which can still inherit from parent classes, but is not a pure form of an object oriented language.  However, most design patterns can still apply within the language as long as there is no attempt to directly access the object's internal state (for example, using an object's methods.)

As with many other programming languages, objects in JavaScript have their fields and functions referenced by the dot ('''.''') between the object and field name.

== The &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; operator ==

The &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; operator creates a new instance of an object.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
item = new Object();
&lt;/source&gt;

== Object methods and fields ==

In JavaScript, objects are free form - they can be modified at run time to instantly create a new object or to create new fields or functions.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
money = new Object();
money.quarters = 10;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Object Literals ==
Objects can also be created using the object literal notation.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
money = {
    'quarters': 10
};
&lt;/source&gt;

As shown below, you can create a function for an object in the same manner.

== The &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; keyword ==

The &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; keyword is used as a reference to an object for which a method was called.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
money = {
    'quarters': 10,
    'addQuarters': function(amount) {
        this.quarters += amount;
    }
};
money.addQuarters(10);
&lt;/source&gt;

The total number of quarters would now be twenty.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{prognav|JavaScript|Object Oriented Programming|Inheritance}}

== Constructor ==

The &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; operator creates a new object based on a constructor and a prototype.  

The constructor is a function matching the name of the object, and, when called by the new operator, has the keyword &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; assigned to the newly created instance of the object.  The constructor can then assign any initial variables as required.

&lt;source lang=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;
function CoinObject()
{
    this.value = 0; 
}
slug = new CoinObject();  // Creates a &quot;slug&quot; - a valueless coin (slug.value = 0).
&lt;/source&gt;

The constructor can accept parameters - however, it is not possible to overload the constructors by having multiple functions with a different number of parameters.

== Prototypes ==

A prototype for an object is the set of auto-created fields and methods. It cannot operate by itself, and relies on an existing constructor.

When the object is created, the fields initialized in the prototype are copied to the newly created object. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;
function CoinObject()
{
    this.value = 0; 
}
CoinObject.prototype.diameter = 1;
slug = new CoinObject();  // A valueless coin (slug.value = 0), with diameter of 1 (slug.diameter = 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

Since the prototype of an object behaves as an object, you can use this to create inheritance.

== Dynamically extending objects ==

Objects within JavaScript are fully dynamic, and fields within an object can instantly be created if they do not already exist.  If, for example, you discover that you now need to keep track of the thickness in the coin example, you can simply add the new field to the prototype.

Changing the prototype of an object allows existing instances of the object to gain access to that change.

When a property value has been assigned on a new object, that property takes precedence over the prototype property from its ancestor. If you delete the property from the new object, the chain of inheritance takes you back to the property from the parent object.

To demonstrate, an Animal constructor is used to create an object, a dog called Spot. After that creation, the constructor has a gender property added to it. That gender property is also accessible from the object for Spot.

The gender property can be updated, and if the gender property is deleted from the dog object, it will retrieve the desired property from its ancestor instead, the Animal constructor.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function Animal (type, name) {
    this.type = type || 'No type';
    this.name = name  || 'No name';
}
var dog = new Animal('dog', 'Spot');

// Add gender to the Animal object
Animal.prototype.gender = 'unspecified';
// dog.gender is 'unspecified'

dog.gender = 'male';
// dog.gender is 'male';

delete(dog.gender);
// dog.gender is once again, 'unspecified'
&lt;/source&gt;

== Vandal notification ==

Thanks for the heads-up, i'm working on it as fast as i can. if you see anything that I miss, let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:16, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

: You're welcome. Let me know if I can help. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:18, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

::I've blocked the 3 accounts that were involved, and reverted all the page moves (so far). I'm going to delete all the obscene redirect pages that were created. The [[Human Physiology]] book got hit pretty hard by this wave of vandalism, so if you could just go check that all the pages and talk pages in that book aren't redirecting out into space, I would appreciate it. Other then that, it's just deleting pages at this point. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:20, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

::: Shit, I'd only just started when I was called out for a soccer match. I'll finish later today. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:31, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

== Chemical Synthesis VfD ==

I just wanted to reiterate a few points from the VfD discussion. I don't think that your book is poorly written, and I certainly don't think you are a bad contributor. Every logical part of me is saying that kids shouldnt be buying acetone at walmart and mixing up TATP in their basements. The way the text is written now, I worry that's the kind of activity that we are encouraging: amateurs and children, at home, boiling hydrogen peroxide on the stove. All I want is to see this material directed at a better target audience, so that we aren't encouraging joe-schmoe at home to try this proceedure himself. I hope you didn't take any of my comments too personally. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:16, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

: Thanks for letting me know. I never thought your comments harsh or unfair. I recognise your viewpoint and motives as sincere and well intended.
: We seem to differ, not so much on the ends, but on the means. I agree that kids shouldn't be mixing explosives in their basements. I disagree, however, that it is our place to ensure that. My mother tounge, Icelandic, has a word, óviti, which literally means un-knower and is used for young children who can't take care of themselves due to their limited mental ability (you keep detergents away from them &amp;mdash; those mentally retarded can also be óviti). Basically someone who needs you to think for them.
: I see the question being whether it is our task to think for un-knowers. This should be discussed and made a policy.
: Just to state it, my oppinion is that it should be left to their parents to deceide which rules to instill in their children. Some parents will fail at their task. Some children may not have learnt to understand the dangers expressed on the synthesis pages even before you put up disclamers. I don't think this is a reason enough for us to padd every sharp corner. Not either that I want to lay broken bottles everywhere.
: There are many faces underlying my motivation. Once we've got the voting stuff sorted out, we should put up something on censoring. At that point, I'll try to make a detailed point based on theory and application. If you'd like to engage in a warm-up discussion/debate, I'd be glad to do so.
: Again, thanks for the note. I sincerely appreciate the polite gesture. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:33, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

== Spelling ==

Sorry about the spelling. Old habits are hard to break, and I find when I am typing quickly, I tend to spell certain words in the same, incorrect way over and over again. One day, when I get around to writing my &quot;spell check bot&quot; (if ever), hopefully I won't have that problem as much. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:37, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== PDF for relativity - thanks ==

Thanks for fixing this so quickly! [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:21, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

: You're welcome! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:49, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

== Vfd, [[Template:Danger]] ==

I created the template {{tl|Danger}} as a risk warning that you can use on any page that contains dangerous information (like everything that involves making explosives). I'm going to declare the VfD over now, because there is clearly no consensus to delete. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:39, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

== Interwiki stuff ==

Yup, I'm game... though I'm a little busy working on books (and wp articles) for a while. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:44, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

== &lt;s&gt;2&lt;/s&gt; 3 things you might be interested in ==

[[Wikibooks:Request for enabling special:import]] -- helps make interwiki page moves more efficient.

[[Talk:Cookbook#Wikipedia_templates]] -- more about specialised interwiki link templates on wikipedia.

--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:11, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

I almost forgot: would you have a look at [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for wikipedians]]? I'm hoping to link to that from a new welcome template. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:42, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

: Thanks! These are, indeed, all interesting. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 09:24, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

== Can you please make a comment also... txs ==

We are discussing GFDL and wikibooks and book communities, rights and what nots in &quot;[[:User_talk:Panic2k4#call_for_comment|Call for comments]]&quot; a future policy could and probably should emerge from that discussion in not only to clarify things to all users.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:18, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

: I've added my comments at [[User talk:Panic2k4#Comments by User:Swift]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 09:28, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

== [[WB:PAG]] ==

I agree with your proposal that the guideline/policy categories should be merged. A few months back, wikibooks didn't have any guideline categories at all, and I had to create them along with the necessary templates. It seems I didn't do the most efficient job at it. 

Definately make that change, I dont have time today to help out with it, but i should be around later tonight briefly, and much of the morning tomorrow to help out with it. Not that you need alot of help to do this, but it's polite to offer. :) --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:29, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

: ''Replied on [[User talk:Whiteknight#Policy and guideline categories]]'' --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 22:40, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

== Vandal ==

No problem, can you report him to the local vandal management process page? I'm only familiar with enwiki and enwikiversity. --[[User:Draicone|Draicone]] 07:10, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

:''Replied on [[User Talk:Draicone#Good job catching the vandal]]'' --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 07:49, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

== [[WB:RFA]] ==

I have nominated you for adminship, at [[WB:RFA]]. If you accept (and I hope you do), the community will vote on the measure. Pending concensus, you could be made into a sysop here. I have nominated you because you are very helpful, and you are active in the realm of policy. Your request to have an admin alter the text of certain protected policies has demonstrated to me that you have a particular need for adminship tools. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:23, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

: Thanks. Both for the compliment and sign of confidence. I had no great aspirations to gain adminship, as you, Johnny, Withinfocus and Derbeth are generally ready and able to help out, but if I can help shoulder the burden, I'm only too happy to do so. Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:05, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

== OOps... need one more vote ==

One more thing to smooth out the transwiki process... [[Wikibooks:Request_for_enabling_special:import#Additional_request]]. We're asking that &quot;Transwiki:&quot; be given namespace status so we can import to it directly. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:57, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

: Done. Thanks for organizing this! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:19, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

== Moving proposal discussion ==

You can certainly feel free to move the discussion to a more appropriate location. Just make sure that you post a link at staff lounge to the new discussion. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:51, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
:''Replied on [[User talk:Whiteknight#Moving comments]]'' --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:19, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

== [[Help:Textbook planning]] ==

That page is defunct, and I dont think it currently serves a purpose anymore. Perhaps it can just be deleted? I have written an essay on the subject: [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide]] that I find very helpful (and that I hope other users do too). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:46, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

: I was going to have a look at it. If you say it is defunct and has little purpose anymore, then sure, we can consider deleting it. We should have a look at which pages link to it and such before, though. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 18:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

::Alot of old pages like this, especially pages that were from the beginning of the project when such matters were still being worked out have been kept for historical reasons. Perhaps we should put a note on it that says &quot;This discussion is really friggen old, and don't edit/read it&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Profanity]] ==

I would like to move this one to [[Wikibooks:Obscenity]] (changing the words in the text as well), and then move this one to {{tl|policy}} ASAP. Do you have any objections? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:22, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

:''Replied on [[Wikibooks talk:Profanity#Not use profanity?]]'' --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:50, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

I just wanted to send you a quick message, and see if you have come to some kind of conclusion on this matter? Since you and I are the only ones talking about this policy, I think once we can reach agreement, we can move this to {{tl|policy}}. I think we both can agree that wikibooks ''does need some kind of policy on inappropriate language'', and I would like to see one implemented sooner rather then later. 
To recap: I am against using the word ''offensive'', but I would be willing to change to the word ''obscene'' (or even a combination of &quot;offensive/profane/obscene&quot; in the text, so long as &quot;offensive&quot; is clearly defined). If &quot;obscene&quot; is alright with you, I think we should move forward with it. I would like to point out that wikipedia does use the word [[w:Wikipedia:Profanity|Profanity]] in their policy on the matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:40, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

: Sorry, I went off wiki for a bit. I'm currently semi-travelling and the next leap is coming up I'll probably be away again for a week at the beginning of November.
: I'll concede on &quot;offensive&quot; but haven't settled on &quot;profane&quot;/&quot;obscene&quot;. I just realized that I should have long ago asked my father and my dear friend Des, the two best sources on the English language that I've come across. I'll go do so now. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:47, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

::If you know somebody who can pick their way through all these tricky words, then definately ask them. I'm not in any hurry. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

:: I just found some following the category link you posted on Darklama's talk page. I'll have a look at this later. Thanks, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 13:05, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

You may wish to take a look at [[User:Darklama/Templates/lastedit]] and [[User:Darklama/Templates/lastedit/test]]. lastedit is the bases for any countdown templates. [[User:Darklama/Templates/query]] makes use of it and you can see that it works because [[User:Darklama/Templates/query/test]] shows up in SD, which took it 7 days to do. My testing phase to see if the month bit of it work properly is hopefully almost over, lastedit counts by days, weeks or months and its almost been a month now. As you can probably guess by its name lastedit counts from the last time a page was edited rather then the time someone added the template. SB_Johnny seems to prefer it that way, because its more forgiving. Counting from when the template was added is also possible, using subst, you would need to do a double subst using some tricks to make the subst within the template not happen until the second subst is used with its inclusion on a page. From what I've seen this is done by using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;includeonly&gt;subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;VARIABLE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; inside the template and then using subst on the template.

:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; doesn't like numbers as big as whats in the timestamps for some reason, thats what my first attempt to give it a go involved.

Another idea that I will probably try to do because of a template that SB_Johnny pointed out to me (that really didn't do as one hoped for), is a generic template that takes a number and determens if that number of days has passed. So that some templates don't require a fixed timeframe in which to be triggered. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:34, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the cleaning today - as (almost) the only RC patroller I get to see (&amp; review) most stuff and to have some action is great.  I noticed you were on the deletion policy talk page too.  It may be that you see some things more my way than others.  For me VfD is a process that needs completing not just starting.  It doesn't worry me to &quot;close&quot; the obvious debates (after all if anyone disagrees they can say so).  I do not want WB to be too like WP but they close the debate in a rather more determined fashion with a border and background colour to the section - any views? It would make it look more &quot;closed&quot; if it's going to sit there for a week (or so) until someone deletes it (or can/should it be arc'd quicker?). I may just try it next time and see what anyone says. Scuse the ramble!

(cross posted to Swift &amp; Darklama as it follows yesterday's chat and I'm not sure who is watching who.  Whoever answers first gets to decide where the chat takes place!)

Continuing to think about this.  I am a real believer that categories should be correctly cat'd in an alpha fashion (not book name) - usually.  However for maintenance type stuff time seems more interesting/important (and seems to be the case for some of this on WP)?  For example I marked a few copyvios about a month ago - '''if''' they are copyvios they should be gone by now.  Equally following threads on RC I found a couple of pages that were marked for &quot;cleanup&quot; a year ago.  The problem is that you would only find out by going to the page.

== Great minds! ==

I came on the morning intending to &quot;nudge&quot; [[Imamat or Successorship After the Last Prophet of God]] and you beat me to it!  I know it ain't policy but would a compromise be to &quot;close&quot; it for a month say but very definitely re-open and deal with it then (telling the author that)?  May not be &quot;policy&quot; but I'm learning policy is what we make it as we go along. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:22, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
:Policy on the hoof!  Could create another &quot;close&quot; - ''close pending review''.  That would cover this one and - when you get to it - [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#Future_2]]?

== VfD organisation ==

Just to repeat it I do agree with you about the need to change the method here.  I've just found that a number of VfD were not closed properly earlier this year and they still have tags on.  Trying to find the arc is a nightmare but is what I shall do next (I don't think one was even listed properly!).  Anyway I guess it might be best just to change the system - discussions on doing things here seem to end up in long grass quite often - let me know if I can help? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:16, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

: I'm just catching up on the past week and will then hopefully start looking into this. Basically not a lot needs to be done. As I mentioned on the VfD, we should start archiving to sub-pages and then introduce methods to sub-page-fying current VfDs.
: Any help is well appreciated. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:03, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
::Might have some time over the weekend (depending on weather).  If you make a start I'll happily follow.  Just trying to tidy up the pages still with VfD tags that are not current at present so maybe I'll try and finish the job off first and then work with you.  --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:17, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

== Welcome Usage ==

Why the changes? Some people were having trouble understanding when to use it and I thought it was helpful to include. I also don't see the need for subst for welcome. If the template is changed in the future, I think users who have it on their page will benifit from it reflecting that change rather then staying fixed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:54, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

: Oh, sorry. I was just writing you a message.
: I didn't think I cut anything out of the actual meat of the text. I apologise if I did. My intent was to make the general outline quick and to the point.
: I don't see the need for the welcome template contents to be updated as users generally don't need it once they learn how to use Wikibooks and where to find information.
: Some interesting information is available at [[w:Wikipedia:Template_substitution]] (I'm not imposing WP practice on WB, but drawing on the vast WP knowledge for use here).
: It was asked on [[Template talk:Welcome]] why the template wasn't being substituted and at the time no-one argued that it shouldn't be. I'm all for discussing wheter it should.

:: I was trying to keep the when to use it as short as possible, but felt it needed to be clear that its a judgement call and to give a brief example. I prefer quick and to the point myself, so I can appreciate that, but not if its at the cost of information. Some users may find it useful as a handy reference to keep around to click on whenever they forget something. Having it all in one place, allows users to goto their talk page and click the link they want when they need it rather then seeking it out and they don't have to worry about keeping it up to date. It also allows welcomers to see whose recently been welcomed at a glance through the &quot;what links here&quot; link. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:41, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

::: OK, I personally prefer the principle-approach rather than the example one (the &quot;some seasoned&quot; and &quot;while other&quot; annoys my particularly) but will agree that users may find it more appealing.
::: &quot;''Some users may find it useful as a handy reference to keep around''&quot;. True, but my feeling is that they more often put up such links on their user pages. the links they find useful on their user pages. It would be difficult to gauge the actual attitude of new users since they don't seem to frequent the Staff Lounge. If you actually know something or have a good idea about what users want that would be great to know. I myself have nothing concrete to offer. &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt;
::: Those who don't frequent Wikibooks and might not bother creating their own set of useful links, a radical changing of the template (not unlikely if they are gone long) might be confusing.
::: &quot;''It also allows welcomers to see whose recently been welcomed''&quot;. Why would one want to? &lt;del&gt;This could also be easily done with categories.&lt;/del&gt; --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 23:18, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
:::: Regarding categories: no they of course don't allow time ordering yet. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 23:19, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: I have nothing concrete to offer as far as what users might find helpful or unhelpful either. Those who don't frequent Wikibooks might be caught offguard by any changes in policies or practises that are reflected in the welcome template, but which don't show up for them because of the use of subst. Infrequent users have more to be confused about than a sudden change in the welcome message. A category would probably be better actually then relying on &quot;what links here&quot;. I wasn't talking about sorting by time, by recently welcomed I meant by comparing the &quot;what links here&quot; list with the new user log. &quot;Why would one want to?&quot; To find out what users need to be welcomed I'd imagine.
::::: I read WP:TS to try to see what advantages might be mentioned for using subst in these sort of cases, since at least half my reasoning is due to lack of seeing any advantages to using subst for this. I didn't agree with reasons like &quot;Lots of links&quot;, &quot;might be deleted in the future&quot;, etc. There are no tricks being used in the template that require the use of subst. So I think &quot;why bother?&quot; and focus on the possible advantages to not doing so, including the smaller ones like &quot;less typing&quot; and &quot;less to delete later&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:09, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

== More VfD organising stuff ==

OK - I can see what you are doing and it looks fine.  I'll try one or two myself (how did you get the edit summary so good?), don't worry about deleting, as long as I get my admin rights soon I'll need something to practice on!  So filing away is fine - the problem then is retrieval.  To me we need some kind of cat/index by time (just year?) and then an alpha cat (using SUBPAGENAME)?  Don't worry about actually doing the pages (set the cat up maybe or give me a clue) - so long as I can get a page with the pages on I'll do a run with AWB which will be far more efficient - but what did you have in mind?  All the best --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:19, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

:I don't see why sorting by date/time would be needed for VfDs if they are sorted by name. All a person should need to know is if a book or page has been brough up for deletion before. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:32, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

::I'm guessing you are watching this DL so for you &amp; Swift the time aspect is twofold.  My wish for organisation makes me want to be able to access data from at least two directions (OK that's me!).

Also I think I should be able to put the archive tag on the pages with the cats using AWB.

== Unsolved archive page ==

Could you possibly clarify the Unsolved archive page? Your last edit of that page states it to be some sort of a &quot;historical archive&quot;. Did this come from Unsolved problems in biology? Why was it put here (without any history)

The origin of the &quot;Unsolved archive&quot; page is described at the top of the &quot;Unsolved problems in biology&quot; page. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 05:05, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

&quot;I'd like to ask you not to require your collegues to be perceptive.&quot; &lt;-- I agree that it is fruitless to expect wiki colleagues to be perceptive. Far too often irony goes unnoticed. I suppose the wikilawyers will eventually get around to making the use of irony a bannable offense. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 04:40, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

== Template (mis)use ==

Hi Swift,

I didn't know I there was a better way to include content on multiple pages other than with templates.  Thanks for the tip.  I thought I had seen something on doing that a long time ago, but when I needed it, I couldn't find the info on how to do it.  And I ''did'' do a pretty thorough search! I finally mistakenly concluded that I must have been thinking about templates, so I went with that.  I have probably fifty such templates that I used for first aid and camping too.  Luckily, I prefixed them all with &quot;Ay&quot; when I created them, so maybe that will make them easier for me to find (though some of them should remain templates as they take arguments and are used throughout my book).  I think what you are suggesting is that I should make them &quot;regular&quot; pages, and then include them in all the place they are used.  Thanks again.

Hi Swift... I brought up the scrapbook idea on the SL, seems to be fairly well-recieved so far.

== Speedy ==

Fair comment - I kind of expected someone to pull me up on it.  There was &quot;effectively&quot; no content would be my view and I see a sense in which it could have been speedy'd anyway.  Other side of the coin - I just rescued Arran from speedy.  I'd prefer VfD to focus on ones that are real judgment ones that to have the page cluttered so anyone passing might find it less easy to read.  I'll happily get it out of the bin if you feel strongly about it - let me know --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:04, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the note.  The rendering seems to be OK now.  Your reference to what s meant by &quot;fixed&quot; seems to be what I had in mind.  That block of text, with &quot;Mumfum&quot; appearing at the top was staying in one place even as I scrolled through the page to get to the completely unrelated matter that interested me.  But for this I would never have touched it.  It could very well be that the problem arose from the vandalism which was reversed, but had not yet had the linkages in the servers caught up.

(I think you've dealt with such issues in the past) How does one cite an article in wikipedia as the original source of a wikibook page?

I just wanted to give you a final heads-up, I'm going to make this page an official policy now. The discussion has stagnated, and besides your objection on the vocabulary used, there is no opposition to the wording. If we want to change the word &quot;profanity&quot; to something else in the future, we certainly can, but if we don't want to change the wording, at least we have some kind of policy on the books concerning this type of content. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:44, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== Author pages and authors vs. contributors ==

In regard to [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Panic2k4#Comments_by_User:Swift your comments] and my unresolved dispute with darklama, I have posted some definitions that I would like your input on please see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks_talk:Ownership#GFDL_and_Authorship GFDL and Authorship] on the WB:OWN discussion page, the concept of authors vs contributors, txs. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:44, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

Feel free to change or evolve your comments on my talk page on those subjects also. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:29, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

: Sorry for not responding, Panic. [[WB:OWN]] and [[WB:WIW]]/[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable|Unstable]] have been undergoing massive discussion and, due to lack of time to commit to this, I've stayed out &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt;. I'll try to have a look today (GMT), but cannot guarantee anything. If you would like me to look at anything in particular, let me know and I'd be more likely to find time to squeeze it in. Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:24, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Well I'll restrain myself in providing you a filter to the discussion :), I could be accused in being partial to my cause, humm, if you are using firefox get Context Highlight ( http://www.cusser.net/extensions/contexthighlight/ ) and mark the relevant words (author and contributor) and select the ones with have more hits for reading... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 08:33, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Kkawohl ==

There is a VfD for another &quot;work&quot; in progress at present [[Transcendentalist Theology]].  I was wondering whether to list this one too (if you read the other you may see why) - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:12, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

== Culling on a talk page? ==

I saw that you removed some discussion on [[Talk:Star Trek Starships]].  While I agree with your sentiment, removing something like the comment made there as if it was never put on there in the first place, when clearly you aren't the person who made the comment, just smacks as almost a vandal attack.

This is also something that is likely to drive away new contributors to Wikibooks.

Please be careful and try to consider that the suggestion to make a coffee table book was something made in good faith.  At least try to explain why it might be a bad idea, instead of treating the user like they never existed in the first place.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:28, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

: Could you please [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Star_Trek_Starships&amp;diff=706780&amp;oldid=706569 look again]. I only added a header, an {{tl|unsigned2}} and replied to the comment. Thanks for the concern and bringing this to my attention, though. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::I'm sorry about that.  Something must have happened when I was looking at it.... I really don't know what happened here.  I swear that I saw the content without the contribution by the anonymous user, which is why I rolled back your &quot;contribution&quot;.  Maybe I'm getting very old here and starting to see things by spending far too much time on Wikibooks......  Really, I am very sorry about this.  I thought you had deleted the remark, and I swear my browser didn't display your reply, although the official history doesn't seem to show that.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:36, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::: No problem. Thanks for re-rolling back. And I really do mean that I appreciate your actions and that you brought it to my attention. It is good to know that we aren't allowed to get away with what you saw happen. Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 17:14, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Sorry to intrude, but I saw the same thing it seems [[User:Swift]] edit took a bit of time to become active, I saw it also as a simple discard of an non signed post about a image book, I thought that [[User:Swift]] had  simply deleted the post as &quot;nonsense&quot;, I noticed [[User:Robert Horning]] post about the problem wile I was posting the other message here, it was a not a very small interval. No one seems to be at fault it was only a infrastructural problem :). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:19, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== That VfD ==

High on my list for today - sort of wish I hadn't put it on hold but I'm trying not to be deletionist - catch it/you later --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:32, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
:I'm at work so this will be a bit brief.  I ''think'' I'll close it as delete as nothing has happened to it (sadly to a point). I see the previous votes as standing and so Xania is in a real minority (equally on WP I was reading that advice is the &quot;quality of argument rather than the mere numerical votes&quot; should be considered (??).

::Dealt with - I hope you agree reasonably and with rationally.  Enjoy the travels and come back refreshed.  I'm not keen on asking but should you wish to help me out I only require 1 further vote for checkuser - should you not wish to I assure you it will not worry me.  I have sent you mail BTW.

Hum - well I put a message on the page asking for it to be left and asked for opinions on the admin noticeboard (you'll see it in the history).  However another admin ignored the message and deleted it - sorry.

==About==
Lighting is one of the easiest areas to analyze in terms of energy efficiency. However, it is often one of the most overlooked areas too.
Types of Lighting
Please goto the subpage for more info: Types of Bulbs

==Energy Audit Procedure==
===Before the Audit===
Before you leave to go on the audit there are some things you need to take care of.

   1. Make sure that you have a &quot;Lighting Inventory Sheet&quot;
   2. Make sure that the light sensor in the tool crib is ready to go (Batteries work)
   3. Read the Walk through Checklist Lighting section

==Data Collection==
Every plant has lights and it will be your job to collect the necessary data to write a report.  Here are the basic things to look for and collect.

   1. Have a plant worker walk you around the plant and help you fill out the &quot;Lighting Inventory Sheet&quot;
   2. Have the plant worker help you make estimates as to how long the lights are on
   3. If you are not sure what types of lights you are looking at do one of the following
         1. Ask the worker
         2. If they don't know ask to see the storage room were spares are kept and use data off them
         3. If all else fails take a guess (Use the color table in the walk through to guess type)
   4. Make sure to take note of lighting on in low use areas (Warehouses, sheds, bathrooms)

==Data Entry==
Use the lighting inventory excel sheet at the bottom of the page to enter all the data you have collected from the plant visit.

   1. Rename sheet (&quot;Lighting Inv &amp; Rec ###.xls&quot;) and replace the ### with report number
   2. Once all the data is entered in the inventory tab you can use the tabs at the bottom of the sheet(Fix 1) to calculate savings.
   3. Choose which type of recommendation you would like to implement located at the top of the page. Once you have entered the fixture information, including code, quantity and hours of operation, the rest of the information will fill itself in. The fixture codes are available on the tab titled 'Fixtures'. Using the information from your inventory, you should be able to find the code easily. The most important information the spreadsheet calculates is the savings column.  The values here give you an idea of how worthwhile your AR is.
   4. Once you have filled out all of the (Fix #) sheets, click the Summary tab. The Summary tab adds up all of the individual sheets demand, energy, materials and labor savings.  This table will be very useful when writing your AR.

==Editing the Lighting Workbook==
To enter a new fixture into the lighting workbook you will need to enter the information on the fixture into the fixture worksheet.

   1. Create a unique code for the new fixture and its ballasts and/or lamps (if not already in the Ballast/lamp worksheets)
   2. Fill out any Ballast/lamp information
   3. Copy the Ballast/Lamp codes into the appropriate boxes on the Fixture worksheet.
   4. To get watts/Lamp use the code  VLOOKUP($I126,Lamps!$A$4:$G$79,4,FALSE) and change 126 to the row your entry is in and 79 to whatever row the corresponding lamp is in.
   5. Enter all other Fixture information
   6. To get the inventory to recognize the Fixture code you need to go to the Formulas tab and Select Name Manager.  This will bring up a box with a list of Names, scroll down until you find Fixture table then change the scope to include your new entry.
   7. To get the Recommendations to recognize the lamps/ballasts you need to do the same as above for Lamps Table and Ballasts Table.

==Report Writing==
In order to start your AR, first follow the general instructions under the 'Starting an AR Write-up' section.  Now that you have a basic outline of your AR, you can begin. Old AR's are the most important resource when writing. Most reports have a lighting AR, and it is highly likely that you will be able to find one very similar to what you're working on. You can use the old AR as an outline, that when filled in with your information and edited to your specifications, will work as a good draft. Make sure your Calculation Methodology is as concise as possible and very easy to follow. That way, the client can easily replicate your calculations with other data if needed. Add subheadings when dealing with multiple savings/implementation costs.  After your calculation methodology is finished, copy all of the (Fix #) sheets from Excel into the end of the section. Make sure your Persuasive is concise and includes a picture related to your AR.
Appendix Writing
The lighting appendix is similar in all reports.  It includes important definitions for the client to easily follow the report followed by the lighting inventory you created in the excel spreadsheet.  An example of definitions is attached at the bottom of this web page.

==Past Energy Savings Opportunities==
* 542 - AR &quot;Upgrade 400W Metal Halides T5 High Output&quot;
* 543 - AR &quot;Upgrade Lighting and add Motion Sensors&quot;

==Tutorials==
* Include 'How Tos' on software (i.e. MotorMaster, system specific stuff), uploaded spreadsheets, etc. Using CamStudio would be good for this

                                Have you ever had a bad feeling about something, like a 
                               bird or a cat or a tree? Mabye a person? A place? It's
                                because your aura is broken by the evilforce or presence.
                               If that question appealed to you read on to find out what 
                                that presence was.

                                                 So I see it appealed to you. The Opaque 
                                 is every dark corner you see ever shadow, he is the very
                                thing that helps the evil stay hidden, helps the murderers
                                 murder. He is also known as The Dark or (in greek)θανατικός.</text>

|R is very particular about what can be contained in a vector. All the elements need to be of the same type, an moreover must be either types of number&lt;ref&gt;There are actually 3 types of allowed numbers: &quot;normal&quot; numbers, complex numbers, and simple integers. This book deals almost exclusively with the first of these.&lt;/ref&gt;, logical values, or strings of text&lt;ref&gt;This is not quite true, but unless you are a computer specialist, you are unlikely to use the final type: a vectors of elements storing &quot;raw&quot; computer bits, see &lt;code&gt;?raw&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

If you want a collection of elements which are of different types, or not of one of the allowed vector types, you need to use a '''list'''.

      <comment>Shadow people</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Shadow people ==

Shadow people (also known as shadow men or shadow beings) are a supernatural phenomenon reported by some individuals. Most accounts of shadow people describe them as black humanoid silhouettes, lacking mouths or eyes, although they are sometimes reported to have red or yellow eyes. They are generally described as lacking mass, although their specific nature varies from two-dimensional (like a shadow) to vaporous or distorted. Their movement is often reported as being very quick and disjointed, or &quot;jiggly&quot;, in the sense that they first may move slowly like a fluid (similar to jello rather than water), then rapidly &quot;hop&quot; to another part of a witness' surroundings. Some witnesses describe this movement as though the shadow entities they have seen &quot;danced&quot; from one wall to the next. 

Observers of shadow people most commonly report that the forms appear at the edge of their field of vision, and that they disintegrate or move into walls when noticed, usually within a split second. However, many also report shadow people appearing in the center of their vision, appearing very close to them, or remaining for several seconds before disappearing. Some individuals have described being menaced, chased, or (more rarely) attacked or raped by shadow people. 

Sightings of shadow people have been reported all over the world. They are a recurring topic of the late-night talk radio show Coast-to-Coast AM. The former host of the show, Art Bell, seemingly resurrected the term &quot;shadow people.&quot; The term appeared as early as September 21, 1953 as the title of a radio drama that was broadcast on Chicago's WGN-AM &quot;Hall of Fantasy&quot;* series. However, reports of beings fitting the description of shadow people have been recorded for centuries in literature. For example, in 1887, celebrated French author Guy de Maupassant pennned the story &quot;Le Horla&quot; (&quot;The Horla&quot;) about shadowy beings who live on milk and water, bedevil human minds, and stalk the unwary.

 
Types 
Category 1 
This category falls into drugs use, seizures, and other mental issues. This category covers a very vast description and is known to have descriptions that may or may not match what others describe in category 2 and 3. Category 1 actually may not be considered shadow people at all due to the non consistancy in the descriptions. 

Category 2 
This category falls more into the ghost and spirit category. The descriptions in this category are as follows: non human shaped shadows or masses of human shaped shadow people in one place, insect shadows, animal shadow people, and women shadow people. These are mostly see thru shadows. Category 2 shadow people tend to be drawn more to a location than a person. It is common for this category to actually try and not become seen. Light may affect this group. 

Category 3 
This category does not fall into the ghost or Spirit category. This category has only 2 types of shadow people, One tall shadow man and several small hooded &quot;twin&quot; style shadow people. These are usually seen non see thru however they may be see thru. This category is more drawn to a person rather than a place, this category may actually be drawn to a certain spirit or ghost as well as humans. This category tends to not care about being seen. Light has no effect on this group. 







Shadow people versus ghosts
Alleged eyewitness accounts of shadow people differ from those of ghosts in many respects. Ghosts are said to be the disembodied spirits of people and are usually said by alleged eyewitnesses to take on the appearance of people, orbs, or mist when seen. 

While ghosts are often said to resemble actual people, accounts of shadow beings generally do not. Although accounts describe shadow beings as having humanlike form, they are generally not described as resembling actual individuals (living or deceased or deive). The cause of shadow people or shadow beings is also not generally attributed to be haunting by ghosts. 

Since accounts of ghosts and shadow people are anecdotal and have not been scientifically verified, such differences are not conclusive. 

Eyewitness accounts
Alleged eyewitness reports of these beings are often similar. In these accounts there are almost always the same forms: a blob-like cluster that sometimes has tendrils, a child-sized being, sometimes with a hood, a tall willowy figure with a jack-o'-lantern-sized head, and a tall figure with a hat. In these accounts, the figures typically follow a progression from the ambiguous blob and finally the tall man, meaning that over time they take on more human appearance. Much less frequently red glowing eyes are reported. Some witnesses also claim to have been attacked, resulting in scratches, bruises, or burns. 

The more consistent accounts typically describe a feeling of dread associated with the presence of these phenomena, and animals are said to react to the phenomena with fear and hostility. Shadow Beings are said to move extremely fast and travel through solid matter. They typically are said to have no discernable features such as mouths, noses, or eyes. Their forms are usually described as somewhat skeletal or thin. Direct visual contact is rarely reported by alleged eyewitnesses with shadow people; they are said to usually disappear before they can be seen clearly, and are seen &quot;in the corner of one's eye.&quot; These beings are said to often appear in mirrors. 




Shadow People In General
Heidi Hollis, researcher on Shadow People, has come up with some very generalized information on Shadow People. She has appeared on Coast To Coast AM several times. Taken from coasttocoastam.com: 

Shadow people have been around since the beginning of time and are a dark influence upon society, she said. They also relate to negative alien entities such as the Reptilians and Greys (alien species), and may in fact be part of the same overall phenomena, she added. 

Typically, shadow beings don't like to be spotted but they are sometimes discovered by a person who wakes up to find them trying to choke or suffocate them, noted Hollis, who presented several methods for decreasing or eliminating incidents with them: 

Learn to let go of your fear. 
Stand your ground and deny them access to your person. 
Focus on positive thoughts. 
Use the name of Jesus to repel them. 
Keep a light on or envision light surrounding you. 
Bless your room with bottled spring water. 
A type of shadow being referred to as the &quot;Hat Man&quot; is actually more akin to the devil or a demon, Hollis revealed. He is often seen wearing a fedora hat, trench coat and three-piece suit, and might appear more solid than other shadow entities. She suggested that these very negative beings are seeking to increase their numbers by recruiting an army of people to the dark side. 

Explanations
Several explanations have been proposed for the appearance of shadow people. 

Paranormal explanations
Some explanations for shadow people come from the fields of parapsychology, metaphysics, cryptozoology, and demonology, and are considered by many to be pseudoscience. Other explanations make no scientific pretense whatever, and lie more within the realm of religion and the occult. 

One of the more creative theories is that shadow beings are manifest thought forms (known in occult circles as egregores or tulpas), meaning that they are either collections of negative psychic energy from areas where traumatic events have taken place and evil people frequent, or have been intentionally created for some nefarious purpose. The negative psychic energy begins to manifest and takes on form and motive, thriving on fear and negative emotions for sustenance (astral vampires). 
Shadow beings have also been described as forms of ghosts, demons, inter-dimensional beings, and extraterrestrial lifes. One of the more popular explanations seems to be that they are some sort of other-dimensional beings whose dimension of origin occasionally overlaps with ours, which is said to explain their ethereal appearance and fleeting nature. 
Many who attach religious significance to the phenomena apply more credit to the demonic explanation. This is due to the phenomena usually being witnessed in places said to have a stigma of great negative energy. Such places include &quot;haunted locations&quot; or places where extreme emotional or physical abuse have transpired and feelings of fear, dread, and hatred somehow linger in the atmosphere beyond the temporal passing of sad events. Some however have made a connection between the black smoke apperance of this phenomena and the Jinn of Islamic belief. The Jinn are described as normally being invisible to humans and when seen having the apperance of Black smoke, making them very simular in apperance to the phenomena of shadow people. 
In Native American Cherokee mythology there is an evil witch known as the Raven Mocker that takes the form of a spectral bird and shifts into a humanoid, shadow-like phantom. These beings are said to steal the souls of the ill or dying. Such creatures are alleged to fear the shaman or medicine man and so do not enter a home where one resides. A medicine man was sought to watch over the infirm and also to watch over the bodies of the recently deceased, as according to myth once the body was buried the Raven Mocker could not steal the soul. 
A much less held view is that shadow people play a guardian angel role, protecting the individual from, or more accurately warning them of, impending danger; similar to the mothman. 
Some witnesses reported that they have seen hooded figures much like shadow people, blinking barely. This could explain some shadow people accounts of people seeing standing or hovering shapes. 
Non-paranormal explanations
Eyewitness accounts of shadow people are neither hoaxes nor actual paranormal experiences, but rather hallucinations or delusions. 

Hypnogogia (waking sleep) is an accepted state of semiconsciousness in which a person can be thinking clearly and yet perceiving images that are being dreamed. This state is often used to explain apparently paranormal experiences. 
Scientists have theorized that under the right conditions erratic electromagnetic field behavior can interfere with the electrical impulses or firing synapses of the human mind, thus influencing people subjected to such environments over time to believe that they are hearing or seeing ghosts, aliens, or perhaps shadow people. Such environments include old buildings with substandard wiring, power plants, and areas with naturally occurring strong magnetic fields. 
Drug induced hallucinations, such as those experienced by habitual heroin users, are known to reflect experiences similar to this phenomena. However, many witnesses do not use narcotics so the majority of accounts cannot be linked to this explanation. Individuals who recreationally use or overdose on diphenhydramine products such as Benadryl, or plants such as Datura, often report seeing shadow creatures and people, but more commonly, the amobea-like entities that usually prelude the appearance of shadow people . These celluar entities are said to be often incredibly detailed beings (complete with vacuoles,plasmodium, and mitochondria , etc.) 
The brain is also wired to perceive faces and other human characteristics in random patterns, called Pareidolia. 
The similarities between eyewitness accounts of shadow people remains difficult to explain scientifically. In particular the tall gingerbread-like man with a hat that is reported as often by 4-year-old children as with adults. The similarities may, however, simply reflect common archetypes</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chandler5416 would like the foraging section[[User:Chandler5416|Chandler5416]] ([[User talk:Chandler5416|talk]]) 01:08, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

===Foraging===
Original Affluent Society: I added a Wikipedia link for the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, as well as capitalized an S. --[[User:Abmort|Abmort]] ([[User talk:Abmort|talk]]) 23:31, 9 March 2009 (UTC) [[Abmort]]

I edited some grammar stuff in the reciprocity section --[[User:Chandler5416|Chandler5416]]

I reworded a sentence about 90% of the people in the US used foraging in the past. It didn't make sense how the person worded it so i rewrote it. --[[User:Maurer7597|Maurer7597]] ([[User talk:Maurer7597|talk]]) 04:26, 9 March 2009 (UTC) [[maurer7597]] Melissa Maurer

I just added some more information about the Ache under the foraging section. I went into more detail about how the hunter never eats his own catch, and his family always receives the same amount of meat as the rest of the tribe - i pretty much just stressed the importance of cooperation and sharing in their tribe. --[[User:Norton3607|Norton3607]] ([[User talk:Norton3607|talk]]) 00:35, 5 March 2009 (UTC)norton3607

I refined the writing of this section on foraging cultures a bit to make the information flow smoother .  I also fixed some grammatical errors and changed some of the content into the third person point of view to maintain the objectivity of the writing.

I added the picture of the Hadza people to show an example of foraging people. [[carr7805]]

I changed &quot;the foraging people&quot; to &quot;foragers.&quot; - [[egoronkin]]

I found and fixed a few more spelling/grammatical errors. --[[User:Klokow7568|Klokow7568]] ([[User talk:Klokow7568|talk]]) 00:15, 8 March 2009 (UTC)
 

Thanks for the changes and edits! I appreciate the input. What you guys added fits in well with what I was trying to convey and enhances this section!

==Consumption==
I took out up in the first sentence and added an &quot;s&quot; to good...better flow...
&quot;consumption is defined as the use of material goods necessary for human survival- for example by eating food or wearing clothing&quot;  I edited this sentence
[[User:Ekholm5421|Ekholm5421]]

In this whole section I fixed grammatical errors, and now the whole section reads more smoothly. I also took out the parts about economists not caring about consuption, since our speding and consumption is what drives are economy, they do study it and care about it. Plus it brings back the focus of anthropologists roles.
[[User:Muellep3|Muellep3]]

====Why do people consume what they do?====

I fixed a few spelling errors, as well as added &quot;they utilize THE PHYSICAL WORLD&quot; instead of &quot;...they utilize THEY&quot;. I also added a wikipedia link to the cultural ecology page. --[[User:Abmort|Abmort]] ([[User talk:Abmort|talk]]) 23:25, 9 March 2009 (UTC)Abmort

===Ecology and consumption===
I changed the subheading to &quot;ecology and consumption&quot; so that the topic of ecology would be immediately relevant to readers that are looking for information on consumption. I realize consumption was related to the ecology in the later paragraphs, but a change in the title might serve well.[[User:Strebep6463|Strebep6463]] ([[User talk:Strebep6463|talk]]) 18:34, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link to wikipedia for the word ecology. I feel like it would be more helpful to post a direct link to it rather than just having it bolded. [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 20:48, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I addressed the fact that America is the world's largest consumer. [[User:Marissafederspiel|Marissafederspiel]]

I made a few grammatical changes to the Ecology and Consumption section to give more clarity and fluency in reading.  [[User:cayab|Cayab]]

12. Consumption (found near the bottom of the page):
Added two Wikipedia links, one for Consumption and another for America. --[[User:Abmort|Abmort]] ([[User talk:Abmort|talk]]) 23:25, 9 March 2009 (UTC)Abmort

==Cultivation==
the horticulture section should talk about slash and burning as well as that it differs from agriculture in the fact that its a 
smaller scale and also produces a larger variety of crops. knight9366 ([[User talk: knight9366|talk]]) 15: 04 1 march

I'll take the other two modes of production, please. (Non industrial and alienation)--[[User:Flintp3360|Flintp3360]] ([[User talk:Flintp3360|talk]]) 05:36, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

Ill take Production please. (Inequalities)--[[User:wwuman23(2707)|wwuman23(2707)]] [[User:Wwuman23|Wwuman23]] ([[User talk:Wwuman23|talk]]) 23:15, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

There definitely needs to be a piece on Consumption to tie the system of Production, Distribution, and Consumption together. [[User:Wwuman23|Wwuman23]] ([[User talk:Wwuman23|talk]]) 00:22, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

Ill take Consumption if no one else already has it --[[User:Mallahp|Mallahp]] ([[User talk:Mallahp|talk]]) 23:38, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a picture from the commons to the cultivation page--[[User:Norton3607|Norton3607]] ([[User talk:Norton3607|talk]]) 00:25, 5 March 2009 (UTC)norton3607

I added a link for the horticulture section becasue every other section had one. [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 20:07, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the agriculture section by deleting excess words --[[User:Chandler5416|Chandler5416]]

I moved the picture in the agriculture section to the second paragraph, since thats what it goes along with. [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 20:43, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link to land ownership in the agriculture section because land ownership is a big part of agriculture so I thought that it should be a link as well! Great write up about agriculture though! [[User:Lalondk|Lalondk]] ([[User talk:Lalondk|talk]]) 19:58, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

Oh, good idea. Land ownership is definitely a huge aspect of this topic so that link will help people get a little more information on what exactly is involved in the ownership and land rights, etc. Thanks for the change! [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 20:14, 8 March 2009 (UTC)
===Grameen Bank===
I created this topic a couple of days ago. I know someone said they would do the Grameen Bank, I am sorry I did not sign the topic after I created it. You are more than welcome to make any additions to this topic, there is quite a lot of really impressive information about this banking system and could easily use some more detail. Also, to make note, I forgot to change the summary when making my edits, I hope that is not to big of a problem, I will try and remember to do that from now on.

I discussed Kiva to use as an illustration of a company that features microcredit. I am involved in this and am able to speak of the benefits after having read and taken part of their program. [[User:MarissaFederspiel]]

Also, I created links from my Kiva paragraph to other sites, further explaining my concepts. [[User:MarissaFederspiel]]

I moved the image of &quot;Nobel Laureate, Muhammad Yunus, the bank's founder&quot; to the left to take away the space in the section and help make the section look more put together. [allumbt]

===Modes of Exchange===

Foraging: I made a few fixes in spelling and punctuation. Also, I restructured a couple sentences to allow for easier understanding. --[[User:Abmort|Abmort]] ([[User talk:Abmort|talk]]) 23:17, 9 March 2009 (UTC)Abmort

Yanamo:  I edited &quot;native America&quot; to &quot;South America&quot; --[[User:Ekholm5421|Ekholm5421]]

Yanamo: I made minor punctuation and spelling fixes such as changing &quot;matieral&quot; to &quot;material&quot; --[[User:Abmort|Abmort]] ([[User talk:Abmort|talk]]) 23:13, 9 March 2009 (UTC)Abmort

Market Exchange: I just edited what I had previously submitted to make it flow better. I also added a few new things, like the other wiki link. 

I also noticed that someone had added redistribution and reciprocity, so i defined both of them when talking about market exchange to help relate the two to market exchange. I also showed how these are related to market exchange in my ethnographic example

Market Exchange: I just added information for the market exchange mode of exchange. Someone also added writing for the redistribution mode of exchange, so the only mode left that needs to be covered is reciprocity --[[User:Norton3607|Norton3607]] ([[User talk:Norton3607|talk]]) 00:29, 5 March 2009 (UTC)norton3607

For my example of market exchange I just said the United States, but didnt go into much detail about it. You can add any additional examples, or go into more depth about how the U.S. is an example of market exchange if you want. --[[User:Norton3607|Norton3607]] ([[User talk:Norton3607|talk]]) 00:46, 5 March 2009 (UTC)norton3607 

i also added a link to Karl Polanyi in my writing (market exchange). I thought this would be helpful since many people probably dont know who he is, and he is very important to the &quot;modes of exchange&quot; section, considering he proposed the three modes of exchange that we're talking about here....feel free to add any other links or additional information. --[[User:Norton3607|Norton3607]] ([[User talk:Norton3607|talk]]) 00:41, 5 March 2009 (UTC)norton3607

Someone rearranged my paragraphs and moved my link. It made the page look much more concise to the reader. Thank you.

Market Exchange: I revised the paragraphs, fixed some typo errors, moved some words around, added some HTML markup to make the citations neater, and in general just made the whole thing flow better. --[[User:ZacharyShaffer|ZacharyShaffer]] ([[User talk:ZacharyShaffer|talk]]) 04:03, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I Just took out Melissa's name from the beginning of Redistribution

I added Agriculture as a tab under Modes of Production. [[User:Marissafederspiel]]

==Modes of Production==
I took out a comma that didn't need to be in the first couple sentences. [[User:Ekholm5421|Ekholm5421]] 

Also added a wikipedia link for &quot;mode of production&quot; [[User:Ekholm5421|Ekholm5421]] 

I edited some of what some one already had,and I added some photos from wikipedia. If anyone wants to add anything else please feel free/ [[User:Luna6045|Luna6045]] ([[User talk:Luna6045|talk]]) 04:45, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I just made the section flow better.

===Distribution, Exchange===
I edited my paragraphs about redistribution and reciprocity so that they would flow better when other people are reading them. I also added some content to redistribution and to the ethnographic example on redistribution! [[User:Lalondk|Lalondk]] ([[User talk:Lalondk|talk]]) 04:05, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link to both redistribution and reciprocity. I think this gives the reader an alternative in case they want to know a little more about these two topics. Good paragraphs though, very well written and well thought out. Flows smoothly. [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 20:20, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I also bolded the three different types of reciporcities that you mentioned in your second section. This kind of makes it more clear to the reader what the main types are and where they are located. Gives it an overall better look. [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 23:00, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I definitely think that those corrections add to the section on reciprocity and redistribution! Thanks for the feedback! [[User:Lalondk|Lalondk]] ([[User talk:Lalondk|talk]]) 23:20, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

===Horticulture===
I changed &quot;Kids have a more active role in this society than others because they weed and plant seeds&quot; to &quot;Children have an important role in a horticultural society because they weed and plant seeds, for example&quot; because children historically have had active roles in some agricultural (and even industrial — think of child labor) societies as well, and it'd be hard to quantify such a thing. [[User:Strebep6463|Strebep6463]] ([[User talk:Strebep6463|talk]]) 22:24, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I simply removed a y from the word the in front of &quot;work is distributed&quot;....Whitcomb5739

===Pastoralism===
You stated that &quot;they often struggle with land rights&quot; and I took that out because you addressed later in the paragraph how there are no formal land rights, rather land is shared with family or certain groups.  I thought the struggle with land rights made it sound as if they had had conflict from this method.  And I do not believe they do.

I added an ehthnographic example about the Masaai people to this section [[User:White9354|White9354]] ([[User talk:White9354|talk]]) 23:22, 9 March 2009 (UTC)white9354

===Industrialism===
I cleaned up a few awkwardly phrased sentences, added a Wiki link to Industry and fixed some formatting and typos.  [[User:Rosen1347]]
I'm not really sure that industrialism helps to spread culture, but i think i understand what you're trying to say, syntax is still a little strange [[user;narkewicz]]

===Post-Industrial/Information===
Edited sentence structure from &quot;Such economic transitions&quot;.. to &quot;economic transitions such as...&quot;
[[User:Ekholm5421|Ekholm5421]]

===Means of Production===
I added some links to wikipedia for some key terms and deleeted a word that occurred twice in a sentence.  [[User:JoelSheppard]]

I added a link to the potlatch section to highlight the main point.  [[User:cayab|cayab]]</text>

|number = 4013

|description = Dual D-type flip-flop with asynchronous set-reset
|pins = 14
}}

The '''4013''' contains two independent D-type flip-flops with asynchronous set/reset inputs. Whenever the set or reset pins go high, the appropriate output is expressed immediately on the outputs. When set and reset are low, the output shows the data at the input at the time of the last low-to-high clock transistion. This is then held until the next transistion.

For more information on D-type flip-flops, refer to [[Practical Electronics/Flip-flops|this module]].

&lt;big&gt;'''Hypothyroidism'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Head &amp; Neck Cancer==
*'''U of Florida; 2005''' PMID 15923797 -- &quot;Thyroid function should be monitored following radiotherapy to the low neck.&quot; (Garcia-Serra A, Amdur RJ, Morris CG, Mazzaferri E, Mendenhall WM. Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun;28(3):255-8.)
**Retrospective. 504 patients whose RT fields included the thyroid gland and defined as TSH &gt;= 4.5 mIU/L.
**Outcome: 5-year hypothyroidism all patients 22% (42% in those patients with documented post-treatment TSH levels), 10-year 49% of all patients (74% in those patients with documented post-treatment TSH)
**Recommendations: Check Serum TSH q6 months for the first 5 years and yearly thereafter.

*'''Cleveland Clinic; 2001''' PMID 11753963 -- &quot;Hypothyroidism: a frequent event after radiotherapy and after radiotherapy with chemotherapy for patients with head and neck carcinoma.&quot; (Mercado G, Cancer. 2001 Dec 1;92(11):2892-7.)
**Retrospective. 143 patients, H&amp;N cancer, RT or chemo-RT. TSH measured regularly. Median F/U 4.4 years
**Outcome: 5-year hypothyroidism 48%, 8-year 67%. Median time-to-development 1.4 years
**Conclusion: Incidence of hypothyroidism higher than generally reported

==Breast Cancer==
*'''MD Anderson; 2008''' PMID 18213620 -- &quot;Risk of hypothyroidism in older breast cancer patients treated with radiation.&quot; (Smith GL, Cancer. 2008 Mar 15;112(6):1371-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23307.)
**SEER analysis, 1992-2002. Stage 0-III breast cancer and cancer-free controls
**Outcome: 5-year incidence of hypothyroidism 14% identical among non-irradiated, irradiated with N0, and irradiated with 4+ LN. After adjustment for sociodemographic/clinical characteristics, no difference between irradiated N0 and irradiated 4+ LN (HR 1.04) but both groups significantly higher than non-irradiated patients (HR 1.21, SS)
**Conclusion: Development of hypothyroidism common in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation; SCV irradiation doesn't appear to amplify risks</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.

'''Before''' you go ahead and publish Question Writer Tracker you must set up your Tracker account.  Details on how to do this are shown in [[Question Writer 3 Manual/Save and Publish/Question Writer Tracker|Question Writer Tracker]].  

When have registered you will have 100MB storage space and a monthly bandwidth allowance of 1GB (1024MB) for free. All the quizzes you publish this way will be automatically tracked for you, so you can log on any time to see the results and analyse the responses to questions.

When you select publish to '''Question Writer Tracker''', Question Writer will ask you to enter the email and password that you used when you registered for your Tracker account. 

[[Image:QW Tracker_Login.jpg|center]] 
&lt;br&gt;

Question Writer will then automatically create the files and publish them on the Question Writer Tracker web page.  A pop up box will appear monitoring the progress.  When this has been completed a message will appear confirming the success of the operation.


 [[Image:QW3 web message.jpg|center]]

You can then paste the link directly onto your own website, or into an email or other document for distribution to whoever you want to access your quiz.

If you click '''yes''' on this message you will be taken directly to your quiz.

The quiz will be listed in Question Writer Tracker under the name that you gave as the Title to the Quiz in Quiz Properties, not the name that you have saved the quiz file under.  If you generate a new version of the same quiz, any older version will be overwritten in Question Writer Tracker, unless you give the new version a new name as Quiz Title. When you publish to tracker with the same quiz title you will be given a prompt to confirm that you do want to overwrite an existing quiz.

[[File:QW Tracker Overwrite.jpg|center]]


When you next you log into Question Writer Tracker, go to the Quizzes page.  Here you will be able to see all the quizzes you have uploaded to Tracker along with information about how much of your free space you have used.  You can also copy the link for any of your published quizzes, use the link to go to the quiz or remove the quiz by clicking on the red cross beside it.   

[[Image:QW3 tracker menu.jpg|center]]


At the top right hand of the screen you will see menu options allowing you to view or amend the details of your Tracker Account, go to the Results page or Log Out.

Question Writer Tracker is a free service from Question Writer.  It allows you to track and analyze the results for all your quizzes published on line and also provides webspace where you can upload your quizzes for easy access.

Once your quiz is published online you can create user tokens to restrict access to the quiz, eg to people who have paid or have reached some other criteria.  See the Question Writer blog for more detail on this [http://www.questionwriterblog.com/archives/2009/03/one_time_use_token.html]

To use this service you will have to register on the Question Writer website [http://www.questionwritertracker.com/account/login].  Enter your email address as your user name and a password (one that you will remember!). 

   
[[Image:QW3 tracker login.jpg|center]]

  
An email will be sent to your email address asking you to confirm that it is really you that is registering and once you have verified that, you will be able to publish quizzes to Question Writer Tracker and login and view your results. 


You also have the option to amend your account details at any time.  This includes your contact details, your Google Analytics ID and the automatic emailing of all results (even if you have not ticked the box in [[../../Quiz Options/Web Settings|Web Settings]]). 


If you want to have results sent to the Tracker you will have to use the same email address in the set up to [[../../Quiz Options/Web Settings/Send Results over the Internet|Send Results over the Internet]] as you used to set up your tracker account.  You can use the Question Writer results service for all quizzes, whether they are published using the Question Writer Tracker webspace or your own website.  More information on the results service can be found in the [[../Results/]] section of this chapter.

Thanks for the typo edits in the Method Manual for Salt Lake Studies.[[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 04:20, 10 April 2009 (UTC)
:You're welcome! I read through the other pages as well. Cheers, [[User:Van der Hoorn|Van der Hoorn]] ([[User talk:Van der Hoorn|talk]]) 21:47, 13 April 2009 (UTC)
My goodness, you have been busy! Thanks again - it is folk such as yourself who have great attention to detail that turn my meanderings into readable text. I often feel that I am simply laying out the bare bones of the manual in a blinding hurry, when I get a gap in my day. I keep hoping for someone to fill in the blanks and catch my typos! At least the latter is occurring, thanks to you. [[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 01:49, 14 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

Some things I plan to do to bring this family up to snuff:
*Adjust the help page so it serves as a user's guide as well as a programmer's manual.
*Add some top-navbox style options:
**Font size (normal or small; this might extend to the bottom navbox, not sure one way or 'tother).
**Arrow type (&lt;big&gt;←&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; would probably be the default).
**Alternative form that sits in the upper right corner, instead of spanning left-to-right.
*Right-hand links on bottom navbox, with anchors by module name.
*External links as an additional navlist entry type.
*Client template to generate print version of the book.

: I tried to add support for named colors like background=black. Apparently the first approach didn't work, so instead of using &amp;amp;nbsp; I've tried another approach which seems to be working. I also seemed to have missed a few places where I needed to switch around #'s and I think I found them all this time. What were you having trouble with? Are you still having trouble? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:31, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

:: As far as I can see your nother approach works.  (I tested it with a named color, too.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 03:18, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

:: In answer to your first question, the earlier approach with nbsp broke everything that actually used the color returned by Navlist/Map/Background or Navlist/Map/Border; I first noticed that from one of the Conlang pages, but once I knew what to look for it was observable from test case D on Navlist/Top.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 03:38, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The six &lt;u&gt;attributes&lt;/u&gt; in Dungeons and Dragons (hereafter referred to as &quot;DnD&quot;) define certain physical or mental abilities of a character, monster, or non-player character (NPC). These are:
* '''Strength''' (Str)
* '''Dexterity''' (Dex)
* '''Constitution''' (Con)
* '''Intelligence''' (Int)
* '''Wisdom''' (Wis)
* '''Charisma''' (Cha)

The most common methods to determine these scores are as follows:
# The player rolls 3d6 six times and places the scores where they are wanted. On average, this will produce a typical individual selected at random from the population. It is suitable for a low-powered campaign.
# An ability score is determined by rolling 4d6 and discard the lowest score. This is repeated six times and each score is placed next to the ability where they are wanted by the player. This method tends to produce higher than average scores, which is more appropriate for a heroic character.
# The point buy method is used to purchase ability scores out of a pool of points. The number of points available is determined by the DM from table 2 below. This method has the benefit of allowing the player to create just the type of character she wants to run. A drawback may be the relative ease of [[W:min-maxing|min-maxing]] the character. That is, the player can exaggerate the beneficial abilities for their character while minimizing the less useful abilities.

== Broken Ribs ==
On March 21 I came off my motorcycle while crossing some tram tracks early in the morning.

Several hours later when I regain consciousness, I awake in hospital with great confusion as to the year, let alone the day or month. Even now a few weeks later, I have no memory of what occurred in the accident, but have since learned that the cartilage in my neck (c5-c6) was badly compressed too.

After being prescribed medication to manage the pain, I discover from my doctor that it prevents bones from healing, thank you public health service. A few weeks down the track the excruciating pain from my ribs has reduced to merely extremely painful.

Hopefully as my ribs knit together over the next week the pain will substantially reduce. I can't wait.

__TOC__
[[Image:Blender3D WhatIsA3DSpace.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Figure 1:''' Objects in a three dimensional space. In the center of the coordinate system is the origin of the global coordinate system.]]

We'll start looking at how 3D scenes are represented in Blender.

As was explained in {{B3D:N2P/Module|3D Geometry}}, Blender represents locations in a scene by their coordinates.  The coordinates of a location consist of three numbers that define its distance and direction from a fixed origin.  More precisely:
* The first (or x-) coordinate of the location is defined as its distance from the YZ plane (the one containing both the Y and Z axes).  Locations on the +X side of this plane are assigned positive x-coordinates, and those on the -X side are given negative ones.
* Its second (or y-) coordinate is its distance from the XZ plane, with locations on the -Y side of this plane having negative y-coordinates.
* Its third (or z-) coordinate is its distance from the XY plane, with locations on the -Z side of this plane having negative z-coordinates.

Thus the origin (which lies at the junction of all three axes and all three planes) has coordinates (0, 0, 0).
{{clear}}

== Global and local coordinates ==

Blender refers to the coordinate system described above as the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|global coordinate system}}, though it's not truly global—each scene has its own global coordinate system.  Each global coordinate system has a fixed origin and a fixed orientation, but we can view it from different angles by moving a virtual camera through the scene and/or rotating the camera.

Global coordinates are adequate for scenes containing a single fixed object and scenes in which each object is merely a single point in the scene.   When dealing with objects that move around (or multiple objects with sizes and shapes), it's helpful to define a '''local coordinate system''' for each object, a coordinate system that can move with the object and follow the object around.   The origin of an object's local coordinate system is often called the '''center of the object''' even though it needn't coincide with the geometrical center of the object.

3D objects in Blender are largely described using {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|vertices}} (points in the object, singular form: '''vertex''').  The global coordinates of a vertex depend on:
* the (x, y, z) coordinates of the vertex in the object's '''local''' coordinate system
* the location of the object's center
* any rotation (turning) of the local coordinates system relative to the global coordinate system, and
* any scaling (magnification or reduction) of the local coordinate system relative to the global coordinate system.

For example, the teacup in Figure 1 is described by a mesh model containing 171 vertices, each having a different set of local (x, y, z) coordinates relative to the cup's center.  If you {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|translate}} the cup (move it without rotating), the only bits of the model that have to change are the global coordinates of the center; the local coordinates of all its vertices would remain the same.

=== Coordinates of child objects ===

[[Image:Blender3D ParentChildCoordinates.png|thumb|400px|'''Figure 1b:''' A parent serves as the source of the global coordinates for its child object. The child is the cup; the parent's orientation is shown with the colored arrows. [[File:Blender3d ParentChildCoordinateAnimation.gif|thumb|200px|Animation of the above]] ]]

Any object can act as a {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|parent}} for one or more other objects in the same scene, which are then referred to as its {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|children}}.  (An object cannot have more than one direct parent, but parent objects may themselves be the children of other objects.)

If an object has a parent, its position, rotation, and scaling are measured in the parent's local coordinate system, almost as if it were a vertex of the parent.  That is to say, the position of the child's center is measured from the parent's center instead of the origin of the global coordinate system.  So if you move a parent object, its children move too, even though the children's coordinates have not changed.  The orientation and scaling of a child's local coordinate system are likewise measured relative to those of its parent.  If you rotate the parent, the child will rotate (and perhaps revolve) around the same axis.

Parent-child relationships between objects make it simpler to perform (and animate) rotations, scaling and moving in arbitrary directions.  In '''Fig. 1b''' the teacup is a child object of the coordinate cross on the right. That cross is itself the child of an invisible parent. (It is both a parent and child.) In the cup's local coordinate system, it is not rotating, but as the cross on the right rotates around its Z axis, it causes the cup to rotate and revolve. In real animations, it will be much easier when the character holding the cup rotates, the cup changes its position respectively.

{{clear}}

== View coordinates ==

[[Image:Blender3D ViewCoordinatesProjectionPlane.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Figure 2:''' View coordinates and Projection Plane]]
Taking the viewer of the scene into consideration, there is another coordinate space: the view coordinates. In '''Fig. 2''' the viewer is symbolized by the camera. The Z axis of the view coordinates always points directly to the viewer in orthographic projection. The X axis points to the right, the Y axis points upwards ('''Fig. 3''').

[[Image:Blender3d ViewCoordinates.jpg|thumb|200px|'''Figure 3:''' View coordinates in viewing direction]]
In fact you always work in view coordinates if you don't set it any other way*. This is
particularly handy if you have aligned your view prior to modeling something, e.g. if an object has a slanted roof and you want to create a window to fit in this roof, it would be very complicated to build this window aligned to the local coordinate system of the object, but if you first align your view to the slanted roof you can easily work in this view coordinate system.

(* In the Blender 2.6 series, the default has been changed to global coordinates. View coordinates remain as an option.)

If you work in one of the three standard views (Front/Top/Side) the alignment of the view coordinates fits the global coordinates; therefore it is quite natural to model in one of the standard views and many people find this the best way to model.

{{clear}}

== Normal coordinates ==

[[Image:Blender3d NormalKoordinates.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Figure 4:''' Normal coordinate spaces for faces. The normal is shown in blue.]]

Although Blender is a 3D program, only the faces are visible. The orientation of the faces is important for many reasons. For example, in our daily lives it seems quite obvious that a book lies flat on a table. This requires the surface of the table and that of the book to be parallel to each other. If we put a book on a table in a 3D program, there is no mechanism that forces these surfaces to be parallel; we have to ensure that ourselves.

The orientation of a face can be described with the help of a so-called {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|surface normal}}. It is always perpendicular to the surface. If several faces are selected, the resulting normal is averaged from the normals of every single face. In '''Fig. 4''' the normal coordinates of the visible faces are drawn.

This concept can be applied to individual points on the object, even if the points themselves have no orientation. The normal of a point is the average of normals of the adjacent faces.

''The images for this tutorial were produced with Blender v2.46.''

== UV Coordinates ==
In later parts (for example, talking about textures) you will come across coordinates labelled “U” and “V”. These are simply different letters chosen to avoid confusion over “X”, “Y” and “Z”. For example, a raster image is normally laid out on a flat, two-dimensional plane. Each point on the image can be identified by X and Y coordinates. But Blender can take this image and wrap it around the surface of a 3D object as a texture. Points on/in the object have X, Y and Z coordinates. So to avoid confusion, the points on the image are identified using U and V to label their coordinates instead of X and Y. We then refer to “UV mapping” as the process of determining where each (U, V) image point ends up on the (X, Y, Z) object.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a large family of point-trick card games with the distinguishing feature that Jack and Nine of the trump suit are the highest trumps. The names of these games are often a variation of &quot;Klaverjas&quot;, being Dutch for Jack of clubs. This suggests that in an earlier form of the game, clubs was a permanent trump suit. Modern games of this family include the Dutch national card game Klaverjas, the French national card game Belote, and the Swiss national card game Jass. Games of this family are also popular in some locations in North America, in Jewish communities, in the Balkans and the Middle East, and in South Asia.

Almost all games in this family are played with decks of 24–36 French-suited playing cards. A notable exception is formed by Jass (played in Switzerland and Vorarlberg), which depending on the region is played with French-, Swiss- or German-suited cards. In most variants the point values of cards are as shown in the table.
The deck shown here has 36 cards, like the one used for Jass. The most typical deck for other variants is the [[w:Piquet deck|piquet deck]] of 32 cards, which omits the Sixes. Some variants also omit the Sevens and Eights, resulting in a deck of 24 cards.
The ranks of the cards are also as indicated by the table. In particular the ''aces and tens rank high'' (i.e. before the kings), and the Jack and Nine of the trump suit (if any) are promoted to become the two highest ranking trumps.
However, two variations occur frequently enough that they are worth mentioning here.

'''Tens may rank low:'''
While normally the tens rank between the aces and kings as one would expect for a card that counts almost as much as an ace and twice as much as a king, in some variants of the game the they rank low, i.e. immediately above the nines. As a result these very valuable cards (in terms of scoring points) are quite easy to lose in a trick.

'''Picture card values may be lower by one:'''
In some variants of the game the King, Queen and (non-trump) Jack score 3, 2 and 1 points, respectively, i.e. each one point less than normal.

==Basic game play==
There is great variation in how trumps are determined, e.g. by bidding, auction or putting a card face up, which may happen before all cards have been dealt. In some variants ''no trump'' is also an option, and in this case almost all variants agree about the rules for trick-play.

The first player (usually forehand, i.e. the player who sits after the dealer and received the first cards) leads any card to the first ''trick''. Each player in turn contributes one card. Players must ''follow suit'', i.e. play a card of the same suit as the first card in the trick, whenever possible. Only a player who is ''blank'' in the ''suit led'' is allowed to ''discard'' a card of another suit instead. The player who contributed the highest-ranking card of the suit led takes the trick, placing it face down on a stack in front of the player. The first player in each subsequent trick is the player who won the previous trick.

All rules agree that if a trump suit has been chosen, any trick containing a trump is won by the player who contributed the highest-ranking trump, even though the suit led may have been a plain suit. There is, however, considerable disagreement about the precise rules that answer the question when it is allowed to play a certain trump.

Once all cards have been played, each player wins the total point value of the cards in the tricks won by that player. More points may be added for:
* melding certain combinations of cards before the first trick, or
* capturing certain combinations of cards in a single trick; and
* winning the last trick.

==Trumps==
In the course of trick-play, players will occasionally trump a trick that started with a plain suit. And sometimes a player will lead a trump, resulting in a round in which every player overtrumps the previous players, if possible. These are typical situations in most Jass games, but different variants and sub-variants disagree about the details: When exactly can, or even must, a trump be played into a trick? This variability seems to be inherited from tarot games such as French Tarot; it can be regarded as the result of codifying the character of trumps in different ways:
* Trumps want to ''trump'' tricks which hitherto consist only of cards in plain suits.
* Trumps do not want to ''undertrump'', i.e. be played to a trick that already contains a higher trump.
These characteristics of the trump suit set the Jass family apart from most other modern trick-playing games, which typically treat trumps in the same straightforward way as whist does: In whist, trump is governed by exactly the same rules as all other suits. It merely happens to win the trick in some situations.

For describing the precise rules that govern trick-play the following terminology will be convenient:

;Follow plain suit: Play any card of the suit led. Does not apply if the suit led is trump.
;Follow trump suit: Play any trump. Only applies if the suit led is trump.
;Trump: Play any trump.
;Overtrump: Play a trump that ranks higher than all trumps already in the trick. This includes playing the first trump to a plain suit led trick.
;Undertrump: Play a trump that ranks lower than the highest-ranking trump in the trick.

This terminology makes it possible to describe complex rules by a short list of options, with the understanding that every card played is subject to the first applicable and satisfiable condition in the list. Thus it is easy to read from the example in the table above that players in Scarto must follow suit if possible; that a player who cannot follow suit must play a trump if possible; and only a player who is blank both in the suit led and in trumps may discard.

It makes sense to begin by considering only non-partnership games, and in partnership games the case that the partner has not played yet or does not head the trick. In the case of two-handed games the situation becomes even simpler, because in case a plain suit trick has been trumped no further cards can be played.

It is likely that all Jass games derive from a two-handed Jewish game. David Parlett traced the game back to a Dutch book of 1821 which describes a game called &quot;Smoojas&quot; (&quot;Jewish Jass&quot;). It is played with a 32 card piquet pack. Tens rank low, and picture card values are lower by one. As in many two-handed trick-taking games, there is initially a stock from which players complete their hands after each trick, and players may play any card without any restrictions such as following suit. Once the stock is empty, the rules shown in the table apply. The Wikipedia article for [[w:Belot|Belot]] currently describes rules of trick-play for a 2–4 player game which seem to correspond to this rule set. The rules for [[w:Manille|Manille]] (not a Jass game, although somewhat related) have the same property, although they differ with those for Belot in the way partnerships are treated.

Perhaps Jewish Jass changed its trick-play rules to those shown in the table under &quot;Most modern games&quot; before the variants for more players branched off.
In any case trick-play in the 2-handed Jewish and Hungarian game described by David Parlett under the rubric &quot;Klaberjass&quot; is as shown here (see also John McLeod on Bela [http://www.pagat.com/jass/bela.html]), and almost all modern Jass games agree with these rules in the 2-handed case, or for the second card played in each trick.

The rule sets in the table are ordered from most restrictive to most liberal.

This rule set is as in French Tarot. It is used in Belote, Coinche and the Rotterdam variant of Klaverjas (according to John McLeod and David Parlett). Also the German game Klabberjass described by John McLeod [http://www.pagat.com/jass/klabberjass.html]. Also Clabber as played in Indiana. [http://www.pagat.com/jass/clabber.html#play]

While there is a great deal of variation in Jass games, and some uncertainty about fine points of trick-play rules since they are so complicated, they are essentially standardised.

== Thinking of an op-amp as an integrator ==

...Really, how op-amps work is a key point to understanding op-amp circuits. When I was a student in middle 1970s, reading classical explanations (they still exist) I couldn't understand what and how an op-amp really does in op-amp circuits with negative feedback. Later, in middle 1980s, when I began explaining basic op-amp circuits with negative feedback to my students, I realized gradually a paradoxical fact: '''although an op-amp is really a proportional and, as they consider, an almost &quot;non-inertial&quot; device, in order to understand how op-amp circuits work, we have to think of it as of an integrating, inertial device''' what it actually is (see also [http://archive.chipcenter.com/analog/c007.htm op-amp myths], ''Integrator inside'' section). Figuratively speaking, we have to think of the op-amp as of a &quot;being&quot; that &quot;observes&quot; continuously its input voltage and changes its output voltage until it manages to zero the input voltage. If we think of the op-amp in terms of U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = A.V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e., V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; change simultaneously), we fall into a vicious circle traveling the feedback loop and we can never understand circuit operation. We have to assume that the output voltage stays late regarding the input voltage. More philosophically speaking, we have to see the causality in the op-amp operation; to think of the input voltage as of a cause and of the output voltage as of a result. Quite later I found this concept in ''The art of electronics'', &quot;The golden rules&quot; section (p. 177): ''What the op-amp does is &quot;look&quot; at its input terminals and swing its output terminal around so that the external feedback network brings the input differential to zero (if possible)''. As you can see, Horowitz &amp; Hill have also animated the inanimate op-amp with the sole purpose of showing what it actually does in negative feedback circuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Amplifiers can be specified according to their input and output properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory, 7th Edition | author = Robert Boylestad and Louis Nashelsky | publisher = Prentice Hall College Division | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0133757347 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=TRBTAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Electronic+Devices+and+Circuit+Theory&amp;dq=Electronic+Devices+and+Circuit+Theory&amp;pgis=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have some kind of '''gain''', or multiplication factor relating the magnitude of the output signal to the input signal. The gain may be specified as &quot;output voltage/input voltage&quot;, &quot;output power/input power&quot; or any other combination of current, voltage and power.  In many cases, with input and output in the same units, gain will be unitless; for others this is not necessarily so – for example, a transconductance amplifier has a gain with units of conductance (output current per input voltage).

In most cases an amplifier should be linear, that is the gain should be constant for any combination of input and output signal. If the gain is not linear, e.g. by clipping the output signal at the limits of its capabilities, the output signal is distorted.

== Classification of amplifier stages and systems ==

There are many alternative classifications that address different aspects of amplifier designs, and they all express some particular perspective relating the design parameters to the objectives of the circuit. Amplifier design is always a compromise of numerous factors, such as cost, power consumption, real-world device imperfections, and a multitude of performance specifications. Below are several different approaches to classification:

=== Input and output variables ===

[[Image:Dependent Sources.PNG|thumbnail|300px|The four types of dependent source; control variable on left, output variable on right]]

Electronic amplifiers use two variables: current and voltage. Either can be used as input, and either as output leading to four types of amplifiers. In idealized form they are represented by each of the four types of dependent source used in linear analysis, as shown in the figure, namely:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;background:white;text-align:center &quot;
!Input 
!Output 
!Dependent source 
!Amplifier type
|-
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;

| '''I'''
| current controlled current source '''CCCS'''

|-
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;

| transresistance amplifier
|-
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;

| voltage controlled current source '''VCCS'''
| transconductance amplifier
|-
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
| '''V'''
| '''V'''
| voltage controlled voltage source '''VCVS'''
| voltage amplifier
|}
Each type of amplifier in its ideal form has an ideal input and output resistance that is the same as that of the corresponding dependent source:&lt;ref&gt;It is a curiosity to note that this table is a [http://www.swemorph.com/ma.html &quot;Zwicky box&quot;]; in particular, it encompasses all possibilities.&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;background:white;text-align:center &quot;
!Amplifier type 
!Dependent source 
!Input impedance 
!Output impedance

|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
| '''Current'''
| '''CCCS'''
| '''0'''
| '''∞'''
|-
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
| '''Transresistance'''
| '''CCVS'''
|  '''0'''
|  '''0'''
|-
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
| '''Transconductance'''
| '''VCCS'''
| '''∞'''
| '''∞'''
|-
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
| '''Voltage'''
| '''VCVS'''
| '''∞'''
| '''0'''
|}
In practice the ideal impedances are only approximated. For any particular circuit, a small-signal analysis often is used to find the impedance actually achieved. A small-signal AC test current ''I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is applied to the input or output node, all external sources are set to zero, and the corresponding alternating voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' across the test current source determines the impedance seen at that node as ''R = V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; / I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Amplifiers designed to attach to a transmission line at input and/or output, especially RF amplifiers, do not fit into this classification approach.  Rather than dealing with voltage or current individually, they ideally couple with an input and/or output impedance matched to the transmission line impedance, that is, match ''ratios'' of voltage to current.  Many real RF amplifiers come close to this ideal.  Although, for a given appropriate source and load impedance, RF amplifiers can be characterized as amplifying voltage or current, they fundamentally are amplifying power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Vsats: Very Small Aperture Terminals | author = John Everett | publisher = IET | year = 1992 | isbn = 0863412009 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=MWuXmf4V4NwC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=amplifier+impedance+transmission-line++dB&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=nsyFR5GqJ6eGtgPX4rXQBQ&amp;sig=Lwap3QvlOSI2ClwZlO4MM4BcD_A#PPA81,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common terminal ===

One set of classifications for amplifiers is based on which device terminal is common to both the input and the output circuit.  In the case of bipolar junction transistors, the three classes are [[/Common emitter|common emitter]], [[/Common base|common base]], and [[/Common collector|common collector]].  For field-effect transistors, the corresponding configurations are [[/Common source|common source]], [[/Common gate|common gate]], and [[/Common drain|common drain]]; for triode vacuum devices, common cathode, common grid, and common plate.

=== Unilateral or bilateral ===

When an amplifier has an output that exhibits no feedback to its input side, it is called '''unilateral'''. One consequence is the amplifier has an input impedance that is independent of the load attached to the amplifier, and an output impedance that is independent of the signal source driving the amplifier. 

The opposite case is the '''bilateral''' amplifier, where feedback connects the output to the input side of the amplifier. Such feedback often is deliberate, for example negative feedback often is used to tailor amplifier behavior. However, at least as often, feedback is both undesirable and unavoidable; introduced, for example, by parasitic elements like inherent, undesirable capacitances in transistors that couple input to output. In any case, a bilateral amplifier has an input impedance that depends upon the load attached to the amplifier, and an output impedance that depends on the source driving the amplifier. 

Linear unilateral and bilateral amplifiers can be represented by two-port networks. Most amplifiers are bilateral to some degree, however they may often be modeled as unilateral under certain operating conditions to simplify the analysis (see the common base article for an example).

=== Inverting or non-inverting ===

Another way to classify amps is the phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal.  An '''inverting''' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, an inversion or mirror image of the input as seen on an oscilloscope). A '''non-inverting''' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An '''emitter follower''' is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal.

This description can apply to a single stage of an amplifier, or to a complete amplifier system.

=== Function ===

Other amplifiers may be classified by their function or output characteristics. These functional descriptions usually apply to complete amplifier systems or sub-systems and rarely to individual stages. 
*A '''servo amplifier''' indicates an integrated feedback loop to actively control the output at some desired level. A '''DC servo''' indicates use at frequencies down to DC levels, where the rapid fluctuations of an audio or RF signal do not occur. These are often used in mechanical actuators, or devices such as DC motors that must maintain a constant speed or torque. An '''AC servo''' amp can do this for some ac motors.  
*A '''linear''' amplifier responds to different frequency components independently, and does not generate harmonic distortion or intermodulation distortion. A '''nonlinear''' amplifier does generate distortion. 
*A '''wideband''' amplifier has a precise amplification factor over a wide range of frequencies, and is often used to boost signals for relay in communications systems. A '''narrowband''' amp is made to amplify only a specific narrow range of frequencies, to the exclusion of other frequencies. 
*An '''RF''' amplifier refers to an amplifier designed for use in the radio frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and is often used to increase the sensitivity of a receiver or the output power of a transmitter. 
*An '''audio amplifier''' is designed for use in reproducing audio frequencies. This category subdivides into small signal amplification, and power amps which are optimised for driving speakers, sometimes with multiple amps grouped together as separate or bridgeable channels to accommodate different audio reproduction requirements.
*A special type of amplifier is widely used in instruments and for signal processing, among many other varied uses. These are known as '''operational amplifiers''',  (or '''op-amps'''). This is because this type of amplifier is used in circuits that perform mathematical algorithmic functions, or &quot;operations&quot; on input signals to obtain specific types of output signals.  A typical op-amp has differential inputs (one &quot;inverting&quot;, one, &quot;non-inverting&quot; relative to the output) and one output. An idealised op-amp has the following characteristics:
**Infinite input impedance (so as to not load circuitry it is sampling as a control input)
**Zero output impedance
**Infinite gain
**Zero propagation delay

:The performance of an op-amp with these characteristics would be entirely defined by the (usually passive) components forming a negative feedback loop around it, that is, ''the amplifier itself has no effect on the output''. 

:Today, op-amps are usually provided as integrated circuits, rather than constructed from discrete components. All real-world op-amps fall short of the idealised specification above – but some modern components have remarkable performance and come close in some respects.

Most amplifiers and many other kinds of analog electronics are built using op-amps. They are so useful that we've dedicated an entire section to them, [[Practical Electronics/Operating amplifiers]].

=== Interstage coupling method ===

Amplifiers are sometimes classified by the coupling method of the signal at the input, output, or between stages. Different types of these include:
*'''R-C coupled amplifier, using a network of resistors and capacitors.''' By design these amplifiers cannot amplify DC signals as the capacitors block the DC component of the input signal. RC-coupled amplifiers were used very often in circuits with vacuum tubes or discrete transistors. In the days of the integrated circuit a few more transistors on a chip are much cheaper and smaller than a capacitor.
*'''L-C coupled amplifier, using a network of inductors and capacitors.''' This kind of amplifier is most often used in selective radio-frequency circuits.
*'''Transformer coupled amplifier, using a transformer to match impedances or to decouple parts of the circuits.''' Quite often LC-coupled and transformer-coupled amplifiers cannot be distinguished as a transformer is some kind of inductor. 
*Direct coupled amplifier, using no impedance and bias matching components. This class of amplifier was very uncommon in the vacuum tube days when the anode (output) voltage was at several 100 V plus and the grid (input) voltage at a few volts minus. So they were only used if the gain was specified down to DC, e.g. in an oscilloscope. In the context of modern electronics developers are encouraged to use directly coupled amplifiers whenever possible.

=== Frequency range ===

Depending on the frequency range and other properties amplifiers are designed according to different principles.

*Frequency ranges down to DC are only used when this property is needed. DC amplification leads to specific complications that are avoided if possible.
*Depending on the frequency range specified different design principles must be used. Up to the MHz range only &quot;discrete&quot; properties need be considered, e.g. a terminal has an input impedance.
*As soon as any connection within the circuit gets longer than perhaps 1% of the wavelength of the highest specified frequency (e.g. at 100 MHz the wavelength is 3 m, so the critical connection length is maybe 3&amp;nbsp;cm) design properties radically change. For example a specified length and width of a PCB trace can be used as a selective or impedance-matching entity.
*Above a few 100 MHz it gets difficult to use discrete elements, especially inductors. In most cases PCB traces of very closely defined shapes are used instead.

=== Type of load ===

*Untuned - (a) audio (b) video
*Tuned (RF amps) - used for amplifying a single radio frequency or band of frequencies

== Implementation ==
Amplifiers are implemented using '''active elements''' of different kinds:
*The first active elements were relays. They were used in trans-continental telegraph lines in the 1800s; a weak current was used to switch the voltage of a battery to the outgoing line.
*For transmitting audio, carbon microphones were used as the first ever active element.
*Up to the early 1970s, many amplifiers used vacuum tubes (&quot;valves&quot; in the UK). Today tubes are only generally used for very high-power, high-frequency amplifiers, microwave ovens, CRT TVs, and for specialist audio applications, in which field they have achieved a degree of popularity. Many broadcast transmitters still use vacuum tubes. Valves' imperviousness to electromagnetic pulse damage may have led to their retention in certain defence contexts.
*In the 1950s the transistor began a gradual take over. These days, discrete transistors are still used in many electronics, but are increasingly replaced by ICs
*Beginning in the 1970s more and more transistors were connected on a single chip therefore creating the integrated circuit. a large proportion of the amplifiers commercially available today are based on integrated circuits.

For exotic purposes several other active elements have been used. For example in the early days of the communication satellite parametric amplifiers were used. The core circuit was a diode whose capacity was changed by an RF signal created locally. Under certain conditions this RF signal provided energy that was modulated by the extremely weak satellite signal received at the earth station. The operating principle of a parametric amplifier is somewhat similar to the principle by which children keep their swings in motion: As long as the swing moves you only need to change a &quot;parameter&quot; of the swinging entity, e.g. you must move your center of gravity up and down. In our case the capacity of the diode is changed periodically.

== Power amplifier classes ==
==== Angle of flow or conduction angle ====
Power amplifier circuits (output stages) are classified as A, B, AB and C for analog designs, and class D and E for switching designs based upon the conduction angle or 'angle of flow' Θ of the input signal through the amplifying device, that is, the portion of the input signal cycle during which the amplifying device conducts. The image of the conduction angle is derived from amplifying a sinusoidal signal. (If the device is always on, Θ = 360°.) The angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier power efficiency. The various classes are introduced below, followed by more detailed discussion under individual headings later on.

;'''Class A'''
:100% of the input signal is used (conduction angle Θ = 360° or 2π, i.e. the active element works in its linear range all of the time). Where efficiency is not a consideration, most small signal linear amplifiers are designed as Class A, which means that the output devices are always in the conduction region. Class A amplifiers are typically more linear and less complex than other types, but are very inefficient. This type of amplifier is most commonly used in small-signal stages or for low-power applications (such as driving headphones).

;'''Class B'''
:50% of the input signal is used by each output transistor (Θ = 180° or π, i.e. the active element works in its linear range half of the time and is more or less turned off for the other half). In most Class B, there are two output devices (or sets of output devices), each of which conducts alternately (push–pull) for exactly 180 deg (or half cycle) of the input signal; selective RF amplifiers can also be implemented using a single active element. 

:These amplifiers are subject to ''crossover distortion'' if the handoff from one active element to the other is not perfect, as when two complementary transistors (i.e. one PNP, one NPN) are connected as two emitter followers with their base and emitter terminals in common, requiring the base voltage to slew across the region where both devices are turned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Art of Electronics | author = Paul Horowitz, Winfield Hill | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1989 | ibsn = 0521370957 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&amp;pg=PA411&amp;dq=crossover-distortion+class-b&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=v7nlR4CCDZaytgOT7IzZBA&amp;sig=Dj6XntJelOmRA80c0IMp9gcG01s }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;'''Class AB'''
:Here the two active elements conduct more than half of the time as a means to reduce the cross-over distortions of Class B amplifiers. In the example of the complementary emitter followers a bias network allows for more or less quiescent current thus providing an operating point somewhere between Class A and Class B. Sometimes a figure is added, e.g. AB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with higher figures implying a higher quiescent current and therefore more of the properties of Class A.

;'''Class D'''

:These use switching to achieve a very high power efficiency (more than 90% in modern designs). By operating each output device either fully on or off, losses are minimized. The analog output is created by pulse-width modulation, i.e. the active element is switched on for shorter or longer intervals instead of modifying its resistance. There are more complicated switching schemes like sigma-delta modulation, to improve some performance aspects like lower distortions or better efficiency.

;'''Other classes'''
:There are several other amplifier classes, although they are mainly variations of the previous classes. For example, Class H and Class G amplifiers are marked by variation of the supply rails (in discrete steps or in a continuous fashion, respectively) following the input signal. Wasted heat on the output devices can be reduced as excess voltage is reduced or kept to a minimum. The amplifier that is fed with these rails itself can be of any class. These kinds of amplifiers are more complex, and are mainly used for specialized applications, such as very high-power units. Also, Class E and Class F amplifiers are commonly described in literature for radio frequencies applications where efficiency of the traditional classes deviate substantially from their ideal values. These classes use harmonic tuning of their output networks to achieve higher efficiency and can be considered a subset of Class C due to their conduction angle characteristics.

More detail on the various classes is provided below.

=== Class A ===
Class A amplifying devices operate over the whole of the input cycle. The output signal is normally a scaled-up replica of the input. Class A amplifiers are the usual means of implementing small-signal amplifiers. They are not efficient; '''a theoretical maximum of 50% is obtainable with inductive output coupling and only 25% with capacitive coupling'''. 

In a Class A circuit, the amplifying element is biased so the device is always conducting to some extent, and is operated over the most linear portion of its characteristic curve (known as its transfer characteristic or transconductance curve). Because the device is always conducting, even if there is no input at all, power is drawn from the power supply. Quiescent power consumption is high, hence its inefficiency.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Electronic Amplifier Class A.png]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;Class A Amplifier&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If high output powers are needed from a Class A circuit, the power waste (and the accompanying heat) is substantial. For every watt delivered to the load, the amplifier itself, at best, dissipates another watt. For large powers this means large and expensive power supplies and heat sinking. Class A designs have largely been superseded for audio power amplifiers, though some audiophiles believe that Class A gives the best sound quality, due to it being operated in as linear a manner as possible which provides a small market for expensive high fidelity Class A amps. In addition, some aficionados prefer thermionic valve (or &quot;tube&quot;) designs instead of transistors, due to claimed better sound quality.

Class A amplifiers are often used in output stages of op-amps; they are sometimes used as medium-power, low-efficiency, and high-cost audio amplifiers. The average power consumption is unrelated to the output power when amplifying ac. At idle (no input), the power consumption is essentially the same as at high output volume. The result is low efficiency and high heat dissipation.

=== Class B and AB ===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:EFFICIENCY_CLASS_AB.GIF|thumb|right|Demonstration of Theoretical efficiency of Class B amplifier]] --&gt;

Class B amplifiers use 2 active elements that each amplify one half of the input wave cycle. They create a little distortion as one device hands over to the other, but their efficiency is much better than Class A. '''Class B has a maximum theoretical efficiency of 78.5% (i.e., π/4).''' This is because there is zero quiescent current in the amplifying elements. 

A single Class B element is rarely found in practice, though it can be used in RF power amplifier where the distortion levels are less important. However Class C is more commonly used for this.

A practical circuit using Class B elements is the complementary pair or &quot;push–pull&quot; arrangement. Here, complementary (or quasi-complementary) devices are used to each amplify the opposite halves of the input signal, which is then recombined at the output. This arrangement gives excellent efficiency, but can suffer from the drawback that there is a small mismatch at the &quot;joins&quot; between the two halves of the signal. This is called crossover distortion. An improvement is to bias the devices so they are not completely off when they're not in use. This approach is called Class AB operation. 

In Class AB operation, each device operates the same way as in Class B over half the waveform, but also conducts a small amount on the other half. As a result, the region where both devices simultaneously are nearly off (the &quot;dead zone&quot;) is reduced. The result is that when the waveforms from the two devices are combined, the crossover is greatly minimised or eliminated.

Class AB sacrifices some efficiency over class B in favor of linearity, so will always be less efficient (below 78.5%). It is typically much more efficient than class A. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Electronic Amplifier Push-pull.png]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;Class B push–pull amplifier&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Class B or AB push–pull circuits are the most common design type found in audio power amplifiers. Class AB is widely considered a good compromise for audio amplifiers, with most of the efficiency of Class B, but little of its distortion.  Crossover distortion can be reduced further by negative feedback. Class B and AB amplifiers are sometimes used for RF linear amplifiers as well. Class B amplifiers are also favored in battery-operated devices, such as transistor radios.

=== Digital Class B ===
Class B amplifiers are in widespread use in logic ICs. They are much more efficient than class A, and are mostly only intended to provide logic 1 or 0 output. Some also provide high impedance output at times.

=== Class C ===
Class C amplifiers conduct less than 50% of the input signal, typically only conducting during input peaks. Distortion is high, but high efficiencies (up to 90%) are possible. Some applications (for example, megaphones) can tolerate the distortion. A much more common application for Class C amplifiers is in RF transmitters, where the distortion can be vastly reduced by using tuned loads on the amplifier stage. The input signal is used to switch the amplifying device on during peaks, and the complete waveform is recreated by tuned circuit.

The Class C amp has two modes of operation: tuned, and untuned.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Malvino, ''Electronic Principles'' (2nd Ed.1979. ISBN 0-07-039867-4) p.299.&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram below shows a waveform from a simple class C circuit without the tuned load. This is called untuned operation, and the analysis of the waveforms shows the massive distortion that appears in the signal. When the proper load (e.g., a pure LC filter) is used, two things happen. The first is that the output's bias level is &quot;clamped&quot;, so that the output variation is centered at one-half of the supply voltage. This is why tuned operation is sometimes called a &quot;clamper&quot;. This action of elevating bias level allows the waveform to be restored to its proper shape, allowing a complete waveform to be re-established despite having only a one-polarity supply. This is directly related to the second phenomenon: the waveform on the center frequency becomes much less distorted. The distortion that is present is dependent upon the bandwidth of the tuned load, with the center frequency seeing very little distortion, but greater attenuation the farther from the tuned frequency that the signal gets. 

The tuned circuit will only resonate at particular frequencies, and so the unwanted frequencies are dramatically suppressed, and the wanted full signal (sine wave) will be extracted by the tuned load (e.g., a high-quality bell will ring at a particular frequency when it is hit periodically with a hammer). Provided the transmitter is not required to operate over a very wide band of frequencies, this arrangement works extremely well. Other residual harmonics can be removed using a filter.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Electronic Amplifier Class C.png]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;Class C Amplifier&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Class D ===
[[Image:Pwm amp.svg|thumb|400px|Block diagram of a basic switching or PWM (Class-D) amplifier.]]

Class D amplifiers are much more efficient than Class AB power amplifiers. So Class D amplifiers use smaller lighter transformers and heatsinks. Power devices in a Class D amplifier are operated in on/off mode. Output stages such as those used in pulse generators are examples of class D amplifiers. The term usually applies to devices intended to reproduce signals with a bandwidth well below the switching frequency. 

These amplifiers use pulse width modulation, pulse density modulation (sometimes referred to as pulse frequency modulation) or more advanced form of modulation such as Delta-sigma modulation (for example, in the Analog Devices AD1990 Class-D audio power amplifier). 

The input signal is converted to a sequence of pulses whose averaged value is directly proportional to the instantaneous amplitude of the signal. The frequency of the pulses is typically ten or more times the highest frequency of interest in the input signal. The output of such an amplifier contains unwanted spectral components (that is, the pulse frequency and its harmonics) which must be removed by a passive filter. The resulting filtered signal is then an amplified replica of the input.

The main advantage of a class D amplifier is efficiency. Because the output pulses have a fixed amplitude, the switching elements (usually MOSFETs, but valves and bipolar transistors were once used) are switched either on or off, rather than operated in linear mode. This means that very little power is dissipated by the transistors, except during the very short interval between the on and off states. The wasted power is low because the instantaneous power dissipated in the transistor is the product of voltage and current, and one or the other is almost always close to zero.

Class D amplifiers can be controlled by either analog or digital circuits. The digital control introduces additional distortion called ''quantization error'' caused by its conversion of the input signal to a digital value.

Class D amplifiers have been widely used to control motors, and almost exclusively for small DC motors, but they are now also used as audio amplifiers, with circuitry to convert analogue to a much higher frequency pulse width modulated signal. The relative difficulty of achieving good audio quality means that nearly all are used in applications where quality is not a factor, such as laptops, modestly-priced bookshelf audio systems and &quot;DVD-receivers&quot; in mid-price home theater systems. 

High quality Class D audio amplifiers are now starting to appear in the market:
*Tripath have called their revised Class D designs Class T.
*Bang and Olufsen's ICEPower Class D system has been used in the Alpine PDX range and some Pioneer's PRS range and for other manufacturers' equipment.

These revised designs have been said to rival good traditional AB amplifiers in terms of quality.

Before these higher quality designs existed an earlier use of Class D amplifiers and prolific area of application was high-powered, subwoofer amplifiers in cars. Because subwoofers are generally limited to a bandwidth of no higher than 150Hz, the switching speed for the amplifier does not have to be as high as for a full range amplifier. The drawback with Class D designs being used to power subwoofers is that their output filters (typically inductors that convert the pulse width signal back into an analogue waveform) lower the damping factor of the amplifier. 

This means that the amplifier cannot prevent the subwoofer's reactive nature from lessening the impact of low bass sounds (as explained in the feedback part of the Class AB section). 
Class D amplifiers for driving subwoofers are relatively inexpensive, in comparison to Class AB amplifiers. A 1000 watt Class D subwoofer amplifier that can operate at about 80% to 95% efficiency costs about $250 USD, much less than a Class AB amplifier of this power, which would cost several thousand dollars.

The letter ''D'' used to designate this amplifier class is simply the next letter after ''C'', and does not stand for ''digital''. Class D and Class E amplifiers are sometimes mistakenly described as &quot;digital&quot; because the output waveform superficially resembles a pulse-train of digital symbols, but a Class D amplifier merely converts an input waveform into a continuously pulse-width modulated (square wave) analog signal. (A digital waveform would be pulse-code modulated.)

=== Special classes ===
==== Class E ====

The class E/F amplifier is a highly efficient switching power amplifier, typically used at such high frequencies that the switching time becomes comparable to the duty time. As said in the class-D amplifier the transistor is connected via a serial-LC-circuit to the load,
and connected via a large L (inductance) to the supply voltage. The supply voltage is connected to ground via a large capacitor to prevent any RF-signals leaking into the supply. The class-E amplifier adds a ''C'' between the transistor and ground and uses a defined ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to connect to the supply voltage.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Classe E.svg]] &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;Class E Amplifier&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The following description ignores DC, which can be added afterwards easily.
The above mentioned ''C'' (''C1'' in the figure) and L are in effect a parallel LC-circuit to ground. When the transistor is on, it pushes through the serial LC-circuit into the load and some current begins to flow to the parallel LC-circuit to ground. Then the serial LC-circuit swings back and compensates the current into the parallel LC-circuit. At this point the current through the transistor is zero and it is switched off. Both LC-circuits are now filled with energy in the C and the L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The whole circuit performs a damped oscillation. The damping by the load has been adjusted so that some time later the energy from the Ls is gone into the load, but the energy in both C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; peaks at the original value, to in turn restore the original voltage, so that the voltage across the transistor is zero again and it can be switched on.

With load, frequency, and duty cycle (0.5) as given parameters and the constraint that the voltage is not only restored, but peaks at the original voltage, the four parameters (L, L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C and C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) are determined. The class F-amplifier takes the finite on resistance into account and tries to make the current touch the bottom at zero. This means the voltage and the current at the transistor are symmetric with respect to time. The Fourier Transform allows an elegant formulation to generate the complicated LC-networks. It says that the first harmonic is passed into the load, all even harmonics are shorted and all higher odd harmonics are open.

==== Class F and the even harmonics ====

In push–pull amplifiers and in CMOS the even harmonics of both transistors just cancel. Experiment tells that a square wave can be generated by those amplifiers and math tells that square waves do consist of odd harmonics only. In a class D amplifier the output filter blocks all harmonics, that means the harmonics see an open load. So even small currents in the harmonics suffice to generate a voltage square wave. The current is in phase with the voltage applied to filter, but the voltage across the transistors is out of phase. Therefore there is a minimal overlap between current through the transistors and voltage across the transistors. The sharper the edges the lower the overlap. 

While class D sees the transistors and the load as two separate modules the class F admits imperfections like the parasitics of the transistor and tries to optimise the global system to have a high impedance at the harmonics. Of course there has to be a finite voltage across the transistor to push the current across the on state resistance. Because the combined current through both transistors is mostly in the first harmonic it looks like a sine. That means that in the middle of the square the maximum of current has to flow, so it may make sense to have a dip in the square or in other words to allow some over swing of the voltage square wave. A class F load network by definition has to transmit below a cut off frequency and to reflect above. 

Any frequency lying below the cut off and having its second harmonic above the cut off can be amplified, that is an octave bandwidth. On the other hand an LC series circuit with a large L and a tunable C may be simpler to implement. By reducing the duty cycle below 0.5, the output amplitude can be modulated. The voltage square waveform will degrade, but any overheating is compensated by the lower overall power flowing. Any load mismatch behind the filter can only act on the first harmonic current waveform, clearly only a purely resistive load makes sense, then the lower the resistance the higher the current. 

Class F can be driven by sine or by a square wave, for a sine the input can be tuned by an L to increase gain. If class F is implemented with a single transistor the filter is complicated to short the even harmonics. All previous designs use sharp edges to minimise the overlap.
Class E uses a significant amount of second harmonic voltage. The second harmonic can be used to reduce the overlap with edges with finite sharpness. For this to work energy on the second harmonic has to flow from the load into the transistor, and no source for this is visible in the circuit diagram. In reality the impedance is mostly reactive and the only reason for it is that class E is a class F amplifier with a very simplified load network and thus has to deal with imperfections. 

In many amateur simulations of class E amplifiers sharp current edges are assumed nullifying the very motivation for class E and measurements near the transit frequency of the transistors show very symmetric curves, which look much similar to class F simulations.
The class E amplifier was invented in 1972 by Nathan O. Sokal and Alan D. Sokal, and details were first published in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;N. O. Sokal and A. D. Sokal, &quot;Class E — A New Class of High-Efficiency Tuned Single-Ended Switching Power Amplifiers&quot;, ''IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits'', vol. SC-10, pp. 168–176, June 1975.
HVK&lt;/ref&gt; Some earlier reports on this operating class have been published in Russian.

==== Class G and H ====

There is a variety of amplifier designs that couple a class AB output stage with other more efficient techniques to achieve a higher efficiency with low distortion. These designs are common in large audio amplifiers since the heatsinks and power transformers would be prohibitively large (and costly) without the increase in efficiency. The terms &quot;class G&quot; and &quot;class H&quot; are used interchangeably to refer to different designs, varying in definition from one manufacturer or paper to another.

Class G amplifiers (which use &quot;rail switching&quot; to decrease power consumption and increase efficiency) are a more efficient than class AB amplifiers. The  class G amplifier has several power rails at different voltages, and switches between rails as the signal output approaches each. Thus the amplifier increases efficiency by reducing the wasted power at the output transistors.

[[Image:ClassG.svg]]

A Class H amplifier takes the idea of Class G one step further creating an infinitely variable supply rail. This is done by modulating the supply rails so that the rails are only a few volts larger than the output signal at any given time. The output stage operates at its maximum efficiency all the time. Switched mode power supplies can be used to create the tracking rails. Significant efficiency gains can be achieved but with the drawback of more complicated supply design and reduced THD performance.

[[Image:ClassH.svg]]
*[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/EfficienzaH.GIF Efficiency Class H]
The classes can be most easily understood using the diagrams in each section below. For the sake of illustration, a bipolar junction transistor is shown as the amplifying device, but in practice this could be a MOSFET or vacuum tube device. In an analog amplifier (the most common kind), the signal is applied to the input terminal of the device (base, gate or grid), and this causes a proportional output drive current to flow out of the output terminal. The output drive current comes from the power supply. 

The voltage signal shown is thus a larger version of the input, but has been changed in sign (inverted) by the amplification. Other arrangements of amplifying device are possible, but that given (that is, common emitter, common source or common cathode) is the easiest to understand and employ in practice. If the amplifying element is linear, then the output will be faithful copy of the input, only larger and inverted. In actual practice, transistors are not linear, and the output will only approximate the input. Non-linearity from any of several sources is the origin of distortion within an amplifier. Which class of amplifier (A, B, AB or C) depends on how the amplifying device is biased — in the diagrams the bias circuits are omitted for clarity.

Any real amplifier is an imperfect realization of an ideal amplifier. One important limitation of a real amplifier is that the output it can generate is ultimately limited by the power available from the power supply. An amplifier will saturate and clip the output if the input signal becomes too large for the amplifier to reproduce or if operational limits for a device are exceeded.

=== Amplifier circuit ===

The practical amplifier circuit below could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier. It features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class AB push–pull output stage, and uses some overall negative feedback. Bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realizable with FETs or valves.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Amplifier Circuit Small.svg|500px|A practical amplifier circuit]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;A practical amplifier circuit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The input signal is coupled through capacitor C1 to the base of transistor Q1. The capacitor allows the AC signal to pass, but blocks the DC bias voltage established by resistors R1 and R2 so that any preceding circuit is not affected by it. Q1 and Q2 form a differential amplifier (an amplifier that multiplies the difference between two inputs by some constant), in an arrangement known as a long-tailed pair. This arrangement is used to conveniently allow the use of negative feedback, which is fed from the output to Q2 via R7 and R8. 

The negative feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier to compare the input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a [[/Common emitter|common emitter]] stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (A better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in Class A. The output pair are arranged in Class AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide the majority of the current amplification and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).

This design is simple, but a good basis for a practical design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. Further circuit elements would probably be found in a real design that would roll off the frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted oscillation. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors — if the output transistors turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage. 

A common solution to help stabilise the output devices is to include some emitter resistors, typically an ohm or so. Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amp.

=== Notes on implementation ===

Real world amplifiers are imperfect.
*One consequence is that the power supply itself may influence the output, and must itself be considered when designing the amplifier
*The amplifier circuit has an &quot;open loop&quot; performance, that can be described by various parameters (gain, slew rate, output impedance, distortion, bandwidth, signal to noise ratio ...)
*Many modern amplifiers use negative feedback techniques to hold the gain at the desired value, reduce distortion and improve frequency response.

Different methods of supplying power result in many different methods of bias. Bias is a technique by which the active devices are set up to operate in a particular regime, or by which the DC component of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; there are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. Class A amplifiers generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide both positive and negative voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. Class C amps, by definition, use a single polarity supply.

Most amplifiers have multiple stages in cascade to increase gain. Each stage of these designs may be a different type of amp to suit the needs of that stage. For instance, the first stage might be a Class A stage, feeding a class AB push–pull second stage, which then drives a class G final output stage, taking advantage of the strengths of each type, while minimizing their weaknesses.

== Files from Commons ==

Please don't upload files from commons. You can already use Commons files on Wikibooks (and any other Wikimedia project). I've deleted the two you uploaded recently, they can be referenced here as [[:File:Bimanual alphabet.jpg]] and [[:File:Klallam people at Port Townsend.jpg]].

If you are going to upload a file under a free license, you should upload it to Commons if it may be useful to the wider community. Please also remember to cite the source of images you upload. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:29, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

Oops! I thought it referenced automatically when I inserted all the information during the upload process. Thank you for the note! --[[User:Klokow7568|Klokow7568]] ([[User talk:Klokow7568|talk]]) 23:39, 8 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|XML Tools|Threading}}

Python includes several modules in the standard library for working with emails and email servers.

==Sending mail==

Sending mail is done with Python's &lt;code&gt;smtplib&lt;/code&gt; using an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server. Actual usage varies depending on complexity of the email and settings of the email server, the instructions here are based on sending email through Google's Gmail.

The first step is to create an SMTP object, each object is used for connection with one server.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import smtplib
server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
&lt;/source&gt;

The first argument is the server's hostname, the second is the port. The port used varies depending on the server.

Next, we need to do a few steps to set up the proper connection for sending mail.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
server.ehlo()
server.starttls()
server.ehlo()
&lt;/source&gt;
These steps may not be necessary depending on the server you connect to. ehlo() is used for [[w:ESMTP|ESMTP]] servers, for non-ESMTP servers, use helo() instead. See Wikipedia's article about the [[w:Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] protocol for more information about this. The starttls() function starts [[w:Transport Layer Security|Transport Layer Security]] mode, which is required by Gmail. Other mail systems may not use this, or it may not be available. 

Next, log in to the server:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
server.login(&quot;youremailusername&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Then, send the mail:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
msg = &quot;\nHello!&quot; # The /n separates the message from the headers (which we ignore for this example)
server.sendmail(&quot;you@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;target@example.com&quot;, msg)
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that this is a rather crude example, it doesn't include a subject, or any other headers. For that, one should use the &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; package.

== The &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; package ==
Python's email package contains many classes and functions for composing and parsing email messages, this section only covers a small subset useful for sending emails.

We start by only importing only the classes we need, this also saves us from having to use the full module name later.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
from email.MIMEMultipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.MIMEText import MIMEText
&lt;/source&gt;

Then we compose some of the basic message headers:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
fromaddr = &quot;you@gmail.com&quot;
toaddr = &quot;target@example.com&quot;
msg = MIMEMultipart()
msg['From'] = fromaddr
msg['To'] = toaddr
msg['Subject'] = &quot;Python email&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Next, we attach the body of the email to the MIME message:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
body = &quot;Python test mail&quot;
msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
&lt;/source&gt;

For sending the mail, we have to convert the object to a string, and then use the same prodecure as above to send using the SMTP server..
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import smtplib
server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
server.ehlo()
server.starttls()
server.ehlo()
server.login(&quot;youremailusername&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)
text = msg.as_string()
server.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddr, text)
&lt;/source&gt;

If we look at the text, we can see it has added all the necessary headers and structure necessary for a MIME formatted email. See [[w:MIME|MIME]] for more details on the standard:
{{dropimage|The full text of our example message|width=650|&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print text
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=&quot;===============1893313573==&quot;
MIME-Version: 1.0
From: you@gmail.com
To: target@example.com
Subject: Python email

--===============1893313573==
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Python test mail
--===============1893313573==--
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

      <comment>/* Some more properties */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Definition 1''': Let (R,+,.) be a ring. A non empty subset S of R is called a '''subring''' of R if (S,+,.) is a ring.

For example the set &lt;math&gt;m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; which stands for &lt;math&gt;\{0,\pm m,\pm 2m\cdots\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of the ring of integers, the set of Gaussian integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[i]&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_4&lt;/math&gt; has the set &lt;math&gt;\{\overline{0},\overline{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; as a subring under addition and multiplication modulo 4.

'''Theorem 1.15''': A non empty subset S of a ring R is a subring of R iff (i)&lt;math&gt;a-b\in S&lt;/math&gt; and (ii)&lt;math&gt;ab\in S \forall a,b\in S&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''': The proof is an elementary consequence of a similar theorem about groups. Clearly necessity is clear. For sufficiency, note that 0=a-a is in S, -a=0-a is in S and a+b=a-(-b) is also in S. Other properties of a ring follow trivially.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.16''': The intersection of two subrings of a ring R is a subring of R.

'''Proof''': Let S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be two subrings and &lt;math&gt;a,b\in S_1\cap S_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;a-b,ab\in S_1\cap S_2&lt;/math&gt; as they are also in S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. (Note that the intersection is nonempty as it defnitely contains 0). But then the result holds by the previous theorem.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the corresponding result about unions may not be true. For example the union of &lt;math&gt;2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; has 3 and 2 but not their difference 1 and so is not a subring of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition 2''': The '''center''' of a ring R is defined as the set &lt;math&gt;Z(R)=\{a\in R: xa=ax \forall x\in R\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 1.17''': The center of a ring R is a subring of R.

'''Proof''': Clearly if a and b are two elements in the center then for any x in R x(a-b)=xa-xb=ax-bx=(a-b)x and x(ab)=xab=axb=abx=(ab)x and so both a-b and ab are in the center. The result follows now from Theorem 1.15.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.18''': The center of a division ring is a field.

'''Proof''': If R is a division ring, then its center contains the identity 1 as x1=1x=x for all x. Also if a is in the center and ab=ba=1 then for any x, xb=x1b=xabb=axbb and so x=axb. Now bx=baxb=1xb=xb and so b is also in the center. Hence each element's inverse is also in the center. Finally note that that the elements commute with each other as they do so with all other elements of R. Other properties of a field follow by virtue of R being a division ring.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;.

==Some more properties==
These problems should be first tried as exercises by the reader.

'''Theorem 1.19''': If a is a fixed element of a ring R, show that &lt;math&gt;I_a=\{x\in R:ax=0\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of R.

'''Proof''': Clearly if x,y are two elements in R then a(x-y)=ax-ay=0-0=0 and a(xy)=axy=0y=0 and so I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is a subring.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.20''':If A and B are two subrings of a ring R then their '''sum''' is defined as the set &lt;math&gt;A+B=\{a+b:a\in A, b\in B\}&lt;/math&gt;. Show that the sum of two subrings need not be a subring.

'''Proof''': Consider the ring M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of 2x2 matrices with entries belonging to the integers. (Check that this is indeed a ring.) It is easy to verify that the sets &lt;math&gt;S=\{\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}  a&amp;0\\ b&amp;0\end{smallmatrix} \bigr):a,b\in \mathbb{Z}\}, T=\{\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}  0&amp;c\\ 0&amp;0\end{smallmatrix} \bigr):c\in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt; are subrings of M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However their sum which contains the matrices &lt;math&gt;\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}  1&amp;1\\ 1&amp;0\end{smallmatrix} \bigr)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}  2&amp;2\\ 2&amp;0\end{smallmatrix} \bigr)&lt;/math&gt; doesn't contain their product which is &lt;math&gt;\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}  4&amp;2\\ 2&amp;2\end{smallmatrix} \bigr)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence sum of two subrings need not be a subring.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 1.21''': An element &lt;math&gt;x\in R&lt;/math&gt; is called '''idempotent''' if x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=x. Let e be an idempotent in a ring R. Show that &lt;math&gt;eRe=\{eae:a\in R\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of R with unity e.

'''Proof''': Clearly if x,y are in eRe then x=eae and y=ebe for some a,b in R. Then x-y=eae-ebe=e(a-b)e and so x-y is in eRe. Also xy=eaeebe=eaebe=e(aeb)e and so xy is in eRe. Hence eRe is a subring. Finally note that xe=eaee=eae=x and ex=eeae=eae=x and so e is the unity of eRe.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;.

==Exercises==
1. Show that the '''normalizer''' N(a) of a element a of a ring R defined by &lt;math&gt;N(a)=\{x\in R:xa=ax\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of R.

2. A non empty subset S of a field (F,+,.) is called a '''subfield''' of F is (S,+,.) is a field. Show that a subset S of a field F, containing at least two elements is a subfield of F iff (i)&lt;math&gt;a-b\in S\forall a,b\in S&lt;/math&gt; and (ii)&lt;math&gt;ab^{-1}\in S\forall a\in S,b(\ne 0)\in S&lt;/math&gt;.

      <comment>Adding a link to an old Wikipedia talk page about negative resistance</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I start here maybe the most interesting discussion about differential negative resistors concerning two unique operation modes - ''linear'' and ''bistable''. Linear applications include various exotic 1-port amplifiers (e.g., legendary tunnel diode amplifier). A lot of interesting negative resistor applications are based on bistable mode: exotic switching circuits with dual-treshold action ([[hysteresis]]), memory circuits (flip-flops), etc. Later, we might copy or move this discussion to [[w:Negative differential resistance|negative differential resistance]] page where its place is but now we have to ascertain if the differential negative resistors obey the definition. Please, join the discussion; the topic is extremely interesting and important.

==== Differential negative resistor operating in linear mode ====

Obviously, this definition is formulated especially for differential negative resistance but, unfortunately, it has problems even in this case. The definition is correct only if the differential negative resistor operates in linear mode (i.e., if we drive a current-driven differential negative resistor by a current and if we drive a voltage-driven differential negative resistor by a voltage). Let's ascertain it.

[[Image:Linear_voltage-driven_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3. An increasing voltage across a voltage-driven differential negative resistance results in a decreasing current and v.v.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_current-driven_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. An increasing current through a current-driven differential negative resistance results in a decreasing voltage drop and v.v.&lt;/center&gt;]]

As a rule, electronics resources show the IV curve of a differential negative resistance in its final N or S shape (e.g., see a [[:Image:Negative differential resistance.png|bare curve]]) and note there is a section with a negative slope. But nobody shows how this magic is done and what it actually means. Only, in order to grasp the idea of differential negative resistance, it is extremely important to show exactly how and why this part of the curve is inclined to the left. Here is the secret of the phenomenon.

The trick is extremely simple, clear and intuitive: this is the great ''dynamizing idea'' that is brought here to the utmost degree. A differential negative resistor is notning more than a kind of &quot;self-varying&quot;, dynamic resistor that changes extremely its instant (ohmic, &quot;positive&quot;) resistance depending on the current passing through the resistor or on the voltage applied across it; ''a differential negative resistor is actually an over-dynamic resistor.'' I have shown the evolution of this great idea in a circuit story&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/r_decreased_resistance/r_decreased_resistance.htm How do we make decreased, zero and negative differential resistance?]&lt;/ref&gt; about S-shaped differential negative resistors (I have placed a reference to this story for your convenience, not to promote myself).

===== Applying a voltage across a voltage-driven differential negative resistance =====

Look at Fig. 3 to see how a voltage-driven differential resistor having an N-shaped IV curve behaves, in order to do this magic in the area of the negative resistance. In this graphical representation, I have superimposed the IV curves of the input voltage source (in a red color) and the differential negative resistor (in blue) on a common coordinate system. In addition, to make things absolutely clear, I have superimposed the IV curve of the instant ohmic resistance R (in orange) as well. Now, turn on your most human mental faculty - your [http://thinkexist.com/quotation/imagination_is_more_important_than_knowledge-for/260230.html imagination], and visualize in your [[Mind's eye|mind's eye]] what happens when the input voltage begins varying.

For example, when the input voltage begins increasing, its IV curve moves horizontally from left to right remaining parallel to itself. If the resistor was &quot;static&quot;, the crossing (operating) point would [[:Image:Voltage-driven_resistor_graph_1000.jpg|slide]] along the IV curve of its ohmic resistance having a positive slope. But it is a more &quot;clever&quot;:) dynamic resistor (like my opponents in this talk page:). So, it begins changing (in this case, increasing) its instant ohmic resistance R and rotating vigorously its IV curve clockwise. As a result, a wonder happens and the operating point slides along a hew IV curve having a negative slope. Note this is not a real curve as the ohmic IV curve is. It is an artificial, a synthetic, an imaginative IV curve; it is an illusion.

Does this case obey the definition, &quot;...an increasing current in the circuit results in a decreasing voltage...&quot;? No, as the voltage jumps in the negative resistance region (see [[#Passing a current through a voltage-driven differential negative resistance|below]]).

===== Passing a current through a current-driven differential negative resistance =====

A current-driven differential resistor with an S-shaped IV curve (Fig. 4) has the opposite crafty behavior:) - when the input current increases, it decreases its instant ohmic resistance R and rotates vigorously its IV curve contraclockwise. Now, the operating point slides upwards along a hew IV curve having a negative slope as [[#Differential negative resistor operating in linear mode|above]]. 

Does this case obey the definition now? Yes, if we only replace &quot;voltage&quot; with &quot;voltage drop&quot;:

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Differential negative resistor operating in bistable mode ====

''If the differential negative resistor operates in bistable mode (i.e., if we drive a current-driven differential negative resistor by a voltage and if we drive a voltage-driven differential negative resistor by a current), the definition is not true.''

I give an opportunity to you to see why the definition has failed in these cases. If you do not manage, I will elucidate why. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 22:05, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

=Collijen Defense=
==4. Bc4==
4. Bc4 gambits a second pawn.  It develops the light-squared bishop to a place attacking blacks weakest square (F7)

This position often leads to the Danish Gambit after [[cxb2]].  Black almost always takes the pawn although he could play knight to c6 or f6 transposing into the Goring Gambit if white captures the pawn with his knight.

In one rare line, black advances his pawn to c2, not wanting to let white develop his dark squared bishop onto the long diagonal.

A '''solar panel''' converts the power of the sun into either electricity (where it is called 'photovoltaic') or heat (where it is called 'solar thermal').

==Who invented it?==
Currently it is unknown who invented the solar cell, but it was invented in Germany.

==How does it get power? ==
Solar panels get their power from the sun.  That is why they are called 'solar' panels because solar means sun in Latin.

==How does it work?==
It transforms solar power into regular electricity using the photovoltaic effect. 
==How dangerous is it?==
It is not very dangerous, but if you look at it too long, the reflected sunlight could damage your eyes. Also, solar panels can get very hot in summer, especially solar thermal ones.

==What does it do?==
It transforms power from light into regular electricity in large amounts usually (as there are small solar cells too). It contains lots of solar cells that do this.
==How does it vary?==
Solar power is a source of clean energy.  By covering just 2% of the earths surface, solar panels could provide enough energy for the current needs of the whole planet. Doing so could cause other problems like reducing the amount of land for growing food.

==What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created?==
==How much does it cost?==
In 1998, it was said that the cost per watt was about $4.50, which is 33 times lower than the cost in 1970 of $150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Intro==
Op Amp is a short hand term for Operational Amplifier. An operational amplifier is a circuit component that amplifies the difference of two input voltages:
:;V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = A (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

Op Amps are usually packaged as an 8-pin integrated circuit.

Op Amp symbol
[[image:opamppinouts.png|nhỏ|200|op-amp]]
*V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;: non-inverting input
*V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;: inverting input
*V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;: output
*V&lt;sub&gt;S+&lt;/sub&gt;: positive power supply
*V&lt;sub&gt;S&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;: negative power supply

Op amps amplify AC signal or AC Voltage better than a simple bipolar junction transistor.

=== Differentiator ===

[[Image:opampdifferentiating.svg|thumb|Differentiating amplifier]]

=== Instrumentation amplifier ===

[[Image:Opampinstrumentation.svg|thumb|Instrumentation amplifier]]


Combines very high input impedance, high common-mode rejection, low DC offset, and other properties used in making very accurate, low-noise measurements

* Is made by adding a [[#inverting amplifier|inverting]] buffer to each input of the [[#Differential amplifier|differential amplifier]] to increase the input impedance.

{{clear}}

=== Schmitt trigger ===

[[Image:Opampschmitt_xcircuit.svg|thumb|Schmitt trigger]]

A comparator with hysteresis

Hysteresis from &lt;math&gt;\frac{-R_1}{R_2}V_{sat}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\frac{R_1}{R_2}V_{sat}&lt;/math&gt;.

{{clear}}

=== Gyrator ===

[[Image:Gyrator.svg|thumb|Inductance gyrator]]

A gyrator can transform impedances. Here a capacitor is changed into an inductor. 

:&lt;math&gt; L = R_\mathrm{L} R C &lt;/math&gt;

{{clear}}

=== Zero level detector ===

Voltage divider reference

* Zener sets reference voltage

{{clear}}

=== Negative impedance converter (NIC) ===

[[Image:Negative_impedance_converter.svg|thumb|Negative impedance converter]]


Creates a resistor having a negative value for any signal generator

* In this case, the ratio between the input voltage and the input current (thus the input resistance) is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{in} = - R_3 \frac{R_1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

{{clear}}

== Non-linear configurations ==

=== Rectifier ===

[[Image:Super_diode.svg|thumb|Super diode]]

Behaves like an ideal diode for the load, which is here represented by a generic resistor &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

* This basic configuration has some limitations.  For more information and to know the configuration that is actually used, see the main article.

{{clear}}

=== Peak detector ===

[[Image:PeakDet.svg|thumb|Peak detector]]

When the switch is closed, the output goes to zero volts. When the switch is opened for a certain time interval, the capacitor will charge to the maximum input voltage attained during that time interval. 

The charging time of the capacitor must be much shorter than the period of the highest appreciable frequency component of the input voltage.

{{clear}}

=== Logarithmic output ===

[[Image:Opamplogarithm.svg|thumb|Logarithmic configuration]]

* The relationship between the input voltage &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{in}&lt;/math&gt; and the output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{out}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{out} = -V_{\gamma} \ln \left( \frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{I_\mathrm{S} \cdot R} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''saturation current''.

* If the operational amplifier is considered ideal, the negative pin is virtually grounded, so the current flowing into the resistor from the source (and thus through the diode to the output, since the op-amp inputs draw no current) is:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{R} = I_\mathrm{R} = I_\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the current through the diode. As known, the relationship between the current and the voltage for a diode is:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{D} = I_\mathrm{S} \left( e^{\frac{V_\mathrm{D}}{V_{\gamma}}} - 1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This, when the voltage is greater than zero, can be approximated by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{D} \simeq I_\mathrm{S} e^{V_\mathrm{D} \over V_{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;

Putting these two formulae together and considering that the output voltage &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{out}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of the voltage across the diode &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt;, the relationship is proven. 

Note that this implementation does not consider temperature stability and other non-ideal effects.

{{clear}}

=== Exponential output===

[[Image:Opampexponential.svg|thumb|Exponential configuration]]

* The relationship between the input voltage &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{in}&lt;/math&gt; and the output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{out}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{out} = - R I_\mathrm{S} e^{v_\mathrm{in} \over V_{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''saturation current''.

* Considering the operational amplifier ideal, then the negative pin is virtually grounded, so the current through the diode is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{D} = I_\mathrm{S} \left( e^{\frac{V_\mathrm{D}}{V_{\gamma}}} - 1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

when the voltage is greater than zero, it can be approximated by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{D} \simeq I_\mathrm{S} e^{V_\mathrm{D} \over V_{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;

The output voltage is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{out} = -R I_\mathrm{D}\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>Added an entry to reflect the changes to the &quot;flying Through a Canyon tutorial.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is for suggesting and tracking ongoing maintenance for the book &quot;Blender 3D: Noob to Pro&quot;.  If you want to add another suggestion to the list there that isn't already there, go ahead.  If you have a problem with one of the suggestions or want to remove one, please discuss the reason why on the [[Talk:Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Todo|talk page]] first.

== Pages to take care of ==
=== Unit 1 and Unit 2 ===
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/FAQ]] The page is outdated and the answers are not very good. The FAQ page does not fit well in the scope of the book. We could use a FAQ about the book itself though. There are better FAQs around. Suggestion: rewrite the page to make working with the book easier.
: I rewrote it to be clearer about its (the page's) purpose and make it more readable, without changing the content. I think it's a worthwhile page, though not really a FAQ per se. We could possibly rename it ''About This Book'' or something. [[User:Dolsson5|Dolsson5]] ([[User talk:Dolsson5|talk]]) 05:18, 12 May 2010 (UTC)
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Introducing Meshes]] This page is very confusing and redundant, repeating information found in many of the other tutorials. Suggestion: break any non-redundant info into the Modeling a Person tutorial or other related tutorials.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Curve and Path Modeling]] The page is useless, and the scope is not clear. Suggestion: add examples and show what we're going to show.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Intro to Bezier Curves]] Suggestion: remove the noob notes and include them in the text. Add images for the second part. There is an edited version of the page, check that and eventually replace the text.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Making Your Creation Smoother]] Wrong title, little content. Suggestions: rename the page to &quot;Working with MetaObjects&quot; (or similar) and add content.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Materials and Textures]] Little content. Suggestion: add examples and show the general way to go. There is a nice tutorial page at [[:de:Blender Dokumentation/ Tutorials/ Texturen/ Texturtypen]] in German, so the images could be used. This tutorial is in English already in the manual, so maybe we don't need it here.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Procedural Textures]] Little content. Suggestion: add content. Either [[:de:http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender Dokumentation: Prozedurale Texturen]] or more tutorial like [[:de:Blender Dokumentation/ Tutorials/ Texturen/ Holz]].
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Image Textures]] Very little content. Suggestion: add content. It would be an important tutorial.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating Basic Seawater]] Practically no content. Suggestion: remove the page or, but more preferably, update heavily.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Texturing Basic Seawater]] No usable content. Suggestion: remove the page or, but more preferably, update heavily. Note: This page has been merged into [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating Basic Seawater]].
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Mountains Out Of Molehills 2]] Screenshots would be useful. Suggestion: add screenshots of the settings.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/The Rusty Ball]] Too little content. Suggestion: add content or remove.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Procedural Eyeball]] Needs images. Suggestion: add images.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/UV Map Basics]] Version unclear. Suggestion: Add version notes.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Realistic Eyes In Blender]] An image file is missing. Looks great though. Suggestion: create the image file again and upload it with clear copyright.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Light a Silver Goblet]] Wrong position in the manual. Suggestion: move to lighting.

=== Unit 3 ===
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Beginning Lighting]] Very short page. Suggestion: This is an important yet extremely difficult page to write. Would need examples for different light setups. Or we just leave it as an introductory page without any real content?
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Adding Lamps]] Not so good example images at the beginning. The purpose of these examples is unclear. Suggestion: there is a quite good introduction to lighting in the manual at [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Tutorials/Lighting/BSoD], so maybe this article is not so important.  
* Missing page: Shadows!
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Faked Gi with Blender internal]] Quite a good page, but maybe a bit more text would be useful. Suggestion: Reword the noob notes, put them directly in the text.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/OSA]] The different OSA types are not explained, the information could be more complete and more precise. Suggestion: add more information. Images could be used directly from [[:de:Blender Dokumentation: Anti-Aliasing]], text would have to be translated.  
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Animation]] This page has much too little information. Suggestion: the manual is much better in this point. Leave the page in the state being? Or rework completely, though it would require a blender master to do it properly. 
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Animation/ScreenLayout]] Very little information. Suggestion: add content, would be useful.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating Basic Water animation]] It may be difficult to follow. Suggestion: add images which show the settings and give more information. Maybe use [[:de:Blender Dokumentation: Die erste Fluidanimation]] this tutorial in German and translate it? Nice thing about wikibooks: you don't have to upload new images but can simply reuse existing images from other wikibooks.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Flying Through A Canyon]] Argh, no images. Suggestion: add images.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Simple Cloth Animation]] No images. Works with Softbodys, not with the cloth system, so the title may be misleading. Suggestion: move the page (better title). Add images.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Soft Body with wind]] Missing image of the result. Suggestion: create a new one and upload it.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Your First Test]] This is about the game engine. Suggestion: move the page so that it gets a better title.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Match Moving]] The article is marked as a stub. Suggestion: rework the page. Maybe there is no good internal solution, so that a listing of external solutions is useful here?
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Beginning Modeling Final Project]] Purpose of this page is unclear. It is not very specific. Suggestion: add more specific advice, it may be a useful page.

=== Unit 4 === 
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/HDRi]] This and the following page is in the wrong section. It belongs to lighting. Suggestion: move the page to the appropriate place.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Realistic Water using Fluid Sim and Yafray]] This seems to be a better fluid sim tutorial. Suggestion: merge with the first FS tutorial.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/BBB's Particles -- New 2.46 Particle System]] Content is already at another place. Suggestion: remove the page.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Textures]] Page has practically no content. Wrong pagename. Suggestion: Remove page.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Bump Mapping]] Page has practically no content. Wrong pagename. Suggestion: Remove page.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Normal Mapping]] Wrong section. Suggestion: rename page and move it to another place in the TOC.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Texture Normal Mapping]] Wrong section. Suggestion: rename page and move it to another place in the TOC.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Color Map Normal Mapping]] Wrong section. Suggestion: rename page and move it to another place in the TOC.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Light Mapping]] Page has practically no content. Wrong pagename. Suggestion: Remove page.

== Suggestions ==
* Standardize the commands and instructions to one keyboard layout and operating system (i.e. Linux QWERTY United States English) and break out the alternative options (e.g. differences on Mac or DVORAK) into side boxes so they don't interfere with readability. The troubleshooting and alternative command options interfere with the readability of instruction steps because you have to wade through excess irrelevant information. these alternatives should be migrated either to the end of each article/section or to some offset side boxes with labels like &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; and &quot;alternative command sequences&quot; so that each set of instruction steps stands alone, so it's easy to separate the actual instruction sequence from the side notes and easy to pick out the differences between your system and the system the book/tutorial was written for. Alternatively make each page devoted to one OS, and do other pages, e.g.: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Making_Fire?linux etc. (note: other OS's will have their own ID, such as linux, win, mac, etc., these should be self explanatory). This link will obviously lead back to the ordinary page http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Making_Fire.
: OS separation is neither useful nor necessary. Only a few pages about the interface would contain any real differences.  --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 19:51, 2 June 2009 (UTC)
* The ideal layout would be completely writing out and capitalizing the keys, like Control-S, Alt-V, and Super-Q. &quot;Meta&quot;, &quot;Windows Key&quot;, and &quot;Command&quot; should not be used, but the difference (as stated above) should be in some little box called &quot;Formatting Conventions&quot; near the beginning.. &quot;Keystrip 5&quot; and &quot;Numpad 5&quot; would be a good way to differentiate between number keys, and letter keys should always be capitalized if they are being instructed to be pressed.
* Always provide the regular Menu path to get to a command (at least the first time) or note that a regular Menu path doesn't exist. Too often the only option provided is a key sequence and the location of the command in the menus is not shown/known. Hot keys should be more along the lines of optional to learn, though obviously in blender it's good to know some of your standard keys, and some key commands possibly don't have a menu equivalent, but Menu paths should always be provided (if they exist) at least the first time a command or key is used/introduced.
* The intro of the book states that beginners need to read the chapters in sequence but there is a lot of repetition of the beginner information in later tutorials. Again this reduces readability because one must wade through irrelevant information. Remove the beginner explanations from later tutorials and instead include a disclaimer at the top noting the other pre-requisite tutorials.
* The inter linking of many pages does not fit to the TOC of the book, this should be fixed. 
* Cleanup the &quot;beginner&quot; tutorials section of this book, many tutorials do not seem that beginner and are not even that clear.
* Redo the beginning section to have a continuous sequence of tutorials.
* Remove most of the chapter style links connecting unrelated tutorials and instead list the tutorials by subject matter (similar to [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List|this]])
* Have a link in the modules going back to tutorial indexes sorted by difficulty and / or subject (i.e.:&quot;back to beginner tutorials list&quot; instead of &quot;next chapter&quot;) 
* Remove the &quot;noob note&quot; discussions on the modules and move them over to the talk pages.
* Link to related content that helps readers locate tutorials that explain topics which the current one assumes knowledge of (similar to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[:Template:Japanese related]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for the Japanese wikibook)
* Add a version note to each tutorial and each image. For the images this should be done by the uploader.
* Move the mostly unfinished (or unreadable) articles into a development section (similar to [[How To Assemble A Desktop PC/Development]]), then move them back into the book once they reach a more complete / understandable state
* Move all the external links to the tutorial links list, or remove them simply, because they didn't belong here anyway. 
* Create a page about the scope and the purpose of the book
* Add a flag for excellent tutorials, that may be used as a guideline on how to write tutorials.

== Done ==
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Particle Systems]] Note: '''The first example could be more useful if it would show a bit more and give some tips about working with particle systems. Suggestion: add more content.''' Added a first, complete, simple tutorial. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 14:01, 7 April 2009 (UTC)
* Removal of all links to INDEX page --[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 15:36, 12 April 2009 (UTC)
* Rewrote and linked to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Modeling a volcano]] [[User:Morrolan|Morrolan]] ([[User talk:Morrolan|talk]]) 15:16, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
* I rewrote the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Flying Through A Canyon]] tutorial, it is now updated and has pictures.

I do think that most of these are helpful, but I believe they could be drastically condensed to more quickly convey their information. Some of these go on for several paragraphs to convey a one or two sentence solution. --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 03:28, 22 February 2009 (UTC)
:I suggest add a page and link it to the original page, on that new page title it (OriginalPageName)NoobNotesand instead of a whole page of notes just insert the page's NoobNote link in place and move that Noob Note to that page. IT will still carch people's attention by being right in the way of your tutorial but will not impede the flow of information if someone is reading and wants to skip the noob note.--[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 12:47, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
: What is a &quot;Noob Note&quot;? A note from a noob who has additional questions, or a note for a noob? 
:* If it contains additional information, it should either go directly in the page, or it is to advanced for the tutorial - so it may go at best to the discussion page, because most readers won't need it.
:* If someone needs clarifying information he should write it on the discussion page, than the tutorial could be made better. 
: In both cases the concept of a Noob Note seems strange to me. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 17:07, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
:: I can see the use of Noob Notes in the case of pointers for beginners, I've used a couple of noob notes so far for information in what I can do if something isn't working. There's a {{tl|info}} template that can be use for useful information, why not a similar &quot;noobinfo&quot; template that's targetted to those who are new to Blender with additional information? [[User:Daworm|Daworm]] ([[User talk:Daworm|talk]]) 02:40, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

:::Additions to a page should be evaluated based on their content, not who made them.  I don't see any reason to preserve the distinction between notes added by &quot;noobs&quot; or &quot;mere users&quot; and those added by the people who consider themselves to be &quot;authors&quot; or &quot;team members&quot;.  Daworm is quite right that questions and comments belong on talk pages.  For tips that might break the flow of a module, I recommend using a template such as {{Tl|B3D:N2P/Note}} or {{Tl|B3D:N2P/Hidden begin}}, depending how long and generally-applicable they are.  {{Tl|Info}} would also be acceptable. --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 19:48, 9 November 2010 (UTC)

== To SoylentGreen ==

Thank you very much for the restructuring of this page, it is much clearer! Excellent to work with. --[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 16:43, 3 April 2009 (UTC)

== Removal of [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Index]] ==

I second that it should be removed. There's no practical reason for why it should be there, etc. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 13:34, 10 April 2009 (UTC)
:Sure, done and done--[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 15:33, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

I'm someone desperately trying to find answers to how to use Blender. How can one find what's in your book without an index?!!!! Idiots.

== Rewrite of hotkey sections ==

The Blender hotkey information is in complete disarray, spread across many pages. I suggest that all relevant (by key, by mode, etc.) hotkey information be placed on single pages. We should write a unified hotkey template to make this easier. The template should have all the hotkey information in it so we don't have to update key information on every page every time something changes. It should look something like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{B3D:Hotkey
|filter={{none|some key|some Blender mode}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Every page should employ the template. The main hotkey page should have all the hotkeys, sorted by key (no filter). The navigation table should be rewritten so that the by-key information leads to anchors on the main hotkey page instead of leading to separate pages. Also, a general update of the information would be in order. Is this all possible? --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 14:52, 4 May 2009 (UTC)
: I don't understand what you would actually like to achieve? Do you want to write a hotkey reference? And what is the purpose of the template? --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 04:44, 5 May 2009 (UTC)
:: Actually, we already have a hotkey reference, check the TOC. It's just that it's completely disorganised and horrible. The template should make updates easy by effectively acting as a hotkey database, so as soon as the template is updated, all the pages get updated instantaneously. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 08:33, 5 May 2009 (UTC)
:: OK, I've seen a second [[Blender 3D: HotKeys|Blender HotKey doc]] and and am rewriting the entire TOC to replace the current hotkey links (plus much more). We should move this to that doc's discussion section. Oh, and, please don't do any major TOC rewrites until I finish this. Thanks! --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 11:25, 6 May 2009 (UTC)

== The &quot;under construction&quot; icon ==

Do we really need it? I thought it's obvious that any unfinished module is &quot;under construction&quot;. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 07:16, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
: I'm not 100% sure whether these icons has the same meaning. A tutorial may be finished, but could be improved. But we could use the 0% sign instead. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 14:56, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
:: Then we don't need it. As I said, anything unfinished is logically improvable. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 08:58, 14 May 2009 (UTC)

== Page merge proposal ==

I suggest that [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Introduction]] be merged with [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Thinking in 3D]]. They should contain the same information and an ambiguous ''Introduction'' page looks unsightly anyways. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 18:59, 15 May 2009 (UTC)
: I agree, but would go a step further and merge both with [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Understanding Coordinates]]. So the page would have real content. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 06:40, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
:: Very well. I'll see what I can do. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 08:57, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
:: Alright, done. Now go sight them! ;) --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 09:28, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

==Using this page==
Is it appropriate to mark an item as done/in progress after attempting to complete it? --[[User:Illusionist|Illusionist]]
: Absolutely. There is no one who would supervise this process, but some people are trying and check if you change the status of a page. So go ahead. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 08:01, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;Suggestions&quot; alternate viewpoint ==

Quote from page:
''The intro of the book states that beginners need to read the chapters in sequence but there is a lot of repetition of the beginner information in later tutorials.  Again, this reduces readability because one must wade through irrelevant information. Remove the beginner explanations from later tutorials and instead include a disclaimer at the top noting the other pre-requisite tutorials.''  

Repetition is the core of learning.  I think revisiting a topic a few times helps retention. How could it be irrelevant unless it covers something foreign to the exercise? People know how to skim past items they are already familiar with.  If nothing else, the reader may receive some needed reinforcement, or gain a better understanding of the concept and/or it can even be a source of pride for those that they &quot;already know that bit&quot; when they get to it.   

However, there are things within early pages ( I'm looking at you:[[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Know_What_You're_Doing#Organize_early.2C_organize_thoroughly.21]] ) where technical terms are being used in detail (without being introduced) that SHOULD mean nothing to a noob that is reading items in-order.  That's something that kills readability, and is discouraging to someone who has accepted the mantle of &quot;noob&quot; (by reading this at all) and is still &quot;not smart enough&quot; to understand items which the writer(s) appears to assume is common knowledge for noobs.

--[[User:Deadguy|Deadguy]] ([[User talk:Deadguy|talk]]) 13:28, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
: I agree with both points. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 04:31, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

== Version of Information? ==

Just wondering, to what version should the Wikibook pages be detailed for? Latest available? Perhaps have a template for things where short-cuts have changed etc. and say &quot;in earlier versions you may have to do A -&gt; B -&gt; C instead of A -&gt; B -&gt; D&quot;

Does that makes sense?
[[User:Daworm|Daworm]] ([[User talk:Daworm|talk]]) 02:49, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

Case in point [[:File:Blender Screenshot for Beginner Tutorial.jpg]] '''this image''', do you think perhaps update the image to a standard Blender view of current version? Not a modified colour view as that's the only page with a non-standard blender colouring for example.
[[User:Daworm|Daworm]] ([[User talk:Daworm|talk]]) 02:51, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

== Merging Sections ==

I propose merging

[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating Basic Seawater]] &amp; [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Texturing Basic Seawater]] into one article and fluff it out some more with appropriate content.

[[User:Daworm|Daworm]] ([[User talk:Daworm|talk]]) 03:50, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

== 2.5 - How do we handle such updates? ==

I would like to start working on content that is formatted for Blender 2.5, but it's not very clear to me how to introduce any new content without causing confusion for users still working in 2.49.

Looking around a little, it does not seem like these pages are getting a super huge amount of updates.  Maybe someone with more wiki experience can let me know how this is normally done.  Can we make a &quot;branch&quot; of the book that has tags for 2.5, or copy the entire thing and start to edit like crazy?  Clearly the biggest issue is concurrent updates:  if someone wants to improve something that is documented for 2.49, but it is no longer correct for 2.5, how do we keep the versions growing in value with such updates?

Any thoughts out there?

--[[User:Ksamson|Ksamson]] ([[User talk:Ksamson|talk]]) 19:21, 16 December 2009 (UTC)

:I think forking the entire book would be counterproductive.  However, it's quite appropriate to note in the text differences between 2.5x and 2.49b.  If a note gets to be than a sentence or two long, please use the {{Tl|B3D:N2P/Hidden begin}} template to minimize the impact on text flow.  When 2.5x becomes stable, someone can go through and update the modules affected by the changes. --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 18:12, 9 November 2010 (UTC)

== Get rid of the confusing 'Do' boxes ==

This is an issue that popped up on BlenderArtists. I suggest that we completely get rid of {{B3D:N2P/Do|these}} awful 'Do' boxes, IMHO they just confuse the reader. I mean, this is 3D modelling, you gotta have some brains to get into it and I think they are just useless and take up space. Not to mention that it's far easier (and more readable) to type plain text.

With that in mind, why not we make plain text the standard for commands instead of those boxes? At least change the formatting to something like '''&lt;code&gt;this inline text in bold.&lt;/code&gt;''' --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 08:04, 18 July 2011 (UTC)


==Outdated==
The entire tutorial from what I've seen in Unit 2 is outdated. It pertains mostly to 2.4x only, but occasionally fills in some '2.58', '2.61', or '2.3' stuff. Needs to be MUCH better. nothing more to say.</text>

==Introduction==

This chapter describes the process of designing a new embedded system, or of improving an existing one. That is, how does an individual engineer, or a team of engineers and project managers, tackle the design of an embedded system in [[w:Design_process#Typical_steps|a systematic way]]. This chapter tries to incorporate more than just the engineer's view of the design process: often, a process starts with a company's CTO (''chief technical officer'') discussing the functionalities of a new product with a customer (''requirement analysis''), with the HR (''human resources'') and CFO (''chief financial officer'') stepping in in a second phase (''high level design'') to estimate how many and which people to put on the project, and how much complexity and risks it brings for the company. Only then, the engineers can start the ''detailed design'' phase, and begin to think about ''implementation'' and ''testing''.

Although this book focuses on embedded systems with an important
amount of mechanical subsystems, the design steps can probably also be
applied to design problems in most other areas of engineering.

==Design steps==

When designing a system, there is a sequence of steps that has to be followed before finishing an end product. These steps  to design are:
* Requirement definition
* System specification
* Functional design
* Architectural design
* Implementation (Prototyping)
* After-sales service/support

It’s not necessary to spend the same amount of time and budget on each of these six steps. One part will go faster than the other. Sometimes even a step can be skipped or cancelled.
Mostly it will be necessary to iterate between these steps to reach an final product.

In the next subsections, there will be more explanation about each of these 6 steps. Hereby an impression will be given about how to implement the steps during the designing of a system or product.
===Requirement definition===
In this first stage of the design process, it’s important to recognize the needs. The question that must be asked is: What does the user want?

How the product will work and witch components to use is not important at this stage. A good way to look at the system is that of a black box. Now it is only important to know what the user has to be able to input, and the demanded output associated with the input.
===System specification (Project description)===
In this step, the real engineering begins. The implementation of the requirements from the first step has to be realized. It is important at this stage to distinguish between system requirements and system specifications. The requirements describe what the users want out of the system when they put something in it. The specifications describe what is necessary internally to meet the requirements. This takes into account that the final project will have some real world environment where it will have to operate. That means we should consider how our system will interact with the user and the actuators it will have to control.

During this phase, the complexity of the system will become clear. This is important to have a global view of the project you’re working on.(See complexities of systems)
===Detailed description (functional design)===
Once the development team understands the requirements needed in order to solve the issues from the previous step, the phase of looking at how the system will work begins.

During this step of the design, the designer decides how the system will be divided into functional blocks and how they will be interconnected and implemented. It’s important to have a view of the process as a system that consists of blocks. 

To do this, it’s recommended to use a block diagram approach. By doing this, a data flow between the controller and the controlled object must be defined. So the first step in defining our detailed description would be to compile a data flow diagram. 

The following step would be to define exactly what these data flows entail. What are the control signals to be given, and what are the returned variables.

It is important not to specify components at this stage of the designprocess, but to keep a broad view throughout this step, later on components can be chosen. This keeps all options open and will lead to a better solution.  
===Architectural design===
After the previous stages, the design team gets a good view of the whole system and its functionalities. Now it’s time to translate this blocks and data flow into real hardware. 

It’s necessary to have different possibilities for each individual block. Hereby the team has the best option to realize the design specifications and requirements.

After these architectural decisions have been made, it’s time to put all the functional blocks together. This can cause some serious ‘logical problems’ . Therefore it can be necessary to iterate on this process.

When putting these blocks together one has to pay attention to the communication between the different blocks. If you connect these blocks you have to be sure that the logic between the different blocks is respected. This means that semantics are a relevant and important issue here.
===Implementation (Prototyping)===
When the design team finished the hardware design, a first prototype of the system can be made. This prototype is important because it’s necessary to do some tests. 

By doing this tests logic errors and hardware disabilities can be found. Feedback will be generated which can be used as input to improve the whole system.

When huge errors are found or the system does not meet the specifications, it can be necessary to return to the functional design step. 
===After-sales service/Support===
Some systems or products need to be followed during their lifecycle. This is called after-sales service. For example: some hardware will have to be replaced, software code must be updated, the system needs an upgrade,… 

Also, the client may need support. Some systems can get very complex so it’s impossible to understand it without a detailed manual and instructions from the developer. The success of a product can improve if there is a good manual and good support.


==Design models==
==Cross-sectional design issues==
===Communication===

Communication is one of the most important aspects in the whole process of designing an embedded system or a product in general.  If there is no communication or a lack of communication projects can get delayed which raises the costs significantly. Communication is important especially when dealing with complex systems. Complex systems are almost always designed by many different people, teams, who often have a different professional background. Not only is communication important because of different professional backgrounds, but it also insures a smooth transition between different phases of the design process and thus less iterations which leads to a quicker development of the system. In other words, communication in an organisation may be used to influence, inform, control or inspire.

In general two broad categories of communication can be distinguished. The first is the strictly managed, structured formal  communication. The second the informal communication. Both are very important for an efficient product development environment.
 
''Formal communication:''
Formal communication channels follow the organisational structure or hierarchy.  In the process of designing a new system, the most important direction of communication is probably horizontal. Horizontal communication occurs across the same hierarchy level and involves for example meetings and coordination between teams of subsystems, or the transition of information from one department to the other after completing a phase in the design process, here documentation is an very important issue and will be dealt with further in this section. 

''Informal communication:''
Informal  communication exists outside the formal lines of the organizational structure. An example of this is friendship groups. The informal communication channel serves two main purposes: it permits employees to satisfy their need for social interaction in the workplace and it can improve an organization’s performance by creating alternative, and frequently faster and more efficient, channels of communication (Robbins et al. 2000). So this type of communication is very important in an organization because solutions to problems can be found much more quickly than through the formal channels, and it can lead to more creative ideas coming from different backgrounds leading to a potential more optimal solution.

''Documentation:''
Documentation is a crucial part of the communication when going through the whole design process. At the end of each phase of the design process, other teams and people are involved in the next phase of the project. This means that every action, decision that has been taken in the previous phase has  to be documented so the working principle of the system as well as the semantics of every term that has been used is clear and transparent.  Documenting is often a hard and time-consuming handling because the person who writes it has to be aware of the terms and principles that can be unclear.
Documentation is not in each phase of the design process in the same form and in the same quantities.  When defining the requirements, documentation consist mainly out of a list of key words that describe the requirements.  System specifications needs more documentation but is still schematic.  So in general we can conclude that how further the phase is  in the design process how more detailed the documentation has to be.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics ''Semantics:'']
Semantics is as mentioned important when systems and people are communicating. Often a system consists out of different subsystems who will have to communicate with each other, so the input of one subsystem has to know what the meaning is of the output of the other system. Therefore when using terms, words, designers will have to explain exactly which connotation these terms and words have. If this is not done, misunderstanding can cause the whole system to fail and then it is very hard to know where the errors are, because same words have been used for other meanings.

Closely related to semantics is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon ''jargon''], jargon causes problems when for example the end user has a totally different background then the engineer who designs the product and thus uses other words for same concepts.

===Late design commitments===

It is crucial for a good design not to make quick decisions about the implementation of the design but to wait as long as possible to fill in the real components and hardware for your design.  A late design commitment leaves open a lot of options for the implementation later on and leads to a better solution and more creativity for the developed system. In the software jargon this late design commitment is called “delaying commitment”. Late commitment is actually a part of a development strategy called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development “lean software development”], this strategy focuses on quick response on the market. It’s a strategy adopted from Toyota who first implemented it in the automotive industry. 

How far in the design process one can keep a broad view is often very market depending. The view can be kept broad until the point where a particular system or product is linked to a customer, this point is called the [http://d.wanfangdata.com.cn/NSTLQK_NSTL_QK6919002.aspx order penetration point]. Depending on the product delivery strategy (make to stock, assemble-to-order, make-to-order, engineer-to-order) the view can be kept broad the whole process or is already determined by the end-user at the beginning of the design process.

===Recources===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management ''Human resources:'']
The most valued assets of an organization are without any doubt the people who individually and collectively contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the business.
Human resource management (HRM) is thereby a crucial organizational activity which has to make sure that the right people are employed for the right product at the right time. 
HRM not only has to hire and fire, but it should also bring a culture into the organization of continued growing of individuals and teams by education and team building. 
If a certain complex embedded system has to be designed, HRM should make sure that enough people with the right backgrounds are assigned to the project.

===Quality===

Quality can mean different things for different people, a common factor is that they are all important. Consumers may focus on the ''specification quality'', asking if the implemented specifications are really needed and useful or on the ''relative quality'', meaning how the system compares to similar systems of the competition. Producers on the other hand probably will view quality as the amount of embedded systems/products that are produced correctly.

Two main issues have to be handled when dealing with quality. On the one hand there should be ''prevention'', which can be achieved by implementing a quality management system  or at system level FMEA can be used. More about these kinds of failure modes and prevention can be read in an separate chapter that deals with this issue ([[Embedded Control Systems Design/Failure modes and prevention]]). On the other hand there should be a ''control system'' to check if there are defects. 
In the early days of quality control, only the end-product was checked for errors, now the general trend is the implementation  of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TQM total quality management] philosophy. This philosophy exist of a total control of the production process and the implementation of quality control not only at the end stage but most importantly at all stages throughout the design process. Another part of the philosophy is to make all people involved in the organisation aware of quality, this shows the importance of good communication in total quality management.   

Because quality management is a key issue in the design process and the entire organisation, international standards have been made to help cope with quality in the design, development and delivery of a general product or service. These standards are called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iso_9000 ISO 9000:2000] standards. This is an extensive family of standards and mostly a part of them are implemented like the ISO 9001, which deals with the quality of the end-product.

The organisation itself has to decide which level of quality they want to reach, this has to be in consultation with the resource management, because the higher the level of quality the company want to achieve, the more recourses there have to be allocated to it.

      <comment>some thoughts on alternative formats</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Re format ==

Some perspective on how I ended up choosing the format I did, and alternatives to it.

My original plans were much more grandiose.  For each page there would be links on the left to all ancestors of the current page, and links on the right to all of their successors.  This would have been technically feasible, but I ultimately didn't do it for two roughly co-equal primary reasons, with at least one secondary reason also figuring into the equation.
# Not all books have &quot;parent&quot; pages, and not all that have them use the same conventions for naming them.  It just happens that the Conlang book, on which I primarily work, is organized with a hierarchy of pages, each of which has a complete set of ancestors named by removing suffixes of the path &amp;mdash; Conlang/Intermediate/Sounds/Phonotactics has ancestors Conlang/Intermediate/Sounds and Conlang/Intermediate (and one might or might not count the book's main page as an ancestor).  In contrast, though, Using Wikibooks has pages of the form Book/Chapter/Section, but not Book/Chapter; and in that situation one might reasonably either have no parent, or count the first section of a chapter as the &quot;parent&quot; of the other sections of that chapter.  If I was going to make the tools applicable to a maximally wide range of books, without presenting a bewildering array of optional parameters (which I was hoping to avoid), it seemed advisable to try not to build into the tools too many structural assumptions about how the book is organized.
# The full-blown top navbox, with all ancestors and their successors, would have been harder to use because it was so complicated.
# There are some awkward organizational questions that would have to be given somewhat arbitrary answers (either by the template designer, or by the book designer if a battery of optional parameters were provided to support different choices).
#* One might reasonably put all ancestors in a column in the center of the box, with the current page at the bottom of the column and the book's main page at the top of the column; but then, what goes over on the left?  Just the predecessor, at the bottom left?  But then, what if the predecessor is the parent &amp;mdash; should that go at the bottom left, or one line up from that?  Or if the ancestors go in the left column, what happens when the predecessor has several generations of different ancestors from the current page?  The vision of a whole matrix of links in the top navbox was pretty strong reinforcement for the Keep It Simple, Stupid approach (2).
#* What about successor links when the current page has descendants?  A single successor would be the first child, but if you've got mulitple ancestors, wouldn't it make sense to have the next page at the same level, as ''well'' as the first child?
In the end, I devised the &quot;split mode&quot; option on Navlist/Link so that I could simultaneously provide only two links (one predecessor and one successor) and yet fully clarify the hierarchical structure of the book, if any.

A side consequence of all this is that the format I finally settled on probably should be called something other than &quot;long&quot; &amp;mdash; because compared to some alternatives, it's really quite compact.

It occurs to me that one might provide a &quot;mode&quot; option on this navbox that would be passed on through to Navlist/Link, so that split mode can be disabled on books that have no deep structure.  (I think that was probably what I had in mind when I deliberately gave the Navlist/Link parameter a name that I didn't think would collide with anything else in the navbox templates.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:07, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

I would like to ask a question, that of which i believe to be an old English. Is it Grammatically correct to say &quot;I love like you&quot; (where this word &quot;like&quot; is not a conjunction but a verb having the same meaning as the presiding word &quot;love&quot;)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, Tbone2550,

I just would like to share with you, that I am a person that feeds off criticism, but to be honest if the response you made on my page is any of bit true, then I would like to suggest that you read my article closer. I do not think you actually read the article, because it is very relevant to the goal that I am trying to accomplish within the text that I post. I can say I appreciate your opinion though.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Dancing Doll.jpg|thumb|right|173px|Angel Airfreshener - Tree Top Doll]]Plastic canvas needlepoint is just a variation of regular needlepoint but can be much more fun and useful, because you can make so many decorative and 3D things from it that would not be possible to create with just cloth. The projects that can be made are only limited by your imagination.

Many people don't know how to do this enjoyable and addictive craft. This guide is meant to explain the basics to you and hope those of you that would like to try out can use this information to start a new hobby you will love for a lifetime. Your friends and family will also enjoy all the beautiful handcrafted things you will give as gifts.

'''Things You Should Know Before Starting A Project'''
On any pattern you work you will find the plastic canvas grid is either counted out by using the terms lines or threads or by holes or squares. I prefer to count the holes of the plastic canvas because I think it's easier.

Plastic canvas comes in 4 sizes: 5 holes to the inch, 7 holes to the inch, 10 holes to the inch, and 14 holes to the inch. Check the materials list at the top of any pattern to see what size canvas the pattern call for. I prefer to stitch projects using 7 count plastic canvas. The plastic canvas sheets also come in different types. The standard clear variety is used on most patterns. It also comes in a variety of colors. Don't use a colored canvas unless the pattern calls for it, because the yarn might not cover it all and the grid may show through. The canvas also comes in a stiff variety or a soft type. Again these are not used unless the pattern requires them.

The best type of yarn to use is regular worsted weight yarn. It's economical, comes in a variety of colors, and can be bought almost anywhere. I never use the type of yarn sold in those little skeins just for plastic canvas. It is expensive and not necessary to do so. I recommend buying Red Heart yarns it can be purchased at many online stores or at your neighborhood Walmart. Also check garage sales for bargains. I have bought bags of yarn very cheap there.

'''Washing Of Plastic Canvas Stitched Items'''
If a project gets soiled it can be washed by soaking it in a sink with warm water and a little dish soap. DO NOT use hot water and DO NOT put it in the washing machine or dryer. Just let it soak in the sink for a little while, rinse and let sit in bath tub to drain and dry over night. Items like a tote bag that will get a lot of handling can be sprayed with Scotchgard to protect it from soiling if desired. DO NOT dry clean or use cleaning solvents, it could melt the plastic grid. If an item gets dusty just use your vacuum to remove the dust.

'''What You Need To Get Started'''
The first thing you should do is practice the basic stitches so you will need a few sheets of 7 count plastic canvas. Buy a couple of yarn needles especially sold for this type of needlepoint. I say buy a couple because I always lose mine down in the chair cushions. You'll also need worsted weight yarn and a pair of scissors. Now that you have your needle, yarn and plastic canvas let's practice some stitches. To keep a project neat on the wrong side no knots are used. When starting a row a small end of the yarn or tail is left on the backside when you pull the yarn through to the front. The first few stitches of the are done over that tail on the wrong side to lock the yarn so it won't come undone. 

[[Image:Contintal stitch.jpg|thumb|right|173px|Continental Stitch Example]] '''Continental Stitch:''' This is a basic stitch that is used on most patterns. Start the stitch by leaving about a 1 inch tail of yarn on the backside and bring your needle up through the hole marked black dot. Go back down to the backside at the red dot. All stitches are done in a left to right manner.

[[Image:Slanted goblen stitch.jpg|thumb|right|173px|Slanted Gobelin Stitch Example]]'''Slanted Gobelin Stitch:''' This stitch really is just a variation of the regular continental stitch but it can be done over 2 or more threads of the canvas at a time. The first stitch of the row is just a continental stitch as before. The second stitch comes up at the second black dot and down at the second red dot over the first one. Continue across to the left side, flip and start again as before.

[[Image:Goblen stitch.jpg|thumb|right|173px|Gobelin Stitch Example]]'''Gobelin Stitch:''' Do the stitches up from the back at the black dot and down through the red dot working over the little tail of yarn as before to keep the stitches from coming undone. The pattern you are going to do will tell you if you should use 1 strand of yarn or 2 . Usually the stitches worked over 2 or more threads will require 2 strands of yarn to cover the grid better.

[[Image:Overcast.jpg|thumb|right|173px|Overcast Stitch Example]]'''Overcast Stitch (also called the Whipstitch):''' This stitch is used to finish off the unstitched edge of a project. When stitching corners I usually make at least 3 stitches instead of the 2 stitches shown. The whipstitch is used when you are joining 2 pieces of a pattern together such as the sides of a tissue box. Use extra stitches if necessary on the corners or sides if they are required to cover the edge of the grid neatly without showing through. Just the 2 pieces back to back and overcast where they should be joined.

There are tons of other stitches and variations of stitches out there but working with this form of needlepoint is a learning experience and you will learn more tricks of the trade and ways of doing things as you get used to using the basic stitches.

'''Two Last Tips For You Before You Start Your First Project:'''
To end off at the end of a row when you are finished. Turn over to the backside of your canvas and run the needle under 4 or 5 stitches then cut the yarn. You will also use this way to start again if you run out of yarn in the middle of a row. I use 3 feet long pieces of yarn when stitching so you don't have too many stops and starts. Just run the yarn under a few stitches on the backside and finish stitching across.

'''That's It !!! Now You Are Ready To Start Your First Project !!!'''

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:140%&quot;&gt;'''Building The Simplest Transistor Current Source'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%; color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;'''Circuit idea:''' ''Using a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) to create a &quot;bottleneck&quot; for the current flow in a circuit branch.''&lt;/span&gt;

== What a current source is ==

[[Image:Ideal_current_source_65b.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1: How does a constant current source behave?&lt;/center&gt;]]

We begin our story with general questions: &quot;What is a '''constant current source'''? What do we want it to do? How does a current source behave? How do we figure out that some device is a current source? How do we make a current source? Do we need a &quot;definition&quot; for such a self-speaking term?&quot; Obviously not; we can take for granted the notion of ''constant current source''. Nevertheless let's mention that it's a thing (electronic device) producing electrical current. For such a simple device, we would expect it to have a simple behaviour. We would very much like it to produce a '''constant''' current, regardless of the load we apply.

What have you known about the current source from the basic course of electricity? Here is the well-known symbol of a current source (Fig. 1). How to make a good guess that it is a current source? If someone gives us a (black) box with two leads and says that it is a current source, how do we convince ourselves that it is really a current source? Let's conduct some experiments. For example, what will happen, if we connect the two leads (a short circuit - case 1 on the picture)? Is it dangerous for the current source (comparing with a voltage one)? Indeed, there is nothing dangerous for a current source, if we short its two leads. As the current source is designed for a given current, it keeps up (limits) the current thus protecting itself.

Then, maybe the opposite condition - an open circuit (case 3 on the picture) - will be dangerous as the current source will try to pass the same current as before. In this situation, the current source is misled: it doesn't see the open circuit; it &quot;thinks&quot; there is something connected there. It just &quot;sees&quot; that no current flows and raises its internal voltage up with the &quot;hope&quot; to pass a current through the harmful &quot;thing&quot;. Of course, the current source does not manage to pass any current through the open circuit and reaches the final (compliance) voltage; a saturation and even a breakdown occurs. Thus, the compliance voltage represents the maximum voltage that the current source can reach when it strives to produce the desired current.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==A passive one==

[[File:Simplest_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2 : Making the simplest current source&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== The general idea ===

How do we make the most simple current source? As we all know,
thanks to a certain wise man called Ohm, the only way to get yourself some current is to apply some voltage over some resistance. The easiest way to achieve 
this is to connect a voltage source in series with a resistor.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I=U/R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

For example, take a standard 9V battery and a 9kΩ resistor, connect them in series - and there you have it, a 1 mA current source (you can measure it with an ammeter).

&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;I = 9 V / 9 kΩ = 1 mA&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

OK, we all know Ohm's law as a mathematical equation... but what's the logic behind it? We know '''the fact''' that voltage over resistance produces current, but '''why'''? Voltage is in fact a genuine '''Force'''; another possible explanation would be to think of '''voltage''' as some kind of '''potential''' - like a smart man's potential to learn many things. In order for this potential to become something real, to move the smart man up the line of personal improvement, (this '''movement''' would be a kind of '''current''') it has to be put in action over some obstacles - exams, tasks, etc. (this would be the equivalent of '''resistance'''). Another analogy would be the potential of a car's engine to propel the vehicle forward - there must be something to act upon - the road surface, for example.

[[Circuit_Idea/Passive_Voltage-to-Current_Converter#Basic_electrical_idea:_Voltage_causes_current|Passive voltage-to-current converter (voltage causes current)]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== The imperfections ===

[[File:Passive_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3: The load decreases the current.&lt;/center&gt;]]

But enough philosophy... now that we have a current source, let's use it to power up something - let's connect a '''load''' (it could be a light bulb, a resistor, anything consuming current). But now a problem appears... the ammeter shows less current, than we expected. We may look at the problem from two viewpoints.

'''...in terms of resistance...''' Why - because the load introduces some new resistance to the circuit, thus rising its equivalent resistance and lowering the current (note the voltage supply stays constant). If we put a bigger load, we would see that the current decreases even more: I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/(R +  R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).

'''...in terms of voltage.''' The real load introduces some voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, which affects the excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, not all the input voltage is applied across the current-setting resistor R but only the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, here the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; determines the current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; instead the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the current decreases: I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/R.

It appears that our most simple current source can't cope with various loads and is unable to keep the current at a constant rate. That's why  these kind of circuits are called '''passive''' - they don't react to changes and disturbances. So, the most simple current source that we've made ourselves is '''a passive one''' (it's like a reluctant worker, who doesn't alter his efforts regardless of how much work there is to be done). Well, this passive circuit is imperfect; it can't stand against the load &quot;intervention&quot;, especially if the load varies. It is a static, fixed, non-adaptable circuit...; it needs some improvement... What do we do then?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==Two ways to make an active one==

==== The basic &quot;dynamizing&quot; idea ====

Obviously, we have to reveal the truth by ourselves; let's then begin reasoning. The problem pops up when we connect a load and, what is worse, if we begin varying its resistance. Note the load may be not only a steady or varying resistor; it might be a capacitor that is charging, a diode (ordinary, zener, LED, base-emitter junction, etc.) or even a voltage source (e.g., a rechargeable battery)... It is not so important what exactly the load is; it is only important that a voltage drop appears across the load and this voltage drop confuses things.

If we look around, we can see that most things in this world are changeable, adaptable, dynamic... According to this observation, we have to make our current source react somehow to the load &quot;intervention&quot;, to resist to its attempt to lower the current. That means something inside the current source has to change, in order to compensate the disturbing voltage drop across the load. What can change in this simple electric circuit?

In our recipe for current we have two ingredients - voltage and resistance. Hence, if we want to make our current source react to changes in load, we have to  alter one of the two ingredients dynamically, in relevance with the change in load resistance.

=== Making the internal voltage dynamic ===

[[File:Bootstrapped_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4: Keeping up a constant current by a dynamic voltage source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

One possible solution would be to vary the internal voltage - when the load increases, the internal voltage rises too. We can call this one '''dynamic current source with following internal voltage'''.

It may seem like a smart idea, but unfortunately - it is not. It's actually a kind of [[w:bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]] - this term comes from the story about [[w:Baron Munchhausen|Baron Munchhausen]], who once got stuck in quicksand, and pulled himself up by his own bootstraps.

This solution has quite a limited ability to compensate changes in load, because the varying supply voltage will quickly reach its maximum.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Making the internal resistance dynamic ===

[[File:R_dynamic_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;Keeping up a constant current by a dynamic resistor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The other possible solution is to vary the internal resistance. This time, when the load resistance increases, the internal resistance R will have to decrease, keeping the sum R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; unchanged, so the current flow stays at a constant rate. Hence the name of the resistor '''R''' is '''current-stable resistor'''. 

Of course, this method also has a limited ability to compensate changes in load resistance, because the decreasing internal resistance will reach zero at a certain time.  But it's much more simple to implement (it's easier to play with resistance, then messing around with voltage).

We will continue our quest to destination ''Simplest transistor current source'' by using the second methodology. What element will we use to materialize the '''dynamic internal resistance''' solution? As the name of this topic implies, it's going to be the '''transistor'''. Let's talk about its behavior to find out why...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==Active current source with a BJT==
===What is the transistor and why did we choose it===
[[FIle:Transistors-white.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;Transistors&lt;/center&gt;]]
Enter the '''transistor''' - considered one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. A tiny device, that literally changed the world and now dominates all areas of life - it can be found in every electronic device around us, as it is the fundamental building block of modern electronic circuits. 

OK, the transistor is pretty cool... but what is it ''actually''? Its name comes from ''transfer resistor - transistor''... which doesn't clarify its structure, neither its purpose. To keep it short, the transistor is a semiconductor device comprising two PN junctions and has three terminals. Let's talk a bit more about its behaviour, as it is much more interesting ;)

It can do a fascinating trick - '''amplifying a signal'''. At least that's how they call it, even though it's not amplification at all. Actually, the transistor allows us to control a larger current flow (the output) with a smaller current flow (the input). It's more like '''creating a scaled copy of the input signal using additional power''', than amplifying it. Think of it as a ''current valve'' - valves are devices used to control the flow of a fluid, in our case the current would be the equivalent to fluid. 

Transistor are also used for '''electronically controlled switches''' - just like ON/OFF buttons, operated by electronic means. This powerful idea is the heart of digital circuitry today.

For a wonderful and detailed explanation of this transistor behaviour by means of hydraulic analogy - check the [[#References/See also|References/See also]] section.

Transistors come in a variety of types, with the most popular being '''MOSFET'''s and '''BJT'''s, but the list continues with lots of others (basically derivatives of the two most popular ones). We will use a '''BJT''', which stand for ''Bipolar Junction Transistor''. ''Bipolar'' indicates that both the electrons and holes take part in the transistor's operation.

Much more can be said about this wonderful invention, but that's a long story outside the scope of this article.


====Hydraulic analogy - the BJT as a ''current valve''====
[[File:GateValve.JPG|thumb|150px|Valve - a variable ''water'' bottleneck]]
As we saw in some of the other articles of Circuit Idea, hydraulic analogy is a powerful and intuitive concept for explaining electrical circuits.
Current flow (hence the word &quot;flow&quot;) can be represented by the flow of a fluid. Usually, when we want some fluid flowing at a constant rate, (e.g. when  watering the garden with a hose), we create a ''constraint'' on the fluid path, creating a ''bottleneck''.[[Image:Potentiometer.jpg|left|thumb|125px|Potentiometer - a mechanically controlled ''current'' bottleneck]] A ''bottleneck'' (consider the name) is the point that has the lowest throughput, thus determining the maximum flow capacity. Bottlenecks cam be found not only in hydraulic stuff, but in virtually any system imaginable. In hydraulic terms, the most simple variable element for creating a bottleneck is the valve. 



In the electrical world, the closest analog to the valve is the variable resistor - also called a ''potentiometer''.

Well, the transistor can behave as a variable resistor too, but unlike the mechanically controlled potentiometer, it's an electrically controlled one - the output collector-emitter(C-E) current can be controlled by the input base current or the base voltage, whichever suits us more.
So here comes the simple idea - if we apply a constant base voltage, we will set a constant C-E current. When the C-E voltage increases (e.g. due to decrease in voltage on the load resistor Rl) the C-E resistance will increase too (remember we set the C-E current to constant using a constant base voltage). So what do we get - a dynamic varying resistor which keeps a constant current flow. In short - ''a current-stable resistor''. Which is exactly what we need in order to make a constant current source.

====Sprinkle that with theory...====

[[FIle:Trans_output_va_2_65b_lab3.jpg|left|thumb|240px|&lt;center&gt;IV curves (both RL and RT vary). &lt;br&gt; ''A nice and clear scheme to be added''&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Transistor_npn.svg|right|thumb|175px|&lt;center&gt;Transistor - an ''electronically'' controlled ''current'' bottleneck&lt;/center&gt;]]

This behaviour is shown on the IV diagram. They name it ''output characteristic'', because it represents the processes occurring at the output part of the transistor depending on changes in current or voltage. We can explain it by some ugly complex formulas found in thick textbooks on semiconductors, but we would rather think of it in a more user-friendly manner.

Imagine it as a mechanism with the '''I''' line acting as a &quot;fixed rail&quot; (representing the current which appears to be a constant), on which the crossing of the two &quot;pivots&quot; - '''Rl''' and '''Rt''' lines - point '''A''' slides. As we decrease the load resistance ('''Rl''' that is) point A slides down the '''Rl''' line, up the '''Rt''' line, and to the right on the '''I''' line. This means that the transistor resistance '''Rt''' increases, so the whole resistance of the circuit remains the same, and therefore the current flow remains the same. As we do the opposite - guess what - exactly the opposite things happen ;)

===The solution - based on team work===
[[File:Simplest_trans_current_source_whiteboard2_65b_lab3.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Building the simplest BJT current source on the whiteboard.&lt;br&gt; ''A nice and clear scheme to be added''&lt;/center&gt;]]
As the saying goes, two heads are better then one. More than two are even more ;) The point here is, that great things in life, no matter how simple, are more often produced by a team effort, rather than a personal one.

So is the case with our solution. Let's present our team... 

In the middle, surrounded by a blue line is the &quot;boss&quot; of the circuit - the varying load resistor Rl. It's he who leads the concert, and the whole circuit is built for him - to satisfy his needs and desires for constant current. The nameless resistor just beneath the boss is his &quot;bodyguard&quot; - just in case someone curious moves the slider of the &quot;boss resistor&quot; to its very end and try to short-circuit the power source through the transistor.

Everything outside the blue line is the BJT current source itself - a whole team of elements working for the &quot;boss&quot;. There's the &quot;hero&quot; of the circuit - the workhorse - the mighty bipolar junction transistor (BJT), who does all the dirty job (donkey work :) of keeping the constant current. This is our ''bottleneck'' point, which determines how much current can pass through. Connected to its base is his &quot;manager&quot; (modern heroes need to have managers), the varying resistor (potentiometer) P, who is basically a varying voltage divider, and by the means of base voltage Vb tells the transistor what to do. In this case - using a constant base voltage the manager tells him to keep the current flow at a constant rate. The &quot;manager&quot; also has a &quot;bodyguard&quot; - Rb keeping the power source safe from short-circuit's caused by someone playing with the potentiometer P.

Then there are our watchful eyes - the voltmeter V2, used to keep an eye on the voltage drop on the load resistor (the boss), another voltmeter V1, watching over the voltage drop on the transistor's collector-emitter junction, and an ammeter, which gives us a sneak-peak on the current flow.

Last, but not least - the power source VCC, who brings the whole circuit to life :)

===Will the circuit pass its exams?===
Now, let's put our solution on the examination table and make some observations.

====What happens when we vary the load?====
.. we observe a change in V1 and V2, but no change in the ammeter. We're happy: the current flow is constant :) How did that happen?

When we increase the load resistance Rl so does its voltage drop, which can be seen on voltmeter V2 (logically simple - more resistance generates more pressure). As V2 shows an increment, V1 respectively shows a decrement (their sum represents the voltage of the power source Vcc). Since we made the transistor act as a current-stable resistor, it &quot;senses&quot; the decrement of the C-E voltage drop and obediently reduces its resistance, so the sum of resistances in the circuit branch remains the same. Therefore the current flow remains the same too.

When we decrease the load resistance, exactly the opposite happens (V2 shows a decrement, V1 shows an increment, the transistor rises its resistance, the sum of resistance remains the same, and so does the current flow).

====What happens when we vary the supply voltage?====
Well, that was quite easy, so let's try a more difficult test - we will vary the supply voltage.
Our expectations are that the current will remain constant, due to the fact that our &quot;manager&quot; (the potentiometer) keeps the ''bottleneck'' of the circuit at the same throughput level by applying constant voltage. 
Unfortunately, as we conduct the experiment we notice that the current changes... see you on the next exam session, constant current source, you've failed.

But what is the problem? Hence the power supply of the potentiometer - it's the one we changed in order to facilitate the examination, therefore we have also changed the bottleneck throughput. Our ''simplest current source'' fails this test, because we use the same power source for driving the transistor as well as for powering the whole circuit.

===The next step: adding a diode===
Our solution failed the last test, but is failure a bad thing?
It can be considered good, because it gives us the opportunity and motivation to improve our ideas and to move up the ladder.

Obviously, we need to drive our transistor with an independent power supply.
One way to do this is to use another voltage supply, dedicated entirely for this purpose. This is somewhat expensive solution, because it uses twice as much resources (two power supplies instead of one).

The more clever way of doing the trick would be to replace the ''voltage-divider circuit'' with a ''voltage-stabilizing one''.
This can be done by replacing the potentiometer with a diode (which is a voltage stabilizing element, as we all know) - an idea with more potential than you would first think of, because it's the way to go if you want to build the famous ''current mirror circuit''... which is a vast topic itself and it will be considered in another article of '''Circuit Idea'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sour Cream and wine conversion are off!
If not mistaken 1 cup = 249 ml; so 1/3 cup is 80 ml; 2/3 cup would be 160 ml. [Unidentified author, pre-2009/Nov/7th]

Neither recipe indicates how many it serves.
The preamble, reciting history, is redundant with the history given on [[Beef Stroganoff|the main page]] about this dish; surely the Cookbook page should skip most of this and refer to that page for such material.  A sentence or two of background should suffice. [Eddy] [[Special:Contributions/84.215.6.188|84.215.6.188]] ([[User talk:84.215.6.188|talk]]) 18:26, 7 November 2009 (UTC)

A variation of this dish is to use Kangaroo instead of Beef; affectionately known as Kangastrog.

== Wrong Meat Wrong Mushrooms ==

Chuck or ground beef is not the way to make a good Beef Stroganoff; use sirloin or higher.  Although I never flour my beef pieces the original recipe does call for flouring.  The best way to make a strognaoff is found in the &quot;Great Dinner's from Life&quot; cookbook published in the early 70's.

One pound cubed sirloin
1 medium onion diced
8 oz FRESH mushrooms - small whole buttons are great, but hard to find in bulk mushrooms; if unable to find slice the normal size mushrooms.  I like a lot of mushrooms and typically  add more
1 tsp dry mustard - add water and let stand for at least 10 minutes, then add 1 tsp sugar
1 cup sour cream - more if you like it really soupy
Burgundy Wine to taste 
Salt and Pepper to taste

Serve over noodles or rice.

Do not use cream of mushroom soup, do not us canned mushrooms

== Wrong technique - saute, not stew ==

Stroganoff is designed as a saute, not a stew. The recipes here call for cooking up to an hour covered, for fully cooked/stewed meat. In a correct preparation, the meat is seared rare and reserved while the sauce is prepared separately. The two are combined at the end and warmed through before serving. The result is pieces of perfectly tender medium-rare (pink) steak in a rich sauce.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{message box|image=The GIMP icon - gnome.svg|message=This is ''just'' a '''convention'''!}}

This page is a manual of style for the [[GIMP]] book. This is just an outline that still misses many things. If you don't agree with something, then start a discussion on the talk page. Do that as well if you want to add something (base was created without any discussion).

== Naming Convention ==
=== Pages ===
# Never shorten the titles of pages (like in [[../Editing/]]), but rather use full names (like in [[../Selection Tools/]])

=== Images ===
# All images '''must''' begin with ''GIMP-''.
# All screenshots should be in PNG format. This assures high quality of these, because PNG is not a lossy format.
# If the image is on some topic than try to make all images really related (like in [[GIMP/Toolbox]] (you can see that all tools have something in common))

== Categorizing ==
'''Always''' put any images, pages and templates in [[:Category:GIMP]]

&lt;!-- Redirects should go to [[:Category:The GIMP - Redirects]]. --&gt;

== Images on pages ==
Try to put many, but not too much images. Also these should be placed well on page (again like in [[../Selection Tools/]]), possibly with some description. Images placed in the text should not be bigger than text (or not much bigger).

== Overall look ==
Pages should have some headlines, to make editing and reading easier. A great example of this are all tool pages.

== Shortcuts ==
If you're putting a shortcut on a page make it bold (instead of &quot;Ctrl&quot; use '''Ctrl'''(&lt;nowiki&gt;'''Ctrl'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;)). If there is no shortcut ([[../Foreground Select/]]), make it italic. Do not make anything bold in tables.

== Navigation ==
Always put &lt;!-- &lt;s&gt;[[:Template:GIMP/Nav|this]]&lt;/s&gt; --&gt; [[:Template:Chapter_navigation|this]] template &lt;!-- &lt;s&gt;on the top&lt;/s&gt; and--&gt; at the bottom of the page. &lt;!-- &lt;s&gt;Description is on its page. Also put after/before that a line(&lt;nowiki&gt;----&lt;/nowiki&gt;).&lt;/s&gt;--&gt;

== Comments ==
There are comments on some pages, which contain information from a newer, unstable version. These should be uncommented once the next stable series are out (i.e. 2.8 after 2.6).

Ever since Pierre-Simon Laplace envisioned the Hypothetical &quot;Laplace's Demon&quot; in 1814, an entity with infinite computing power that knows the exact location and velocity of every particle in the universe, there has been speculation that if one had such abilities, the past, present, and future of the universe can be predicted. However, there are limits to even this kind of knowledge, and it may very well be impossible for mankind to ever find the much sought-after &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;. Does Laplace's Demon hold proof of Predestination? Could it even exist? We will examine these questions shortly.

==Laplace's Demon and Predestination==
Let us assume, for one moment, that Laplace's Demon not only could exist, but it is real. The entity is sitting in a laboratory, doing computations, and feeding scientists data about the future of the universe. This scenario could be thought of as absolute proof that free will is an illusion, and that predestination rules the universe. As the Demon simulates particles ricocheting off of each other, forming atoms, cooling down, then gradually forming stars several billion years ago, it watches matter spin, gravity attract material; Earth forms, then life forms, then Humans slowly evolve, it predicts the chemical reactions going on inside our brains, it knows what we will do, what we will think, and what we will feel. For the processes of our brain are no different, no less certain than the boiling of water or the constant flickering of minute switches in the circuitry of a computer. Neurons fire, some adrenaline is released there, some dopamine here, and you get a human thought. What we perceive as free will is merely routine chemical processes occurring within our brains, and we are no more than clumps of matter floating around in the universe like the coldest space rock, as time moves only forward, and the universe expands outward. and nothing- nothing is uncertain in the mind of the Demon.

== A Counter to Laplace's Demon==
According to chemical engineer Robert Ulanowicz, in his 1986 book Growth and Development, Laplace's demon met its end with early 19th century developments of the concepts of irreversibility, entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics. In other words, Laplace's demon was based on the premise of reversibility and classical mechanics; thermodynamics, i.e. real processes, however, are, under current theory, thought to be irreversible. There has recently been proposed a limit on the computational power of the universe, specifically the ability of Laplace's Demon to process an infinite amount of information. The limit is based on the maximum entropy of the universe, the speed of light, and the minimum amount of time taken to move information across the Planck length, and the figure was shown to be about 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; bits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia: large numbers#Computers and computational complexity | &quot;Computational capacity of the universe&quot;]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, anything that requires more than this amount of data cannot be computed in the amount of time that has lapsed so far in the universe. So not only could Laplace's Demon in the literal sense never exist, but due to the second law of thermodynamics, its principle of predestination is also invalid.

Also, Laplace's Demon's knowledge is limited by the fact that it is in and of itself a part of the universe it is observing. To the question, &quot;Will you answer this question to be true or false?&quot;, Laplace's Demon can never accurately determine the answer. This is similar to trying to determine the truth of the statement, &quot;The next sentence is true. The previous sentence is false.&quot; Any object in the universe is limited in computing power by itself being a part of that universe, Therefore, it is impossible for the human mind to comprehend a true &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;.

== Elementary Chaos Theory ==
To predict whether a baseball heading towards a house will fall short, smash through the window, or pass overhead -- we look at the location and velocity of that baseball, and we can get a rough estimate of where it will land with a simple estimate.
With a bit more information about the wind, we can get an even better estimate of where it will land. There are infinite other factors, for example, the tiny aerodynamic imperfections of the surface of the ball, the gravity of the ball and all objects surrounding it, and other such data that each subtly contribute to the velocity and impact site of the ball, and when they all add together, they can change the trajectory of the ball drastically.

Some kinds of uncertainty are &quot;linear&quot; -- if my measurement of the horizontal velocity of the baseball is 10% too low, then the baseball will probably land about 10% further than my estimate.
Other kinds of uncertainty are &quot;exponentially growing&quot; (&quot;deterministic chaos&quot;).

==Conclusion==
In spite of all these things, we can still learn something from Laplace's Demon. For example, the more data that you have about the universe, the more accurate and long range your predictions can be. According to chaos theory, very small factors can alter and influence large and complex systems over time. A butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon could potentially cause a hurricane in the Gulf coast a week later; e.g. the &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot;. However, the more &quot;butterflies&quot; you factor in, the longer the range of your weather predictions could be. Perhaps, one day a vast network of quantum computers, being fed data about micro-climate systems across the planet and planetary systems, the temperature over all regions of the sun, and other data, long-range interplanetary weather- forecasting may not be impossible. However, humans will never be able to predict the future state of the universe accurately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intro==
An oscillator is a circuit which generates a repetitive electric signal of given waveform (for example a sinewave).

==Electronic Oscillation==
Electronic Oscillator is an electronics circuit that generates oscillation when circuit is in resonance a natural process when all the frequency components cancel out . Commonly found in LC and RC Phase Shift 

In electronics, oscillation occurs when the following conditions are met
* Output voltage is equal to input voltage and inverted
* The Phase Angle difference between input and output voltage must be 180

===Passive Oscillation===
With Series LC or Parallel LC . At Resonance, the frequency dependent components will cancel out ie impedance of inductor will cancel impedance of capacitor &lt;math&gt;Z_L + Z_C = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_L = Z_C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ω
:;&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since ω = 2πf therefore
:;f = 1/2π&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

This frequency is called Resonance Frequency and usually denoted as f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;

At Resonance Frequency
:&lt;math&gt;V_L = Z_C&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;V_L - Z_C = 0 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;V_C = - Z_L&lt;/math&gt;

The voltage of the series LC keeps oscillating between inductor's voltage and capacitor's voltage between phase angle 0 - 180

;In LC circuit, oscillation occurs at the resonance frequency
:;f = 1/2π&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Active Oscillation===
====Fixed Frequency Oscialltor====
For active cicuit, to meet the requirement for oscillation require 
:An Inverter that has output voltage equals to input voltage and inverted . So any Transistor or Op Amp Amplifier can be configured to act as an Inverter

:A Feedback circuit between input and output that provides 180 degree difference in phase angle . This can be achieved through Resonant Tuned LC circuit or three stage of RC Phase Shift with each stage has a phase shift of 60

For Resonant Tuned LC circuit, the oscialltion frequency is equal to the resonant frequency
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2π&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

When choosing the value of &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt; in power of 10 so that &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;-½n&lt;/sup&gt; then the oscillating frequency can be calculated by
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-½n&lt;/sup&gt;


For RC Phase Shift
:; Tanθ = 1/2π f &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{RC}&lt;/math&gt;
:; Tan 60 = Sin 60 / Cos 60 = &lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} {\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the frequency change through phase change is
:f = 1/2π  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3} \frac{1}{RC}&lt;/math&gt;

When choosing the value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{CR}&lt;/math&gt; in power of 10 so that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{CR}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;-n&lt;/sup&gt; then the oscillating frequency can be calculated by
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.33 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-n&lt;/sup&gt;

====Variable Frequency Oscialltor====
Variable Frequency Oscialltor can be achieved through inverter with feedback circuit of 
* 2 series inductors L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel to one capacitor C
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2π &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{(L_1 + L_2)C}}&lt;/math&gt;

* 2 series capacitors C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel to one inductor L
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2π &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{(C_1 + C_2)L}}&lt;/math&gt;

* 2 series capacitors C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel to a tuned LC

==Electro-Mechanical Oscillation==
===Crystal Oscillator===
A '''crystal oscillator''' is an [[electronic circuit]] that uses the mechanical [[resonance]] of a vibrating [[crystal]] of [[Piezoelectricity#Materials|piezoelectric material]] to create an electrical signal with a very precise [[frequency]].
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = n f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;

Here's a little thing I'm writing right now:

      <comment>/* Other recursive functions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CAVEAT Needed'''

A caveat is needed on the last block of solutions that warns readers that the code will not compile because of ambiguity between the code in the solution and that in Prelude.

=== Other recursive functions ===

&lt;nowiki&gt;:(&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This is no good to a learner (like myself) &amp;mdash; the solution for the log2 problem:

&lt;pre&gt;
log2 1 = 0
log2 n = 1 + log2 (n `div` 2) -- the &quot;`&quot; make div into infix notation
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ok, so when was I supposed to have read about `div` and infix notation?  The central challenge to the problem should be thinking about a recursive definition of a logarithm, but instead it turns out to be a trick question about syntax that hasn't been discussed yet, and isn't discussed now.

I had written the right function definition, but had no idea about `div` until coming here after wasting a bunch of time trying to figure out how to use &quot;/&quot;, silly me.  

What does that explanation even mean?  It's frustrating, and uninformative.  I understand it's an 'advanced' question, but it's only advanced because it asks about stuff I would have no way of knowing, unless I just peek back here.</text>
