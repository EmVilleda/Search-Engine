|11:4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

|11:5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:7 Then after that says he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:8 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone you; and go you thither again?
|&amp;nbsp;
|8 &quot;Rabbi,&quot; exclaimed the disciples, &quot;the Judeans seek to stone you, and you would go back there again?&quot; 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.

|-
|11:11 These things said he: and after that he says unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:12 Then said his disciples, ''Lord'', ''if he sleep'', ''he shall do well''.
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;LATIN&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Domine si dormit salbus erit.jpg|155px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Domine&amp;nbsp;si&amp;nbsp;dormit&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;salbus&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;erit&lt;/small&gt;

|11:13 Nevertheless Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of ''taking of rest'' in sleep.

|13 But Jesus had spoken of his death, and they thought He referred to the resting of sleep.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent all of you may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.

|11:17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
|&amp;nbsp;
|19 and many Judeans were among the mourners with Martha and Mary, having come to express sympathy on the death of their brother.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever you will ask of God, God will give it you.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:23 Jesus says unto her, Your brother shall rise again.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:24 Martha says unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
|&amp;nbsp;
|25 &quot;I am the Resurrection and the Life,&quot; said Jesus; &quot;the one who &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believes&lt;/font&gt; in me, even if he (or she) has died, shall live;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:26 And whosoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you this?
|&amp;nbsp;
|26 And everyone who is living and &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believes&lt;/font&gt; in me shall never die. Do you &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt; this?&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:27 She says unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
|&amp;nbsp;
|27 &quot;Yes, Master,&quot; she replied; &quot;I &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt; that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the One coming into the world.&quot; 
|&lt;small&gt;GR.&lt;U&gt;Cristos&lt;/U&gt; AR.mәshīha&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|11:28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master has come, and calls for you.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goes unto the grave to weep there.
|&amp;nbsp;
|31 So the Judeans who were comforting Mary in the house, when they saw that she rose hastily and went out, followed her, thinking she was going to the sepulchre to weep there.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, (o. pneuma) and was troubled.
|&amp;nbsp;
|33 Seeing her weeping, and the Judeans also weeping who had come with her, Jesus, with a deeply troubled spirit,
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:34 And said, Where have all of you laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.
|&amp;nbsp;
|34 asked them, &quot;Where have you laid him?&quot; &quot;Master, come and see,&quot; was their reply.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:35 Jesus wept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;
|35 Jesus wept.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
|&amp;nbsp;
|36 &quot;See how dear he held him as a friend,&quot; said the Judeans. 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:37 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:39 Jesus said, Take all of you away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, says unto him, Lord, by this time he stinks: for ''he has been dead four days''.
|Fourth-day man&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;tau;&amp;epsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;alpha;&amp;rho;&amp;tau;&amp;alpha;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;&lt;/b&gt; (5066)
|39 &quot;Take away the stone,&quot; said Jesus. Martha, the sister of the deceased, exclaimed, &quot;Master, by this time there is an awful odor; for he has been dead four days.&quot; 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:40 Jesus says unto her, Said I not unto you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?
|&amp;nbsp;
|40 &quot;Did I not say,&quot; replied Jesus, &quot;that if you &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt;, you shall see the glory of God?&quot; 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:42 And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|42 I know that you hear me at all times; but because of the crowd standing around I have said this&amp;mdash;that they may &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt; that you sent me.&quot; 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with ''grave clothes'': and his face was bound about with a cloth. Jesus says unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
|with grave-bandages&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;kappa;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;rho;&amp;iota;&amp;alpha;&amp;iota;&amp;sigmaf;&lt;/b&gt; (2750)
|44 The man who was dead came out, his hands and feet wrapped in bandages, and his face covered with a kerchief. &quot;Unbind him,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;and let him go.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|45 Then a number of these Judeans who had come to Mary and had witnessed His deeds became &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believers&lt;/font&gt; in Him;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many miracles.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.
|&amp;nbsp;
|48 If we let him alone, everybody will &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt; in him, and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, All of you know nothing at all,
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:51 And this spoke he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:52 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together in order to put him to death.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
|&amp;nbsp;
|54 Therefore Jesus no longer went about that area openly, but He left Judea and went into the district near the desert, to the town of Ephraim, and remained there with the disciples.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:55 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.
|&amp;nbsp;
|55 The time of the Judean Passover approached, and many from the country went up to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Feast.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:56 Then sought they for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think all of you, that he will not come to the feast?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|11:57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show it, that they might take him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A liability is an obligation to transfer economic benefit as a result of past events.

Importantly, this definition does not take into account the legal position. It reflects the substance of the arrangement rather than the legal form.

Current liabilities represent liabilities that form part of the operating cycle e,g trade payables (trade creditors), or if not part of the operating cycle have a maturity of less than 12 months. 
==== accrual accounting for current liabilities ====
===== accounting for employee liabilities =====
* Some employee liabilities are deductions from gross pay, and can be recorded to offset the salary payable liability ( they reduce the salary payable by accumulating other liabilities payable) , against a total periodic (fortnightly/ monthly ) salary expense.
                     DR   CR
 salary expense      A
 salary payable           B
 superannuation           C
 worker's comp insurance  D
 employee's tax payable   E
  
 A = B + C + D + E

Common liabilities that fall in this category
are the non-expiring ones like superannuation, worker's accident/disability insurance, and pay-as-you-go taxation.
Worker's insurance and taxation can be accumulated for lump-sum annual payment .

* Sick leave can be seen as provision type of liability, where an estimate is made based on historical sick leave about amount of total sick leave will be taken in the coming year, and expensed against a provision for sick leave. Since sick leave doesn't accrue from year to year, unused sick leave provision can reduce the next period's sick leave expense ( similar to ageing of accounts receivable bad debts provision ).

==== Definition in concept context ====
With respect to the central equation:
* Assets = Liability + Equity 

Liability and Asset  share similar adjectives of past , present, and future in their definitions:
* Arising out of defined '''past''' events
* A '''present'''  &lt;u&gt;obligation&lt;/u&gt; (liability) / &lt;u&gt;right&lt;/u&gt; ( asset)
* for the '''future''' &lt;u&gt;outflow&lt;/u&gt; ( liability) / &lt;u&gt;in flow&lt;/u&gt; ( asset) of &lt;u&gt;resources&lt;/u&gt; ( being the concrete form of abstract &lt;u&gt;economic benefit&lt;/u&gt; )

( Equity is defined as ''assets less liabilities'' ).

And they both have the same &lt;u&gt;recognition&lt;/u&gt; criteria :  &lt;u&gt;probable&lt;/u&gt; , and &lt;u&gt;measurable&lt;/u&gt; . 

These definitions may be changed soon, to emphasise concepts such as &quot;presently enforceable&quot; , &quot;present  right of control over resources(asset)/obligation of economic burden(liability)&quot;, by some accounting bodies.

  
===== Exercises =====
# define asset, liability , and equity, in the framework of 3 sentences about past, present and future , using the words ''resource'', ''economic benefit'', ''right'' and ''obligation'' . 
# Discuss the meaning : &quot;the future economic benefit has to be both probable and measurable in order for either an asset or liability to be recognized&quot;.

==== The role of ''probable'' in defining provisions and contingent liabilities ==== 
''Probable'' is more than 50% likely to occur because there was a past obligating event. The past obligating event defines
a future payment event which is 
# on a specific date
# on demand from the obligating party
# linked to another obligating event by specific agreement

A contingent liability suffers from recognition criteria failure, it can't be reliably measured, or isn't probable.

Contingent liabilities become provisions , which are recognised liabilities on financial statements, when they
become probable and can be reliably estimated ( measured ).

A reliable estimate of economic burden serves as measurability for provisions: e.g. product warranty provision: if minor repairs cost 5% of the total cost and an estimated 5% of products may require minor repairs within 2 years of sale, and major repairs cost 20% and 1% of products may require major repairs in 2 years, then a provision is made for 5% x 5% + 20 % x 1% of budgeted total sales (0.25% + 0.2% = a 0.45% of sales amount set aside as  credit to warranty provision  liability account , and the warranty expense of 0.45% recorded at the start of the same period as the expected sales . On a warranty being claimed, cash in bank is credited and warranty provision debited to settle this instance of liability with economic outflow).

==== Assessing financing as buyer or seller using financial ratios ====
The ratios concerned are classed as liquidity ratios and stability ratios. 

  
===== liquidity ratios =====
* &lt;u&gt;the quick ratio&lt;/u&gt; - this is current assets except inventory and prepaid assets over current liabilities. 
* If inventory and prepaid assets are included, then it is the &lt;u&gt;current ratio.&lt;/u&gt;
* quick ratio should be  &gt; 0.9 .
===== stability ratios =====
* assets = liabilities + equity .   Equity / assets = ( assets - liability) / assets = 1 - liability / assets. 
* equity / assets = equity  ratio.  
* liability / assets = debt ratio.  &lt; 0.6 ok.
* from above, equity ratio = 1 - liability ratio
* 1/ equity ratio = assets / equity = capitalisation ratio. &lt; 2.5 ok.  ( 1/2.5 = 2/5 = 0.4 = acceptable equity ratio threshold).

===== How to use =====
# If more than one years balance sheet is available, a company being considered for investment can be assessed by calculating the liquidity and stability ratios ( or  quick ratio and capitalisation ratio,  to be concrete ).
# the calculation is ''(current assets total - inventory - pre-paids) divided by  current liabilities''  for each year's balance sheet.
# If the quick ratio is going down and is significantly less than 1, then liquidity might be a future problem and the company might collapse. ''A quick ratio less than 1 means that if all the current liabilities are demanded, even by collecting all the current receivables and handing over all cash equivalent assets, there will still be remaining current liability''. 
* If the capitalisation ratio is &gt; 2.5, then
 assets / equity &gt; 2.5, 
 (liability + equity) / equity &gt; 2.5
 liability/equity + 1 &gt; 2.5,
liability/equity &gt; 1.5
 
* try to work out if near current liabilities have been hidden in non-current liabilities, or that contingencies exist that would turn non-current liabilities into current liabilities.

==== Accounting like considerations for taking on liability to increase finance ====
If assets = liability + equity,  and if (big if) more assets can be employed to efficiently increase income, then:
* increase liability - take on long term borrowings (non-current liabilities), which will have periodic interest expense as well as principal repayment at a fixed long-term date.
* increase equity - issue shares in the company, dilute control possibly, with the promise of retaining less profits through dividend payments (public drawings) periodically.
* the risk of increase liability is risk of failure to pay the principal and insolvency. Can liquidity ratios predict this ?
* the risk of issuing equity as shares is the loss of control of the company, with fewer retained profits due to dividend obligations, a drop in market value due to perceived dilution of share value, more mouths to feed and hence decreased EPS (earnings-per-share) for a given profit.

===== an example concrete problem statement =====
From the borrowing viewpoint, if a high probable profit is thought to be likely by increasing assets held through financing, then whether it is better to finance by issuing shares, or by increasing long term borrowings. In the first, the downside is dilution of control and dilution of earnings per share, and in the latter, the downside is increased defaulting risk, decreased liquidity ratios.
* given A= assets, L = liabilities , P = gross profit before tax of 't'% and additional interest, S the current issued shares,  if an increase in assets 'a' results in a increase in gross profits 'p' ,is it better to increase by 'a' by issuing  's' shares at 'a'/'s' per share, or borrowing 'a' at an annual interest rate of 'i'% , where an annual interest of 'i' % times 'a' will be incurred ?
** in the first ,  net profit after tax is  P + p * (100 - t) % , giving an earnings per share of ( P + p * (100 - t)/100) / (S + s) , and a debt ratio of L  / (A + a)
** in the second, net profit after tax and interest is   ( P + p (100 - i) / 100 ) * ( 100 - t) / 100 , giving an EPS of (P + p (1 - i/100) * (1-t/100) / S , and a debt ratio of (L + a) / (A + a)

Rough steps in financing:
# budget and forecast increase profit and increase in assets required. May require lots of management accounting.
# Model results of increasing liability , increasing equity or a combination of both, in order to increase assets.
# analyse consequences of possible different actions.
# choose, lead action
# review results and learn

===== Examples =====
When trying to avoid liability, a company may issue a 1 for x renounceable share issue, and sweeten the decline in EPS for shareholders by offering a discount in market value of the diluting share offerings. This of course brings the market share value down. This really annoys professional brokers as well, because they have to back pedal their BUY recommendation and qualify that growth prospects will suffer a short-term earnings downgrade.

In contrast: Before the recent GFC, many companies were being financed with large borrowings , because earnings were good and banks were happy that companies were keeping up with interest payments  as well as growing money on trees to meet the principal payment. No one really wanted earnings-per-share to go down by asking shareholders to pay for growth. But with the onset of stifled cash-flow , it was found that fair value should have been applied to some fake cash equivalents, like sub-prime backed bonds, so the numerator of the quick ratio suddenly dropped for many companies, and financial entities had to sell their investments: non-current liability flicked the contingency switch and became current, increasing the denominator of the quick ratio. The quick ratio went from comfortably above one, to a lot less than one. Growing by debt became corporate criminality in some instances. Debt restructuring can occur, but if this involves the permanent devaluation of investors interests e.g. share revaluation, where secured major investors such as banks are prioritized over unsecured shareholders ( 'the punters') , then either the smaller shareholders have to bear major losses so the major investors will continue lending because their interests are secured, or the major finance investors refuse to continue lending, because they cannot obtain their required degree of security, and the company cannot obtain money to pay current liabilities when they fall due, and the company becomes insolvent.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
The Bengali language, locally known as ''Bangla'', uses Bengali script, an Indic script somewhat similar to Devanagari script used to write [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Hindi|Hindi]].

==How many people speak this language==
Bengali is the fourth most commonly spoken language in the world with over 200 million speakers. It is the primary language of Bangladesh. 149 million 500 thousand citizens in Bangladesh speak in Bengali. Bengali is also spoken in India and Nepal by minority groups. Besides, emigrant Bangladeshis also speak in this language.

==Where is this language spoken?==
[[Image:Map of Bengal.svg|thumb|left|Where Bengali originated from.]]
Bengali is spoken in Bangladesh and in West Bengal, Tripura (states of India), Asham and also some portion of Jharkand. West Bengal and Bangladesh together formed the ancient region of Bengal. There is also a large and growing Bengali speaking population in England.

==What is the history of this language?==
Bengali evolved from the merging of some derivatives of Sanskrit with local dialects. It also was enriched with the infusion of words from Arabic, Persian and European languages. The oldest specimen of Bengali literature is ''Charyapada'' from the 7th century. 

Bengali also holds the distinction of being a language for which the speakers had to struggle a lot. In 1952, Bangladesh was part of Pakistan. The Pakistani rulers, mostly from the erstwhile Western wing of Pakistan (which forms the current state), were Urdu and Punjabi speaking, and wanted to declare Urdu as the national language. This was against the wishes of the Bengali population, who were the majority in Pakistan. On 21 February, 1952, a bloody crackdown by Police on unarmed students and activists resulted in a massacre. The movement later resulted in Bangla being recognized as one of the national languages of Pakistan. The event is commemorated as ''Language Movement Day'' in Bangladesh, and in 1999, UNESCO recognized it as the ''International Mother Language Day''.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
[[Image:Nazrul.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Nazrul playing a flute, Chittagong, 1926]]
Rabindranath Tagore is the most famous Bengali poet. He received the 1913 Nobel Prize in literature for his book of poems, ''Gitanjali''. Two of his songs are the national anthems of Bangladesh and India. 

Kazi Nazrul Islam, another famous poet was known as the rebel poet mainly because of his most famous poem called &quot;Bidrohi&quot; or &quot;The Rebel&quot;, and also because of his strong sympathy and support for revolutionary activities leading to India's independence from British Rule.

Welcome to the Hindi lessons Wikibook.

This book is an introduction to Hindi and the script used to write it. It was written as an entry at hindi.unilang.org, and the author was kind enough to grant permission to copy and freely modify the text under the GFDL. Presently it is in a very colloquial style and needs editing to conform to Wikibooks conventions and take a bit more scholastic tone (per Vasil's comments), but it is a good start.

First and foremost, let me say some words about how well I know Hindi and about the way I'll teach it...
I've learned the little Hindi I know from a guy, who call himself Siddharth. Thanks to him, I'm writing these lessons - with his permission of course ;-) So, here's the best time to give my gratitude to my guru: धन्यवाद गुरु जी (Dhanyavaad guru-ji)! 

Now, back to Hindi. I'll write the lessons in Devanagari (that is the script the Indians use to write Hindi). Don't worry if you don't know how to read Devanagari. I've written with every word in Hindi a transliteration in English letters. Apart from that I've written one short lesson about how to read the hindi script: Lesson 0. (since I'm a programmer, I always start to count from 0, lol:)

First Lesson is about the Language Hindi in general, i.e. about what's Hindi, where is it spoken etc. (of course for those who don't know :-) The number of lessons isn't great for now, as I'm learning more I'll teach more! Besides I think that Hindi grammar isn't that difficult to learn, and actually there isn't much to learn! So, after learning some basic grammatical structures and patterns you'll be able to say much in Hindi! Wish you luck! Enjoy!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hindi is written in a script called Devanagari, which is highly phonetic. Once it is learned, Hindi becomes an easy language to read. Each character is pronounced the same way it appears each time, with very few exceptions. Its primary difficulties are that 1) there are some letters written down before another character but pronounced after it, and 2) some letters are formed from the combination of two others.

We'll start with a few straightforward consonants - ''h, n, d, m, r, k''. For now we'll consider them out of &quot;alphabetical&quot; order just to get an idea how they work. They'll be presented in order later.

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;ह&lt;/span&gt;	This is the letter for the sound ''H'' as in &quot;Hindi,&quot; pronounced just as in English. Note that every Hindi consonant &quot;inherits&quot; the schwa vowel /ə/ with it unless it is otherwise marked (the schwa sound is the initial a in ''a''bout or the vowel sound in th''e''). However, the schwa is not typically pronounced when at the end of a word.  The character ह &quot;h&quot; is read with the schwa as &quot;ha.&quot;

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;न&lt;/span&gt;	This is &quot;na,&quot; similar to the English &quot;n.&quot;

Let's join the two together (by the only two possible ways) and pronounce them.

::हन 	

At first sight, this looks like &quot;hn.&quot; But with every consonant except the last comes the schwa, so we read that as &quot;han.&quot; In the ancient language Sanskrit that Hindi decends from that final &quot;a&quot; was pronounced. A contemporary Hindi speaker would read &quot;Siddharta Gautama Buddha&quot; as &quot;Siddharth Gautam Buddh.&quot;

::नह 	

That would of course be &quot;nuh&quot;.

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;द&lt;/span&gt; 	That's &quot;d&quot; as in &quot;Hindi&quot;, pronounced with the tongue a little flatter against the back of the teeth. Consonants pronounced this way are known as dental consonants. There is another d in Hindi, known as retroflex, and made with the toungue touching the roof of the mouth.

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;म&lt;/span&gt; 	M as in &quot;magnet&quot;, so same as English m. If we join two m's we'll have a word, which will be pronounced in Hindi exactly the same way as the English &quot;mum&quot;:  मम.

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;र&lt;/span&gt; 	R as in &quot;roll.&quot;

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;क&lt;/span&gt; 	K as in &quot;keen.&quot;

In Hindi each vowel is written in two ways--as a vowel mark called a matra, and as a detached vowel letter. Matras are seen more often than detached vowels. Detached vowels appear at the start of a word, or when one vowel follows another. In all other cases the vowel marks are used. 

Let's start with the vowel marks:

(I hope you remember, that every consonant comes with an &quot;a&quot; unless otherwise marked, so there is no matra for that sound)

{| style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=5px align=left 
|- valign=top
|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;ा	&lt;/span&gt;
|ā	
|The vowel &quot;ā&quot; - a straight vertical line is both its matra and its vowel mark. It sounds similar to the ''a'' in f''a''ther. The dashed little circle to its left isn't part of the language--it just shows you the place of where the preceding consonant would be. Here is a consonant with the ā matra: हा - &quot;haa&quot;.
|- valign=top
|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;ि	&lt;/span&gt;
|i 	
|The short &quot;i&quot;, pronounced as the i in English &quot;hit&quot; or as a shortened version of the vowel in see. The most important thing about it, you should certainly know, is that it's written before a consonant, but read after it! Thus हि is pronounced &quot;he.&quot;
|- valign=top
|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;ी	&lt;/span&gt;
|ī 	
|The long version of the &quot;i&quot; (ee), pronounced as the English &quot;ee&quot; in &quot;see&quot;. It's written after the consonant. With a character it looks like: ही - &quot;hee&quot;.
|- valign=top
|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;ो	&lt;/span&gt;
|o 	
|O as in &quot;domain&quot;. With ह it looks like: हो - &quot;hoe&quot;.
|- valign=top
|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;ौ	&lt;/span&gt;
|au 	
|au may be pronounced a lot like an English &quot;o&quot;, though some dialects pronounce it as a dipthong. With ह it looks like: हौ - &quot;how&quot;.
|- valign=top
|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;ु 	&lt;/span&gt;
|u 	
|That's the short u, as in &quot;look&quot;: हु - &quot;hu&quot;.
|- valign=top
|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;ू 	&lt;/span&gt;
|ū 	
|That's the long u as in &quot;coooool&quot;: हू - &quot;hoo&quot;.
|- valign=top
|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;े 	&lt;/span&gt;
|e 	
|This e is pronounced as in the ''e'' in gr''e''y. Together with ह this would be: हे.
|- valign=top
|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC3333&quot;&gt;ै 	&lt;/span&gt;
|ai 	
|That's also an e. It's e, but a bit closed sound and some speakers pronounce it as a dipthong. है
|}

An important thing, before we continue. A dot over a vowel nasalizes it, forcing some of the expired air through the nasal cavity. When pronounced, a nasalized vowel is pronounced by forcing some of the expelled air through the nose, producing a slight n or ng sound:

ं	The anusvara dot, nasalizing a vowel. For example if we have dot over no, we'll pronounce that as &quot;no~&quot; (sometimes written as &quot;non&quot;) - exactly the same as the French word for &quot;no.&quot; नो -&gt; नों (no -&gt; no~). In the lessons I will transcribe the nasalized letter as ~.

These are all the basic vowel marks, allowing us to write some words, using the letters learned so far:

हिंदी - &quot;Hindi.&quot; Let's have a closer look. First we see that the word starts with &quot;i&quot;, but since it is the short i matra, it is written before but pronounced after the next consonant, which is &quot;h,&quot; So far we have &quot;hi&quot;. Next we see the dot, nasalizing the vowel to &quot;hi~&quot; (hin). Next two letters: a dental d and the long &quot;i.&quot; This word can also be written with the na character written explicitly (in shortened form in this case) as: हिन्दी.

Some more words with what we know so far:

है - &quot;hai&quot; or &quot;hay&quot; (without the &quot;i&quot; sound in &quot;hei&quot;) means &quot;is.&quot;

हैं - &quot;hai~&quot; (hain) means &quot;are.&quot;

मैं - &quot;mai~&quot; (main) means &quot;I.&quot;


Next come the Detached forms of the Vowels:

Recall that these are used after another vowel or at the beginning of a word which starts with a vowel. Their pronunciation is exactly the same pronounciation as in their vowel mark form:

अ a	That's the sound which is equivalent of the &quot;inherited a&quot; I told you about - the one which follows every consonant, if there is no other following vowel.
आ 	ā 	Equivalent of  ा. 	
इ 	i 	Same as the short i vowel mark. 	
ई 	ī 	Same as the long i vowel mark. 	
ओ 	o 	Same as the O vowel mark.
औ 	au 	Same as AU vowel mark.
उ 	u 	Same as short u vowel mark.
ऊ 	ū 	Same as long u vowel mark.	
	
ए 	e 	Same as e vowel mark.
ऐ 	ai 	Same as ai vowel mark.

Some examples:

एक - &quot;ek&quot; = one

उन्नीस - &quot;unnīs&quot; = nineteen

आप - &quot;aap&quot; = you

उनका - &quot;unka&quot; = their

अब - &quot;ab&quot; = now

आंख - &quot;aankh&quot; = eye

अच्छा - &quot;acchā&quot; = good

और - &quot;aur&quot; = and

भाई - &quot;bhai&quot; = brother

Don't bother about the letters you don't know, we'll learn them shortly. The more important thing is that you should recognize and see the detached vowels. Now I'll continue with a comparatively full list of Hindi consonants. Learning them will enable you to read many words in Hindi. Of course there are also combinations of characters to learn, which will be the final step. The consonants are now shown in groups in their traditional order representing their pronunciation classes.

Gutturals (sound is made from the back of throat)
*क 	ख 	ग 	घ 	ङ		
*k 	kh 	g 	gh 	ng		
						
Palatals (sound is made by the tongue touching the hard palate)
*च 	छ 	ज 	झ 	ञ		
*c 	ch 	j 	jh 	ñ		
						
Cerebrals (sound is made by rolling the tongue)
*ट 	ठ 	ड 	ढ 	ण		
*T 	Th 	D 	Dh 	N		
						
Dentals (sound is made by the tongue touching the teeth)
*त 	थ 	द 	ध 	न 		
*t 	th 	d 	dh 	n 		
						
Labials (sound is made with lips closed or almost closed)
*प 	फ 	ब 	भ 	म 		
*p 	ph 	b 	bh 	m 		
						
Semi Vowels (pronounced with lips and throat open)
*य 	र 	ल 	व 			
*y 	r 	l 	v/w 			
						
Sibliants / Aspirants
*श 	ष 	स 	ह 	ज़ 		
*sh 	ssh 	s 	h 	z 		
						
Compound and Others
*क्ष 	त्र 	ज्ञ 	श्र 	ऋ 		
*ksh 	tr 	gy 	shr 	ri 		
											
Double Letters (formed only from one consonant, but doubled..., actually easy to spot)
(* Note that on some browsers you won't see the letters properly and instead of seeing one letter under another, you'll see one letter left to another with the first letter having under it the special mark, called &quot;virama&quot; to make it semi-consonant.)
क्क 	ट्ट 	ठ्ठ 	त्त 	न्न 	ड्ड 	द्द
KK 	TT 	TTH 	T'T' 	NN (*Note the similarity with TR) 	DD 	D'D'

Now, just one thing before we end the lesson, and it's very important thing: half consonants.
I told you that every consonant comes with the vowel &quot;a&quot; with it. So when you see &quot;sm&quot; you should read this as &quot;sam&quot;. But what if you want to say something that begins with &quot;sm&quot;, not &quot;sam&quot;. When one wants to mute the inherited a-vowel, there is a special mark called &quot;virama&quot;. It's put below the letter and if you see a letter with such mark you don't have to pronounce &quot;A&quot; after it. Let us see how that virama-thing looks like:

टम = T + m = Tam
ट्म = T + virama + M = Tm

You see the small mark under the T? I bet you do! Well, that's the virama, it mutes the a, so we pronounce &quot;Tm&quot;, not &quot;Tam&quot;. However as much as useful it may be, it's not used that much in  handwriting because almost all consonants in Hindi have their &quot;half consonant&quot; equivalent, so it's not necessary to write the virama, but instead of this one has to write the corresponding half consonant. Half consonant are extremely easy to notice, since they look like the left half of a consonant. Here is an example:

सक = s + k = sak
स्क = Half s + k = sk

Some half letters do combine with the next consonant and change shape. I'll give you some of those which you will encounter most often:

Half Letter + n:
(again: on some browsers you won't see the proper combinations, but consonant + virama + n)

ब् + न = ब्न
ह् + न = ह्न
ग् + न = ग्न
द् + न = द्न
प् + न = प्न
र् + न = र्न  * that needs an extended explanation, see below
क् + न = क्न
त् + न = त्न
म् + न = म्न
व् + न = व्न
स् + न = स्न

Half Letter + R:

ब् + र = ब्र
ह् + र = ह्र
ग् + र = ग्र
द् + र = द्र
ज् + र = ज्र
ड् + र = ड्र
प् + र = प्र
र् + र = र्र * that needs an extended explanation, see below
क् + र = क्र
त् + र = त्र
च् + र = च्र
ट् + र = ट्र
म् + र = न्र
न् + र = न्र
व् + र = व्र
ल् + र = ल्र
स् + र = स्र
य् + र = य्र

Note how similar the &quot;half letter + n&quot; and &quot;half letter + r&quot; are. There is only one little difference, something like the little hook on the N version.

Half r + Consonant:

The half R, followed of course by consonant, is showed by a mark over the second consonants. This mark looks the same as the mark which differentiate the short i detached vowel from the long detached vowel ī. Remember if you see that mark read it as R, but before the consonant it modifies. Some examples:

र्ह, र्स, र्म, र्न, र्ज, र्द, र्ट, र्त

That letters should be read, according to their order: rh, rs, rm, rn, rj, rd, rT, rt

So, that's it. You've learned as much as you'll need to know to be able to read most Hindi texts. For example, you can test yourself by reading (although not understanding) the Hindi version of the web-site of BBC, there you can find some names of countries or famous people, written in Devanagari. That's what I did to show you some examples:

*पाकिस्तान  = Pakistan
*ताजमहल = Taj Mahal
*केनेडी = Kennedy
*बग़दाद = Baghdad
*क्रिकेट = Cricket
*वेबगाइड = Webguide
*इंटरनेट = Internet
*माइक्रोसॉफ़्ट = Microsoft
*इराक़ = Iraq
*सद्दाम हुसैन = Saddam Hussein
*ग़ज़ा = Gaza
*इसराइल = Israel
*इंडोनेशिया = Indonesia
*मेडागास्कर = Madagascar
*श्रीलंका = Sri Lanka
*ईरान = Iran
*कॉलिन पॉवेल = Colin Powell
*अल्जीरिया = Algeria
*बुश = Bush (yeah, the former president of the USA)
*अमरीका = America
*यूरोप = Europe
*तुर्की = Turkey
*यूरो = Euro
*कोरिया = Korea

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 1: About Hindi. Linguistic Information.

The Republic of India has 18 official or national languages: Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Panjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu and English. Not all languages are from the same group, thus an Indian speaker of Hindi would understand a Tamil speaker as well as for example an Englishman would understand a Chinese! Hindi as one of the official languages of India (Bhaarat) has more than 180 000 000 speakers! It's an Indo-European language, descendant of Sanskrit. It uses the Devanagari script to write. Another name for the language Hindi, is &quot;khadi boli&quot; (khari boli) - that's actually the name of a dialect, spoken originally in Delhi, from which Hindi developed. Surprisingly, Hindi isn't spoken only in India and parts of the surrounding countries, but also in... Africa! Yes, it's true and all Hindi speakers in Africa are more than 2 000 000! About the half of them live in South Africa (~800 000) and Uganda (~150 000).

Urdu, the national language of Pakistan is the same language as Hindi (FYI, back in history, India was a much bigger country, including the territories of today's Pakistan and Bangladesh. In those times the language spoken in the country was called Hindustani...). In some cases it's spoken about as the Hindi-Urdu language. However as languages, spoken in different countries, they are in many aspects different - mostly in vocabulary. Since Urdu is spoken in an Islamic country it had borrowed many words from Arabic and Persian and thus it has an Arabic hue, whereas Hindi would use rather Sanskrit words... Another difference is the writing system. As I said, Hindi uses the Devanagari script, but Urdu uses a modified version of the Arabic script (or rather the script used by Persians).

Most of the other official language of India possess their own script. However some of them use the Devanagari script too. Marathi is written in Devanagari for example. Gujarati has its own script. Some Panjabi speakers use the Devanagari script as well, but other (the Sikhs) use a special script, called &quot;Gurumukhi&quot;. It's very similar to Hindi though... It's regarded as the script of the gurus (teachers), so it got its name - guru = teacher, mukh = mouth. On the other hand, &quot;Devanagari&quot; means &quot;the heavenly script&quot; or the script used in the city of gods (deva = god, nagari = city, town)...

To get a simple idea of how Hindi looks like written, see the text below:

हिन्दुस्तान में बहुत सारी भाषाएँ बोली जाती हैं और इस से पता चलता है कि भारत दुनिया का सब से बड़ा प्रजातान्त्रिक देश है।।

So, that was the very first lesson. It's short, yes, but I think it's important, since for me it's important to know some &quot;linguistic&quot; background of the language I learn. I think you share my opinion on that.

Anyways, now you're ready to get to Lesson 2, where you can find and learn your first words in the fascinating language Hindi!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 2: Some Basic Words &amp; Phrases

In this lesson we will learn some very basic Hindi phrases. We'll start with the two little words &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. I think they would be useful :-) So here we are:

* '''हाँ = YES''' ( haa~ - note the nasal &quot;n&quot;)
* '''नहीं = NO''' ( nahi~ - note the nasal &quot;n&quot;)

If you want to sound more polite you have can use the particle &quot;जी&quot; (ji). Remember it well! It's a very important particle, similar to Japanese &quot;さん&quot; (san) or Korean &quot;씨&quot; (sshi) in that it can be glued at the end of a name or title. If instead of &quot;Hello Mr. X&quot; you say &quot;Hello Mr. X-ji&quot; a Hindi native would appreciate it... So, let's get back to our &quot;yes-no&quot; thingie and see how to use &quot;ji&quot; there:

*      ''' जी हाँ = YES''' (or &quot;Yes, sir&quot;... Ji Haa~)
*       '''जी नहीं = NO''' (or &quot;No, sir&quot;... Ji Nahi~)

Note that you can place &quot;ji&quot; after &quot;haa~&quot; or &quot;nahi~&quot; too:

*       '''हाँ जी = YES''' (or &quot;Yes, sir&quot;... Haa~ Ji)
*       '''नहीं जी = NO''' (or &quot;No, sir&quot;... Nahi~ Ji)

You can also use जी (ji) on its own. Alone it can mean &quot;YES&quot;, so if you reply to a question just with &quot;ji&quot; you speak proper Hindi. It can mean &quot;what?&quot; &quot;pardon me&quot; &quot;yes?&quot; etc.:

*       '''जी = YES''' (kinda the English &quot;yeah&quot; or &quot;yep&quot;)
*      ''' जी = Yes?''' Pardon me? What? What do you mean? etc.

Now it's time to learn how to say &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot;. Here they are:

*       '''नमस्ते = Hello! OR Goodbye!''' ( Namaste )

As you see &quot;namaste&quot; is universal, just like Italian &quot;Ciao&quot; or Hawaiian &quot;Aloha,&quot; which also are used for both hello and goodbye. There is another form of &quot;namaste&quot;. It's namaskar, bearing the same meaning, and used more frequently in Southern India; you can use it instead of &quot;namaste&quot;. They're fully interchangable. Of course if you want to be more polite, you can add the famous &quot;ji&quot; particle :-)

The language of Indian Muslims and Hindus from northeast India and Pakistan is more influenced by Persian, Arabic, and the Islamic religion. For example a Muslim might use the arabic &quot;assalamu alaikum,&quot; or peace be upon you (salam /selam/ means peace, the same as the Hebrew &quot;shalom&quot;) instead of the Hindu &quot;namaste.&quot; If you are greeted with &quot;assalamu alaikum&quot;, the proper response is &quot;walaikum assalam&quot; (peace be upon you too). In Urdu one says &quot;khuda hafiz&quot; for &quot;goodbye.&quot; If you meet a Muslim you can use that for goodbye...

Next we'll learn two words, designating &quot;thanks&quot; or &quot;thank you&quot;:

*       '''धन्यवाद = Thank you.''' ( Dhanyavaad, it's the &quot;native&quot; Hindi word )
*       '''शुक्रिया = Thank you.''' ( Shukriyaa, from the Arabic word &quot;shukran&quot;)

We'll end this lesson with a phrase, meaning &quot;Where are you from&quot;. You don't yet need to know what the words in there really mean, just remember it just as a phrase:

*       '''आप कहां से हैं? = Where are you from?''' ( Aap kahaa~ se hain? )
**Note that ~ is used to show nasal sound, i.e. nasalized a. I'll use always that mark to indicate nasalized sounds.

The transliterated &quot;ai&quot; is pronounced not as &quot;a&quot; + &quot;i&quot;, but as &quot;ae&quot; or &quot;e&quot;. It's similar to the sound of &quot;a&quot; in &quot;apple&quot;. I don't write it as &quot;e&quot; to distinguish it from the other 'e'.

That's all for this lesson. Before you continue be sure to remember it well!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 3: Pronouns.

First, a basic table of the Hindi personal pronouns, then some explanation.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| वह / यह (voh/vah) (yeh)
| He/She/It/That
| ये (ye)
| They/Those
|}	

तु (tu) is used only for very close person, e.g. one's girlfriend/boyfriend. तुम (tum) is probably the most used word for &quot;you&quot; (singular) in Hindi. It can be used with everybody, unless one wants to be polite, in which case one says &quot;aap&quot; (आप). NB. When using &quot;aap&quot; (आप) or &quot;tum&quot; (तुम) conjugate the verb for plural. Well, you don't know how to conjugate at this point, but do remember this rule! When meeting someone for the first time, politeness is appropriate, so it is better to use &quot;aap&quot; for &quot;you.&quot;

Next, the demonstrative pronouns:

*यह = This ( yeh / yah )
*वह = That ( woh / wah )

*ये = These ( ye )
*वे = Those ( ve )

And, the possesive pronouns:

|तुम्हारा (tumhara - /tum/)
|Your

|उसका (uska)

| 		
|
|}

So, let's build a Hindi sentence.

*है = is ( hai /hae/ )

*मेरा नाम Peter है = My name is Peter. (Mera naam Peter hai.    नाम (naam) means &quot;name&quot;).

NB: The verb in Hindi is always placed at the end of the sentence, a feature which many Asian languages share. (Hindi is SOV, i.e Subject-Object-Verb, language). Thus, for &quot;My name is Peter&quot; we say, &quot;My name Peter is.&quot; More examples:

*उसका नाम Peter है. = His name is Peter. (Uska naam Peter hai.)
*यह पानी है. = This is water. (Yah pani hai.)
*यह घर है. = This is a house. (Yeh ghar hai.)

That's enough material for this lesson I think. The next lesson will address genders and verbs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 4: '''Genders in Hindi. Hindi Verbs''' - Part 1.

Unlike many European languages which have have three genders or those such as English which have none, Hindi has precisely two, masculine and feminine. There is no reliable rule for which words are which, but one can often deduce a word's gender from its ending. Most Hindi words end in a vowel. Those ending in -a are usually masculine. Those ending in -i (actually the long i - ee) are usually feminine. There are of course some words that end in consonants or other vowels, whose gender cannot be predicted and must be learned. When we learn the adjectives and verb conjugation we will find that those -a and -i endings are very important. So, please remember that well:


'''-a (ा)'''  -  general mark of masculine words (singular!) - nouns, adjectives, verbs

'''-i (ी)'''  -  general mark of feminine words (even both - singular and plural) - nouns, adjectives, verbs


Many masculine Hindi words (ending in -a of course:) can be turned into feminine ones by simply replacing the -a ending with -i! For example:


लड़का (larka) = boy,        लड़की (larki) = girl  

बिल्ला (billa) = tomcat,        बिल्ली (billi) = cat, pussycat


Some masculine words ending in -a:

कमरा (kamra) = room
केला (kela) = banana
तारा (tara) = star
हवा (hava) = wind

Feminine Words ending in -i (-ee):

चीनी (chini) = sugar

But exceptions exist. for e.g., the following end in -i (-ee) but are masculine:

पानी (pani) = water
पक्षी (pakshi) = bird


Some words ending with consonants:

दोस्त (dost) = friend (masculine)
किताब (kitab) = book (feminine)
औरत (aurat) = woman (feminine :-)

A word ending in a vowel different from -a or -i:

गुरु (guru) = teacher

To the general rule of the -a and -i ending there exist some exceptions, that is, there exist some masculine words, which end in -i. For example, the word for &quot;man&quot;:

आदमी (aadmi) = man



'''Verbs in Hindi. General Information.'''

The infinitive form of every Hindi verb ends in &lt;u&gt;ना (-na)&lt;/u&gt;:

खाना (khana) = to eat

पीना (pina) = to drink

जाना (jana) = to go

आना (aana) = to come

करना (karna) = to do (remember this one as it's used in many compound verb forms)

देना (dena) = to give

लेना (lena) = to take

लिखना (likhna) = to write

पढना (padhna) = to read

समझना (samajhna) = to understand

समझाना (samjhaana) = to explain (i.e. to make someone understand)

सीखना (sikhna) = to learn

For the root of the verb, required for conjugation, remove its -na ending. 


&lt;u&gt;Making plurals&lt;/u&gt;:

In plural the masculine -a ending becomes -e while the feminine -i ending either remains -i or becomes -i~:

'''-a (ा)'''   -  general mark of masculine words (singular) - MASC. SG.

'''-e (े)'''   -  general mark of masculine words (plural) - MASC. PL.

'''-i (ी)'''   -  general mark of feminine words (singular and plural) - FEM. SG. and PL.    

'''-in and -i~'''   -    occasional mark of feminine words (plural) - FEM. PL.


Now back to verbs:

Add &lt;u&gt;&quot;ता&quot; (ta)&lt;/u&gt; to verb root for masculine singular and &lt;u&gt;&quot;ते&quot; (te)&lt;/u&gt; for masculine plural. Add &lt;u&gt;&quot;ती&quot; (ti)&lt;/u&gt; for feminine singular and plural.

Examples:

खाता (khata) = eat
पीता (pita) = drink
etc.

However, although these verbs are now conjugated, they are not quite ready to use. One cannot say &quot;Mai~ khata&quot;; one must use the copula &quot;to be,&quot; the most important verb in Hindi:


The verb '''&quot;TO BE&quot; (Hona - होना)'''


मैं हुं (mai~ hu~) = I am

तु है (tu hai) = You (intimate) are

तुम हो (tum ho) = You are

वह है (voh hai) = He/She/It/That is


हम हैं (ham hai~) = We are

आप हैं (aap hai~) = You are

वे हैं (ve hai~) = They are


Let's give you a pattern:

Verb root + TA / TE / TI    +   Conjugated corresponding form of &quot;Hona&quot; (to be)    =    Present Imperfect Tense

Some examples: 

NB:  Hindi does not use articles

मैं खाता हुं. (mai~ khata hu~) = I eat.

लडका खाता है. (larka khata hai) = The (A) boy eats. 

लडकी खाती है. (larki khati hai) = The (A) girl eats.

आप पीते हैं. (aap pite hai~) = You (polite sg.) drink OR You (plural) drink.

मैं पानी पीता हुं. (mai~ pani pita hu~) = I drink water.

तुम पानी पीते हो. (tum pani pite ho) = You drink water. NB: &quot;tum&quot; is the most used word for &quot;you&quot; and is actually plural. So whenever you use it, conjugate the verb as plural.

A final, somewhat &quot;funny,&quot; example:

मैं सिगरेट पीता हुं. (mai~ sigaret pita hu~). I smoke a cigarette... The literal meaning of the sentence is &quot;I drink a cigarette.&quot; Every language has its oddities and peculiarities!

More about other verb tenses in the next lesson(s). Please do revise this whole lesson well before continuing to the next one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 5: Hindi Verbs - Part 2.

We continue with some other tenses in Hindi:


'''Present Continuous Tense''':

&lt;u&gt;Verb Stem + रहा / रहे / रही (raha/rahe/rahi) + Present Tense of &quot;Hona&quot; (to be)&lt;/u&gt;

For those who don't like grammatical terms and don't know for sure what's &quot;continuous tense&quot;, I'll tell that it's the same as the English verbs, ending in &quot;-ing&quot;. So if you want to say that you &quot;read&quot; a book in the moment of speaking, you have to say &quot;I am reading a book&quot;, not simply &quot;I read a book&quot;, because the last could mean that you read a book in general, i.e. you're not reading it in the moment of speaking. So let's clear all that out with some examples.

&lt;li&gt; मैं किताब पढ रहा हुं. (mai~ kitab padh raha hu~) = I'm reading a book. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; मैं पानी पी रहा हुं. (mai~ pani pi raha hu~) = I'm drinking water. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; मैं रोटी खा रही हुं. (mai~ roti kha rahi hu~) = I'm eating bread. (a girl speaking!)  &lt;/li&gt;

The verbs stem and raha/rahe/rahi are pronounced almost as one (at once), although they're written separately. Sometimes in colloquial speech all is even shortened more. The &quot;raha hu~&quot; for example is pronounced &quot;rahu~&quot;, &quot;raha hai&quot; as &quot;rahai&quot;, &quot;raha hai~&quot; -&gt; &quot;rahai~&quot;...

&lt;hr/&gt;

'''Past Tense''':  &lt;br /&gt;
(This section needs to be revised as it does not account for the distinction between intransitive and transitive verbs. When forming the perfect tense (past) in Hindi, the verb will not always match the traditional subject of your sentence in gender/number (this depends on transitivity of the verb). Some of the examples below are incorrect for this reason and should be rewritten according to standard Hindi grammar and the &quot;ne&quot; construction.)

Building past is easy. Just take the root of a verb and add -a, -e, or -i, respectively for Masculine Singular, Masculine Plurar and Feminine both - Singular and Plurar:

&lt;u&gt;Verb Stem + ा/े/ी (-A/-E/-I) = Past Tense&lt;/u&gt;

'''Note:''' For verbs, whose stem end in a vowel you have to add '''या/ये/यी''' (ya/ye/yi)
E.g. खाना -&gt; खा -&gt; खाया(Khana -&gt; Kha (stem) -&gt; Khaya)

&lt;u&gt;'''Some examples:'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; मैं खाया. (mai~ khaya) = I ate. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; मैं पढा. (mai~ padha) = I read. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; लडका खाया. (larka khaya) = The boy ate. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; लडकी खायी. (larki khayi) = The girl ate. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; आप पीया. (aap piya) = You drank. (Sg. polite or Plural) &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; मैं पानी पीया. (mai~ pani piya) = I drank water. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; तुम पानी पीये. (tum pani piye) = You drank water. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

Some Verbs are irregular. I'll show you some of them (A little below you'll see the past of 'to be', which is needed to build the imperfect past tense, necessary to be able to say such phrases as &quot;I've used to go ...&quot;):

Past of '''जाना''' (Janaa = to go)

गया / गये / गयी / गयीं (gaya / gaye / gayi / gayi~)
(1: Masc. Sg, 2: Masc. Pl. 3: Fem. Sg, 4: Fem. Pl.)

To build the past imperfect tense, we have first to learn the past tense of the &quot;main&quot; hindi verb: &quot;to be&quot; (Hona). Past of &quot;hona&quot; is even simplier than the present form:

Past of '''होना''' (Honaa = To be)

था (tha) = was (for Masculine SINGULAR)
थे (the) = were (for Masculine PLURAL)

थी (thi) = was (for Feminine SINGULAR)
थीं (thi~) = was (for Feminine PLURAL)

Examples:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; मैं वहां था. (mai~ vaha~ tha.) = I was there. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; आप यहां थे. (aap yaha~ the) = You (polite) were here OR You (plural) were here. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; (वहां /vaha~/ = there, यहां /yaha~/ = here, जहां /jaha~/ = where) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Now as you know here/there/where (btw, there exists also another word for where = kaha~) I'll give you a Hindi proverb:

जहां धुआं है, वहां आग भी है. (jahan dhua~ hai, vaha~ aag bhi hai) = Where there is a smoke, there is a fire too.

&lt;hr/&gt;
'''Past Imperfect Tense''':

...
&lt;u&gt;Verb Stem + ता / ते / ती (TA/TE/TI) + Past Tense of &quot;Hona&quot; (to be) = Past Imperfect Tense
Stem + ता/ते/ती + था/थे/थी/थीं = Past Imperfect Tense
&lt;/u&gt;
The past imperfect tense is used to tell about habitual actions in the past. In English it's best translated with the pattern &quot;used to + verb&quot;:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; मैं खाता था. (mai~ khata tha) = I used to eat. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; लडका खाता था. (larka khata tha) = The boy used to eat. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; लडकी खाती थी. (larki khati thi) = The girl used to eat. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; आप पीते थे. (aap pite the) = You used to drink. (Sg. polite or Plural) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; मैं पानी पीता था. (mai~ pani pita tha) = I used to drink water. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; तुम पानी पीते थे. (tum pani pite the) = You used to drink water. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Next comes of course the past continous tense:

&lt;hr/&gt;
'''Past Continuous Tense''':

Well, no need to help you much here. It's the same as the present continous except that it's used the past tense of Hona:

&lt;u&gt;Verb Stem + रहा / रहे / रही (raha/rahe/rahi) + Past Tense of &quot;Hona&quot; (to be) = Past Continuous Tense&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;li&gt; मैं किताब पढ रहा था. (mai~ kitab padh raha tha) = I was reading a book. &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt; मैं पानी पी रहा था. (mai~ pani pi raha tha) = I was drinking water. &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt; मैं रोटी खा रही थी. (mai~ roti kha rahi thi) = I was eating bread. (a girl speaking!) &lt;/li&gt;

I think you got it, now for the FUTURE:

&lt;hr/&gt;
'''Future Tense''':

The Future tense it a bit more complicated than the past for it has more verb-endings for person than those by the past tense.

&lt;u&gt;Future Imperfect Tense&lt;/u&gt;:

Let us conjugate a verb in the future tense, then I'll give the endings:

Future Imperfect of &quot;Pina&quot; ('''पीना''' = to drink)

&lt;li&gt; मैं पीउंगा (mai~ piunga) = I will drink &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; तु पीएगा (tu piega) = You will drink &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; तुम पीओगे (tum pioge) = You will drink &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; वह पीएगा (voh piega) = He/She/It will drink. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; हम पीएंगे (ham pienge) = We will drink &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; आप पीएंगे (aap pienge) = You will drink. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; वे पीएंगे (ve pienge) = They will drink. &lt;/li&gt;

For &quot;I&quot; use -unga, for &quot;Tu&quot; use &quot;ega&quot;, for &quot;Tum&quot; use &quot;oge&quot;, for &quot;voh&quot; use &quot;ega&quot; and for &quot;ham/aap/ve&quot; the plural form &quot;enge&quot;.

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Future Continuous Tense&lt;/u&gt;:

To build that tense use these endings:  रहूंगा रहेगा रहेंगे रहोगे (rahunga/rahega/rahenge/rahoge) similarly as the forms for Future Imperfect together with the &quot;conjugated&quot; verb.

&lt;u&gt;Verb Stem + TA / TE / TI + rahunga/rahega/rahenge/rahoge = Future Continuous Tense&lt;/u&gt;

Let's make the future continuous of the verb &quot;pina&quot; to make things clear:

Future Continuous of &quot;Pina&quot; (पीना = to drink)

&lt;li&gt; मैं पीता रहुंगा. (mai~ pita rahunga) = I will be drinking. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; तु पीता रहेगा. (tu pita rahega) = You will be drinking. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; तुम पीते रहोगे. (tum pite rahoge) = You will be drinking. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; वह पीता रहेगा. (voh pita rahega) = He/She/It will be drinking. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; हम पीते रहेंगे. (hum pite rahenge) = We will be drinking. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; आप पीते रहेंगे. (aap pite rahenge) = You will be drinking. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; वे पीते रहेंगे. (ve pite rahenge) = They will be drinking. &lt;/li&gt;

So, now you have everything you have to know about verbs except if I've missed something. That was a long and a hard lesson so have a rest before you go to the next lesson :)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 6: Adjectives. Colors

After the long and fatiguing lesson about hindi tenses, let me explain you how adjectives act in hindi in a short and neat lesson :-)

What you've learned so far will help you much to understand the adjectives in Hindi. Actually they act just like nouns or verbs, having the ending -a for masculine and -i for feminine (generally speaking). The other thing you have to know about them is that they're declined according to the noun they modify. Nothing new as I said! Here are some adjectives, which I'll use a little below in a few examples.

Some Adjectives:

* बडा (bada - some pronounce that 'bara') = Big
* छोटा (chhota) = Small
* लम्बा (lamba) = Long
* महंगा (mahnga) = Expensive
* सस्ता(sasta) = Cheap
* साफ (saf) = Clean
* गान्दा(gandha) = Dirty
* ठण्डा(thanda) = Cold
* गर्म (garam) = Hot

Note that all adjectives given above are in masculine. To make them feminine simply change the -a to an -i and of course those not ending in a vowel do not change at all...

Now we'll use those to build some sentences you already are familiar with:

यह बडा घर है. (Yeh bara ghar hai. ) = This is a big house.  
यह घर बडा है. (Yeh ghar bara hai.) = This house is big. 
लडकी अच्छी रोटी खाती है. (larki acchi roti khati hai) = The girl eats a tasty bread.
मैं ठण्डी पानी पी रहा हुं. (mai~ thandi pani pi raha hu~) = I'm drinking cold water.

Note how meaning can change depending on the position of the adjective in the first two sentences. Actually nothing so different in meaning, but rather the way of saying that &quot;the house is big&quot; is changed...
Now you get the idea, I hope. Therefore let me show you some colors:

* रंग (rang) = Color
* सफेद (safed) = White
* काला (kala) = Black
* नील (nila) = Blue
* हरा (hara) = Green
* पीला (pila) = Yellow
* लाल (lal) = Red

I've mentioned it above, but I'll say it once again. You have to &quot;decline&quot; the adjective according to the word it modifies. If it's masculine, use the adjective with the ending -a else i.e. if the word being modified is feminine change the ending to -i. If a word ends in a consonant however you don't have to decline it at all!

You have it all now. You can build crazy sentences as for example &quot;This is a blue house&quot; (Yeh nila ghar hai) or &quot;The girl eats red bread&quot; (Ladki lal roti khati hai) etc. :-) Just be imaginative. I won't give more examples in this lesson. I've promised it'll be short, so it is. Next lesson is about the cases. It isn't really hard, but it's very important. There you'll learn some postpositions as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 7: Cases in Hindi. The Direct and Oblique cases. Plural of Nouns.

Like the many prepostitions in English (e.g. in, at, on, under, below, of etc.) in Hindi there exist the so called postpositions, playing the same role as the English prepostitions, having the same meaning, but with the only difference that they stay after the noun not before it. For example in English we say &quot;In London&quot;, but in Hindi that would be &quot;London in&quot; (London men).

In Hindi there are two cases: The Direct case and The Oblique case. When a word is used with a postposition it is in the Oblique case, in all other cases it is in the Direct case. The Direct case is rather like the Nominative case in many European languages. Here are some postpositions:

में (me~) = In
से (se) = From
का (ka) = Of
को (ko) = (To) Not really translatable, used to build Dative and Accusative. I'll explain a little below.

In the previous lessons, I gave many nouns. Their forms are the main forms, i.e. they're in the Direct case. I explained also that masculine nouns ending in -a become in the plural the ending -i. That's the general rule. However there are words, which do not end in -a and I haven't explained the plural of feminine, so here it goes:

      Singular and Plural of Nouns in the Direct Case:

Masculine: Ending in -a

Singular:   लडका (ladka) = boy
Plural:   लडके (ladke) = boys

Masculine: Ending in other vowel (very few):

Singular:   गुरु (guru) = teacher
Plural:   गुरु (guru) = teachers

Masculine: Ending in a consonant

Singular:   दोस्त (dost) = friend
Plural:   दोस्त (dost) = friends

Feminine: Ending in -i

Singluar:   लडकी (ladki) = girl
Plural:   लड़कियां (ladkiya) = girls

Feminine: Ending in a consonant

Singular:   किताब (kitab) = book
Plural:   किताबें (kitabe~) = books

Feminine: Ending in -a or -u

Singular:   अध्यापिका (adhyapika) = female teacher
Plural:   अध्यापिकाएं (adhyapikae~) = female teachers

All the sentences I gave in past lessons you can easily turn into plural now or in some cases the sentences are even in plural since some words don't change in plural. Let me show you some examples:

लड़कियां अच्छी राटी खातीं हैं. (larkiya acchi rati khati~ hai~). = The girls eat tasty bread.
लडके अच्छी रोटी खाते हैं. (larke acchi roti khate hai~) = The boys eat tasty bread.
ये बडे घर हैं. (Ye bare ghar hai~) = These are big houses.
वे सुन्दर लड़कियां हैं. (Ve sundar larkiya~ hai~) = Those (they) are pretty girls.
वे लड़कियां सुन्दर हैं. (Ve larkiya~ sundar hai~) = Those girls are pretty.

Now for the oblique case. Nouns change in singular and plural in the oblique case as well, here is the explanation (to make it easier for you i'll use the same words as in the examples of direct case above):

      Singular and Plural of Nouns in the Oblique Case:

Masculine: Ending in -a

Singular:   लडके (ladke)
Plural:   लडकों (ladko~)

Masculine: Ending in other vowel (very few):

Singular:   गुरु (guru)
Plural:   गुरुओं(guruo~)
(for &quot;admi&quot; /man/ it'll be &quot;admiyo~&quot; - आदमियों)

Masculine: Ending in a consonant

Singular:   दोस्त (dost)
Plural:   दोस्तों (dosto~)

Feminine: Ending in -i

Singluar:   लडकी (ladki)
Plural:   लड़कियों (ladkiyo~)

Feminine: Ending in a consonant

Singular:   किताब (kitab)
Plural:   किताबों (kitabo~)

Feminine: Ending in -a or -u

Singular:   अध्यापिका (adhyapika)
Plural:   अध्यापिकाओं (adhyapikao~)

At last you know the cases in Hindi. Now (believe me) you know almost all grammar in Hindi! Congats! Now we can extend our well-know sentences and make them look really long. Let's try:

सफेद घर में लडकीया अच्छी रोटी खातीं हैं. (safed ghar men larkiya acchi roti khati~ hai~). = The girls eat tasty bread in the white house.
मैं कमरे में ठण्डी पानी पी रहा हुं और लडकी अच्छी राटी खा रही है. (mai~ kamre me~ thandi pani pi raha hu~ aur ladki acchi rati kha rahi hai). = I'm drinking cold water in the room and the girl is eating tasty bread.
etc... The point is, whenever you wanna say &quot;in&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;of&quot; etc of something, you have to use the oblique case, since you use the word with a postposition. Note for example how it is: &quot;kamre me~&quot;, not &quot;kamra me~&quot;, because we use the postposition &quot;in&quot; (me~).

Now I want to explain to you the use of the postposition particle &quot;ka&quot;, meaning &quot;of&quot;.

      Use of the postposition &quot;का&quot; (ka) = OF

1. Since it's a postposition you always have to use the word preceding it in the Oblique case.
2. Second thing you have to know about it is, that it could (and should :) change to ke/ki according to the word following it (the object).

In English we say &quot;the house of the girl&quot;. In Hindi that should be said as &quot;the girl '''s'' house&quot;. In this case &quot;the girl&quot; should be in oblique case and house of course (since obviously it is the object) is in the direct case. Our example will be in Hindi &quot;Ladki ka ghar&quot; (लडकी का घर). But if we use a feminine word for an object &quot;ka&quot; changes to &quot;ki&quot; as in &quot;Ladki ki sari&quot; (लडकी की सरी), meaning &quot;the sari of the girl&quot; (sari is a traditional indian female clothing). Then if we wanna say &quot;the houses of the girl&quot; we have to say &quot;ladki ke ghar&quot; (लडकी के घर). I think you got the idea. Now we can build even bigger sentences...

The last thing I should tell you about in this lesson is the use of the particle (postposition) &quot;ko&quot;. It could be translated as &quot;to&quot;, but in some cases it shouldn't be translated at all. That's so because actually it's the accusative or dative marker. If somebody is the receiver of an action (or the verb) you have to use that particle.

      Use of the postposition &quot;को&quot; (ko)

I'll give first some examples and then explain:

लडका लडकीयों को पानी देता है. (ladka ladkiyo~ ko pani deta hai) = The boy gives water to the girls.
लडका लडकीयों को किताबें देता है. (ladka ladkiyo~ ko kitabe~ deta hai) = The boy gives the books to the girls.
मैं लडके को जानता हुं. (mai~ ladke ko janta hu~) = I know the boy.
मैं लडकी को जानता हुं. (mai~ ladki ko janta hu~) = I know the girl.
मैं लडकों को जानता हुं. (mai~ ladko~ ko janta hu~) = I know the boys.
मैं लड़कियों को जानता हुं. (mai~ ladkiyo~ ko janta hu~) = I know the girls.

Some verbs require the use of dative/accusative and thus the use of 'ko'. Such verb is &quot;to know - janna&quot; (as spanish &quot;conocer&quot;, italian &quot;conoscere&quot; or german &quot;kennen&quot;), there are of course other verbs of that sort as for example &quot;to give&quot;. &quot;I give the book to the girl&quot; -&gt; To whom do I give to book? -&gt; to the girl (or even just 'the girl') -&gt; dative, so &quot;ladki ko&quot;... I'm sure I'll find a better way to explain that, but for now use that poor explanation. However I think examples do much...

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 8: Modal Verbs.

Modal verbs are those such as &quot;to want&quot;, &quot;can&quot; (to be able to), &quot; to need to,&quot; &quot;to have to&quot; etc... This lesson covers how to use such verbs in Hindi, in particular these four.

(1). Can /be able to/ = sakna (सकना)
You only have to know that it's added to the root of the main verb. &quot;I can read hindi&quot; - in that sentence &quot;the main verb&quot; is &quot;read&quot;. So:

Verb stem + SAKNA / सकना (sakta/sakte/sakti/sakti~) + To be (hona, conjugeted) = Can + Verb

Oh, of course you must &quot;conjugate&quot; the verb sakna as I taught you (i.e. add ta/te/ti/ti~ to it's stem &quot;sak&quot;). Here are some examples:

मैं हिंदी में लिख सकता हुं. (mai~ hindi me~ likh sakta hu~) = I can write in Hindi.
मैं हिंदी कुछ कुछ बोल सकता हुं. (mai~ hindi kuch kuch bol sakta hu~) = I can speak a very little Hindi.
मैं वह नहीं समझा सकता हुं. (mai~ voh nahi~ samajha sakta hu~) = I cannot explain that.
लडकी अच्छी राटी कर सकती हैं. (ladki acchi roti bana sakti hai~) = The girl can make tasty bread.

(2). Must (to have to)

To express the idea &quot;to have to,&quot; Hindi uses the pattern: &quot;to me ... it is.&quot; Thus &quot;I have to go&quot; in Hindi becomes &quot;to me it is to go&quot;. &quot;To have to&quot; uses the Dative case, which requires the use of special pronouns which I haven't explained to you yet. For know I'll just say that &quot;mai~&quot; becomes &quot;mujhe&quot; (to me) and &quot;tu&quot; becomes&quot;tujhe&quot; (to you), while for the plural we add the particle &quot;ko&quot;. I hope you remember it from the previous lesson. So &quot;ham ko&quot; = &quot;to us&quot;. 

Examples:

मुझे जाना हैं. (mujhe jana hai.) = (to me / to go / is) = I have to go.
तुझे खाना हैं. (tujhe khana hai.) = (to you / to eat / is) = You have to eat.
भरात में हमको हिंदी बोलना हैं. (bharat me~ hamko hindi bolna hai) = (India in / to us / hindi / to speak / is) = In India we have to speak Hindi.

(3). Need (Chahie - चाहीए)

&quot;Chahie&quot; is used in similar manner as &quot;to have to.&quot; Again, we say &quot;to me,&quot; &quot;to you,&quot; &quot;to us,: &quot;to the person,&quot; etc., i.e. the dative case. Instead of placing the conjugated verb &quot;to be&quot; at the end of the sentence place &quot;chahie&quot;:

मुझे जाना चाहीए. (mujhe jana chahie) = I need to go. (Similar to meaning and construction with &quot;mujhe jana hai&quot;...)
मुझे पानी चाहीए. (mujhe pani chahie) = I need water.

(4). Want (chahna = चाहना)

Verb infinitive + CHAHNA / चाहना (chahta/chahte/chahti/chahti~) + To be (hona, conjugeted) = Want to + Verb

मैं जाना चाहता हुं. (mai~ jana chahta hu~) = I want to go.
वह खाना चाहता है. (voh khana chahta hai) = He wants to eat.
हम हिंदी सीखना चाहते हैं. (ham hindi sikhna chahte hai~) = We want to learn Hindi.
मैं चाबल चाहता है. (mai~ chaval chahta hu~) = I want rice.

That'll end this lesson. Enjoy the next lesson, where you'll learn how to count to 20 and learn some wh-questions as well...

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 9: Numbers up to 20. Wh-questions and other question-words.

Here is a table of the numbers up to 20:

|-
|1
|एक

|11
|ग्यारह

|-

|}

Next come the question words:

* क्या (kya) = What?
* कौन (kaun) = Who?
* कहां (kaha~) = Where?
* क्यों (kyo~) = Why?
* कैसा / कैसे / कैसी (kaisa/kaise/kaisi) = How?
* कितना / कितने / कितनी (kitna/kitne/kitni) = How much?, How many?

So, basically, that was the lesson, but I forgot something to tell you about. It's concerning the numbers. The Devanagari script even possess its own letters for writing the numbers, but those are not used much in our time. However I'll give them here too:

* १ = 1
* २ = 2
* ३ = 3
* ४ = 4
* ५ = 5
* ६ = 6
* ७ = 7
* ८ = 8
* ९ = 9
* १० = 10

As you can see they resembles the &quot;&quot;Arabic&quot;&quot; ciphers we use, and it should be so, since actually the Arabic ciphers are INDIAN ciphers. The writing system, on base 10, developed in India, where people used to write numbers with the letters you see above... Later Arabs adopted that system and brought it all over the word, thus it became known as &quot;Arabic numbers&quot;... By the way, written in Devanagari, the year, in which I'm writing these lesson will look as २०१०...

|12:1&amp;nbsp;Then&amp;nbsp;Jesus&amp;nbsp;six&amp;nbsp;days&amp;nbsp;before&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.

|-
|12:2 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*

|12:3 Then took Mary a ''pound'' of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
|pound [12 ounces]&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&amp;iota;&amp;tau;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;nu;&lt;/b&gt; (3046)
|3 Mary then took oil of genuine nard, a pound weight, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair, so that the house was filled with the fragrance.
|&lt;small&gt; Apothecary pound:&lt;br&gt;twelve ounces&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|12:4 Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|12:5 Why was not this ointment ''sold for three hundred pence'', and given to the poor?
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;LATIN&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Image:DENARIIS.jpg|156px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;est&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;trecentis&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;denariis&lt;/small&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the ''bag'', and bare what was put therein.
|Tonguepiece box&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;gamma;&amp;lambda;&amp;omega;&amp;sigma;&amp;sigma;&amp;omicron;&amp;kappa;&amp;omicron;&amp;mu;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/b&gt; (1101)
|6 The reason he said this was not that he cared for the poor, but that he was a thief, and having the money-box, he would take away what was put into it.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying has she kept this.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:8 For the poor always all of you have with you; but me all of you have not always.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
|&amp;nbsp;
|9 Now a great many of the Judeans knew that Jesus was there; and they came not only on His account, but also to see Lazarus whom He had brought back to life.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
|&amp;nbsp;
|10 But the High Priests consulted together to put Lazarus to death also,
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
|&amp;nbsp;
|11 for because of him many were drawn away from the Judean crowd and became &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believers&lt;/font&gt; in Jesus.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:12 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:13 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:14 And Jesus, when he had found ''a young ass'', sat thereon; as it is written,
|A young donkey&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&amp;alpha;&amp;rho;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/b&gt; (3678)
|14 And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon it, just as the Scripture says, 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:15 Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:16 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:18 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive all of you how all of you prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:20 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:21 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:22 Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:23 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of ''wheat'' fall into the ground and die, it abides alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.
|grain [any]&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;sigma;&amp;iota;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;upsilon;&lt;/b&gt; (4621)
|24 In all truthfulness, I tell you that unless a kernel of grain falls to the ground and dies, it remains a single grain; but if it dies, it has greater yield. 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:25 He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
|&amp;nbsp;
|25 Whoever loves their life shall lose it; and whoever hates their life in this world shall keep it to eternal Life. 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.
|&amp;nbsp;
|26 If anyone serves me, then follow me; so where I am, there my servant will be: my Father will honor the person who serves me. 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:28 Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:30 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:33 This he said, signifying what death he should die.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abides for ever: and how says you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&lt;small&gt;GR.&lt;U&gt;Cristos&lt;/U&gt; AR.mәshīha&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|12:35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while all of you have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:36 While all of you have light, believe in the light, that all of you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
|&amp;nbsp;
|36 While you have the light, &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt; in the light, so that you may become Children of Light.&quot; Jesus said this, and departed and hid Himself from them.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:37 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
|&amp;nbsp;
|37 Though He had performed such great miracles in their presence, they did not &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt; in Him&amp;mdash;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:38 That the saying (o. logos) of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
|&amp;nbsp;
|38 That the words of Isaiah the Prophet might be fulfilled, &quot;LORD, WHO HAS &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;BELIEVED&lt;/font&gt; OUR PREACHING? AND THE ARM OF THE LORD&amp;mdash;TO WHOM HAS IT BEEN REVEALED?&quot; (Isa. 53:1).
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:39 Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again,
|&amp;nbsp;
|39 For this reason they were not able to &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt;&amp;mdash;for again Isaiah said,
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:40 He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
|&amp;nbsp;
|40 &quot;HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND MADE THEIR HEART CALLOUS, THAT THEY SHOULD NOT SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND NOT UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR MIND, AND BE TURNED, AND I SHOULD HEAL THEM.&quot; (Isa. 6:9,10).
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:41 These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
|&amp;nbsp;
|42 However, even among the Rulers many &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believed&lt;/font&gt; in Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge Him, for fear they should be removed from the synagogue.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:44 Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|44 But Jesus cried aloud, &quot;Anyone who &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believes&lt;/font&gt; in me, &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believes&lt;/font&gt; not only me, but in HIM who sent me;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:45 And he that sees me sees him that sent me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|45 And he (or she) who sees me, sees HIM that sent me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.
|&amp;nbsp;
|46 I have come as light into the world, in order that no one who &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believes&lt;/font&gt; in me may remain in the darkness.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:47 And if any man hear my words, (o. rhema) and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
|&amp;nbsp;
|47 And if anyone hears my teaching and does not &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt;, I do not judge him (or her); for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:48 He that rejects me, and receives not my words, (o. rhema) has one that judges him: the word (o. logos) that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
|&amp;nbsp;
|48 Whoever disregards me, and does not receive my teaching is not left without a judge: the words I have spoken will judge that person on the last day.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|12:50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

|13:3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:4 He rises from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a ''towel'', and girded himself.

|4 rose from the supper table, threw off His outer garments, and took a towel and tied it around Himself.
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|13:5 After that he pours water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:6 Then comes he to Simon Peter: and Peter says unto him, Lord, do you wash my feet?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:7 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:8 Peter says unto him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:9 Simon Peter says unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:10 Jesus says to him, He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean everything: and all of you are clean, but not all.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, All of you are not all clean.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know all of you what I have done to you?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:13 All of you call me Master and Lord: and all of you say well; for so I am.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; all of you also ought to wash one another's feet.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:15 For I have given you an example, that all of you should do as I have done to you.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:17 If all of you know these things, happy are all of you if all of you do them.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:19 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it has come to pass, all of you may believe that I am he.
|&amp;nbsp;
|19 From now on, I will tell you things before they happen, in order that when they do happen you may &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt; that I am [He].
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, (o. pneuma) and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:23 Now there was ''leaning on Jesus''' bosom ''one'' of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.

|13:24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spoke.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:25 He then lying on Jesus' breast says unto him, Lord, who is it?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a morsel, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the ''morsel'', he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
|mouthful&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;psi;&amp;omega;&amp;mu;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/b&gt; (5596)
|26 &quot;It is the one,&quot; answered Jesus, &quot;to whom I shall give this piece of bread when I have dipped it.&quot; And having dipped the morsel, He gave it to Judas, the son of the Simon Iscariot.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:27 And after the morsel Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That you do, do quickly.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this unto him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:30 He then having received the morsel went immediately out: and it was night.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:31 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall immediately glorify him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:33 ''Little children'', yet a little while I am with you. All of you shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Where I go, all of you cannot come; so now I say to you.
|Little children&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;tau;&amp;epsilon;&amp;kappa;&amp;nu;&amp;iota;&amp;alpha;&lt;/b&gt; (5040)
|33 Little children, I am still with you for the moment. You will seek me, but, as I said to the Judeans, `Where I am going you are not able to come,' so for the present I would say: 
|&lt;small&gt;1 JOH 2:13
|-
|13:34 A new commandment I give unto you, That all of you love one another; as I have loved you, that all of you also love one another.
|&amp;nbsp;
|34 A new commandment I give you, to love one another; that as I have loved you, you should also love one another.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:35 By this shall all men know that all of you are my disciples, if all of you have love (o. agape) one to another.
|&amp;nbsp;
|35 In this all mankind will know that you are my disciples&amp;mdash;if you love one another.&quot; 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:36 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, where go you? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you can not follow me now; but you shall follow me afterwards.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|13:38 Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto you, The cock shall not crow, till you have denied me three times.

Despite the name sad1225, I'm not sad on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas Christmas].  I got this username while I was a student.  Even though it's ugly, it's a pretty unique username so I've kept it around.

==Recipes==
I like cooking so I've been fishing for the best way to add some of my favorite recipes to the web.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several uses for second-order differential equations. In this chapter, I will cover the use of second-order differential equations to describe the motion of a mass at the end of a spring.

The chapter is broken up into three sections:
# [[../Simple Harmonic Motion/]]
# [[../Motion with a Damping Force/]]
# [[../Motion with an Outside Force/]]

== Chapter Notation ==
The formulae in this chapter are written with the following notation in mind. If you've learned a different manner of notation, please take note of the differences. I made every attempt to use a standard set of notation.

==== Important Terms ====
Terms that I feel deserve your undivided attention will appear like '''This'''. You will see this term referred to often in the text that follows, so it's recommended that you fully understand what it means.

==== Derivatives with respect to time ====
If a derivation is taken with respect to time (t), then an equivalent symbol is used and is pronounced ''x double-dot'', ''x triple-dot'', etc.
* Example:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\equiv\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;

== Rendering MATH PNG Images ==
This chapter was written using the built-in TeX markup language present in MediaWiki. It's recommended that you view the chapter with your preferences set to render all Math in PNG. Check your preferences for this setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Simple Harmonic Motion can be used to describe the motion of a mass at the end of a linear spring without a damping force or any other outside forces acting on the mass. It's best thought of as the motion of a vibrating spring.

==Laws of Motion==
There are generally two laws that help describe the motion of a mass at the end of the spring.
#Hooke's Law
#Newton's Second Law

===Hooke’s Law===
To demonstrate Hooke’s Law, we will use a (massless) spring hung from a ceiling. The ceiling is rigid, and offers no effect on the spring’s motion.

If we leave the spring alone, and don’t attach a mass, the spring will remain in an un-stretched state with a total length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. Now, if we attach an arbitrary mass (&lt;math&gt;m_1&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) to the free end of the spring, then the spring will stretch a distance (&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;) from the original length (&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;). So now &lt;math&gt;\mbox{length}_\mbox{total}=s+l&lt;/math&gt;.

Eventually, the mass will come to rest at this new total length at a position known as the '''Equilibrium Position'''. This position is what many of the calculation reference as &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Here is where Hooke's law comes into play. As the spring stretches, when the mass is attached, a force is exerted on the mass in the direction of the original un-stretched position. This force is expressed using the equation: &lt;math&gt;\vec F=\vec ks&lt;/math&gt;. Where &lt;math&gt;\vec F&lt;/math&gt; is the force exerted on the mass by the spring, &lt;math&gt;\vec k&lt;/math&gt; is the spring's '''Constant of Proportionality''', often called the '''spring constant''', and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the distance the spring stretched from its un-stretched position.

Suppose that any movement by the mass in a downward direction is considered positive and upward is negative. If you take the weight (&lt;math&gt;\vec W&lt;/math&gt;) of the mass, it will be equal to the force exerted by the spring when &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, or the equilibrium position. Due to this, we now know that &lt;math&gt;\vec W=\vec F&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\vec W=m\vec g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec F=\vec ks&lt;/math&gt;, by substitution, we get &lt;math&gt;m\vec g=\vec ks&lt;/math&gt;. If you set these equal to zero, you'll get &lt;math&gt;m\vec g-\vec ks=0&lt;/math&gt;.

''Why is &lt;math&gt;\vec ks&lt;/math&gt; negative?'' This is because no matter what the mass does, the spring-with-gravity combination will always exert a force opposite to its motion. For example, as the mass travels downward beyond the equilibrium point, the spring will pull it back '''''upwards''''' in an attempt to regain equilibrium. When the mass gets above the equilibrium point, the spring contribution is less and the net acceleration is then '''''downward''''' toward regaining equilibrium. It behaves the same as if in an idealized example imagined all far removed from any local gravity effect, and that the spring is alternately stretched and compressed about a completely unstressed state. Some examples invent a horizontal version with the mass sliding over a frictionless surface, the better to then introduce a friction component.

====Examples====
=====Example 1=====
A mass of &lt;math&gt;1/4\mbox{ slug}&lt;/math&gt; is attached to a spring and stretches it &lt;math&gt;6\mbox{ inches}&lt;/math&gt;. Calculate the spring's constant of proportionality.

'''Solution'''&lt;br&gt;
Using the combined equation &lt;math&gt;mg-ks=0&lt;/math&gt;, we know &lt;math&gt;m=1/4\mbox{ slug}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=6\mbox{ inches}=1/2\mbox{ ft}&lt;/math&gt;

(we omit the vector since we're only looking for a magnitude)

By definition, we know &lt;math&gt;g=32 ft/s^2&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging everything in, we get &lt;math&gt;(1/4 slug)(32 ft/s^2)-k(1/2 ft)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, we find&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;8\mbox{ lb}=k(1/2\mbox{ ft})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;16\mbox{ lb}/\mbox{ft}=k&lt;/math&gt;
=====Example 2=====
An object of unknown mass stretches a spring 10 cm from the ceiling. The spring's orignal length was 7 cm. Calculate the weight of the object if the spring constant is 5 N/m.

'''Solution'''&lt;br&gt;
First, we need the distance the spring is stretched after the mass is attached. This can be found using &lt;math&gt;\mbox{length}_\mbox{total}=s+l&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mbox{length}_\mbox{total}=10\mbox{ cm}=.1\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l=7\mbox{ cm}=.07\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;. Plugging everything in and solving for &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; we find &lt;math&gt;s=.03\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;.

By definition we know &lt;math&gt;W=mg&lt;/math&gt;. With that, and &lt;math&gt;mg-ks=0&lt;/math&gt;, we plug everything in and solve for &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;W-(5\mbox{ N}/\mbox{m})(.03\mbox{ m})=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;W=.15\mbox{ N}=150\mbox{ g}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Newton’s Second Law of Motion===
Now, imagine that we have another mass hanging from a spring, which is attached to the ceiling. This mass is then pulled down a distance &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, below the equilibrium point, and released. By Hooke's Law, the spring will be pulled back up, and after reaching it's highest point, start to travel back down.

If the mass continues this motion, without any outside influence, it's known as '''Free Motion'''. During this motion, there is acceleration acting on the mass to keep it in motion. This acceleration can be readily found in Newton's Second Law of Motion using &lt;math&gt;\vec F=m\vec a&lt;/math&gt;. Where &lt;math&gt;\vec F&lt;/math&gt; is the force of the spring acting on the mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec a&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of that mass due to the force acting on it.

From Calculus, we know that &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a=\ddot x&lt;/math&gt;. If we substitute this into our equation from the section on Hooke's Law, we find &lt;math&gt;m\ddot x-k(s+x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. However, since this motion is always in the direction of the spring's force, our equation becomes &lt;math&gt;m\ddot x+k(s+x)=mg&lt;/math&gt;. Expanding this, and solving for &lt;math&gt;m\ddot x&lt;/math&gt; we get &lt;math&gt;m\ddot x=-k(s+x)+mg=-ks-kx+mg&lt;/math&gt;. Knowing that &lt;math&gt;mg-ks=0&lt;/math&gt;, we can simplify our equation to end with &lt;math&gt;m\ddot x=-kx&lt;/math&gt;.

==The Differential Equation of Free Motion==
Finally, if we set the equation above equal to zero, we end up with the following:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;m\ddot x+kx=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Since our leading coeffiecient should be equal to 1, we divide by the mass to get:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ddot x+\frac{k}{m}x=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
If we set &lt;math&gt;\omega^2=\frac{k}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, we'll have our final form of this equation:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ddot x+\omega^2x=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The above equation is known to describe '''Simple Harmonic Motion''' or Free Motion.

===Initial Conditions===
With the free motion equation, there are generally two bits of information one must have to appropriately describe the mass's motion.
#The starting position of the mass. &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;
#The starting direction and magnitude of motion. &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;
Generally, one isn't present without the other. For simplicity, we will consider all displacement below the equilibrium point as &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and above as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

For upward motion &lt;math&gt;v&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and for downward motion &lt;math&gt;v&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Solution===
Multiplying this equation by &lt;math&gt;\dot x&lt;/math&gt; gives:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;m\ddot x \dot x+k x \dot x=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The first and the second addends are exact derivatives, so this equation may be integrated to obtain the following relation:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;m\frac{{\dot x}^2}{2}+k\frac{x^2}{2}=E&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The first addend of this relation is known as the kinetic energy of the mass and the second — as the potential energy of the spring. The above integral represents the energy conservation law. This is also a first order separable differential equation. It may be rewritten as
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{\sqrt{\frac{2 E}{m}-\frac{k}{m}x^2}}=\pm dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The integration of this relation gives
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\arccos x\sqrt{\frac{k}{2E}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t + \varphi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Or, finally rearranging the result, substituting &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{k/m}&lt;/math&gt;, and solving for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{\frac{2E}{k}}\cos (\omega t + \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

|15:7 If all of you abide in me, and my words (o. rhema) abide in you, all of you shall ask what all of you will, and it shall be done unto you.

|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:8 Herein is my Father glorified, that all of you bear much fruit; so shall all of you be my disciples.

|15:9 As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you: continue all of you in my love. (o. agape)

|-
|15:10 If all of you keep my commandments, all of you shall abide in my love; (o. agape) even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. (o. agape)
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.

|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:12 This is my commandment, That all of you love one another, as I have loved you.
|&amp;nbsp;

|-
|15:13 Greater love (o. agape) has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:14 All of you are my friends, if all of you do whatsoever I command you.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:16 All of you have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that all of you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever all of you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;

|-
|15:17 These things I command you, that all of you love one another.

|-
|15:18 If the world hate you, all of you know that it hated me before it hated you.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:19 If all of you were of the world, the world would love his own: but because all of you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:20 Remember the word (o. logos) that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, (o. logos) they will keep your[s] also.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:21 But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|21 But all this will happen as you represent&amp;nbsp;my&amp;nbsp;name&amp;nbsp;[read:&amp;nbsp;Jesus], because the world does not know the ONE who sent me.

|-
|15:22 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:23 He that hates me hates my Father also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:24 If I had not done among them the works which no other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:25 But this comes to pass, that the word (o. logos) might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|15:26 But when ''the Comforter has come'', whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit (o. pneuma) of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:

|-
|15:27 And all of you also shall ''bear witness'', because all of you have been with me from the beginning.

|16:4 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, all of you may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.

|16:7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.

|16:23 And in that day all of you shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever all of you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.

|16:27 For the Father himself loves you, because all of you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.

|-
|16:28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.

|-
|16:30 Now are we sure that you know all things, and need not that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you came forth from God.

|30 Now we know that you have all knowledge, and do not need to be questioned. In this we &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt; that you came from God.&quot;

|16:31 Jesus answered them, Do all of you now believe?
|&amp;nbsp;
|31 &quot;Now you &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt;?&quot; replied Jesus.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|16:32 Behold, the hour comes, yea, is now come, that all of you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

|16:33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me all of you might have peace. In the world all of you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I ''have overcome'' the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Michael J. Trout. I'm an author, poet, playwright, thinker, living in FUKUi, Japan (I love the name). I have lived all over the world from Bethesda-MD, Palma De Majorca-Spain, West Yorkshire and the Midlands-England, Homosassa FL, Tallahassee FL, Tuscaloosa AL, Montgomery AL, Gaithersburg MD, Arlington MA, Boston MA, Manhattan NY and finally Japan. My focus is the exploration of human truth and I am curious what will happen to humanity in my life-time.  Predominately, I muse whether we will foolishly send humanity into a out of control tail spin by our denial of our crude oil addiction, our catastophic impact on global ecology, and the mounting pressures associated with globalization especially as it relates to the awaking of Super-mega-galactic-econo-CHINA monster!  It’s going to be very interesting to observe the game unfold, so I picked a great seat to watch it -- Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A mole is a conversion factor to convert from amu (atomic mass units) to grams and back. Specifically, a mole is 6.02214 x &lt;math&gt;10^{23}&lt;/math&gt; particles. So, to find the mass of one mole of carbon(12.01 amu) we would use the following equation:
&lt;math&gt;
amu = (grams)(6.02 * 10^{23})
&lt;/math&gt;

This number is known as Avogadro's number.


== Why moles? ==

Because atoms and molecules are so small, the molar concept provides us with a way to deal with substances in the laboratory; to measure their properties and observe changes in their characteristics.  

For example, a molecule of water is infintesimally small and weighs 18 amu.  It consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. However, Avogadro's number of water molecules weighs 18 grams, and has a volume of 18 milliliters. It contains two moles of hydrogen atoms and one mole of oxygen atoms. The molar weight of an element or molecule is also known as the ''gram formula weight'', or simply the atomic weight expressed in grams.  Just remember that Avogadro's number is just that -- a number; one can have a mole of anything.  A mole of oranges is &lt;math&gt;6.02 * 10^{23}&lt;/math&gt;oranges. (Although this quantity of oranges would surely be larger than our entire planet!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">May I request that some fact-checking be done here?  The 42 mph

every action is based on current SOC and driver demand.  For more

Removed &quot;because diesels don't have throttles&quot;, because diesels do have throttles.
Original author is confusing fuel injection with carburation possibly.


Diesel engines do '''not''' have throttles...

&quot;Approaching Home&quot; -- Not sure about the wisdom of the advice offered.  The NiMH cells will deteriorate faster if at low charge during storage.

===========================
Good advice when approaching a red light and you expect to have a long wait.  But what if you stop and only then realise it will be a long wait?   Easy - just turn the temperature control to cold (and the aircon off of course).  Otherwise the NHW-11 will run its ICE to keep the occupants warm.  

Another way to encourage ICE shutdown when stopped is a quick flick into reverse (without moving). 
These tips are from personal experience as I have one. [[User:Shannock9|Shannock9]] ([[User talk:Shannock9|talk]]) 00:49, 2 December 2009 (UTC)</text>

|18:1&amp;nbsp;When&amp;nbsp;Jesus&amp;nbsp;had&amp;nbsp;spoken&amp;nbsp;these&amp;nbsp; words, he went forth with his disciples over the ''brook'' Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.

|1 After offering this prayer Jesus went out with His disciples to a place on the other side of the Ravine of the Cedars, where there was a garden which He entered with His disciples.

|18:2 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus frequently resorted thither with his disciples.

|&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:3 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek all of you?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|18:5 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus says unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:6 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:7 Then asked he them again, Whom seek all of you? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:8 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore all of you seek me, let these go their way:
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:9 That the saying (o. logos) might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Of them which you gave me have I lost none.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:10 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and stroke the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The ''servant'''s name was ''Malchus''.
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;LATINIZED(-us) GREEK(-ous)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:MALCHUS.jpg|120px]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;servo&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Malchus&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:11 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up your sword into the ''sheath'': the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?
|sheath&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;theta;&amp;eta;&amp;kappa;&amp;eta;&amp;nu;&lt;/b&gt; (2336)
|11 Jesus said to Peter, &quot;Put your sword back to your side. Shall I refuse to drink the cup which the Father has given me to drink?&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:12 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
|&amp;nbsp;
|12 So the cohort and their commander with the Judean authorities arrested Jesus and bound Him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:13 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:14 Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
|&amp;nbsp;
|14 (This was Caiaphas who had given his countrymen the advice, &quot;It is to your interest that one man should die for the people.&quot;) 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:16 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spoke unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:17 Then says the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Are not you also one of this man's disciples? He says, I am not.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:18 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:19 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:20 Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
|&amp;nbsp;
|20 Jesus replied, &quot;I have spoken openly to the world. I have taught in the synagogue or in the Temple where the Judeans come together, and I have said nothing in secret. 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:21 Why ask you me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:22 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answer you the high priest so?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:23 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smite you me?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:24 Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:26 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did not I see you in the garden with him?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:27 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:28 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:29 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What ''accusation'' bring all of you against this man?
|formal charge&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;kappa;&amp;alpha;&amp;tau;&amp;eta;&amp;gamma;&amp;omicron;&amp;rho;&amp;iota;&amp;alpha;&amp;nu;&lt;/b&gt; (2724)
|29 Accordingly, Pilatus went out to them and inquired, &quot;What charge do you bring against this man?&quot; 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:30 They answered and said unto him, If he were not a villain, we would not have delivered him up unto you.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:31 Then said Pilate unto them, Take all of you him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
|&amp;nbsp;
|31 &quot;You take him,&quot; said Pilatus, &quot;and judge him by your Law.&quot; The Judean leaders replied, &quot;We have no power to put any man to death.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:32 That the saying (o. logos) of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:33 Then ''Pilate'' entered ''into the judgment hall'' again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Are you the King of the Jews?
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;LATIN &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(2nd hand, Codex D)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Image:PILATUS.jpg|156px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;[in]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;praetorium&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Pilatus&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;
|33 Entering the Praetorium again, Pilatus called Jesus and asked Him, &quot;Are you the King of these Judeans?&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:34 Jesus answered him, Says you this thing of yourself, or did others tell it you of me?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you unto me: what have you done?
|&amp;nbsp;
|35 &quot;Am I Judean?&quot; exclaimed Pilatus; &quot;Your own Nation and the High Priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?&quot; 
|&lt;small&gt; Nation: Judea&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|18:36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from behind.
|&amp;nbsp;
|36 &quot;My Kingdom,&quot; replied Jesus, &quot;is not of this world. If my Kingdom did belong to this world, my followers would have fought to keep me from being delivered up to the Judeans. But, in fact, my Kingdom is not from here.&quot; 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You says that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:38 Pilate says unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and says unto them, I find in him no fault at all.
|&amp;nbsp;
|38 &quot;What is truth?&quot; said Pilatus. And having said this, he went out again to the Judean leaders and told them, &quot;I find no crime in him. 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:39 But all of you have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will all of you therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
|&amp;nbsp;
|39 But you have a custom that I must release one prisoner to you at the Passover. So shall I release to you this King of Judea?&quot; 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|18:40 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&lt;small&gt;AR.&lt;U&gt;BAR-abbas&lt;/U&gt;:&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;son of father&lt;/small&gt;

|&amp;nbsp;
|1&amp;nbsp;Then&amp;nbsp;Pilatus&amp;nbsp;took&amp;nbsp;Jesus&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;had&amp;nbsp;Him flogged.

|19:2 And the soldiers intertwined a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,

|19:3 And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they stroke him with their hands.
|&amp;nbsp;
|3 Then they approached Him, saying in a mocking voice, &quot;Hail, King of Judea!&quot; And they slapped His face. 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:4 Pilate therefore went forth again, and says unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that all of you may know that I find no fault in him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|4 Once more Pilatus came out and said to the Judeans, &quot;See, I am bringing him out to you to let you understand that I find no crime in him.&quot; 
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|19:5 Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate ''says unto them, Behold the man!''
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;LATIN&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[File:ECCEHOMO2.jpg|152px]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;et&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;dicit&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;eis&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ecce&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;homo&lt;/small&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:6 When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate says unto them, Take all of you him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
|&amp;nbsp;
|7 The Judean leaders replied, &quot;We have a Law, and in accordance with that Law he ought to die, for having claimed to be the Son of God.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:8 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, (o. logos) he was the more afraid;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:9 And went again into the judgment hall, and says unto Jesus, Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:10 Then says Pilate unto him, Speak you not unto me? know you not that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you?
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:11 Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me unto you has the greater sin.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:12 And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you ''are not Caesar's friend'': whosoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;LATIN&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[File:CAESAR.jpg|160px]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;non&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;es&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;amicus&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Caesaris&lt;/small&gt;
|12 After this, Pilatus wanted to release Him. But the Judeans kept shouting, &quot;If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Every one who sets himself up as king speaks against Caesar.&quot; 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:13 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, (o. logos) he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&lt;small&gt;AR.&lt;U&gt;Gabbatha&lt;/U&gt;: elevated place&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|19:14 And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he says unto the Jews, Behold your King!
|&amp;nbsp;
|14 It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about mid-day. Then he said to the Judeans, &quot;There is your King!&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:15 But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate says unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:16 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:17 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called ''the place of a skull'', which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;LATIN&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[File:CALVARIE.jpg|142px]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;calvarie&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;locum&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&lt;small&gt;AR.&lt;U&gt;Golgotha&lt;/U&gt;: the skull&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|19:18 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:19 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
|&amp;nbsp;
|19 And Pilatus wrote a notice and had it fastened to the cross. It read thus: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF JUDEA. 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:20 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.
|&amp;nbsp;
|20 Many Judeans near the city at the site of the crucifixion read this notice, being written in three languages&amp;mdash;Aramaic, Latin, and Greek. 
|&lt;small&gt;AR.&lt;U&gt;Aramaic&lt;/U&gt; and Gr, and LAT. (''N.I.V.'')&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|19:21 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
|&amp;nbsp;
|21 The High Priests of Judea disagreeded with Pilatus. &quot;You should not write `The King of Judea,' “ they said, &quot;but that he claimed to be King of Judea.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:22 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was ''without seam'', woven from the top throughout.
|unsewed together&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;alpha;&amp;rho;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;phi;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;&lt;/b&gt; (729)
|23 So the soldiers, as soon as they had crucified Jesus, took His garments, including His robe, and divided them into four parts--one part for each soldier. The robe was seamless, woven from top to bottom. 
|&lt;small&gt;Herod Antipas provided gorgeous robe.&lt;br&gt;LU. 23:11&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|19:24 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:25 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he says unto his mother, Woman, behold your son!
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:27 Then says he to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:28 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:29 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the spirit. (o. pneuma)
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was a high day,) besought Pilate that their ''legs'' might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
|legs&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;sigma;&amp;kappa;&amp;epsilon;&amp;lambda;&amp;eta;&lt;/b&gt; (4628)
|31 Meanwhile the Judeans, because it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, and in order that the bodies might not remain on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that was a high Sabbath), requested Pilatus to have their legs broken, and the dying men taken away. 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:34 But one of the soldiers with a spear ''pierced'' his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
|pierced&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;epsilon;&amp;nu;&amp;upsilon;&amp;xi;&amp;epsilon;&amp;nu;&lt;/b&gt; (3572)
|34 One of the soldiers, however, pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:35 And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knows that he says true, that all of you might believe.
|&amp;nbsp;
|35 This is the testimony of an eye-witness, and it is true. He knows that he is telling the truth&amp;mdash;in order that you may also &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt;. 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:37 And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:38 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
|&amp;nbsp;
|38 After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, although a secret disciple for fear of the other Judean leaders, asked permission to take the body of Jesus; and Pilatus consented. So he came to remove the body. 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:39 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a ''mixture of myrrh and aloes'', about an hundred pound weight.
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;LATIN&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[File:MIXTURA.jpg|160px]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;mixturam&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;murrae&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;et&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;aloes&lt;/small&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:40 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
|&amp;nbsp;
|40 Taking the body down, they wrapped it in linen cloths along with the spices, in accordance with the Judean mode of burial preparation.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb, wherein was never man yet laid.
|&amp;nbsp;
|41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre that had never been used.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|19:42 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the tomb was nigh at hand.
|&amp;nbsp;
|42 And being the Judean preparation day for the Sabbath, they laid the body of Jesus in the sepulchre because it was nearby.

=Basic Cells Unit Study=


----
{{Info|All text below is cut &amp; pasted from my original files. References to materials outside of Wiki* will be removed as I work.}}

Introduction:

For this unit we will be using the Usborne Internet-Linked Science Encyclopedia (please check your library before buying) as our initial reference material. I will also be including links to Wikipedia entries for both the English and Simple English (easier reading level) versions when available. The Wikipedia entries can be used as an alternative main source for this unit. The basic structure of this unit is to first do some background research, followed by the activities that will be used to create the unit folder, and finally some laboratory activities which will be recorded and added to the unit folder. The general level for this unit is based on  a year 5 (Logic Stage) science program following a classical trivium similar to many popular commercial homeschool curriculum. One big difference in our studies (other than we are Open Source and Creative Commons Licensed, i.e. Free) , is that our units embrace technology. To really take advantage of what this unit can offer a good Internet connection is a must. At the present some of the critical information, diagrams, and downloads needed to complete this unit will be in the form of links to those tools on other sites. While most of those sites will have some sort of commercial aspect, all of the resources needed to complete this unit will be part of their no-cost offerings. I hope as time goes on to be able replace those links with resources developed specifically for distribution with this unit. That is part of where the Open Source aspect enters into the big picture. If you, a user, wish to contribute to a unit by creating one of those resources (or even writing your own unit following our format) feel free to do so. You may redistribute it yourself (following the Creative Commons licensing terms) or submit to me for inclusion in the main distribution of this unit (upon approval).

Introduction to Cellular Biology

	Cells are the basic building blocks of life. They are like organic Legos. Each one has a similar basic structure, but the subtle differences (color, number of connectors) make each Lego perform a little differently. Sometimes, even a single block can be enough to form the entire structure. The same is true with cells. There are unicellular organisms and multicellular organisms, simple cells, and complex cells, but the basics of a cell are always there. 

	The study of cells is called cellular biology, or cytology. A scientist who specializes in cellular biology is called a cytologist. This study includes their physical properties such as their structure and the organelles they contain, their environment and interactions, their life cycle, division and function and eventual death. Knowing the composition of cells and how cells work is important to all of the biological sciences.

#organic
#unicellular
#multicellular
#organelle
#organism

Cell History

	Cells were discovered by Robert Hooke. He used a microscope to look at organisms in 1665. He named cells after the Latin word cella which means a room. He did this because he thought cells looked like small rooms.
Three German biologists - Schleiden, Schwann and Virchov - figured out three rules about all cells:
1.all living things are made of cells 
2.the cell is the basic unit of structure and function in all organisms. 
3.every cell comes from another cell that lived before it. 





Activity 2: Cell Rules &amp; History

	Make a Three Pocket Book (Big Book of Science p.20). Make three cards, one for each pocket. On each card write on of the rules above. At the top of the inside write “3 Rules About Cells”. On the bottom flaps, first write “Figured out by German Biologists” near the top edge, below that write the name of one of the biologists on each pocket. On the left outer flap write “Robert Hooke.” On the right outer flap write “discovered cells by using a microscope in 1665.” This should be very neat. Think of it like an art project and make it as decorated (within the theme) as you like. The center-back  outer flap will be glued into the final unit study folder, so do not decorate that part.


Basic Cell Structure

	In biology, the cell is the basic structure of organisms. All cells only come from other cells.
The outside of the cell is a cell membrane. Inside some cells, some parts of the cell stay separate from other parts by membranes. These separate parts are called organelles (like small organs.) They have different functions in the cell (do different work.) Some of these are ribosomes, nucleus (where DNA is), and mitochondria.
Kinds of cells

	There are two basic kinds of cells: prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. 

	Prokaryotes are simple cells. Bacteria are types of prokaryotes. They are very simple cells that do not have a nucleus or any other membrane-bound cells found in more complex cells. In order to function, prokaryotic cells must still have certain features.
A nucleoid region containing the DNA. This region is not contained in a membrane, and, therefore is not a nucleus.
Ribosomes to translate the DNA code into the proteins needed.
An outer membrane to hold everything together
Some prokaryotes also have cell walls, or flagella (to help them move around)

	Eukaryotes are less simple cells. All eukaryotic cells have a nucleus, and may have membrane bound organelles. Most multicellular organisms are made up of eukaryotic cells, although there are  unicellular (single-celled) eukaryotes. Plant and animal cells are eukaryote.
 




Prokaryotic Organisms

All prokaryotic organisms are unicellular.

Most prokaryotic organisms are bacteria. All bacteria (or &quot;one bacterium&quot;) are very small organisms (living things). They are so tiny they can only be seen with a microscope. Bacteria are formed with very few cells. Many of them have only one cell. This kind of organism is called a unicellular organism. Bacteria are among the oldest living organisms on Earth.
There are more bacteria than any other living organism on the planet. Most bacteria live in the ground or in water, and many live inside of other living organisms. Some bacteria can cause diseases in other organisms, but others are good.
A bacterium reproduces (creates more bacteria) by dividing itself into two new &quot;child&quot; bacteria. 

			Bacteria under the microscope


Kinds of eukaryotic organisms

There are two kinds of eukaryotic organisms: multicellular and unicellular.

Unicellular

A paramecium
Unicellular organisms are made of one cell. Examples of unicellular organisms are:
Amoeba 
Paramecium 
Unicellular organisms live without other cells to help them. So the cell does all things that it needs to live. Each cell:
eats 
moves 
respires (uses oxygen to make sugar into energy) 
gets rid of waste 
reproduce (make more of itself) 
senses its environment 


Multicellular

	Multicellular organisms are made from many cells. This can be a small number of cells, or millions of cells. All plants and animals are multicellular organisms. The cells of a multicellular organism are not all the same. They have different shapes and sizes, and do different work in the organism. The cells are specialized. This means they do only some kinds of work. By themselves, they cannot do everything that the organism needs to live. They need other cells to do other work. They live together, but cannot live alone.


Epithelial Cells

Activity 3: Compare and Contrast Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells

	Create a three-tab Venn diagram book (Big Book of Science p.17). On the flaps make a Venn diagram comparing and contrasting the two types of cells. Inside, under the appropriate flap, list some types of organisms that have that kind of cell. On the outside sections (will be cover flaps when closed) that corresponds to each cell, draw a colorful diagram of that type of cell.


Plant Cells

Plant cells are quite different from the cells of the other eukaryotic organisms. Their distinctive features are:
A large central vacuole (space enclosed by a membrane), which is filled with fluid and helps the cell keep its shape. 
A cell wall made up mostly of cellulose . The cell wall is thick and rigid, supporting the cell. The cell walls of multiple cells bond together to form the structure of the plant.

Chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll, the pigment that gives plants their green color and allows them to perform photosynthesis. 

Plants lack centrioles that are present in animal cells. 
Like other eukaryotic cells, plant cells typically also have a nucleus, containing most of the cell's DNA, and mitochondria, the 'power plants' of the cell.


Animal Cells

	An animal cell is a form of eukaryotic cell. Many tissues in animals are eukaryotic. The animal cell is different  from other eukaryotes, most notably plant cells, as they lack cell walls and chloroplasts, and they have smaller vacuoles. Due to the lack of a rigid cell wall, animal cells appear to be circular (though are often deformed by surrounding cells) under microscopes - in three dimensions the cells are normally spherical.

It would be extremely useful if this page listed at least one chinese word for each initial described here along with a recording of a native speaker speaking it. While it is nice to have a description of the sounds, nothing can replace actually hearing it. --[[User:128.179.67.72|128.179.67.72]] 07:29, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
:I'm trying to recruit a native speaker to provide these samples. But for now, if you go to [[Chinese/Lesson 1|Lesson 1]] there are recordings of the new vocabulary words, so you should be able to start off pretty well even without looking through the pronunciation section.

:&amp;mdash; [[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 13:49, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

If you need to find samples, go to the wikipedia page on the IPA representation of the sound and there will be a proper sound sample which you will be able to upload here. [[User:Jocke pirat|Jocke pirat]] ([[User talk:Jocke pirat|talk]]) 17:14, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

I added some sound files, but I don't think any are available for the aspirated sounds. Also, I didn't bother to put in sound files for phonemes which are the same as the English equivalent.

== clear of the tongue tip ==

&quot;clear of the tongue tip&quot; is a little vague to me, what specifically is meant by the tongue tip and how do i clear it?
&lt;br/&gt;[[User:YukataNinja|YukataNinja]] 16:31, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

Yeah. The phrase &quot;slowly pass it backwards along the tongue until it is entirely clear of the tongue tip&quot; was used, with slight modifications, to describe j, q and x. But it's not clear what it means. [[User:TrueDat|TrueDat]] ([[User talk:TrueDat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TrueDat|contribs]]) 05:06, 4 March 2011 (UTC)

== Alternate &quot;c&quot; pronunciation? ==

There's a site with a handy pronunciation table, apparently of all the standard Mandarin syllables [http://www.hello-han.com/ch-education/yinjieku/femail/hanziyinjieku-en.php] ... but all the syllables beginning &quot;c&quot; are pronounced (to my untrained ear) just like those beginning &quot;k&quot;, but with longer vowel sounds afterward.  Can someone explain? [[Special:Contributions/70.15.114.2|70.15.114.2]] ([[User talk:70.15.114.2|talk]]) 05:44, 1 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

This vegetable soup is a must-have item on the menu of every West Java (Sundanese) restaurant in Indonesia. This soup has some kind of appetizing effect because of the use of tamarind or (dried) sour starfuit as one of the ingredients. Sayur asem is a compliment to main dish such as ayam [[Cookbook:Fried Chicken of Indonesia (Ayam Goreng Kuning)|Ayam Goreng Kuning]], [[Cookbook:Pepes_Ikan|Pepes Ikan]] or fried salty fish.

==Ingredients==
* Vegetable for the soup 
** 100 g [[Cookbook:Yardlong bean|yardlong bean]]
** 1 [[Cookbook:Chayote|chayote]]
** 50 gr [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]]
** 100 g [[Cookbook:Jackfruit|young jackfuit]]
** 50 gr Gnetum gnemon leaves and fruits (Belinjau)
** 50 gr raw peanuts
** 105 g [[Cookbook:Galangal|galangal]] 
** 2 salam leaves
** 20 g [[Cookbook:Tamarind| fresh tamarind]] or Asam Jawa tamarind paste, or 
** 5 (dried) Belimbing sayur

*Spice paste, using food processor grind the following ingredients:
** 1 [[Cookbook:Chili_Pepper|fresh red chili pepper]] 
** 2 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
** 2 g [[Cookbook:Terasi|terasi]]
** 1/2 tbl. salt

==Procedure==
#Clean the vegetables, cut into bite size
#Boil 1.2 liter of water in a pot
#Put the spice paste and the ingredients, with vegetables needs longer cooking time first (corn, peanuts, young jackfruit, etc.)
#Add salt and sugar to taste

      <comment>/* Starting the Parser */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is used in mainstream development. It might have started off as an attempt at a web standard, but is now used even in more traditional applications as a document standard. For example, the Open Document Format employed by Sun in their StarOffice and OpenOffice suites is based on XML.

Because of its wide-spread use in the IT industry, it is fitting that we as PHP developers know how to make use of XML files in our PHP applications.

== XML Structure ==

Since XML documents are extensible, there are no limits to the tags that you can create to define data with. Here is an example of a simple XML document :

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;document&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Isn't this simple!&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;XML is as simple as pie. :-)&lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/document&gt;

The reason that it looks so simple, is because it is so simple! Just as in HTML, elements are enclosed by angled brackets : &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;, where the start element differs from the end element by the exclusion of a forward slash : &quot;/&quot;.

== Creating an XML Parser in PHP ==

=== Defining the XML Parser ===

In PHP, you define an XML Parser by using the xml_parser_create() function as shown below.

 &lt;?
 $parser = xml_parser_create(ENCODING);
 ?&gt;

You can think of the $parser variable in terms of a parsing engine for the XML document. Note that the ENCODING can be either :

1. ISO-8859-1 (default)

2. US-ASCII

3. UTF-8

=== Defining the Element Handlers ===

Element handlers are defined by means of the xml_set_element_handler() function as follows :

 &lt;?
 xml_set_element_handler(XML_PARSER, START_FUNCTION, END_FUNCTION);
 ?&gt;

The three arguments accepted by the xml_set_element_handler() function are :

1. XML_PARSER - The variable that you created when you called the xml_parser_create() function.

2. START_FUNCTION - The name of the function to call when the parser encounters a start element.

3. END_FUNCTION - The name of the function to call when the parser encounters an end element.

e.g. :

 &lt;?
 $parser = xml_parser_create();
 xml_set_element_handler($parser, &quot;startElement&quot;, &quot;endElement&quot;);
 ?&gt;


=== Defining Character Handlers ===

Character handlers are created by means of the set_character_handler() function as follows :

 &lt;?
 xml_set_character_handler(XML_PARSER, CHARACTER_FUNCTION);
 ?&gt;

The two arguments accepted by the set_character_handler() function are :

1. XML_PARSER - The variable that you created when you called the xml_parser_create() function.

2. CHARACTER_FUNCTION - The name of the function to call when the parser encounters character data.

=== Starting the Parser ===

To finally start the parser, we call the xml_parse() function as follows :
 &lt;?
 xml_parse(XML_PARSER, XML);
 ?&gt;

The two arguments accepted by the xml_parse() function are :

1. The variable that you created when you called the xml_parser_create() function.

2. The XML that is to be parsed.

e.g. : 

 &lt;?
 $f = fopen (&quot;simple.xml&quot;, 'r');
 $data = fread($f, filesize(&quot;simple.xml&quot;));
 xml_parse($parser, $data);
 ?&gt;

=== Cleaning Up ===

After parsing an XML document, it is considered good practice to free up the memory that is holding the parser. This is done by calling the xml_parser_free() function as follows :

 &lt;?
 xml_parser_free(XML_PARSER);
 ?&gt;

=== Example ===
 
 &lt;?
 # --- Element Functions ---
 
 function startElement($parser, $name, $attributes){
    # ... some code
 }
 
 function endElement ($parser, $name){
    # ... some code
 }
 
 function characterData ($parser, $data){
    # ... some code
 }
 
 function load_data($file){
    $f = fopen ($file, 'r');
    $data = fread($f, filesize($file));
    return $data;
 } 
 
 # --- Main Program Body ---
 $file = &quot;simple.xml&quot;;
 $parser = xml_parser_create();
 xml_set_element_handler($parser, &quot;startElement&quot;, &quot;endElement&quot;);
 xml_set_character_data_handler($parser, &quot;characterData&quot;);
 xml_parse ($parser, load_data($file));
 xml_parser_free($parser);
 ?&gt;

== Parsing XML Documents ==

We have seen the steps needed to successfully parse a XML document with PHP. Lets take a moment to reflect on how these steps are interconnected.

When a XML parser is initialized, php will go through the XML file. When a starting tag is found, a predefined function created by you, the programmer, is called. The same thing happens when php encounters the text between tags, and the end tags.

Here is a complete example of parsing XML documents. This example is a RSS reader which can be used to display News Articles from any RSS feed which conforms to RSS 1.0 standards.

=== Example ===
 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;title&gt; Google Articles &lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &amp;lt;h2&gt;Google Articles&amp;lt;/h2&gt;
 &amp;lt;dl&gt;
 &lt;?php 
 
 $insideitem = false;
 $tag = &quot;&quot;;
 $title = &quot;&quot;;
 $description = &quot;&quot;;
 $link = &quot;&quot;;
 
 function startElement($parser, $name, $attrs) {
         global $insideitem, $tag, $title, $description, $link; 
         if ($insideitem) {
                 $tag = $name;
         }
         elseif ($name == &quot;ITEM&quot;) {
                 $insideitem = true;
         }
 }
 
 function endElement($parser, $name) {
         global $insideitem, $tag, $title, $description, $link;
         if ($name == &quot;ITEM&quot;) {
                 printf(&quot;&amp;lt;dt&gt;&amp;lt;b&gt;&lt;a href='%s'&gt;%s&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;/dt&gt;&quot;,
                 trim($link),trim($title));
                 printf(&quot;&amp;lt;dd&gt;%s&amp;lt;/dd&gt;&quot;, trim($description));
                 $title = &quot;&quot;;
                 $description = &quot;&quot;;
                 $link = &quot;&quot;;
                 $insideitem = false;
         }
 }
 
 function characterData($parser, $data) {
        global $insideitem, $tag, $title, $description, $link;
         if ($insideitem) {
                 switch ($tag) {
                         case &quot;TITLE&quot;:
                                 $title .= $data;
                                 break;
                         case &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;:
                                 $description .= $data;
                                 break;
                         case &quot;LINK&quot;:
                                 $link .= $data;
                                 break;
                 }
         }
 }
 
 $xml_parser = xml_parser_create();
 xml_set_element_handler($xml_parser, &quot;startElement&quot;, &quot;endElement&quot;);
 xml_set_character_data_handler($xml_parser, &quot;characterData&quot;);
 # $fp = fopen(&quot;http://www.newsforge.com/index.rss&quot;, 'r')
 $fp = fopen(&quot;http://news.google.co.za/nwshp?hl=en&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=&amp;output=rss&quot;, 'r')
         or die(&quot;Error reading RSS data.&quot;);
 while ($data = fread($fp, 4096)) {
         xml_parse($xml_parser, $data, feof($fp))
        or die(sprintf(&quot;XML error: %s at line %d&quot;,
        xml_error_string(xml_get_error_code($xml_parser)),
         xml_get_current_line_number($xml_parser)));
 }
 fclose($fp);
 xml_parser_free($xml_parser);
 ?&gt;
 &amp;lt;/dl&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">As you write more complex scripts, you'll see that you '''must''' make it clear to yourself and to others exactly what you're doing and why you're doing it.
Comments and &quot;good&quot; naming can help you make clear and understandable scripts because:
* When writing a script takes longer than a week, by the time you're done, you won't remember what you did when you started, and you will most likely need to know.
* Any script that is commonly used ''will'' need rewriting sooner or later. Rewriting is much easier (and in many cases, made possible) when you write down what you did.
* If you want to show someone your scripts, they should be nice and neat.

==Comments==
Comments are pieces of code that the PHP parser skips. When the parser spots a comment, it simply keeps going until the end of the comment without doing anything.
PHP offers both one line and multi-line comments.

===One-Line Comments===
One-line comments are comments that start where ever you start them and end at the end of the line.
With PHP, you can use both // and # for your one-line comments (# is not commonly used).
Those are used mainly to tell the reader what you're doing the next few lines.
For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 //Print the variable $message
 echo $message;
&lt;/source&gt;

It's important to understand that a one-line comment doesn't have to 'black out' the whole line, it starts where ever you start it.
So it can also be used to tell the reader what a certain variable does:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $message = &quot;&quot;; //This sets the variable $message to an empty string
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''$message = &quot;&quot;;'' is executed, but the rest of the line is not.

====One-line Comment Issues====
* One-line comments end by either:
# a newline (an actual newline, not the \n newline mark ) OR:
# a closing PHP tag of the ?&gt; variety
* If a one-line comment is closed by a closing PHP tag will not be commented. The following will thus print out &quot;2&quot;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;// echo &quot;1&quot;; ?&gt; echo &quot;2&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Multi-Line Comments===
This kind of comment can go over as many lines as you'd like, and can be used to state what a [[../functions|function]] or a [[../Classes|class]] does, or just to contain comments too big for one line.
To mark the beginning of a multiline comment, use /* and to end it, use */ .
For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 /* This is a
    multiline comment
    And it will close
    When I tell it to.
  */
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also use this style of comment to skip over part of a line.
For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  $message = &quot;&quot;/*this would not be executed*/;
&lt;/source&gt;
Although it is recommended that one does not use this coding style, as it can be confusing in some editors.

====Multi-line Comment Issues====
* An unfinished multi-line comment will result in an error, unless it is starting (not closing) within an already existing multi-line comment block (i.e., it is non-greedy but only operates first on a complete open and close set)
** The following will result in an error: &lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt; /* test */ */&lt;/source&gt;
** The following will not result in an error:  &lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt; /* test /* */&lt;/source&gt;
* Thus, these multi-line comments cannot be nested (the first block up to &quot;ending first comments&quot; will be commented out, but the following */ will not have any opening /*for it). The following will therefore cause an error:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
/*
Starting first comments
/* 
Starting Nested comments
Ending nested comments
*/
Ending first comments
*/
&lt;/source&gt;

* One can quickly toggle multiple blocks at a time by combining the styles (though this may not work show as such correctly in a text editor)

Original text with nothing commented out (thus printing &quot;block one block two&quot;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php
//*
print &quot;block &quot;;
print &quot;one &quot;;
// */
print &quot;block &quot;;
print &quot;two&quot;;
?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

After taking out a / on the first line, the first block is commented out, printing only &quot;block two&quot;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php
/*
print &quot;block &quot;;
print &quot;one &quot;;
// */
print &quot;block &quot;;
print &quot;two&quot;;
?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

Since the single line // overrides the multi-line /* .. */ two blocks of code can be switched at the same time back and forth into or out of comment mode.

Original text (printing out only &quot;block one&quot;)

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php
//*
print &quot;block&quot;;
print &quot;one&quot;;
/*/
print &quot;block&quot;;
print &quot;two&quot;;
// */
?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

After taking out a / on the first line, the first block is commented out and the second block is uncommented, printing out only &quot;block two&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php
/*
print &quot;block&quot;;
print &quot;one&quot;;
/*/
print &quot;block&quot;;
print &quot;two&quot;;
// */
?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

* phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.pkg.html PHPDocumentor uses multiline comments (albeit with the opening immediately followed by an additional asterisk &quot;/**&quot;) and other standardized tags within the comment block to create its automatic documentation. See the website for additional instructions. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php
/**
 * This is my new fancy code...
 * @author Dr. Who
 * @version 1.0
 */
?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

===Issues with Either Single or Multi-line Comments===
When using multi-line comments with the typical &quot;/&quot; as delimiters in a regular expression, it is possible there will be a conflict, as an asterisk at the end of the expression (along with the closing &quot;/&quot; delimiter) could create something which would be parsed as a closer of the comments, thus leaving the succeeding &quot;*/&quot; without an opener:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php

/*
$subject = &quot;Hi Joe&quot;;
$matching = preg_match($subject, '/^Hi.*/');
*/

?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

To avoid the problem, one could:
* Use other regular expression delimiters--delimiters which may be less frequently encountered (and thus also in need of escaping) in most circumstances anyhow (e.g., &quot;@&quot; besides for email matching may be less frequent than &quot;/&quot;)
* Use an &quot;if&quot; with an impossible conditional which can:

Avoid regular expression conflicts:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php

if (0) {
$subject = &quot;Hi Joe&quot;;
$matching = preg_match($subject, '/^Hi.*/');
}

?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

and also avoid nesting problems:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php

if (0) {

if (0) {
print &quot;Hi &quot;;
}

print &quot;Bob&quot;;
}

?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

One disadvantage of the &quot;if&quot; method, however, is that it will most likely not be recognized by text editors as far as code coloring (though this may be an advantage for debugging, if one wishes to see more clearly what is inside the commented out block while running tests on the code).

==Naming==
Naming your variables, functions and classes correctly is very important.
If you define the following variables:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $var1 = &quot;PHP&quot;;
 $var2 = 15;
&lt;/source&gt;

They won't say much to anyone. But if you do it like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $programming_language = &quot;PHP&quot;;
 $menu_items = 15;
&lt;/source&gt;

It would be much clearer.
But don't go too far. ''$programming_language'', for example is not a good name. It's too long, and will take you a lot of time to type and can affect clarity. A better name may be ''$prog_language'', because it's shorter but still understandable.
Don't forget to use comments as well, to mark what every variable does.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $prog_language = &quot;PHP&quot;;  //The programming language used to write this script
 $menu_items = 15;        //The maximum number of items allowed in your personal menu
&lt;/source&gt;

===Magic numbers===
When using numbers in a program it is important that they have a clear meaning.  For instance it's better to define ''$menu_items''  early on instead of using ''15''  repeatedly without telling people what it stands for.  The major exception to this is the number 1; often programmers have to add or subtract 1 from some other number to avoid off-by-one errors, so 1 can be used without definition.

When you define numbers early on in their usage it also makes it easier to adjust the values later.  Again if we have 15 menu items and we refer to them ten times, it will be a lot easier to adjust the program when we add a 16th menu item; just correct the variable definition and you have updated the code in 10 places.

==Spacing==
PHP ignores extra spaces and lines.
This means, that even though you could write code like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 if($var == 1) {echo &quot;Good&quot;;} else {echo &quot;Bad&quot;;}
&lt;/source&gt;

It's better like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 if($var == 1) {
   echo &quot;Good&quot;;
 } else {
   echo &quot;Bad&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Some programmers prefer this way of writing:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 if($var == 1) 
 {
   echo &quot;Good&quot;;
 } 
 else 
 {
   echo &quot;Bad&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

You should also use blank lines between different portions of your script.
Instead of

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $var = 1;
 echo &quot;Welcome!&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;;
 echo &quot;How are you today?&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;;
 echo &quot;The answer: &quot;;
 if($var == 1) {
   echo &quot;Good&quot;;
 } else {
   echo &quot;Bad&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

You could write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $var = 1;
 
 echo &quot;Welcome!&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;;
 echo &quot;How are you today?&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;;
 
 echo &quot;The answer: &quot;;
 if($var == 1) {
   echo &quot;Good&quot;;
 } else {
   echo &quot;Bad&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

And the reader will understand that your script first declares a variable, then welcomes the user, and then checks the variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A drill is a tool used to bore holes in a material.  A drill may either be manually turned by the user or automatically turned by a motor.  The latter is an electric drill.  The drill bit is the cutting element of the drill.  This bit is a cylendrical shaped piece of metal with a spiral cut.  Drill bits can be almost any size from fractions of an inch to larger.  A drill press is an electric drill fixed to a pedistal.

      <comment>/* The Monitor-section */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{nVidia}}


Could you imagine a video-night sitting in front of a 17&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; monitor? Wouldn't it be much nicer to go through all your videos using a television? Most video cards don't provide direct [[Wikipedia:SCART|SCART]]-connection to the TV, but some offer a [[Wikipedia:S-Video|S-Video]] connection.

This page provides step-by-step documentation on howto setup your X-Server and use Tv-out.


==Setting up the X-Server==


We need to edit three different parts of your X config file to make the X-server render your desktop or video to a television that is connected to your video card through the S-Video (or Composite) port on your videocard. They are used to associate a Monitor with a Device and define a Screen.  If you look through your configfile you will notice that those sections already exist.  No wonder, because we need one Device-, one Monitor- and one Screen- Section for each connected monitor/TV. In our case it's the original monitor (CRT) and the television. To make sure your monitor will work later on as well '''do not touch the existing sections'''.  We will add new sections to support tv-out as well as the original monitor simultaneously.  There is also a feature called '''TwinView''' which is not covered here.

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #ff0000; background: #ffa000; padding: 0.5em; color: #000000;&quot;&gt;  
Please make a backup of your configuration file before you make any changes to it.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Device-Section and its options===

This section associates each installed videocard with a driver. As you look through the xorg.conf your device-section section should look like this right now:

&lt;pre&gt;
Section &quot;Device&quot;
 Identifier  &quot;Videocard0&quot;  # unique identifier for each video card
 Driver      &quot;nvidia&quot;
        VendorName  &quot;nVidia&quot;
        BoardName   &quot;nVidia Corporation NV15 [GeForce2 GTS/Pro]&quot;  # see lspci
# Options ...
EndSection
&lt;/pre&gt;

This Device Section controls the DVI/VGA output and ignores the tv-out and all devices conected to it. There are some special nvidia-options to use the tvout.

====TVStandard====

You should adjust this parameter to your monitor. In general you can take the value from this table:

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;  
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; 
| '''Value''' || '''Country'''
|-
|&quot;PAL-B&quot; || used in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Guinea, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Russia
|-
|&quot;PAL-D&quot; || used in China and North Korea
|-
|&quot;PAL-G&quot; || used in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Malaysia, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland
|-
|&quot;PAL-H&quot; || used in Belgium
|-
|&quot;PAL-I&quot; || used in Hong Kong, The United Kingdom, and most of the former colonies (i.e. South Africa, Australia, etc.)
|-
|&quot;PAL-K1&quot; || used in Guinea
|-
|&quot;PAL-M&quot; || used in Brazil
|-
|&quot;PAL-N&quot; || used in France, Paraguay, and Uruguay
|-
|&quot;PAL-NC&quot; || used in Argentina
|-
|&quot;NTSC-J&quot; || used in Japan
|-
|&quot;NTSC-M&quot; || used in Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, South Korea, Taiwan, United States of America, Venezuela, Dominican Republic...
|}
&lt;/div&gt;


''Usage:''

&lt;pre&gt;
Option    &quot;TVStandard&quot; &quot;NTSC-M&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

====TVOutFormat====

This option is used to force the output to ''S-Video'' or ''Composite''. If this option is missing it will be auto-detected. But be careful because this detection might fail. Possible values are '''SVIDEO''' and '''COMPOSITE'''.

''Usage:''

&lt;pre&gt;
Option    &quot;TVOutFormat&quot; &quot;COMPOSITE&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

====ConnectedMonitor====

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;  
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; 
| '''Value''' || '''Effect'''
|-
|&quot;CRT&quot; || No effect, because you tell your videocard to use the monitor connected to the 15 pin VGA connector
|-
|&quot;DFP&quot; || Everything will be printed on the flat panel connected to DVI/HDMI output
|-
|&quot;TV&quot; || The monitor will be disabled and everything will be displayed on TV connected to the SVIDEO or COMPOSITE output
|-
| colspan=2 align=&quot;left&quot;|'''And in all combination for TwinView'''
|}
&lt;/div&gt;


''Usage:''

&lt;pre&gt;
Option    &quot;ConnectedMonitor&quot; &quot;CRT, TV&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

====A complete device-section====

Finally your new device section should look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
Section &quot;Device&quot; 
 Identifier  &quot;Card_tv&quot;
 Driver      &quot;nvidia&quot;
 BusID       &quot;PCI:1:0:0&quot;  # May differ (not needed unless you have two or more cards)
 Option      &quot;TVOutFormat&quot; &quot;COMPOSITE&quot;  # Or &quot;SVIDEO&quot;
 Option      &quot;TVStandard&quot; &quot;NTSC-M&quot;
 Option      &quot;ConnectedMonitor&quot; &quot;TV&quot;
EndSection
&lt;/pre&gt;

===The Monitor-section===

As mentioned we need to setup a monitor device and define the '''Horizontal Syncronisation rate'' and the '''Vertical Refresh rate''. You need not search for those numbers, because usually those numbers are the same for most televisions.

&lt;pre&gt;
Section &quot;Monitor&quot;
 Identifier   &quot;tv&quot;
 HorizSync 30-50
 VertRefresh 60
EndSection
&lt;/pre&gt;

===The Screen-section===

To complete the whole configuration we need to add a Screen section that associates the Device and Monitor sections and defines the desired display resolutions.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Section &quot;Screen&quot;
 Identifier &quot;Screen_tv&quot;
 Device     &quot;Card_tv&quot;
 Monitor    &quot;tv&quot;
 DefaultDepth 16
 SubSection &quot;Display&quot;
 Depth     16
 Modes &quot;1280x1024&quot; &quot;1152x864&quot; &quot;1024x768&quot; &quot;800x600&quot;
 EndSubSection
EndSection
&lt;/pre&gt;

===The ServerLayout-section===

We now have two monitor-sections, two device-sections and two screen-sections. But how does X know what do with with them. Easy answer. There's another section defined with ServerLayout which can be used to switch the used devices. There should already exist a Section for that which controls your current monitor and defines what keyboard and mouse to use. '''Don't edit it''' unless you know what your doing. This Tutorial describes how to use several serverlayouts. So we add one more of them using our television Screen section:

&lt;pre&gt;
Section &quot;ServerLayout&quot;
 Identifier     &quot;tv&quot;
 Screen         0  &quot;Screen_tv&quot; 0 0
 InputDevice    &quot;Mouse0&quot; &quot;CorePointer&quot;
 InputDevice    &quot;Keyboard0&quot; &quot;CoreKeyboard&quot;
EndSection
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Permissions===
On a Debian or Ubuntu system you will have to edit allowed_users in /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config to get permission to start the X server.

If xinit reports &quot;''user not authorized to run the X server, aborting''&quot;, edit the file '''/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config''' as follows:

Change this line:
&lt;pre&gt;allowed_users=console&lt;/pre&gt;
to
&lt;pre&gt;allowed_users=anybody&lt;/pre&gt;

Additionally, to connect to the server, you may need to launch X with &quot;X :1 -layout tv -auth .Xauthority&quot;

===Finally===

After putting all that into your configuration file we are ready to test the X-Server and write a little script to launch mplayer on the TV.

==Testing Tv-Out==

To test the TV out try this from and xterm on your CRT:

&lt;pre&gt;
X :1 -layout tv
&lt;/pre&gt;

Your monitor should turn blank and might switch into Standby (SignalLost messages could also appear). If your TV is connected and the input selection is set correctly you should see the nVidia logo then the mousepointer should appear. To switch between monitor and TV you can use these key combinations:

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;  
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; 
| '''Keycombination''' | '''Effect'''
|-
|CTRL+ALT+F7 || This is the original Xserver with your windomanager running. Your TV turns black.
|-
|CRTL+ALT+F8 || This will be the tvout. You monitor turns black.
|}
&lt;/div&gt;


''If those keys don't work, try to zap through all: start from F1 and go up to F12. One should be your windowmanager and another is the television. The others are terminal loginprompts.''

(In Ubuntu 7.04 the following has been found with the nvidia-glx driver on a Geforce4 Go 420 on issuing X :1 -layout tv:

&lt;pre&gt;
(EE) NVIDIA(0): Unable to initialize the X Int10 module; the console may not
(EE) NVIDIA(0): be restored correctly on your TV.
&lt;/pre&gt;

This been reported as a [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/109703 bug])

To open a terminal go to your windowmanager, open a prompt and type:

&lt;pre&gt;
DISPLAY=:1 xterm
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you now switch back to your TV on F8 there will be a terminal popped up in the upper left corner of the screen. Your config passed the test. We can now try to handle all this in a useful way.


When trying the xterm command above, you may get an error similar to:

&lt;pre&gt;
AUDIT: Tue May 17 14:57:14 2005: 18768 X: client 1 rejected from local host
Xlib: connection to &quot;:1.0&quot; refused by server
Xlib: No protocol specified
&lt;/pre&gt;


This error occurs if your system is using Xauthentication (xauth) to limit who can access a running X server. You need to tell X that you want to allow access from the local machine to display :1. The following command is one long command that is split across 2 lines. It will configure Xauthentication so that display :1 will accept connections from the same sources as display :0. This command was constructed on and it works on Mandriva 2005 LE, and has been seen to work on Fedora Core 5 and Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake).
To configure Xauthentication for local access, open a prompt and type:

&lt;pre&gt;
xauth add &quot;$(/bin/hostname)/unix:1&quot; MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 \
$( xauth list | egrep &quot;$(/bin/hostname)/unix:0&quot; | awk '{print $3}' )
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Shutting down the TV-SCREEN==

It you want to shutdown the TV-screen session, you can easily use the same procedure as if you want to kill your X-Server.

# Activate the X-Session you want to terminate
# Press ALT + CTRL + BACKSPACE
# Switch back to your regular session and continue as if nothing happend 


==Example Scripts to use the TV-Out==

===Starting mplayer on TV===

To get a command for running mplayer on the TV, create a new file '''/usr/local/bin/mplayer.tv''', with this content:

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xinit /usr/bin/xterm -ut -e \
  /usr/bin/mplayer -stop-xscreensaver -fs -vo sdl &quot;$@&quot; -- /usr/X11R6/bin/X :1 -layout tv
&lt;/pre&gt;

Use '''locate''' or '''whereis''' to find the correct path if some commands are located elsewhere. ( FC5: /usr/bin/xinit and /usr/bin/X )

Make the script executeable:

&lt;pre&gt;
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mplayer.tv
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;  
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; 
| '''Parameter''' || '''Explanation'''
|-
|exec || replace shell with xinit and forward arguments
|-
|/usr/X11R6/bin/xinit || xinit opens up a new X-Server and runs a command
|-
|/usr/bin/xterm -ut -e || this is sometimes needed to get the right display
|-
|/usr/bin/mplayer || the movie player
|-
| -stop-xscreensaver || we don't want the screensaver active while watching a movie
|-
| -fs -vo sdl || use fullscreen playback
|-
|&quot;$@&quot; || forward parameters for mplayer
|-
| -- || everything coming after this will be parameters for xinit and not mplayer
|-
|/usr/X11R6/bin/X || this is the X-server we want to use
|-
|:1 || the new screen will be located at &quot;:1&quot;
|-
| -layout tv || we use our special ServerLayout &quot;tv&quot;
|}
&lt;/div&gt;


You can now play all your videos on TV:

&lt;pre&gt;
mplayer.tv /your/path/to/video.mpeg
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;

===mplayerstart: Bash script with resume===

mplayerstart is a wrapper script for mplayer which allows the user to resume playback of a previously played file, supports several TV-out methods (including the xinit method above), disables screensavers, restores volume levels, and  other features.  The most recent version may be obtained here: [http://igurublog.wordpress.com/downloads/script-mplayerstart/ mplayerstart].

TwinView is a feature of modern '''nVidia''' graphics cards first introduced on the GeForce2 MX range of cards. TwinView presents a single big screen to the operating system, one advantage of this approach compared to using multiple cards with Xinerama is that hardware accelerated OpenGL applications work on both screens and can be moved from one to other easily.

==Buying a TwinView card==

If you do not currently have a TwinView card but are interested in buying one, there are few things to look out for:

* Some cards listed as featuring TwinView have the second display only available throught a TV out which is of no real use for dual head system - though this maybe useful for multitasking video with other operations. Popular configurations of TwinView are HD15/TV, DVI/HD15 and DVI/DVI. Many configurations of the later two combinations have the second output which either can be the monitor or a TV out giving the best of both worlds.
* Most TwinView cards have at least one DVI output which is a DVI-I which can support analog monitors with the aid of an adaptor (such as CRTs and old/cheap LCD displays) in addition to DVI LCD displays, be careful, if this is what you want/need that you don't get a card with DVI-D output which only supports LCDs.
* The majority of highend NVIDIA cards have a DVI/DVI combination so this is generally easy to find. For a cheaper card you will probably have to settle for a DVI/HD15 card which may require looking at several models before you find one.
* The resolution of the second display on GeForce2 MX cards is limited by a slow pixel clock (150Mhz) which limits this screen to 1280x1024. GeForce4 (all modern cards) and later cards have both outputs running with the same pixel clock giving the same maxiumum resolution on both screens.

==Configuring TwinView with NVIDIA's binary driver==

APPENDIX G of the [ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-7676/README.txt NVIDIA Readme] has a comprehensive coverage of the TwinView feature. The configuration of XFree86/Xorg is similar to other setups, the main difference is the &quot;Screen&quot; section, here is an example TwinView setup:

&lt;pre&gt;
Section &quot;Screen&quot;
	Identifier	&quot;Screen0&quot;
	Device		&quot;NVIDIA GeForce2 MX (3123)&quot;
	Monitor		&quot;Monitor0&quot;
	DefaultDepth	24
	Option &quot;TwinView &quot; &quot;on&quot;
	Option &quot;TwinViewOrientation&quot; &quot;RightOf&quot;
	Option &quot;MetaModes&quot; &quot;1280x1024,1280x1024;1280x1024,1024x768;1280x1024,NULL;1280x1024,1280x1024+1200+0&quot;
	Option &quot;SecondMonitorHorizSync&quot; &quot;30 - 96.0&quot;
	Option &quot;SecondMonitorVertRefresh&quot; &quot;50 - 120&quot;
	Subsection &quot;Display&quot;
		Depth	24
		Modes	&quot;1280x1024&quot; &quot;1152x864&quot; &quot;1024x768&quot;
	EndSubsection
EndSection
&lt;/pre&gt;

The options used in this example are specific to TwinView and therefore may need some explaination:

* '''&quot;TwinView&quot;''' needs to be set for TwinView to work
* '''&quot;TwinViewOrientation&quot;''' selects where the second screen is placed in relation to the first one: &quot;RightOf&quot;, &quot;LeftOf&quot;, and &quot;Clone&quot;
* '''&quot;MetaModes&quot;''' is a list of modes comprised of 1st and 2nd monitor pairs, each pair is separated by a semi-colon (;).
** '''1280x1024,1280x1024''' - both monitors are set to 1280x1024
** '''1280x1024,1024x768''' - the first monitor is set to 1280x1024 and second to 1024x768 (on the right in this case)
** '''1280x1024,NULL''' - the first monitor is set to 1280x1024 the and second is not displaying anything.
** '''1280x1024,1280x1024+1200+0''' - the first monitor is set to 1280x1024 and the second is set to 1280x1024 offset by 1200 from the origin of the first screen in the horizonatal direction creating a 80pixel overlap in the middle. This can be used with edge blended projectors (which overlap the image to avoid a noticeable join)
* '''SecondMonitorHorizSync''' The HorizSync option in the Monitor Section is the for the first monitor and this is its equivalent on the second monitor.
* '''SecondMonitorVertRefresh''' The VertRefresh option in the Monitor Section is the for the first monitor and this is its equivalent on the second monitor.
* '''Subsection &quot;Display&quot;''' You may think that you don't need this, however you'd be wrong if you thought that! If only one screen is connected the Nividia driver will say ''&quot;(WW) NVIDIA(0): Only one display device connected; disabling TwinView.&quot;'' and X will revert to the settings in this section, it is a good idea to check that the default resolution works with both monitors (in case one breaks) so that you can get a graphical login without messing about.

The default meta mode is the left most one. You can switch through the modes in two ways whilst X is running. The first method is to use the Ctrl-Alt-+/- key combination to change native resolution of the screen whilst keeping the virtual screen size the same, this is sometimes called a virtual desktop. The other method only available on modern distributions is to use the xrandr command which changes resolution without creating a virtual desktop, xrandr with no arguments gives a list of all the available modes, to change to mode two use &quot;xrandr -s 2&quot;, more details about xrandr can be found on its man page.

===other options===

* NoTwinViewXineramaInfo - Athough TwinView presents to the OS as a single screen it also by default uses the Xinerama extension to tell the window manager what physical screens there are. The Window manager will typcially use this information to control the behaviour of maximised windows so that they only maximise onto one screen. This option, when set, turns off this feature.
* TVStandard - For controlling the second monitor on cards that feature it - see the [[nVidia/TV-OUT|TV-OUT]] for more details.
* TVOutFormat - For controlling the second monitor on cards that feature it - see the [[nVidia/TV-OUT|TV-OUT]] for more details.
* TVOverScan - For controlling the second monitor on cards that feature it - see the [[nVidia/TV-OUT|TV-OUT]] for more details.
* ConnectedMonitor - To override the monitor type detected by the Nvidia driver - maybe useful for some old non-[[Wikipedia:VESA Display Data Channel|DDC]] monitors. 

NB: if you use your flat panels in analog mode, you will need to refer to them as CRTs (e.g., &quot;ConnectedMonitor&quot; &quot;CRT, CRT&quot; (or &quot;CRT-0, CRT-1&quot;))

==Alternatives to TwinView==

TwinView in the author's opinion is the best way to get a dual-head system due the support of hardware acceleration on both screens:

* Multiple Similar Nvidia cards using Xinerama, accelerated 3D (via GLX) a new feature introduced in driver version 76.64, see Appendix V in the [ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-7664/README.txt NVIDIA Readme] for more details.
* in addition to your main AGP card you can use any number of PCI graphics cards and with the aid of the X11R6 Xinerama extension you can span your desktop across the cards and the cards do not have to made by the same manufacturer (though I've never tried this). Xinerama is described by the, fairly outdated, [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Xinerama-HOWTO/ Xinerama-HOWTO]. This method does not provide accelerated 3D support the non primary display(s).
* If you have a system where you cannot get upgraded graphics or extra graphics card (for example in a laptop) you can use [http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/Projects/DWiB/vnc.html VNCwall] to create a multihead display using the display output of many networked machines. This option does not provide accelerated 3D support on any displays due to the use of VNC.
* [http://dmx.sourceforge.net/ DMX]: provides multi-head support for multiple displays attached to different machines using the X protocol. 

==TV-out with TwinView==

It is possible to use TwinView with a monitor plus a TV if you want everything on your monitor to appear also on the TV. This is particularly useful for watching films and if you don't want to start a separate X display for the TV (as described on [[nVidia/TV-OUT|TV-OUT]]). Starting '''mplayer''' is also simple, you don't need any special options or scripts to direct output to the TV and while watching the film, your monitor will still be on.

This configuration is taken from the mplayer documentation.

First download the latest nvidia driver from [http://www.nvidia.com/ www.nvidia.com], make sure it works and insert the following into your X config file, typically under /etc/X11/xorg.conf if you use xorg:

&lt;pre&gt;
Section &quot;Device&quot;
	Identifier	&quot;GeForce&quot;
	BoardName	&quot;nVidia GeForce2/MX 400&quot;
	Driver		&quot;nvidia&quot;
	Option		&quot;NoLogo&quot;
	Option		&quot;CursorShadow&quot; &quot;on&quot;
	Option		&quot;TwinView&quot;
	Option		&quot;TwinViewOrientation&quot; &quot;Clone&quot;
	Option		&quot;MetaModes&quot; &quot;1024x768,640x480&quot;
	Option		&quot;ConnectedMonitor&quot; &quot;CRT, TV&quot;
	Option		&quot;TVStandard&quot; &quot;PAL-B&quot;
	Option		&quot;TVOutFormat&quot; &quot;SVIDEO&quot;
EndSection
&lt;/pre&gt;

The important bits are TwinViewOrientation, MetaModes and TVStandard.

# '''TwinViewOrientation''': &quot;Clone&quot; means to duplicate the monitor screen to the TV
# '''MetaModes''': these are pairs of resolutions, first means your monitor, the second the TV
# '''TVStandard''': see the readme.txt file of the nvidia driver (that you have downloaded from [http://www.nvidia.com/ www.nvidia.com]) or [[nVidia/TV-OUT|TV-OUT]] to figure out what to put here 

These setting will clone your monitor and everything will also appear on the TV. To start watching a film just type what you would normally do:

&lt;pre&gt;
mplayer -fs butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid.avi
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with the relation of quantities. In an equation, both sides are equal, and in an inequality, one side is usually greater than another.

An equation consists of two expressions joined by the equals sign (&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;). Everything on the left-hand side is equal to everything on the right-hand side, for example &lt;math&gt;2+3=4+1&lt;/math&gt;. Some equations contain a '''variable''', usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. An equation with a variable will only hold true for certain values of that variable. For example &lt;math&gt;2 + x = 5&lt;/math&gt; is only true for &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;. The values that the variables have when the equation is true are called the '''solutions''' of the equation. Therefore &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of the equation &lt;math&gt;2 + x = 5&lt;/math&gt;.

==The language of algebra==

There are several terms that you need to be familiar with before you begin to work with algebra.

===Variable===

A variable is a quantity, whose value is usually unknown. Usually, a variable is given the symbol &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, although any letter can be used.

===Constant===

A constant is usually a known quantity, which does not involve the variable. Later you will come across unknown constants, which are usually given the symbol &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

===Index===

Generally, an index is anything that is written superscript to (slightly above) a symbol. Often indicies are used to indicate something raised to a power, such as &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; (read as x-cubed), which is the same as &lt;math&gt;x \times x \times x&lt;/math&gt;.

===Expression===

An expression is a group of symbols which form a mathematical statement. &lt;math&gt;2 + 2&lt;/math&gt; is an example of an expression.

===Term===

A term is any variable, constant or a product of variables or constants which are separated by a &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; or a &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; sign. In the expression &lt;math&gt;3x+4xy-2y&lt;/math&gt;, the separate terms are &lt;math&gt;3x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;4xy&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;2y&lt;/math&gt;.

===Coefficient===

A coefficient is the constant part of a term which multiplies the variable part of the term. For example, in &lt;math&gt;2x^3&lt;/math&gt;, the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Equation===

An equation is a mathematical statement that two things are equal. There is an equals sign (&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;) in between two expressions. &lt;math&gt;2+2=4&lt;/math&gt; is an example of an equation, as well as &lt;math&gt;3+x=7&lt;/math&gt;.

===Identity===

An identity is an equation with an unknown, and is true for all values of that unknown. The identity symbol ( ≡ ) is used in place of the equals sign. As an example, &lt;math&gt;x - x = 0&lt;/math&gt; is always correct no matter what the value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is. It is usual to write &lt;math&gt;x - x&lt;/math&gt; ≡ &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; when you want to emphasize the fact that it is an identity and not just an equation.

===Function===

A function relates one input value to one output value. A function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is usually noted as &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; is an example of a function. It is then possible to write &lt;math&gt;f(3)=3^2=9&lt;/math&gt; once the function has been defined. &lt;math&gt;f(x)= \sqrt x&lt;/math&gt; is not a function, because there are two output values (positive and negative) for each input.

==Manipulating expressions==

Sometimes, expressions will be messier than they need to be, and they can be represented in an easier to understand form. The skills here are essential to the rest of the A-level course, although it is very likely that you have already covered them at GCSE.

===Collecting like terms===

When collecting like terms, you simply add all the terms in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; together, all the terms in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; together, and all the terms in &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; together. The same applies for any other letter that represents a variable.

For example, &lt;math&gt;2x+4y+8z-3x-7y-2z+4x&lt;/math&gt; becomes:

&lt;math&gt;2x-3x+4x = 3x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4y-7y = -3y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;8z-2z = 6z&lt;/math&gt;

So, by adding all the answers, &lt;math&gt;2x+4y+8z-3x-7y-2z+4x&lt;/math&gt; simplified is &lt;math&gt;3x-3y+6z&lt;/math&gt;.

===Multiplication===

Multiplication of different variables such as &lt;math&gt;a \times b&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt;. Single variables become [[A-level_Mathematics/OCR/C1/Indices_and_Surds|indices]], so &lt;math&gt; x \times x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Like addition and subtraction, you keep like terms together. So, for example:

&lt;math&gt;2x^2z \times 3yz^2 \times 4xy^3&lt;/math&gt; becomes:

&lt;math&gt;2 \times 3 \times 4 \times x^2 \times x \times y \times y^3 \times z \times z^2&lt;/math&gt;

which can finally be simplified as:

&lt;math&gt;24{x^3}{y^4}{z^3}&lt;/math&gt;

(Shouldn't this be 234{x^3}{y^4}{z^3})

===Expansion of brackets===

The skill of expanding brackets is illustrated by the following example.

&lt;math&gt;(8x+5y)(3x-6y)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=(8x+5y)3x-(8x+5y)6y=8x(3x-6y)+5y(3x-6y)&lt;/math&gt;
use FOIL

F=&gt; first term in each bracket 8x . 3x =24x^2
O=&gt;outside terms(1st in 1st x 2nd in 2nd) 8x . -6y = -48xy
I=&gt; inside terms (2nd in 1st x 1st in 2nd) 5y . 3x =15xy
L=&gt; last term in each bracket 5y . -6y = -30 y^2

and terms together(usually only the middle 2) 24x^2 -48xy +15xy -30y^2
answer 24x^2-33xy-30y^2

===Factorising===

Sometimes, expressions can be re-written as the product of their factors. You divide an expression by a factor common to all of the terms in the expression. This is essentially the opposite of expanding brackets, since most of the time the common factor is placed outside of brackets. For example:

To factorise &lt;math&gt;10x+15y&lt;/math&gt; you must first find a common factor of &lt;math&gt;10x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;15y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; is easily spotted as a factor. Now you divide the whole expression by &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; leaving you with &lt;math&gt;2x+3y&lt;/math&gt;. Place &lt;math&gt;2x+3y&lt;/math&gt; within brackets, and then put the &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; outside the bracket. The factorised expression is now &lt;math&gt;5(2x+3y)&lt;/math&gt;, and you can multiply out the expression to make sure you get the original expression.

Another expression, &lt;math&gt;x^2-xy^2+3xz&lt;/math&gt; has a common factor &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The factorised form of this expression is &lt;math&gt;x(x-y^2+3z)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Fractions===

When working with fractions, the rule is to make all of the denominators equal, and then write the expression as one fraction. You need to multiply both the top and bottom by the same amount to keep the meaning of the fraction the same.

For example, for &lt;math&gt;\frac {3x}{2} + \frac {2y}{5} - \frac {z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;, the common denominator is &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;.

Multiply both parts by &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\frac {15x}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiply both parts by &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\frac {4y}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

Leave this as it is: &lt;math&gt;\frac {z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

You now have &lt;math&gt;\frac {15x}{10} + \frac{ 4y}{10} - \frac {z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;, which becomes &lt;math&gt;\frac {15x+4y-z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Solving equations==

Often, to solve an equation you must rearrange it so that the unknown term is on its own side of the equals sign. By rearranging &lt;math&gt;2 + x = 5&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x = 5 - 2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has been made the '''subject''' of the equation. Now by simplifying the equation, you can find that the solution is &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;.

===Changing the subject of an equation===

You will usually be given equations that are more complex than the example above. To move a term from one side of the equals sign to the other, you have to do the same thing on both sides of the equals sign. For example, to make &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the subject of &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{4 a (x^2 +b)}{3}&lt;/math&gt;:

{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
|Multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;3y = 4 a (x^2 + b)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Divide both sides by &lt;math&gt;4a&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac {3y}{4a} = x^2 + b&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Subtract &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; from both sides
|&lt;math&gt;\frac {3y}{4a} -b = x^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Square root both sides
|&lt;math&gt;\pm\sqrt{\frac {3y}{4a} -b } = x&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Solving quadratic equations===

Quadratic equations are equations where the variable is raised to the power of 2 and, unlike linear equations, there are a maximum of two '''roots'''. A root is one value of the variable where the equation is true, and to fully solve an equation, you must find all of the roots. For a quadratic equation you can factorise it and then easily find which values make the equation valid. The example above is quite a simple case. You will usually be given a more complicated equation such as &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If the equation isn't already in the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;, rearrange it so that it is. The steps needed to factorise &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt; are:

{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
| Multiply &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; (coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the constant term)
| &lt;math&gt;2 \times 3 = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Find two numbers that add to give &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; (coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) and multiply to give &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt; (answer from previous step)
| &lt;math&gt;2 \times 3 = 6&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2 + 3 = 5&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Split &lt;math&gt;5x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;2x + 3x&lt;/math&gt; (from the results of the previous step)
| &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 2x + 3x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Simplify
| &lt;math&gt;2x(x + 1) + 3(x + 1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Simplify further
| &lt;math&gt;(2x + 3)(x + 1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

So &lt;math&gt;(2x + 3)(x + 1) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt; in factorised form. You can now use the fact that any number multiplied by &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to find the roots of the equation. The numbers that make one bracket equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of the equation. In the example, the roots are &lt;math&gt;-1.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;.

It is also possible to solve a quadratic equation using the [[A-level_Mathematics_%28MEI%29/C1/Algebra#The_quadratic_formula|quadratic formula]] or by [[A-level_Mathematics_%28MEI%29/C1/Algebra#Completing_the_square|completing the square]].

==Simultaneous equations==

Simultaneous equations are useful in solving two or more variables at once. Basic simultaneous equations consist of two linear expressions and can be solved by three different methods: elimination, substitution or by plotting the graph.

===Elimination method===

The basic principle of the elimination method is to manipulate one or more of the expressions in order to cancel out one of the variables, and then solve for the correct solution.

An example of this:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (1) to this equation)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 6y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (2) to this equation)
|}

From this, we can see that by multiplying equation (1) by a factor of 2 and then subtracting this new equation from (2), the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-variable will be eliminated.

(1) &lt;math&gt;\times 2 \rightarrow 4x + 6y = 20&lt;/math&gt; (1a) (Assigning the number (1a) to this equation)

Now subtracting (2) from (1a):

{|
|align=&quot;right&quot;|
|&lt;math&gt;4x + 6y = 20&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1a)
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;|&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 6y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;|&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 0y = 14&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|
|}

Now that we have &lt;math&gt;2x = 14&lt;/math&gt;, we can solve for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which in this case is &lt;math&gt;7&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;x = 7&lt;/math&gt;.

Substitute the newly found &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; into (1):

&lt;math&gt;2 \times 7 + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;14 + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;

And we find that &lt;math&gt;y = - 4/3&lt;/math&gt;

So, the solution to the two equations (1) and (2) are:

&lt;math&gt;x = 7&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = -4/3&lt;/math&gt;

===Substitution method===

The substitution method relies on being able to rearrange the expressions to isolate a single variable, in the form variable = expression. From this result this new expression can then be substituted for the variable itself, and the solutions evaluated.

An example of this:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 3y = 12&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (1) to this equation)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x + y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (2) to this equation)
|}

From this expression, it is possible to see that (2) is the most simplistic expression, and thus will be the better choice to rearrange.

Taking (2), and rearranging this into &lt;math&gt;x = 6 - y&lt;/math&gt;. (2a)

Subbing (2a) into (1) we get

&lt;math&gt;2(6 - y) + 3y = 12&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this, we get that &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Again we can sub this result into one of the original equations to solve for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. 
In this case &lt;math&gt;x = 6&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that for situations in which one of the equations is non-linear, you must isolate one variable in the linear equation and substitute it into the non-linear one. Then you can solve the quadratic equation with one of the methods above.

Another form of substitution is if you've got a similar expression in both equations, like in this case:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (1) to this equation)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 6y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (2) to this equation)
|}

Here, &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt; is found in both equations, so:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x = 10 - 3y&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2x = 6 - 6y&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|}

And since &lt;math&gt;2x = 2x&lt;/math&gt;, you could do:

&lt;math&gt;10 - 3y = 6 - 6y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;6y - 3y = 6 - 10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;3y = -4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = -4/3&lt;/math&gt;

Now you've got &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and finding &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will be the same as above.

===Graphical method===

By plotting the lines of the two equations, you can solve them by seeing where the lines intersect. If the intersection is at the point (a,b), then the solution is &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=b&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;!--Need to draw an example to go here--&gt;

===Solving problems with simultaneous equations===

Often, you will be given problems which you must be able to write out as a pair of simultaneous equations. You will need to recognise such problems, and write them out correctly before solving them. Most problems will be similar to these examples with some differences.

'''Example 1'''

''At a record store, 2 albums and 1 single costs £10. 1 album and 2 singles cost £8. Find the cost of an album and the cost of a single.''

Taking an album as &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and a single as &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the two equations would be:

&lt;math&gt;2a+s=10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a+2s=8&lt;/math&gt;

You can now solve the equations and find the individual costs.

'''Example 2'''

''Tom has a budget of £10 to spend on party food. He can buy 5 packets of crisps and 8 bottles of drink, or he can buy 10 packets of crisps and 6 bottles of drink.''

Taking a packet of crisps as &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and a bottle of drink as &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, the two equations would be:

&lt;math&gt;5c+8d=10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;10c+6d=10&lt;/math&gt;

Now you can solve the equations to find the cost of each item.

'''Example 3'''

''At a sweetshop, a gobstopper costs 5p more than a gummi bear. 8 gummi bears and nine gobstoppers cost £1.64.''

Taking a gobstopper as &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and a gummi bear as &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, the two equations would be:

&lt;math&gt;b+5=g&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;8b+9g=164&lt;/math&gt;

The problem can now be solved by using one of the methods above.

==Quadratics==

[[Image:Quadratic01.png|right]]
A quadratic is a [[A-level Mathematics (MEI)/C1/Polynomials|Polynomial]] of degree 2, in the form &lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt;.

===Graph===

A quadratic graph is one that can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt;. The graph of &lt;math&gt;y=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt; is shown on the right, and as you can see it has the same characteristic &quot;bucket&quot; shape that all quadratics have, called a '''parabola'''. The line of symmetry and the '''vertex''' (maximum or minimum point) of the graph can be found by plotting the curve point by point, and the root can be found by [[A-level_Mathematics_%28MEI%29/C1/Algebra#Solving_quadratic_equations|factorising]] the quadratic.

However, these properties can be more easily deduced from its '''completed square form''':

&lt;math&gt;y=2(x + 2)^2 - 6&lt;/math&gt;.

===Completing the square===

Completing the square is the process of changing a quadratic from the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx +c&lt;/math&gt; to the equivalent form &lt;math&gt;a(x+d)^2 + e&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; are constants. For example, the quadratic &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 8x +2&lt;/math&gt; would become &lt;math&gt;2(x+2)^2 - 6&lt;/math&gt;.

Changing a quadratic to completed square form makes it easy to find several things, such as the roots of the quadratic and the vertex of the quadratic, without even requiring a sketch.

Here are the steps for completing the square. Don't worry, it's easier than it looks.

! 1.
| Ensure the quadratic is in the conventional form: &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;.
| &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 2.
| Unless &lt;math&gt;a=1&lt;/math&gt;, &quot;pull/factor out a&quot;, that is, divide the entire quadratic by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and put it outside a bracket.
''Note: If the quadratic is part of an equation you can divide each side by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, for example &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 8x + 2=0&lt;/math&gt; simply becomes &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 4x + 1=0&lt;/math&gt;.''
| &lt;math&gt;2\left(x^2 + 4x + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 3.
| Replace the &lt;math&gt;x^2 + kx&lt;/math&gt; part with &lt;math&gt;\left(x + \frac{k}{2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;.
It is important to realise that &lt;math&gt;\left(x + \frac{k}{2}\right)^2=x^2 + kx + \frac{k^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; which is close to what it was there before but not equal. This will be corrected in the next step. To prevent writing something that isn't actually equal it is a good idea to do both these steps at once in your working once you have got used to the method.
| &lt;math&gt;2\left((x+2)^2 + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{c}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 4.
| Correct the error introduced in the previous step by inserting the subtraction of a suitable number. This suitable number can be found in two ways:
# By expanding the term inserted in the previous step and comparing it to the original; ''or''
# By remembering that the error is always &lt;math&gt;\frac{k^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.
''This step is known as &quot;completing the square&quot; and gives the method its name.''
| 
# &lt;math&gt;(x+2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4&lt;/math&gt; which is 3 greater than &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 4x + 1&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt; -3&lt;/math&gt; is inserted: &lt;math&gt;2\left((x+2)^2 - 3\right)&lt;/math&gt;; ''or''
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{4^2}{4} = 4&lt;/math&gt; so the error is 4: &lt;math&gt;2\left((x+2)^2 -4 +1\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = 2\left((x+2)^2 -3\right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 -\frac{b^2}{4a^2} + \frac{c}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 5.
| If step 2 was necessary then simplify the result a bit by expanding the outer bracket.
|&lt;math&gt;2(x+2)^2 -6&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 6.
| Check that what you have obtained expands back to what you started with.
''Note: You may feel confident enough to skip this step.''
|&lt;math&gt;2\left(x^2 + 4x + 4\right) -6&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=2x^2 + 8x + 8 - 6&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}\right)  -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=ax^2 + bx + \frac{b^2}{4a}  -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;
|}

So the completed square form of &lt;math&gt;y=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2(x+2)^2 -6&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;-6&lt;/math&gt; tells us that the lowest point of the curve is at &lt;math&gt;y=-6&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;x+2&lt;/math&gt; tells us that the line of symmetry is at &lt;math&gt;x+2=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x = -2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the vertex is at &lt;math&gt;(-2,-6)&lt;/math&gt;, and if you look at the graph, you can see that is the case.

You can see from the graph that &lt;math&gt;y=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt; has one root between &lt;math&gt;-4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-3&lt;/math&gt; and another between &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, where it crosses the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis. But how do you find the exact values? Using the completed square form, it can be re-arranged quite easily to find &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;:

| &lt;math&gt;a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 2.
| Isolate the &lt;math&gt;(x + k)^2&lt;/math&gt; term.
| &lt;math&gt;2(x + 2)^2=6&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x + 2)^2=3&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 =\frac{b^2}{4a} - c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 =\frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 3.
| Square root each side, including a &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; as the bit inside the bracket might be negative or positive.

|  &lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

''Then some simplification:''

&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{4ac}{4a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{\sqrt{4a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 4.
| Isolate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;x \approx -0.268&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-3.73&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x =\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} - \frac{b}{2a} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x =\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for this specific example are within the expected range, as seen on the graph.

===The quadratic formula===

The quadratic formula is derived from the general case of completing the square:

&lt;math&gt;x =\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

It can be used to find the roots of a quadratic by putting numbers directly into it. For example, for &lt;math&gt;y=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;x =\frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64-16}}{4} = -2 \pm \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt; x = -2 + \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = -2 - \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

====The discriminant====

Notice that the quadratic equation contains &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&lt;/math&gt; inside a square root sign. This part is called '''the discriminant''' and can be considered on its own to determine the number of roots of the equation.

* If &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; then you will be unable to find the square roots as you don't know how to square root a negative number. The type of numbers you have encountered so far are known as real numbers and so it is said that the quadratic has '''no real roots'''.
* If &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac=0&lt;/math&gt; then changing the &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; sign in front of the square root won't make any difference, because it is zero either way. You will therefore get the same root twice, so it is said the quadratic has '''one repeated root'''.
* If &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; then the &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; will mean you get two answers, and so you can say the quadratic has '''two distinct''' (i.e. different) '''roots'''.

==Inequalities==

An inequality is an expression which compares the relative sizes of points, lines, or curves. Unlike an [[#Solving equations|equation]], where both sides of the equals sign are always equal, inequalities can have one side greater than or equal to the other side.

===The four signs of inequalities===

There are four main basic signs:

* &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; less than,
* &lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt; greater than,
* &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; less than or equal to, and
* &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; greater than or equal to.

For example, &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is less than 4, &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 4, &lt;math&gt;x\le 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is four or any number less than this, and &lt;math&gt;x\ge 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is four or any number higher than this. 

Note that &lt;math&gt;x &gt; y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y &lt; x&lt;/math&gt; are both essentially the same statement.

If you become confused with which sign means less than and greater than, it is useful to remember that the inequality signs always point to the smaller number.

===Combining inequalities===

There are some cases where two inequalities can be combined into one. For example, the height of the door was said to be between &lt;math&gt;x \ge 1.95&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 2.05&lt;/math&gt;. The usual way of writing these is &lt;math&gt;1.95 \le x &lt; 2.05&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the inequality signs are in the same direction. &lt;math&gt;2.05 \ge x &gt; 1.95&lt;/math&gt; is perfectly acceptable, but it is incorrect to combine opposite facing inequalities and they must be left as two separate inequalities.

===Solving linear inequalities===

These signs can be used in place of equal signs, and an equation now becomes an inequality (since both sides are not always equal).

For example,  instead of &lt;math&gt;2x + 4 = 6&lt;/math&gt; we could have &lt;math&gt;2x + 4 &gt; 6&lt;/math&gt;.

In this example, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; may be any number which makes this inequality greater than 6. In this case &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;x \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;. If the inequality was &lt;math&gt;2x + 4 \ge 6&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; could take the value of 1.

An inequality can be manipulated and therefore solved just like an equation, although there is an extra step you must take when you multiply or divide by a negative number.

===Multiplying or dividing by a negative number===

When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, you must change the direction of the inequality sign.

For example, look at the inequality &lt;math&gt;10 &gt; 5&lt;/math&gt;. This is correct since 10 is obviously greater than 5. Now if we were to multiply both sides by -1, we would get:

&lt;math&gt;-10 &gt; -5&lt;/math&gt;.

This is incorrect, since -10 is actually less than -5. By reversing the inequality sign, we now have the correct inequality:

&lt;math&gt;-10 &lt; -5&lt;/math&gt;.

===Solving quadratic inequalities===

To solve a quadratic inequality, you could [[A-level_Mathematics_%28MEI%29/C1/Algebra#Solving_quadratic_equations|factorise]] it, just like a quadratic equation. 


Alternatively you could draw its graph as if it was a quadratic equation, and then shade the side that's covered by the inequality. ''maybe an image here, to demonstrate the method?''

==Indicies==

You are probably already familiar with indices, for example &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is just a shorter way of writing &lt;math&gt;x \times x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt; is similarly &lt;math&gt;x \times x \times x \times x&lt;/math&gt;. In &lt;math&gt;x^5&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called the base and &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; is called the power or exponent. &lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt; is pronounced &quot;x to the four&quot;, or &quot;x raised to the 4th power&quot; in full. Some powers are so useful that they have special names: &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as &quot;x squared&quot;, &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;x cubed&quot; and &lt;math&gt;x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (which you will soon learn about if you haven't already encountered it) is called &quot;the reciprocal of x&quot;.

'''Note:''' The &quot;law of indices&quot; is sometimes also called the &quot;exponent laws&quot; or &quot;power rules&quot; [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExponentLaws.html]. More generally, an [[w:index|index]] in mathematics is a [[w:superscript|superscript]] or [[w:subscript|subscript]] to a symbol.

===Operations with indices===
Using this notation you might notice several patterns. 

====Multiplication====

Firstly, &lt;math&gt;x^3 \times x^2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left(x \times x \times x\right) \times \left(x \times x\right)=x \times x \times x \times x \times x&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;x^5&lt;/math&gt;. Of course &lt;math&gt;3+2=5&lt;/math&gt; so you have added the powers together. To clarify, here is an example with numbers:
&lt;math&gt;2^3 \times 2^5 = 8 \times 32 = 256 = 2^8&lt;/math&gt; (like before, &lt;math&gt;3+5=8&lt;/math&gt;)

====Division====

Secondly &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^4}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{x \times x \times x \times x}{x \times x} = x \times x = x^2&lt;/math&gt; (when &lt;math&gt;x \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;). This time &lt;math&gt;4-2=2&lt;/math&gt; and so you have subtracted the powers. 

Here is an example with numbers:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{10^5}{10^2}=\frac{100000}{100}=1000=10^3&lt;/math&gt; and again &lt;math&gt;5-2=3&lt;/math&gt;.

====Base raised to two powers====

Thirdly &lt;math&gt;\left(x^2\right)^3&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left(x \times x\right) \times \left(x \times x\right) \times \left(x \times x\right)=x \times x \times x \times x \times x \times x&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;x^6&lt;/math&gt;. You can see that &lt;math&gt;2 \times 3 = 6&lt;/math&gt; and so the powers have been multiplied. Here is another example with numbers: &lt;math&gt;\left(3^2\right)^4=9^4=6561=3^8&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 \times 4 = 8&lt;/math&gt;.

====Multiple bases====

Finally &lt;math&gt;\left(xy \right)^3 = xy \times xy \times xy = x \times y \times x \times y \times x \times y = x \times x \times x \times y \times y \times y&lt;/math&gt; which is the same as &lt;math&gt;x^3y^3&lt;/math&gt;. Here is an example with numbers: &lt;math&gt;\left(2 \times 5\right)^2 = \left(10\right)^2 = 100 = 4 \times 25 = 2^2 \times 5^2&lt;/math&gt;. There is a similar situation with division: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^2 = \frac{x}{y} \times \frac{x}{y} = \frac{x \times x}{y \times y} = \frac{x^2}{y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

====The Laws of Indices====

The rules that have been suggested above are known as the laws of indices and can be written as:

# &lt;math&gt;x^ax^b = x^{a+b}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left(x^a\right)^b = x^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left(xy \right)^n = x^n y^n&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^n = \frac{x^n}{y^n}&lt;/math&gt;

===Special indices===

You may well have realised that &lt;math&gt;{x^1}=x&lt;/math&gt;. This can be seen by looking at the pattern of &lt;math&gt;x^3=x \times x \times x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^2 = x \times x&lt;/math&gt; or by doing &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^3}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; which is clearly &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; but is also &lt;math&gt;x^{3-2}=x^1&lt;/math&gt; by law 2.

So far all the examples we have looked at are where the power is a positive integers, but by thinking about the laws it is possible to look at other cases.

====Power 0====

It is less obvious that &lt;math&gt;x^0=1&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (strictly speaking, any &lt;math&gt;x \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, see the [[#What is the value of 00?|note]] below.), but this can be shown in a similar way, for example &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^4}{x^4}&lt;/math&gt; is 1 but must be also be &lt;math&gt;x^{4-4}=x^0&lt;/math&gt; by law 2.

====Negative powers====

The next logical step is to ask what &lt;math&gt;x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is. Well by using law 2 &quot;backwards&quot; &lt;math&gt;x^{-1} = x^{0-1} = \frac{x^0}{x^1} = \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;. A similar argument can be used for any other negative integer, for example &lt;math&gt;x^{-3} = x^{0-3} = \frac{x^0}{x^3} = \frac{1}{x^3}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Fractional powers====

What if the power isn't even an integer? Suppose you wanted to find &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, you could say that &lt;math&gt;{x^\frac{1}{2}} \times {x^\frac{1}{2}}  = x^1&lt;/math&gt; (by law 3, addition of powers) which means that &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt x&lt;/math&gt;. However it is customary to only use the positive root and so &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt x&lt;/math&gt;. You can use a similar argument for other such fractions, for example &lt;math&gt;\left(x^\frac{1}{3}\right)^3=x&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{3} = \sqrt[3]{x}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''In summary:'''
* &lt;math&gt;x^1=x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x^0=1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x^{-n}=\frac{1}{x^n}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{n}=\sqrt[n]{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes you might have to use the laws to understand what something means, for example &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{2}{3} = \left(x^2 \right)^\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; (using law 3), and &lt;math&gt;\left(x^2\right)^\frac{1}{3} = \sqrt[3]{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; (using the definition above). It's useful to remember the general rule that &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt[b]{x^a}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Surds==
In mathematics, a Surd is an expression containing a root with an irrational solution that
can not be expressed exactly – for example, ''√3 = 1.732050808...'' .

Sometimes it is useful to work in square roots, rather than using an approximate decimal value. Square roots can be manipulated just like algebraic expressions and sometimes it may be possible to eliminate the square root (called rationalising the expression), which may have not been possible if you tried to work with the approximate value. When asked to give the exact value, approximate decimal answers will not do and you will have to manipulate surds in order to give a final answer in simplified surd form.

===Simplification of surds===

Because surds can be manipulated like algebraic expressions, you can easily multiply out the terms and add the like terms. However, there are also a few rules that will be useful when simplifying surds.

===Basic rule of surds===

Because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {x} \times \sqrt {x} = x&lt;/math&gt;, it is useful to know that it can be rearranged to give &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {x} = \frac {x} {\sqrt {x}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {\sqrt {x}} = \frac {\sqrt {x}} {x}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Surds as indices===

Because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x} = x^\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; the laws of indices also apply to any n-th root. The most frequently used instances of this are laws 4 and 5 with square roots:

* &lt;math&gt;\left(xy \right)^n = x^n y^n&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{x} \times \sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^n = \frac{x^n}{y^n}&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}} = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{y}}&lt;/math&gt;

The first of these points is often used to simplify a square root, for example &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{200}=\sqrt{100 \times 2}=\sqrt{100} \times \sqrt{2}=10\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. In an exam, you will be expected to write all square roots with the smallest possible number inside the square root (i.e. the number inside the root shouldn't have any square factors).

===Rationalising the denominator===

Another technique to simplify expressions involving square roots is to '''rationalise the denominator'''. This means getting rid of square roots from the bottom of a fraction. In the case of a fraction such as &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt;, both numerator and denominator can be multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; to give &lt;math&gt;\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the fraction is of the form&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+\sqrt{c}}&lt;/math&gt; the strategy used in the previous paragraph will only work if it is modified slightly. This time you should multiply the numerator and denominator by &lt;math&gt;{b-\sqrt{c}}&lt;/math&gt;. If you are familiar with the standard difference of two squares expansion you should already know what happens next:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+\sqrt{c}} \times \frac{b-\sqrt{c}}{b-\sqrt{c}} = \frac{ab-a\sqrt{c}}{b^2 + b\sqrt{c} - b\sqrt{c} - \sqrt{c}^2} = \frac{ab - a\sqrt{c}}{b^2-c} &lt;/math&gt;. As you can see the denominator now does not contain any square roots. For example:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{\sqrt{3}+1} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}+2}{3-1} = \sqrt{3}+1 &lt;/math&gt;

==Common questions and mistakes==

===Splitting up roots===

A common mistake is to split &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x + y}&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\left(x+y\right)^2&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;, usually whilst moving it to the other side of the equals. Trying a few examples will quickly convince you that this is not possible:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{25}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ne; &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{9} + \sqrt{16}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{64}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ne; &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{32} + \sqrt{32}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
And so on

===What is the value of &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;?===
The short answer is that for this course you don't need to know, and you can safely skip this section. If you're still interested then read on:

The question arises because &lt;math&gt;x^0=1&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and yet you would expect that &lt;math&gt;0^y=0&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;0 \times 0 \times 0 \dots = 0&lt;/math&gt;. It turns out using a value of 1 is quite useful (perhaps even necessary) in various parts of algebra, whereas making it zero doesn't help at all. Almost all mathematicians would therefore either say that &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; is 1 or that it is undefined (that is, it can't be given a value). A more technical discussion can be found at [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/sci-math-faq/specialnumbers/0to0/ http://www.faqs.org/faqs/sci-math-faq/specialnumbers/0to0/]

And I do mean welcome to Wikibooks.  Really.

I would like to point out that adding content to Wikimedia projects that has been licensed under the CC-by-SA-NC license is a violation of the terms of the Gnu Free Document License, as the GFDL does permit some limited forms of commercial activity.  I am supportive of people that use the non-commercial use only license for their works, and I appreciate the viewpoint they are trying to make.  It just doesn't blend together with content that does permit commercial use so there is a conflict of the copyright licenses and makes it illegal to copy that sort of content to this project.  To be honest, I don't know what sort of commercial activity might be used with the [[Rip a karaoke cd]] Wikibook, but I'm just pointing out that it is generally permitted with Wikibooks content.

This license (the GFDL) has been used since the inception of Wikibooks, and a [http://www.intelligentdesigns.net/Licenses/NC major discussion about this] has been done by many other people who do a better job of explaining the issue than myself.  To change the license would mean to completely kill this project and restart totally from scratch, losing out on all of the content that has been added here for the past three years.

I hope that you understand this issue, and are willing to work with us on this point.

I'd also like to point out that we strongly discourage endorsing specific commercial businesses here.  This isn't an official rule, so you can argue your point and remove the npov tag if you want to in this regard.  There are some Wikibooks that are specifically about a particular commercial product, so obviously there is some leeway about that anyway.  The point here is that endorsing a product like &quot;If you don't already have one, buy a Plextor CD-RW. Many CDRWs will not read or write a CD+G properly, all Plextor drives do&quot; is a specific point of view.  There are many manufacturing companies who make blank CD-Rs, some better than others, but you should try to qualify why you think that Plextor CDs are superior, such as ''&quot;[[w:New York Times|the New York Times]] has reviewed different CD-ROM media and found that Plextor CDs are superior than other brands.&quot;''

We are also in the middle of trying to come up with a general policy about encouraging illegal activity.  Ripping a CD is a marginal activity at best.  Yes, I do know the legal reasons for copying tracks for personal use, but I'm mainly here to let you know that it is skating on thin ice here.  I think the DRM restrictions that keep you from doing this sort of activty with music or audio recordings is absolutely stupid, and even worse if you were the original author/creator/songwriter of the content on that CD.  Still, this is a point of view that needs to be tempered.

All of this discussion is to help you to improve the content you have written, not to discourage you from participating on Wikibooks.  I hope that you continue to get involved here, and I would like to see more contributions from you in the future.  Please read some of the links listed above before you get too far into adding large amounts of content here, but we really do want to have more people come here and help us to write the various texts we call Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:31, 4 April 2006 (UTC)



Thanks for the in depth review and for bringing things to my attention.  I will make further comments about the tutorial on [[Talk:Rip_a_karaoke_cd]] where it seems it would be most appropriate.--[[User:Hapa|Hapa]] 20:16, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

== VfD for CD Ripping book ==

I was hoping it wouldn't get to this, but somebody else has nominated your book for deletion on the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] page.  I guess it is partially my fault because I raised a stink over this in some very public forums and unfortunately used your book as an example of one that should be used for review under some &quot;no illegal activity&quot; policy.  My point in those discussions was that deleting books on the basis that it covered illegal activity was a very subjective process, and that it put a huge burden on people like myself, as well as opened up a huge area for abuse by individuals who delete content at the drop of a hat.

Please know that 1) I am not the only user or even admin on Wikibooks and 2) This is not an attack against you personally.

Don't take this personally, and I really would like to see you remain on Wikibooks and help us out.  Try to defend what you've written if you can, and explain legal uses for the information as well.  I'll do what I can, but this seems to me to be a losing fight.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:09, 8 April 2006 (UTC)
:'Tis no big deal - Maybe it's not an appropriate article for Wikibooks, I'll come up with something more appropriate in the near future, at the very minimum it survives at [http://www.opentutorial.com/index.php?title=Rip_a_karaoke_cd OpenTutorial:Rip_a_karaoke_cd], meanwhile I'll keep trolling wikibooks for stuff to fix. I'm learning a great deal by participating here and having a good time also.--[[User:Hapa|Hapa]] 21:33, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

You cannot mark any of screenshots of Microsoft programs as own work. They are protected by law and therefore {{tl|fair use}}. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:36, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

SLI is a feature that allows two NVIDIA cards to work as one providing increased performance. SLI was first supported in the [http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_1.0-8174.html 1.0-8174 driver], for a review read the Phoronix [http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=338&amp;num=1 NVIDIA Linux SLI (1.0-8174)] article.

To be able to use SLI (Scalable Link Interface) you will need two or more graphics card that are capable of running in SLI. You will also need a certified power supply that can handle two or more graphics cards. You will also need a motherboard that supports SLI, typically a motherboard with two pci-express x16 lanes, and a graphics chipset that is capable of supporting dual GPU's.

Sincerely, Welcome to Wikibooks!

I'm glad that you have chosen to come here and help to help with Wikibooks, and I hope that you continue to participate here.  This is mainly a footnote to let you know that I have changed the name of your new Wikibook from [[TeachersToolbox]] to [[Teachers' Toolbox]].  First of all, there is no need for using [[w:CamelCase|CamelCase]] in the naming of Wikibooks.  You can revert back to this naming system if you really want to, but it should be done only as an artistic flair to the name of the book and not because of any restraints of the software running the Wikibooks website.  Most Wikibooks have spaces in the names of the &quot;title&quot; of the book, and can even use glyphs other than the traditional alphabet as well.  If you want to change the name of this book back, that can be done by using the &quot;move&quot; tab at the top of the edit page, which will appear after you have spent a little bit of time here on Wikibooks.  Brand new contributors are restricted with some of these options.  If you need some help on this issue, you can drop a note to me on [[User talk:Robert Horning|my discussion page]].

I've been in exactly the situation that you've said in the introduction here, actually much worse because I had to substitute for a college course that I hadn't even seen the syllabus until 10 minutes ''after'' I started my lecture.  The previous instructor had been fired... not a pleasant situation to be in.  And that was the first day for me being in the faculty of that school, so I hadn't even seen the college catalog at that point to even know what the curriculum was.  I hope I never get myself into a situation like that again.  The students liked what I presented and said I did a pretty good job, so I guess that should count for something.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:10, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

== Pagemoves ==

Hi,

Did you just use copy-paste to move &quot;microwiki&quot;? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:13, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

: yes partly, it was redirected from microtechnology to microwiki and we have reverseed that now, so the page is microtechnology and microwiki redirects there. Same thing about nanowiki and nanotechnology. I wasnt sure how redirect would act to an existing page, so I have used cut-paste. --[[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 10:18, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

::I guess that will work in this case... since you were the only author. In the future, keep in mind that pages with multiple contributors should be moved, not copied, as it loses the contribution history when you cut and paste. If there's already a redirect page where you want to move something to, leave a note on the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] (or my talk) so that an admin can delete the redirect and move the page with its history intact. :) --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:22, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

:::I'll leave it as it is now, since there were very few other contributors, but if you find time to do it, then you're most welcome to undo my changes and make a proper redirect. I wont be adding to the books the next couple of days. --[[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 10:38, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

::::OK, will do. You made no other changes? If you make any, do it at the old location, so they get moved with the rest :). I'll move it at lunchtime (5-6 hours from now). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:51, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

::::Hi again Johnny - from what you write it sounds like it needs an admin to do the move correctly. If I can do it myself i'll do it - just let me know! thanx /[[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 19:55, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

:::::You don't usually need an admin to move correctly, but for some reason there was already a redirect where you were moving it to, and the redirect page needed to be deleted before pagemove could work. I redid the moves for [[Nanotechnology]] and [[Microtechnology]]... are there any others? 
:::::BTW, see the talk page for nanotechnology... there was an IP edit that altered the format, and I wasn't sure whether to put it back in so I copied it to the talk.
:::::Good luck with your project! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:33, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
::::: - thanks - so far theres only those two pages. I think we'll start chopping it into smaller sections on individual pages now. [[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 15:06, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

::::::Cool :). If you need to move something and there's a redirect there, let me know and I'll delete it for ya. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:33, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette|Wikibooks gazette home]] | [[Wikibooks talk:Wikibooks gazette|Discuss]] | [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Bulletin board]] | [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|Subscription list]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource. 

&lt;center&gt;[[User:The Staff|The Staff]]&lt;br&gt;04:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)&lt;/center&gt;

==If you have a moment to vote==
There are two administrators (HerbyThyme and myself) currently asking for checkuser rights. Checkuser is a tool used to help clean up and discourage vandalism on wikibooks, allowing us to block IP addresses that are used by vandals, while at the same time letting us be sure we don't accidentally block a good contributor who might be sharing that IP address. 

The place to vote is [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship#Requests_for_CheckUser_rights]] (for Herby) and [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship#Nominations_for_CheckUser_rights]] (for me). Unlike most tool requests, Checkuser is required to have a minimum of 25 votes, since this tool is given by Wikimedia stewards, rather than local users. Thanks for contributing to Wikibooks! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Yellow tang- ==
Physical description: 
Varing in size from 1/4&quot; to 8&quot;, bright yellow fins and body are the trademarks of the yellow tang. Small, tightly packed scales on the body give the fish a velvety appearance. The sharp spines near the tail are used for defense and as an anchor in the rocks when sleeping. 

General information:  

The yellow tang is a grazing fish with a diet of almost anything that is green (ie. alge, grass, lettuce...). It is not unheard of for the fish to eat meat. Even though this fish is generally an herbivore the tang has been known to eat shrimp and other smaller animals. This varying diet may even include excrements from other fish. This small fish is very territorial; especially in the presence of another tang fish. The yellow tang is also in the sergeant fish family.  

The tang fish does not require a lot of space in which to live. But please take in mind when using the tang in an aquarium that it needs a constant flow of water. Not much but some, it helps the fish stay in shape and keeps the fish in good health.

Special anatomical, physiological or behavioral adaptations:  

The short snout has evolved for the specialized task of grazing on algae which grows on rocks. The mouth and surrounding skin has toughened to withstand the impact with the rough reef surface. Like other fish in the sergeant fish family they have a number of small spines protruding near their tail. The spines near their tail is how they got their name, also commonly called the scalpel fish. As mentioned above the spines on the tail serve dual purposes as a means of defence and as an anchor while sleeping

Comments about the yellow tang of the Fort Worth Zoo:

This has become a very popular fish in aquariums as of late. There is only one other tang that is more popular, the purple tang. They are eazy fish to take care of and will add plenty of color to any environment. But anyone who wants to add the tang to their aquarium should be forewarned that the tang is prone to ich. An external parasite that can eventually kill the fish. Almost every tang contracts this parasite at one time or another.
  
Personal Observations:  

This seems to be a calm fish in regards to others in my observations, except to other tangs. They also are extremely quick and dart from place to place, never hovering in one place too long; at least the males always seem to keep moving. Their striking color makes them a fun and interesting fish to watch. It has also been said that people who own aquariums with colorful fish lead less stressful lives.

==Forms of RIT==
*'''Zevalin''' - ibritumomab, Y-90 labeled murine antibody. Pure beta emitter, 64 hr half life.
*'''Bexxar''' - tositumomab, I-131 labeled murine antibody, beta and gamma, 8 day half life. Dose is based on individual patient dosimetry (pharmacokinetics).

'''Rituxan''' - rituxumab, unlabeled ''chimeric'' anti-CD20 antibody.

==Administration==
===Bexxar===
'''''Steps:'''''
*'''Dosimetric step''' - infusion of unlabled antibody (tositumomab, not rituxumab, 450 mg) followed by 5 mCi dose of I-131-tositumomab.
*Whole body imaging on Day 0 (day of dosimetric step), day 2-4, and day 6 or 7. If biodistribution is acceptable, then calculate patient specific dose to deliver 75 cGy (or 65 cGy if plts 100,000-150,000). 
*&lt;br&gt;'''Therapeutic step''' - 7-14 days after dosimetric step. 2nd infusion of unlabeled antibody followed by patient-specific dose of I-131-tositumomab to deliver 65-75 cGy total body dose.

'''''Patient selection:'''''
*Should not be administered to patients with &gt;25% bone marrow involvement and/or impaired bone marrow reserve.
*Caution should be exercised in patients with impaired renal function.
*Do not administer if there is altered biodistribution (see below).

'''''Thyroid protection:'''''
&lt;br&gt;Begin the day prior to dosimetric step. Continue through 14 days after therapeutic dose. 


'''''Dosimetry:'''''
&lt;br&gt;Whole body images obtained with gamma camera every 3 days to determine total body residence time (TBRT), reflecting clearance of the radioisotope.  Count 1 is within an hour of the infusion of the dosimetric dose; Count 2 is 2-4 days after dosimetric dose. 
&lt;br&gt;Assess whole body images for Counts 1 and 2 (and optionally Count 3) to see if there is altered biodistribution. If there is altered biodistribution based on the images or the TBRT, then Bexxar should not be administered.
&lt;br&gt;'''Expected biodistribution:''' 1st Image: most of the activity is in the blood pool (heart and major vessels), and uptake in the normal liver and spleen is less than the heart. On 2nd and 3rd images, blood pool activity and liver activity decreases. Uptake by thyroid, kidney, urinary bladder, and minimal lung uptake.
&lt;br&gt;'''Altered biodistribution: '''
*''1st image:'' if blood pool is not visualized or if there is diffuse, intense uptake in the liver and/or spleen or if there is a suggestion of urinary obstruction. If there is diffuse lung uptake greater than that of the blood pool. 
*''2nd and 3rd images:'' urinary obstruction or diffuse lung uptake greater than that of blood pool.
*TBRT &lt;50 hrs or &gt;150 hrs

'''''Dose adjustments:'''''
&lt;br&gt;For platelet count &gt;= 150,000, total body dose is 75 cGy. For platelets 100,000-150,000, total body dose is 65 cGy. 
&lt;br&gt;For obese patients (weight &gt; 137% of ideal body weight), dose should be based on 137% of their lean body weight.

===Treatment===

'''''For recurrence:'''''
*'''U. Washington''' - PMID 17312330, '''2007''' &amp;mdash; &quot;High-Dose [131I]Tositumomab (anti-CD20) Radioimmunotherapy and Autologous Hematopoietic Stem-Cell Transplantation for Adults ≥ 60 Years Old With Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Lymphoma.&quot; Gopal AK et al. J Clin Oncol. 2007 Apr 10;25(11):1396-402.
**24 pts. Pts older &gt; 60 yrs, relapsed B-cell NHL (s/p median of 4 prior regimens). Rituxan + Bexxar followed by ASCT. 
**Median f/u 2.9 yrs. 3-yr OS and PFS 59% and 51%. 2 pts with grade 4 hematologic toxicity.
**Conclusion: safe and effective treatment for older adults

      <text xml:space="preserve">Co-ordinates are a way of describing position. In two dimensions, positions are given in two perpendicular directions, ''x'' and ''y''.

==Straight lines==

A straight line has a fixed gradient. The gradient of a line and its y intercept are the two main pieces of information that distinguish one line from another.

===Equations of a straight line===

The most common form of a straight line is &lt;math&gt;y=mx + c&lt;/math&gt;. The m is the gradient of the line, and the c is where the line intercepts the y-axis. When c is 0, the line passes through the origin.

Other forms of the equation are &lt;math&gt;x = a&lt;/math&gt;, used for vertical lines of infinte gradient, &lt;math&gt;y = b&lt;/math&gt;, used for horizontal lines with 0 gradient, and &lt;math&gt;px + qy + r = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which is often used for some lines as a neater way of writing the equation.

====Finding the equation of a straight line====

You may need to find the equation of a straight line, and only given the co-ordinates of one point on the line and the gradient of the line. The single point can be taken as &lt;math&gt;({x_1}, {y_1})&lt;/math&gt;, and the co-ordinates and the gradient can be substituted in the formula &lt;math&gt;y-{y_1} = m(x-{x_1})&lt;/math&gt;. Then it is simply a case of rearranging the formula into the form &lt;math&gt;y=mx + c&lt;/math&gt;.

You may only be given two points, &lt;math&gt;({x_1}, {y_1})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;({x_2}, {y_2})&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, use the formula &lt;math&gt;m = \frac {{y_2} - {y_1}} {{x_2} - {x_1}}&lt;/math&gt; to find the gradient and then use the method above.

===Gradient of a line===

The steepness of a line can be measured by its gradient, which is the increase in the ''y'' direction divided by the increase in the ''x'' direction. The letter ''m'' is used to denote the gradient.

&lt;math&gt;m=\frac {y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}&lt;/math&gt;

====Parallel and perpendicular lines====

With the gradients of two lines, you can tell if they are parallel, perpendicular, or neither.
A pair of lines are parallel if their gradients are equal, &lt;math&gt;m_1=m_2&lt;/math&gt;.
A pair of lines are perpendicular if the product of their gradients is -1, &lt;math&gt;m_1 \times m_2=-1&lt;/math&gt;

===Distance between two points===

Using the co-ordinates of two points, it is possible to calculate the distance between them using Pythagoras' theorem.

The distance between any two points A&lt;math&gt;({x_1},{y_1})&lt;/math&gt; and B&lt;math&gt;({x_2},{y_2})&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Mid-point of a line===

When the co-ordinate of two points are known, the mid-point is the point halfway between those points. For any two points A&lt;math&gt;({x_1},{y_1})&lt;/math&gt; and B&lt;math&gt;({x_2},{y_2})&lt;/math&gt;, the co-ordinates of the mid-point of AB can be found by &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {{x_1} + {x_2}}{2}, \frac {{y_1} + {y_2}}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Intersection of lines===

Any two lines will meet at a point, as long as they are not parallel. You can find the point of intersection simply by solving the two [[../Equations#Simultaneous_equations|equations simultaneously]]. The lines will intersect at one distinct point (if a solution to their equation exists) or will not intersect at all (if they are parallel). A curve can however intersect a line or another curve at multiple points.

==Curves==

To sketch a graph of a curve, all you need to know is the general shape of the curve and other important pieces of information such as the x and y intercepts and the points of any maxima and minima.

===Curves in the form &lt;math&gt;y=x^n&lt;/math&gt;===

Here are the graphs for the curves &lt;math&gt;y=x^1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y=x^3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=x^4&lt;/math&gt;:

(Need to draw those later, just simple b&amp;w curve sketches for each curve)

Notice how the odd powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; all share the same general shape, moving from bottom-left to top-right, and how all the even powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; share the same &quot;bucket&quot; shaped curve.

===Curves in the form &lt;math&gt;y=\frac {1} {x^n}&lt;/math&gt;===

Just like earlier, curves with an even powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; all have the same general shape, and those with odd powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; share another general shape.

(Images here)

All curves in this form do not have a value for &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {0}&lt;/math&gt; is undefined. There are '''asymptotes''' on both the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis, where the curve moves towards increasingly slowly but will never actually touch.

===Intersection of lines and curves===

When a line intersects with a curve, it is possible to find the points of intersection by substituting the equation of the line into the equation of the curve. If the line is in the form &lt;math&gt;y = mx + c&lt;/math&gt;, then you can replace any instances of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;mx + c&lt;/math&gt;, and then expand the equation out and then [[../Equations|factorise]] the resulting quadratic.

===Intersection of curves===

The same method can be used as for a line and a curve. However, it will only work in simple cases. When an algebraic method fails, you will need to resort to a graphical or [[A-level Mathematics (MEI)/C3/Numerical Methods|Numerical Method]]. In the exam, you will only be required to use algebraic methods.

==The circle==

The circle is defined as the path of all the points at a fixed distance from a single point. The single point is the centre of the circle and the fixed distance is it's radius. This definition is the basis of the equation of the circle.

===Equation of the circle===

The equation of the circle is &lt;math&gt;{x^2} + {y^2} = r^2&lt;/math&gt; for a circle center (0,0) and radius r, and &lt;math&gt;{(x-a)^2} + {(y-b)^2} = r^2&lt;/math&gt; for a circle centre (a,b) and radius r.

So, for example, a circle with the equation &lt;math&gt;{(x+2)^2} + {(y-3)^2} = 25&lt;/math&gt; would have centre (-2,3) and radius 5.

===Circle geometry===

When presented with a problem, it may appear at first that there is not enough information given to you. However, there are some facts that will help you spot right angles in relation to a circle.

*The angle in a semi-circle is a right angle
*The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord
*The tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius through that point

==Allgemein==

Whew... I just thought I'd write some dialogue in real everyday language and explain quickly afterwards, just to avoid the typical constructed textbook phrases. It turns out that basic everyday language is way more complicated than I thought ;-) The chapter is quite a bit longer than I planned... I also added some trivia, because I feel if you can understand things or learn weird facts along the way this helps a lot to memorize stuff.

What do you think? Should we strip the phrases down, so they really become very basic stuff? I wouldn't like to, because this is just the way people ARE talking... Maybe it is not necessary to really explain everything, but have the learner accept some quirks and maybe understand them later? Or separating the important stuff from the trivia?

I think grouping the explanations by topic would help clear things up a lot, e.g. &quot;reflexive verbs&quot;, &quot;contracted pronouns&quot; &quot;math&quot; and maybe even &quot;filler phrases&quot;. Maybe I'll get around to do this one of these days...

[[User:Thamane|Thamane]] 21:40, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

For this lesson for school, we are just going to get to the tip of the iceberg, we will just be doing very common thing of school, we will revise to a very complete, very detailed, very long, and really different school lesson. and don't enter reflexive verbs, but reflexives are okay and don't put all of the contracted pronouns, however math sound good in this section. And welcome to the German wikibook, BTW I think we should complete lesson 5 before heading foreward. --[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 22:08, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

Also I'm going to short and serptate out &quot;Und Satz fur Satz...&quot; some thing are too diffcult, like the past tense, we aren't introducing till' Level 2. --[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 22:24, 4 April 2006 (UTC)


Sorry, but I have a question concerning this lesson. Was is your purpose that the English translations are so bad?? There are so many grammatically mistakes. e.g. &quot;have you the tasks done&quot; --[[User:SteffiB|SteffiB]] 20:09, 13 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and welcome. I see you are becoming very active in the German Wikibook, we should get a lesson plan together, becuase even though the Lesson 6 info you added is great, it needs to be reformed, so in looks like the other lessons. So, what to you think? --[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 22:13, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

I joined WikiBooks due to my interest in the proposed Wikiversity project; Wikiversity is a wonderful idea, and I would be more than happy to help contribute to the project as both a student and a contributor (and, in about a year, a teacher, perhaps.) I am currently reading about how to contribute to the project aside from just editing and would be grateful for any helpful information anyone out there might give me.

Some of my hobbies include:
*Bonsai
*Baking
*Programming
*Trombone
*Tabla
*Harmonica
*Mixing (drinks, that is)</text>

|21:2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:3 Simon Peter says unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with you. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:4 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;

|21:5 Then Jesus says unto them, Children, have all of you any ''food''? They answered him, No.
|for eating [plus bread]&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;pi;&amp;rho;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigma;&amp;phi;&amp;alpha;&amp;gamma;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/b&gt; (4371)
|5 He called to them. &quot;My boys,&quot; He said, &quot;have you any food there?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; they answered.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:6 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and all of you shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved says unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:8 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
|&amp;nbsp;

|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:9 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a ''fire of coals'' there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.

|9 As soon as they landed, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish broiling on it, and bread on the side.

|-
|21:10 Jesus says unto them, Bring of the fish which all of you have now caught.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:12 Jesus says unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.
|&amp;nbsp;

|21:13 Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.

|21:14 This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:15 So when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these? He says unto him, Yea, Lord; you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my lambs.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:16 He says to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He says unto him, Yea, Lord; you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my sheep.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:17 He says unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Love you me? And he said unto him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus says unto him, Feed my sheep.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:18 Verily, verily, I say unto you, When you were young, you gird yourself, and walked where you would: but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you where you would not.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:19 This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he says unto him, Follow me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|21:20 Then Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays you?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cannabis==
I think we should rename this page to Cannabis. This would bring it in line with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_%28drug%29 Wikipedia article] (which is also called Cannabis). Furthermore, &quot;cannabis&quot; has become the preferred term for many, because of the negative connotations of the term &quot;marijuana&quot;, especially its racist usage in the past to help criminalize it. (The &quot;marijuana&quot; term was originally used in the US by newspapers to cause fear of a &quot;demon drug from Mexico&quot; in the populace.)

== Remove/Rewrite Myths section ==

Does the &quot;Myths&quot; section need to exist in its current form?  First of all it is very unprofessional and reads like a forum reply: &quot;Let's bust some myths about marijuana here&quot;.

Secondly, the arguments it presents are mostly regarding the ''legality'' of marijuana: &quot;its [sic] up to the user&quot;.  Those arguments don't relate to the &quot;facts&quot; from freevibe.com.  e.g. &quot;It's Unsafe&quot; gets the reply &quot;its up to the user&quot;.  That doesn't refute the argument, it just claims it should be legal.  The &quot;facts&quot; seem to be arguing that you ''shouldn't'' smoke pot, not that it should be illegal.

Finally, a number of claims are made without any facts: &quot;And when is 'the last year' in that study? How many people did they survey? Did they just choose the typical looking stoners to make the results come out how they wanted?&quot;  This doesn't refute anything, it just claims the studies ''could'' be wrong without offering any evidence.  (Floydian[?] then argues that &quot;Not all marijuana users are loners, in fact most aren't&quot; without offering any evidence of his own.)

I vote it be removed or rewritten.

I agree with both comments.
The opening section on Description was plagiarized from a site called Erowid:http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_basics.shtml

The author has clearly then interpreted information from this site and created their own conjecture without any form of research citation to support their postulations.
The original Wikipedia document on Cannabis (cited above)is far more professional and presents a thorough understanding the subject.

I would go further and recommend the removal of this document as it comes across as a personal opinion and I now wonder if the author sought permission from Erowid to reproduce the information as no citation refers.

&quot;Hemp is renewable and can be used to make paper and textiles. (Citation needed)&quot;

I don't understand why this one needs citation... Let's use logic.

1) Plants are renewable. They procreate.
2) Hemp clothing exists.
3) Hemp paper exists (And for reasons only the US knows, is not used in place of cutting trees down)

Therefore by combining 1, 2 and 3, we can conclude:
Hemp is renewable and can be used to make paper and textiles</text>

Infection is an unfriendly encounter with a foreign organism.  Lest we forget we live in harmony with many mico-organisms and one might even say that it is well that they occupy the niches they do lest a less pleasant neighbor move in.  This is not to say that our normal flora are in all cases benign, but they tend to be opportunistic about it, so they keep our immune system on its toes.  It is probably best after all that our immune mechanisms be exercised on a regular basis.  

Acute infection may do us in and in some cases due entirely to the toxic products of the infecting organism.  In other cases it is the immune response to the infection that can be nearly as lethal as seems to be the case it seems with H5N1 strain of influenza or birdflu.  

As orthopedic surgeons we confront a number of different types of infection scenarios.  First and foremost we are focused on avoiding infection which in the absence of specific measures of anti-sepsis would make much of what we do impractical, so it behooves us to do this optimally.

We are also asked to perform therapeutic interventions in the setting of established musculoskeletal infections and one of the most anxiety provoking is the soft tissue infection which we call necrotizing fasciitis also known more commonly by the general surgeons as synergistic gangrene. One can hardly imagine a more nefarious enemy, seemingly lurking everywhere and at the least provocation it seems producing a rapidly progressive infection which can kill an otherwise healthy human in a matter of hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To use the library builder you have to have a very good understanding of GML - the programming language of Game Maker. Not many people know it - but the libraries are simply made up of Game Maker code. All you are doing when dragging and dropping is putting small chunks of GML into the program, but it is represented by icons. To make your own library, you provide images, coding for the tab and sometimes initiation code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{rejected}}

An '''Ad hoc administration committee''' of Wikibooks will consist of 3 administrators assembled for the purpose of enforcing policies. The committee is &quot;ad hoc&quot; in the sense that it will be formed in response to specific issues.

==Role==

To oversee Wikibooks policies and guidelines and provide final decisions on the interpretation and enactment of enforced policies. To oversee and adjudicate voting procedures.

==Activities that should precede forming the committee==

The party who spots an infringement of an enforced policy should:

* Communicate with the offending party, informing them of the infringement and asking them to correct it. The infringement should be noted on the discussion page of the appropriate article.
* After a negative response, or 2 days, they may revert or remove the offending item.

If these measures do not work then an administrator should be contacted with the following information supplied:

* The article, discussion or talk page involved.
* The enforced policy that has been infringed.
* The nature of the infringement.

==Decision taking==

The committee will take decisions on the basis of a majority vote.

==Forming the committee==

Any administrator may call an ad hoc committee into being to address a specific issue of policy enforcement. Any three administrators may form the committee. Users may request an administrator to call a committee, upon receiving such a request the administrator must either call the committee or ask another administrator to do so.</text>

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
The Portuguese language uses the Latin (Western) alphabet now with the letters k, w, and y.
They use six different '''diacritics''' to change the sounds that the letters make in words.  Here are the different letters that are changed by diacritics: '''á, â, ã, à, ç, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú, '''.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|diacritic|a mark added to a letter to change the way it is pronounced.}}

==How many people speak this language?==

About two hundred and fifty million people speak Portuguese as their native language. It is the 5th most spoken language of the world. It is one of the official languages of the European Union and Mercosul.

==Where is this language spoken?==

[[Image:Lusophoneworld.png|700px]]

Portuguese is spoken all over the world.  Most people in Portugal and Brazil speak Portuguese as their first language.  It is the official language of [[Wikijunior:Europe/Portugal|Portugal]], [[Wikijunior:South America/Brazil|Brazil]], East Timor, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Mozambique and Equatorial Guinea.  A few hundred years ago Portugal [[w:Portuguese discoveries|discovered]], '''colonized''' and laid claim to many regions around the world.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|colonize|to claim, populate and govern new land.}} 


Portuguese colonization was distinct from other colonizing nations due to the small size of the nation (territory/population). The colonization process was a direct result of nautical exploration for commerce and trade routes and the goal to establish claims (see [[w:Padrão|Padrão]]), more than a pressure to expand population. A significative part of the population necessary to maintain the new territorial claims were in fact not even of Portuguese origin, Galegos (from [[w:Galicia (Spain)|Galicia - Spain]]) and Flemengos ([[w:Flemish people|Flemish people]]) were, especially in the earlier stages of expansion, of great importance to the crown. For similar reasons there was also a great level of interbreeding with locals and population movement from colony to colony, more than any other European nation.

[[File:The Portuguese Empire.png|700px]]

As can be seen above the Portuguese [[w:Portuguese Empire|Império Ultramarino]] (overseas empire) included Brazil, countries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. It   was the longest-lived modern European colonial empire and the first global empire in history. Portuguese settlers (and settlers from other nations under license from Portugal) went to the new colonies, established the government and business, ruling over any existing indigenous populations. The new colonies continued to speak Portuguese and indigenous were required to learn the language in order to interact with the state representatives.  Portuguese was often established as a common language on ethnically distinct regions that have several local dialects (i.e.: Angola and Guinea-Bissau) and this practice continues after their independence or as a way to preserve Historico-cultural distinction like in East Timor.  Although Portuguese is not the official language in [[w:Goa|Goa (India)]] and [[w:Macao|Macao (China)]] it is still spoken by minorities on those regions and the language also had a deep influence in nations that it entered in contact, for instance Portuguese were the first Europeans to reach Japan and one of the many legacies was the adoption of some [[w:Japanese words of Portuguese origin|Portuguese language into Japanese]].

The spoken language of [[w:Galicia (Spain)|Galiza]], an autonomous community in northwest Spain, is [[w:Galician language|Galego]], closely related to Portuguese.  (In medieval times, Galego and Portuguese were a single language.)

[[w:Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP)]] formed by Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique  and São Tomé and Príncipe and Equatorial Guinea, part of the [[w:Community of Portuguese Language Countries|Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP)]] an the intergovernmental organization  for friendship among lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) nations where Portuguese is an official language. 

There are also large communities of Portuguese speaking people in other parts of the world such as the United States, [[Wikijunior:Europe/Andorra|Andorra]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/France|France]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], Jersey, Namibia, Venezuela, and South Africa. Portuguese is becoming one of the main languages in Southern Africa, where it is also taught in Namibia and South Africa.

Portuguese-based Creole is also spoken in different parts of the world. These include India, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

==What is the history of this language?==

It is one of many descendants of Latin (Ibero-Roman group). All of these languages split from Latin long ago.  During the Middle Ages the Latin in North Portugal and Galicia (northwestern Spain) slowly became a language called Galician-Portuguese. Galician-Portuguese was a mix of Latin and some of the local pré-Roman languages: Celt, Lusitanian. It also contains influences from the invaders of the Roman Empire: Vandals, Visigoths and later Arabic invaders from northern Africa (the Moors), even French due to cultural relations and English due to economical relations have enriched the language. The discoveries age enriched Portuguese language by giving lots of words from Africa, Asia and America.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==

*Luís de Camões (Portuguese, 1524 – 1580): considered by some the greatest poet of the Portuguese language.
*Machado de Assis (Brazilian, 1839 – 1908): widely regarded as the most important writer of Brazilian literature.
*Fernando Pessoa (Portuguese, 1888 – 1935): another great Portuguese poet.
*Cecília Meireles (Brazilian, 1901 – 1964): Modernist poet.
*José Saramago (Portuguese, 1922 – 2010): Awarded Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998. 
*Jose Cardoso Pires (Portuguese, 1925 – 1998): author of short stories, novels, plays, and political satire.
*Nélida Piñon (Brazilian, 1937 – present): First woman to win the prestigious Juan Rulfo literary prize, awarded annually to a leading Latin American, Caribbean, or Iberian writer.
*Paulo Coelho (Brazilian, 1947 – present)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Uncanonical Calculation Order?==
Every other source I've read about the abacus recommends working left to right. That is, beads higher in value before beads lower in value (hundreds before tens, tens before ones).

It's also odd that the addition instructions specify right to left, while for subtraction it is left to right.
::I think its because in multiplication you work from right to left. Possibly because you're using the full abacus?

==Other Abacus Types?==
This page appears to assume an abacus with a five-and-two arrangement, rather than the more modern four-and-one. Would it make sense to adjust it, and if not, at least acknowledge how one abacus can differ from another?
:I think we should teach using both kinds and the reader should choose what they want to study. The two most prevalent are the 5-and-2-beaded Chinese abacus (suanpan) and the 4-and-1-beaded Japanese abacus (soroban) which was derived from the Chinese version. There's even a 10-beaded Russian abacus and an Incan abacus was recently discovered that's based on knotted ropes, but those can probably wait.

==Templates?==
Anyone up for making snazzy templates like the [[Chess]] Wikibook? Look at the following board setup:
 {{Chess diagram|=
 |tleft
 |
 |=
 8 |xx|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |=
7 |  |xx|  |  |xx|  |  |xx|=
6 |  |  |xx|  |xx|  |xx|  |=
5 |  |  |  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |=
4 |xx|xx|xx|xx|ql|xx|xx|xx|=
3 |  |  |  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |=
2 |  |  |xx|  |xx|  |xx|  |=
1 |  |xx|  |  |xx|  |  |xx|=
   a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h
|}}
{{-}}
Now look at the wiki-code for it:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Chess diagram|=
|tleft
|
|=
8 |xx|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |=
7 |  |xx|  |  |xx|  |  |xx|=
6 |  |  |xx|  |xx|  |xx|  |=
5 |  |  |  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |=
4 |xx|xx|xx|xx|ql|xx|xx|xx|=
3 |  |  |  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |=
2 |  |  |xx|  |xx|  |xx|  |=
1 |  |xx|  |  |xx|  |  |xx|=
   a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h
|}}
{{-}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
This format could quickly be translated into easily-altered images of all the types of abaci out there. Just awesome as I think about it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Abration tone ==
== Albumen Prints  ==
A process using egg whites, salt and silver nitrate. Popular in the mid to late 1800s.

== Anthotype ==
A process of making an emulsion from crushing light sensitive flower petals and vegetables.

== Argyrotypes ==
== Bromoils ==

Photographic images printed in pure gold. Both develop out and print out processes exist.

'''Develop Out'''

Robert Hunt described a develop-out chrysotype process in his book, ''A Manual of Photography'', in the 1840s. The germane extract can be read at this link: http://bookdome.com/arts/Manual-Photography/Section-II-Chrysotype.html.

Hunt's essential formula is the exposure of paper coated with ammonium ferric citrate until an extremely faint image appears. The paper is then washed in a solution of gold chloride he describes as &quot;about the colour of sherry wine.&quot;

Terry King much more recently announced the Chyrsotype Rex process. Mr. King has kept the formula proprietary, but it appears to be similar to Mr. Hunt's, possibly substituting ferric oxalate for the ammonium ferric citrate and requiring an 8% solution of gold chloride. King's website is http://www.hands-on-pictures.com.

'''Print Out'''

In 2012 Richard Eugene Puckett announced the Texas Chrysotype process. Puckett adds a small volume of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to ammonium ferric oxalate to create a solution of ammonium ferric-ferrous oxalate. His formula specifies a 10% solution of gold chloride be mixed with the ammonium ferric-ferrous oxalate at a usual ratio of 3 parts ammonium ferric-ferrous oxalate to 4 parts gold. The image prints out fully on dry paper and requires no humidification or development. Recommended papers are Arches Platine, Clearprint 1000H vellum, and any number of hot-pressed water color papers heavily sized with 3% arrowroot starch. 

The Texas Chrysotype is not only the first dry print-out process for gold, but it is the first that yields gray-scale pictorial images rendering 9 to 11 or more stops with extremely fine to fine grain. Puckett has published several chryostype videos on youtube, including his presentation at the 2013 Alternative Photographic International Symposium in Santa Fe, New Mexico. His website is http://www.texaschrysotype.com.

== Polaroid Emulstion Lifts ==
The emulsion lift is a Polaroid print that is soaked in hot water until the emulsion layer comes off the back of the Polaroid, the image is then transferred to a new surface.
== Polaroid image transfer process ==
The Polaroid development process is interrupted. Then the Polaroid's dyes are transferred to another surface.
The desired image is taken with Polaroid film and after the 1st 12 seconds or so the emulsion is removed from the paper backing.  Durning this time 100 lb or 90 lb watercolor paper has been soaked in water.  Then the emulsion and the watercolor paper are joined together.  You roll with a brayer 10 times in one direction and then 10 times in the opposite direction to make sure that you do not get air bubbles.  When finished remove the emulsion and you will have the imaged transferred to the paper.  Let dry.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
[[Image:Urdu_alphabets.png|left|thumb|200px|The Urdū alphabet, with names in the Devanāgarī and Latin alphabets]]
Urdu is written in the Perso-Arabic Script, and has many letters common with Arabic and Persian. It is written from right to left. However, Urdu is often written in the Latin alphabet in text messaging and e-mails.

==How many people speak this language?==
There are estimated to be about 60 million '''native speakers''' of Urdu and an additional 40 million people who can speak it as a '''secondary language'''.  It is also closely related to the language [[../Hindi|Hindi]], and speakers of the everyday forms of the languages can usually understand each other.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|native speaker|someone who learned to speak a language as a child.}}

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|secondary language|any language that a person learns to speak after the first language that they learned at home.}}

==Where is this language spoken?==
Urdu is widely spoken in Pakistan and India, though it also has large number of speakers in the Middle East, United Kingdom, and North America.

==What is the history of this language?==
Urdu is believed to have evolved from contact between the local Indo-Aryan (prakrith, a localized form of Sanskrit) speaking population and the people of the Persian/Arabic speaking nations who invaded and ruled the Indian sub-continent for almost 1000 years since the attacks of Ghaznavi in early 10th Century.  Urdu evolved in the Indian sub-continent from various local dialects such as Prakrit and Brij Bhasha with outside influences from the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish languages.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
Urdu is rich in both prose and poetry. Some famous poets who wrote in Urdu are Allama Muhammad Iqbal, Mirza Ghalib, Mir Taqi Mir, and Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Allama Muhammad Iqbal is recognized as the national poet of Pakistan.[[File:Iqbal.jpg|right|100px|thumb|National poet of Pakistan, Muhammad Iqbal]]

==Internationalization==
===Keep the Simplified/Traditional Versions in Sync===
The Chinese Wikibook has two identical versions; [[Chinese|Simplified]] and [[Chinese (Mandarin)/Traditional|Traditional]]. This is done to unclutter the textbook and to meet the needs of people either interested in the characters used in China or used in Taiwan. However, whenever a change is made in one version, it is not automatically carried over, so periodic checks must be made to ensure that the two remain in sync. This sometimes involves translating from one script to the other, but often only involves copying formatting changes.

===Translate Pages===
Currently, the English version is the most developed of the Chinese Wikibooks. If you know another language, please check if a Chinese book is started in that language and compare it to this one. You can make changes to their content based on ideas gained here, or do a wholesale translation of this textbook into the target language. Since the Chinese can stay the same across languages, a lot of work can be saved in this way. Translation efforts have been started in the following languages:

*[http://it.wikibooks.org/wiki/Corso_di_cinese/Indice Italiano]
*[http://pl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chiński Polski]
*[http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chino Español]

Even if a translation has been done at one time, it may have been incomplete or not been updated to reflect recent changes on the English site. Please work to keep them current. If you can only do a partial translation, leave a note to later contributors linking back to your source (a good candidate for using [[Help:Templates|Templates]]).
{{clear}}

===Add InterWiki Links===
If you can't translate pages, but know enough of a language to locate the corresponding Chinese Wikibook, you can make Interwiki links. You can see them on the Wikibooks Sidebar listed under &quot;in other languages&quot; when available. They are typically placed at the very end of a page using a simple format. Here is the list used for the Chinese TOC page:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[it:Corso di cinese/Indice]]
[[pl:Chiński]]
[[es:Chino]]
&lt;!-- 在以上的课程里中文是一样的，
在以下的课程里中文是不同的 --&gt;
[[fr:Enseignement du chinois]]
[[de:Chinesisch]]
[[ja:中国語]]
[[nl:Mandarijn]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The ones listed above the divider are translations of this book. The ones below are of their own design. In addition to the main page, Lesson pages, Stroke Order pages and anything else can be interwikied as long as the content is the same.

==Stroke Order Images==
[[Image:不-red.png|right|thumb|90px|Black to red fade]]
[[Image:永-order.gif|left|thumb|100px|Gif animations]]
There is [[commons:Commons:CJK_stroke_order_project|a project on Wikicommons]] to upload images and animations of the stroke order for characters. There are [[commons:commons:CJK_stroke_order:Tutorials|directions on how to contribute]]. It's easy with the use of some free programs and can be done even with only a basic understanding of Chinese. Please contribute so that we'll have a standardized reference for our Wikibook users. 

Have a look at the stroke order pages for each lesson to see what our immediate needs are:
&lt;center&gt;[[Chinese/Lesson 1/Stroke Order|Lesson 1]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[Chinese/Lesson 2/Stroke Order|Lesson 2]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[Chinese/Lesson 3/Stroke Order|Lesson 3]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

==Sound Samples==
[[Image:Gnome-speakernotes.png|right]]
With a microphone and a read through the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia/Recording_guidelines recording guidelines] for the Spoken Wikipedia you can contribute audio examples. Sound samples are particularly important for beginners, especially ones who are studying alone with no teacher or native speaker on hand. 

You can see what has been uploaded so far at [[commons:Category:Chinese pronunciation|Category:Chinese pronunciation]]. [[commons:user:Peter Isotalo|Peter Isotalo]] started, but a native speaker would be best.

      <comment>/* Using RDoc to Generate Usage Output */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ruby Programming/TopNav|prev=Unit testing|next=RubyGems}}

The standard Ruby library provides a tool for generating documentation from [[w:Self documenting code|self documenting code]] called [http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/index.html RubyDoc] or RDoc for short.  Though it's part of the standard library, RDoc isn't a file you &lt;tt&gt;require&lt;/tt&gt; to use.  Instead it consists of  a command-line program called &lt;tt&gt;rdoc&lt;/tt&gt; and a library for parsing specially-formatted comments out of Ruby and C code.

== A Simple Example ==

Here are the contents of the file &lt;tt&gt;simpleNumber.rb&lt;/tt&gt; which contains a class &lt;tt&gt;SimpleNumber&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
# This file is called simpleNumber.rb
# It contains the class SimpleNumber

class SimpleNumber

  def initialize( num )
    raise if !num.is_a?(Numeric)
    @x = num
  end

  def add( y )
    @x + y
  end

  def multiply( y )
    @x * y
  end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Just to get going, run &lt;tt&gt;rdoc&lt;/tt&gt; on this file

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt; rdoc simpleNumber.rb

                    simpleNumber.rb: c...
Generating HTML...

Files:   1
Classes: 1
Modules: 0
Methods: 3
Elapsed: 0.426s
&lt;/pre&gt;

A quick look around reveals &lt;tt&gt;rdoc&lt;/tt&gt; has created a new directory called &lt;tt&gt;doc/&lt;/tt&gt;.  It contains quite a few files (given such a simple class!)

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt; ls doc/
classes      files                fr_file_index.html    index.html
created.rid  fr_class_index.html  fr_method_index.html  rdoc-style.css
&lt;/pre&gt;

Open the file &lt;tt&gt;doc/index.html&lt;/tt&gt; in a web browser and find

[[Image:Rubydoc1.png|The RubyDoc output from simpleNumber.rb]]

What has RDoc done?  First, it has scanned the given file (shown in the upper left pane).  The middle pane lists all of the classes in &lt;tt&gt;simpleNumber.rb&lt;/tt&gt;, and the right panel gives all of the methods in SimpleNumber.  In this case the lower panel is showing the summary information for the file &lt;tt&gt;simpleNumber.rb&lt;/tt&gt; which has been extracted from the top-level comment in the file.  Once we select either a class or a function it will show more particular information.

== Handling Multiple Files ==

Any directories included on the command line will be searched for Ruby files (with an &lt;tt&gt;.rb&lt;/tt&gt;  or &lt;tt&gt;.rbw&lt;/tt&gt; extension) and C files (with a &lt;tt&gt;.c&lt;/tt&gt; extension).  rdoc will search recursively, which makes it convenient for documenting large trees of code.  If no source files are specified, RubyDoc will start searching with the current directory.  The output is always generated in a directory &lt;tt&gt;doc/&lt;/tt&gt; under the current location.

Any files which aren't recognized as Ruby or C are not parsed by default, but can be included as command-line arguments to rdoc.  In this case they are treated as SimpleMarkup (see below) -- generally speaking they will just be browsable as plain text files in the HTML documention.

== Formatting for RDoc ==

RDoc uses a formatting system called SimpleMarkup for its markup purposes.  SimpleMarkup is a simplified text-based markup system, much like many wiki markup languages.  Here's a brief overview:

* Consecutive lines aligned on the left margin (either column 0 in a text file, or after the comment character and whitespace in a source file) are considered a paragraph.  An empty line starts a new paragraph.
* If a line starts with &quot;*&quot;, &quot;-&quot; or &quot;&lt;a digit&gt;&quot; the following information is a list item, either unnumbered or numbered.  All subsequent lines should be indented to match the text on the first line of the list item.  Here's an example (from the RDoc documentation):

&lt;pre&gt;
* this is a list with three paragraphs in
   the first item. This is the first paragraph.

   And this is the second paragraph.

   1. This is an indented, numbered list.
   2. This is the second item in that list

   This is the third conventional paragraph in the
   first list item.

* This is the second item in the original list
&lt;/pre&gt;

* The lists can be labeled. Each label must be inside square brackets or followed by two colons:
&lt;pre&gt;
    [cat]  a small furry mammal
           that seems to sleep a lot

    [ant]  a little insect that is known
           to enjoy picnics
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    cat::  a small furry mammal
           that seems to sleep a lot

    ant::  a little insect that is known
           to enjoy picnics
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Any line which starts to the right of the current left margin is considered verbatim text (like program code, for example)
* Any line starting with one or more equals signs is a heading.  One equals sign is a top-level header, two equals signs is a second-level heading, etc.
* Three or more dashes on a line give a horizontal line.
* Basic text markup:
** Tags can be used, including asterisks for '''*bold text*''', underscores for ''_emphasis_'' text, and plus signs for &lt;tt&gt;+code+&lt;/tt&gt; text.
** Alternately, HTML tags can be used.

=== linking to other methods ===

To link to other methods format them like ri, ex:

 &lt;pre&gt;# same as the #read method of the &lt;/pre&gt;

You can avoid having a link created like &lt;pre&gt;\#method_name&lt;/pre&gt; (won't be linked) and &lt;pre&gt;\Win32&lt;/pre&gt; for camelcase that shouldn't be linked to known classnames.

=== linking to a url ===

Here's an example: 
&lt;pre&gt;# For detail, see the msdn[http://msdn.microsoft.com].&lt;/pre&gt;

== Using RDoc with RI ==

== Including Diagrams ==

If the program &lt;tt&gt;dot&lt;/tt&gt; from the [http://www.graphviz.org/ Graphviz] is available, RDoc will generate class hierarchy diagrams as part of the HTML documentation.  This behavior can be enabled with the command line option &lt;tt&gt;--diagram&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-d&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Using RDoc to Generate Usage Output ==

'''Warning''' : This is only possible with Ruby 1.8.X, Rdoc support for 1.9.X don't include this feature, no more.

RDoc can be used to generate a command-line usage string (paragraph) from a file's comments.  This is done with the class method &lt;tt&gt;RDoc::usage&lt;/tt&gt;.  Here's an example:

&lt;pre&gt;
# TestRDocUsage: A useless file
#
#  Usage:  ruby testRDocUsage.rb  [options]
#

require 'rdoc/usage'

RDoc::usage
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which when run:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt; ruby testRdocUsage.rb 
TestRDocUsage: A useless file

 Usage:  ruby testRDocUsage.rb  [options]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Not particularly interesting.  &lt;tt&gt;RDoc::usage&lt;/tt&gt; can take two kinds of command line options.  If the first argument is an integer, this value is used as the exit code for the application (yes, &lt;tt&gt;RDoc::usage&lt;/tt&gt; terminates the application).  Any further (string) arguments call out sections of the introductory comment which should be used.  Here's a slightly more complicated version of the above example:

&lt;pre&gt;
#= Overview
# TestRDocUsage: A useless file
#
#= Usage
#
#  Usage:  ruby testRDocUsage.rb  [options]
#

require 'rdoc/usage'

RDoc::usage('Usage')
&lt;/pre&gt;

This time with section headers.  Running the script gives

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt; ruby testRdocUsage.rb 

USAGE
=====
  Usage:  ruby testRDocUsage.rb  [options]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Where only the 'Usage' section (called out as an argument to &lt;tt&gt;RDoc::usage&lt;/tt&gt;) is included.

== Other Interesting Command-Line Options ==

Here are a selection of other interesting rdoc command-line options which haven't been covered above:

; -a, --all : Parse all class methods, not just public methods.
; -x, --exclude pattern : Exclude files/directories matching ''pattern'' from search.  Files included explicitly on the command line are never excluded.

* How do you include an external image file when publishing RDoc inside a Gem?  RDoc keeps converting the image into html!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==What writing system(s) does this language use?==

Dutch uses the Latin alphabet, just like English, but 'ij' is sometimes treated as a single letter, equivalent to 'Y'.  At the beginning of a place name, both letters are capitalized (e.g. IJsselmeer).

==How many people speak this language?==

About 24 million people speak Dutch. More, of course, speak it as another language, but it is more common as a first or native language.

==Where is this language spoken?==
[[Image:Dutch Language.png|200px|left|thumb|Dutch is spoken in Europe and in communities around the world.]]

The majority of Dutch speakers live in the Netherlands ([[Wikijunior:Europe/Netherlands|click here to learn about the Netherlands]]) and the northern part of Belgium (Flanders) ([[Wikijunior:Europe/Belgium|click here to learn about Belgium]]).  Those two countries alone have 21 million Dutch speakers.  Dutch in the Netherlands and Flanders is the official language, and is spoken by nearly everyone there.  Dutch is also the official language in Suriname where about 60% of the population has it as their mother tongue. 

Dutch is also spoken in Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles, and a tiny corner of northern France called French Flanders.  Dutch used to be spoken by many in Indonesia, which was a Dutch colony until 1949, but now only the older generation speak it.  Afrikaans, one of the languages of European settlers in Africa, is almost completely based on Dutch.  In fact, they are so similar, someone could be speaking Afrikaans and someone else Dutch, and they would both understand each other.

Dutch migrants to the US and Australia, and more recently to Spain, France and Italy, often continue to use Dutch.

==What is the history of this language?==

Scholars believe that Dutch became an independent language in about 600 AD. Before it was just one of numerous West Germanic dialects. 

The best known example of very old Dutch text is ''&quot;Hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan, hinase hic enda tu, wat unbidan we nu&quot;'' (&quot;All birds have started making nests, except me and you, what are we waiting for&quot;). It was written around 1100. For a long time, scholars thought that it was the oldest Dutch text, but now an older text has been discovered: ''&quot;Visc flot aftar themo uuatare&quot;'' (&quot;A fish was swimming in the water&quot;) and ''&quot;Gelobistu in got alamehtigan fadaer&quot;'' (&quot;Do you believe in God the almighty father&quot;). If you know German, this should be pretty easy to understand. These were written around the year 900.

Modern Dutch developed around 1550.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
* Gerard Reve
* Harry Mulisch
* Willem Frederik Hermans
* Jan Wolkers
* Ronald Giphart
* Annie M.G. Schmidt
* Max Velthuijs

==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==
In Dutch:

''Je bent de zon,''&lt;br&gt;
''Je bent de zee,''&lt;br&gt;
''Je bent de liefde,''&lt;br&gt;
''Ga nu met mij mee''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In English:
&lt;blockquote width=20%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px&quot;&gt;
''You are the sun,''&lt;br&gt;
''You are the sea,''&lt;br&gt;
''You are love,''&lt;br&gt;
''Now go along with me''&lt;br&gt;

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Esperanto uses the Latin alphabet, like English, with a few differences.  The letters ''q'', ''w'', ''x'', and ''y'' are gone, and there are new letters ''ĉ'', ''ĝ'', ''ĥ'', ''ĵ'', ''ŝ'', and ''ŭ''.

What's really different from English is that each Esperanto letter stands for one and only one sound.  There are no letters that sound differently in different words (like the ''a'' in ''f&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;t'', ''f&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;te'', and ''f&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;ther''), no silent letters (like the ''s'' in ''i&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;land''), and no sounds that take more than one letter (like the ''sh'' in ''fi&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;'').

Most Esperanto letters that are used in English have the same sounds that they usually have in English, and almost all Esperanto letters have sounds that are used in English.  The new letter ''ĥ'' is different from English, though; it has a sound like clearing your throat.  (That's also the way a Scottish person would say the ''ch'' in ''lo&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt;''.)  Here are all the Esperanto letters, and their sounds:

==How many people speak this language?==

The answer is: nobody really knows.
There are no exact numbers; Esperanto speakers are hard to count because they are spread all over the world.
It is most likely that there are between 100,000 and 2 million Esperanto speakers.
Most of them have learned to speak it; only about 1000 people speak Esperanto as their native language.

A speaker of Esperanto is called an Esperantist.

File:Jubilea simbolo.svg|Jubilee symbol&lt;br/&gt;({{lang eo|Jubilea simbolo}})
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Esperanto is spoken all over the world.
Really!
However, most Esperantists learn Esperanto as a second language, so nowhere is it the language of the majority of people.
Esperanto speakers live in the same places as speakers of other languages.

In order to identify themselves to other Esperanto speakers, Esperantists use a number of symbols.
The ''green star of Esperanto'', the {{lang eo|verda stelo}}, is the oldest and most commonly used symbol.
It is incorporated into the ''Esperanto flag''.
A more recent symbol called the jubilee symbol ({{lang eo|jubilea simbolo}}) was designed in 1987.
It is common to see all three of these symbols at an Esperanto event.

==What is the history of this language?==

[[Image:Zamenhof.jpg|left|thumb|100px|L.L. Zamenhof]]

Esperanto is a constructed language invented by Jewish-Polish eye doctor L.L. Zamenhof (1859 &amp;ndash; 1917).
He grew up in a city in Poland that was divided between groups who spoke different languages and did not get along. He hoped that if everyone could understand each other, they could live together in peace.
In 1872, when he was only 13 years old, he began designing a language called ''Lingwe uniwersala'' (&quot;universal language&quot;).
In 1878, at age 19, he shared his new language with a few close friends, but then he left for university to study medicine and left all of the notes about his language with his father for safe keeping. Unfortunately, his father was afraid that the idea of a universal language would cause trouble with the Russian Tsar who ruled Poland at the time, so he burned them.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|constructed language|a language that someone invented.  This is unlike English and other '''natural languages''' whose rules and vocabulary evolved over hundreds or thousands of years.}}

Zamenhof found out that all of his work had been destroyed when he came home from university in 1881.
He immediately started constructing a new, improved version, which he now called ''Lingvo universala'' (which means &quot;universal language&quot; in modern Esperanto).

For six years he tried to publish his new language, but the censors of the Tsar would not allow it.
Instead of surrendering his dream, he used this time to improve the language and practice using it to translate many works.

{{SideBox
 |'''''The First Constructed Language?'''''&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div style{{=}}&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style{{=}}&quot;margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;Esperanto is ''almost'' the first constructed language that had any success. Zamenhof started work on what eventually became Esperanto in 1872, but unfortunately he did not ''publish'' it until 1887.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style{{=}}&quot;margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;In the meantime, German priest Johann Martin Schleyer (1831 &amp;ndash; 1912) started design on his own language, Volapük, in 1879, and he published it in 1880&amp;mdash;seven years before Zamenhof published Esperanto.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Volapük was popular for a few years, but when Esperanto was published, most people abandoned Volapük in favour of Esperanto since Esperanto is much easier to learn.
Today, Volapük is almost completely extinct, with only around 20 speakers left in the world.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
}}

In 1887, Zamenhof published {{lang eo|Unua Libro}} (&quot;First Book&quot;), to describe his universal language.
Zamenhof did not use his real name when he published the book because he had already had so much trouble with the Tsar's censors.
Instead, he published the book under the name ''Doktoro Esperanto'', which is &quot;Dr. Someone-who-hopes&quot; in the language he was introducing.
The name &quot;Esperanto&quot; (which means &quot;someone who hopes&quot; in Esperanto), became the name of the language.

Because the language was so simple, and because there were already lots of things written in Esperanto (which Zamenhof had either written or translated while waiting on the Tsar's censors), it caught on very quickly.
By 1905, the first World Congress of Esperanto ({{lang eo|Universala Kongreso}}) was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer in France.
By the time World War I had started in 1914, Zamenhof had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize twice, Esperanto was part of the school curriculum in China, Samos and Macedonia, and there was even an Esperanto currency (the {{lang eo|spesmilo}}).
Unfortunately, Zamenhof died in 1917, and did not live to see the end of the war in 1918.

After World War I, Esperanto's popularity began to soar. The horrors of the war created a desire in people for a universal peace, and Esperanto seemed the best hope for a universal language to foster communication to prevent war from happenning again. The League of Nations&amp;mdash;the precursor to the modern United Nations&amp;mdash;officially recommended that its members use Esperanto as a second language, and some of the most important scientific associations suggested that Esperanto be used for future scientific communication. For a while it seemed that Esperanto would become the international language for communication, science, and, of course, peace&amp;mdash;this time, the 1920s, is considered to be the golden age of Esperanto.

But the great dictators that arose in the early days of World War II&amp;mdash;Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin&amp;mdash;banned Esperanto.
Many Esperantists, including members of Zamenhof's family, died in Nazi death camps.
The League of Nations, along with many prominent Esperanto associations, did not survive the war.

Since then, slowly the Esperanto movement has been rebuilding, although it is not yet at the levels it was at before World War II.
Although the United Nations does not support Esperanto in the same way that the League of Nations did, some United Nations agencies support the language.
The Internet and organizations like {{lang eo|Pasporta Servo}} (which allows Esperanto speakers to travel by staying with other Esperantists around the world) have allowed Esperantists to keep in touch in ways they could not have in the past.
Esperanto now exists only through the enthusiasm of its speakers, without the support of any nation or major international organization.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
 
[[w:L. L. Zamenhof|L. L. Zamenhof]] (1859 &amp;ndash; 1917), Zamenhof himself was the first Esperanto author.
While he was waiting for the censors to allow him to publsh his language, he improved it by using it to translate a number of works, including Shakespeare. He also wrote a number of original Esperanto books and poems.

[[w:Julio Baghy|Julio Baghy]] (1891 &amp;ndash; 1967), Hungarian actor who wrote novels and poetry in Esperanto, and was very influential in the early development of the language for poetic use. His most famous novel is {{lang eo|Printempo en Aŭtuno}} (&quot;Springtime in Autumn&quot;, 1931), but he is more well-known for his poetry. His most influential work is his collection of poems, {{lang eo|Preter la vivo}} (&quot;Beyond Life&quot;, 1922).

[[w:William Auld|William Auld]] (1924 &amp;ndash; 2006), Scottish poet who was nominated three times (1999, 2004 and 2006) for the Nobel Prize in Literature for his works in Esperanto. His most famous work is {{lang eo|La infana raso}} (&quot;The Infant Race&quot;, 1956).

[[w:Claude Piron|Claude Piron]] (1931 &amp;ndash; 2008), Swiss linguist who wrote dozens of books on the language, as well as novels, poems and non-fiction books. His most famous work is [[w:Gerda _malaperis!|{{lang eo|Gerda malaperis!}}]] (&quot;Gerda Vanished!&quot;), which is not only an entertaining mystery novel, but is also written so that early chapters use basic Esperanto, which gets more advanced with each chapter.

It would be great is a speaker of this language could add a little information about how the special letters are pronounced. --[[User:Starchildmom|Starchildmom]] 22:40, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

:This has been done, but it is probably even more important to have information about how the rest of the letters - the ones used in Latin and English - are pronounced. --[[User:Haruo|Haruo]] 19:01, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

I'm a big fan of making stuff visual, rather than trying to explain it in a paragraph. Perhaps adding something like this - which has the new letters highlighted - would be easier to digest?

The only other comments you need to add are:
* How ĥ is pronounced
* That q, w, x and y are gone (and maybe how they are replaced by kw, ŭ ks and j)
* That unlike English, every letter has only one sound (you can use a as an example: f&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;t, f&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;te and f&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;ther all have different sounding versions of a)
* There are no silent letters (like h in p&lt;strong&gt;h&lt;/strong&gt;)

So you could replace what's in &quot;What writing system(s) does this language use?&quot; with:

 Esperanto uses the Latin alphabet, like English, but with a few differences.
 The letters ''q'', ''w'', ''x'' and ''y'' are gone, and new letters ''ĉ'', ''ĝ'', ''ĥ'', ''ĵ'', ''ŝ'' and ''ŭ'' are added.
 The Esperanto alphabet looks like this:
 
 (put the tables above here)
 
 Most Esperanto letters sound like they would in English, except in Esperanto, the sounds of letters never change.
 In English, the sound of ''a'' is different in ''f&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;t'', ''f&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;te'' and ''f&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;ther'', and the ''s'' is silent in ''i&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;land''.
 That does not happen in Esperanto, because there is only one way to spell a sound, and only one way to sound out a spelling.
 
 The major differences from English are that ''c'' is pronounced like ''ts'' and ''j'' is pronounced like ''y'',
 and the new letter ''ĥ'' does not have a sound in English, but is like clearing your throat, or how a Scottish person would say the ''ch'' in ''lo&lt;strong&gt;ch&lt;/strong&gt;''.
 The missing letters ''q'', ''w'', ''x'' and ''y'' are replaced with ''kw'', ''ŭ'', ''ks'' and ''j''.
 
 (Then continue with the &quot;Because ordinary keyboards don't...&quot; until the end of the section.)

That's not ''complete'' and in some cases it's not ''technically'' correct, but it's complete and correct enough to make a sound base for a decent class presentation by a kid, i think.

== Esperist? ==

Has anyone else heard of Esperantists referred to as &quot;Esperists&quot;?
Even a quick Google search gives me this page only, and then a ton pages with &quot;esper ist&quot;.
I have only ever heard of Esperantists referred to as &quot;Esperantists&quot; or &quot;samideanoj&quot; (by other Esperantists - it means &quot;brother&quot;, but not in the family sense - and it's not really a proper name for Esperantists).
And then there's the technically correct term Esperantano, but that's not in common use.
&quot;Esperantist&quot; is the only term I have heard in common use, and it is the officially designated term by World Congress declaration.
Unless someone has heard the term &quot;Esperist&quot; used, I'll take it out. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 19:15, 2 February 2010 (UTC)

== Contemporary Esperanto writers? ==

Anyone have any suggestions for more contemporary Esperanto writers who have some influence and/or fame?

== Length ==

I'm concerned about the length of this article.  It's now distinctly longer than ''any'' of the 100%-completion articles, even the very long ones like (that I recall) [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/German|German]], [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Serbian|Serbian]], and [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Swahili|Swahili]]; and quite a lot longer than the average.  I admit that I too am squeamish about looking any particular content in the eye and telling it &quot;You have to go&quot; &amp;mdash; but we really ought to be looking for opportunities to tighten things up somewhat.  Simpler may be better.  We don't want to drive away kids who aren't at the extreme upper end of the age range (although we surely also want the material to be useful to kids who ''are'' at the upper end).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 00:58, 5 February 2010 (UTC)

:The bulk of this article is in the history section. Most languages aren't going to have any history to speak of, other than &quot;it evolved as mix of X, Y and Z sometime back in the haze of ancient history&quot;. The few that do have anything approximating a recorded history, like Esperanto or [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Italian|Italian]] (for example), are naturally going to have longer history sections. What makes Esperanto particularly unique is that 1.) a lot of what it ''is'' comes from ''why'' it is (because it is a designed language)... and to understand that, you need to understand its history, 2.) most of its history is in the current era, involving things that an average kid today will be familiar with (WW1 &amp; 2, for example), rather than relatively ancient history (take Italian as an example - what average kid will know Frederick II from Adam?) and 3.) Esperanto is, in essence, the result of a 13 year-old kid's love project, and what could be more motivating or interesting to a child than seeing that something they are dreaming up today may become a worldwide phenomenon tomorrow? --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 01:52, 5 February 2010 (UTC)

::Valid points, all.  Though I was already beginning to doubt mildly before the history section.  I certainly don't mean to suggest any precipitous action; but after giving ourselves some time to let the material settle in our minds, so to speak, we may find that we can after all see ways to subtly simplify, here and there.  The occasion calls for a light touch, rather than a heavy one.  And there's no rush (as Ingolemo remarked to me over at the [[Conlang]] Wikibook a few months back... or was it more like a year ago).

::BTW, not to misrepresent my own position on this &amp;mdash; I really do ''like'' the work you've done on this article, quite a lot, which is the basic source of the squeamishness I mentioned earlier.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 02:44, 5 February 2010 (UTC)

:::Oh, I didn't take your comments as criticism - it's a valid concern, and I did mull it over myself when I was writing the history section in particular (which is why I had all those answers ready ^_^;). I certainly expect trimming, because I tried to make sure that it was as complete as possible without being too complete - or in other words, I erred on the side of length, prefferring to be a little longer rather than lacking in info. I expect editors to come along and trim it a bit - and I don't expect anything more to be added (except one or two more writers in the &quot;who writes&quot; section; contemporary ones), although I might be surprised I guess.

:::In fact, I can already see a few things that might be trimmed out - like the UNESCO mention, and dropping Kálmán Kalocsay from the list of writers (actually, I was aiming for one writer in each &quot;era&quot; of Esperanto: Zamenhof in the formation days, Baghy in the &quot;growth&quot; days (pre WW1), Auld in the golden age (WW1-WW2), Piron in the recovery age (post WW2-80s), and ??? in the modern age - so if I could find a modern name I would ditch Kalocsay and add the modern one), and the paragraph on how to type on computers in Esperanto can probably be cut in half. But I'll leave the trimming to another editor, or I'll do it myself if enough time passes and no one else has done it.

:::I've been working my way down the page sprucing it up with the goal of taking it from &quot;developing&quot; to &quot;publishable&quot;. Just the last two sections left. For them, I don't really have all that much new content to add - just a few more things in the words to say, like I'm going to add the numbers, and then drop things like &quot;where's the bathroom&quot; - and it's mostly about reformatting for making it look sweet. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 05:48, 5 February 2010 (UTC)

::::I recommend not waiting for other editors; you're immersed in it now, which for purposes of trimming gives you, now, a head start on any other editor, now or later, and even on yourself coming back to it much later.  Also, Wikijunior is a slow-paced sort of place (in recent times, anyway), and it could take years before someone else comes around with the time and inclination to tackle the matter.  In all of 2009, for example, the only substantial changes to Esperanto were the expansion and table-izing of the words and phrases, and the removal of some &quot;inappropriately in-depth material&quot; (the latter by {{nowrap|Pi zero}}; I see BTW that that wasn't a matter of length but of focus).  If you see some things that can be trimmed, take the time to be sure of what you want to do, and then just be bold and do it.  If other editors do come around next week, or next month, they'll have an even better starting point from which to further improve this article, or there is no shortage of other articles they can turn their attention to.

::::I'd be interested in your comments on dash-separated lists of words and phrases, as you've reformatted that section, versus tabular format.  I always preferred tables, as neat and easy-to-read, to the point in fact that I've long wished I had time to go through and systematically table-ify those lists in all the articles of this book.  Of course some of it is personal taste, but I can't help feeling there are more objective considerations involved, on both sides.

:::::Well the ''other'' reason I am stepping back and having a &quot;cool off&quot; period before going at this page again is because I want to get back to my ''primary'' project - the main [[Esperanto]] Wikibook (i am actually right in the middle of a major overhaul job there, and want to get back to it). I feel that this page is now good enough to rate &quot;publishable&quot; (and I'm going to mark it so). Of course, it can always be improved (a lot ^_^;), but I think we're at the point now where we are no longer ''creating'' the page, and are now actually in the ''improving'' phase.

I'm trying a different arrangement of the writing system(s) section.  Different languages have different things that are especially interesting about them, and I was thinking that the phonetic spelling of Esperanto could be made to be the central point of interest for that section.  That way, the tables could be presented at the end as an elaboration of that point of interest.
*I wonder if typical English-speaking kids will understand ''roll your tongue''; but so far, I haven't thought of another way of putting it that's obviously any better.
*I didn't quite have the nerve to put an exclamation point at the end of &quot;it has a sound like clearing your throat!&quot;, as that semed like it might be getting a little carried away.
*I tried explaining the word ''loch'' with a reference to the Loch Ness Monster, but decided it could come across as patronizing and didn't really add anything.
--[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 22:11, 9 February 2010 (UTC)

:The thing is, the section is about ''writing'' systems... not phonology. If you check the other languages in the book, very few - if any - have any kind of phonological info at all. And since this chapter is already 2-3 times the average size of the other chapters, something has to go.
:I agree that different languages have different items of interest, but if we have to pick one thing about Esperanto that's interesting... the fact that it's phonetic and orthographic? Really? I would have put flexible word order before that, but if I really had to pick one interesting thing about Esperanto to share to kids, it would be its history - and the goals with which it was designed. That's interesting, and inspiring, and supremely educational (because while they're hearing the story of Esperanto, they're learning more details about history). --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 05:53, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

::Some thoughts, rambling though they may be.
::*I didn't mean to suggest, and don't believe, that there has to be only one interesting thing about each language.
::*Making each article fun and interesting and, along the way, informative is what matters.  Overlength is ''potentially'' a problem because it may correlate with things getting boring, but that's a side-effect of length, not inherent.  It's good if a language has personality that comes through in its article, so the whole book doesn't become a tedious progression of generic languages.  I think this article feels shorter than it was.  (I also sense, in a detached sort of way, that sooner or later the history section may shorten up significantly further &amp;mdash; though I cringe in anticipation.)
::*I think the one-sound-per-letter thing is fun, or at least it can be pitched that way (flaws of my own pitch notwithstanding).  It makes the alphabet into a kind of game and helps give Esperanto personality, especially with a few curves thrown in like the velar fricative (&quot;clearing your throat&quot; &amp;mdash; I like it).
::*The idea that phonology doesn't belong in that section implies an excessive divorcing of orthography from phonology, to the detriment of the section since the one-to-one phonemic valuing of letters is the distinctive feature of the orthography.  (This is somewhat reminiscent of a problem we had at Conlang Intermediate last year, in which trying to separate morphology from syntax was just getting in the way of explaining things clearly.)  Also, I don't think it's entirely fair to insist on limiting the content of the section in a way that really requires a more sophisticated knowledge of languages than we expect our target audience to have even ''after'' they've read the book.
::--[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 07:14, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

:::Well:
:::*This is not meant to be a comprehensive introduction, and (so I've heard), the goal is to keep this book under 64 pages (obviously impossible, but it's a benchmark). There are 30 languages in the &quot;publishable&quot; section (including Esperanto). Figure on 2 pages per language then. After including the required information, there's really not that much room for other info. Practically speaking, you're simply not going to have room to bring up more than one interesting thing per language.
:::*Boredom is not really a concern (of mine). I can write 50 pages on Esperanto and keep kids engaged. The problem is length itself, not the side effects. If this book is going to be transformed into a print book - which is the goal - it has to be kept short for obvious reasons. The Esperanto article is about 50% longer than the next longest article (German), and over 130% longer than the average (see [[User:Indiana/Sandbox/Wikijunior:languages size comparison|here]]). (And it's pretty much a given that the history section has to be shortened, but in my opinion, the story told there is the most interesting part of the article, so once the trimming begins, that should be trimmed last.)
:::*Saying the alphabet in 30 different languages can surely be fun (and, it might even be a great idea to have a Wikijunior book solely dedicated to alphabets around the world that does just that). But take an average kid, who's read this book. Six weeks later, how is the velar fricative going to &quot;stick&quot; with them? They'll probably never see ĥ again. They may have a few moments of fun when reading the book, sounding out the alphabet, but then... meh. Six weeks later, that's all lost. Instead, think about the story in the history. Six weeks after they've put the book down, they'll still remember that story because stories stick with kids. And whenever they hear a language they can't understand spoken, or hear &quot;united nations&quot;, or &quot;nazis&quot;, they will recall the story (&quot;the guy who invented Esperanto also understood what it's like to not understand what other people are saying!&quot;, &quot;the nazis? oh yes, another one of the evil things they did is they tried to destroy Esperanto!&quot;). It introduces a concept into a child's imagination (&quot;maybe if we could all understand each other, then we could all get along&quot;) that can translate into positive action (&quot;wait, instead of fighting about this argument, let's try and understand each others' positions first&quot;). Granted, with many kids that won't happen - they'll put down the book and forget all about it - but ''more'' kids will benefit ''more'' from the story in the history than will benefit from an afternoon of horking ĥ's. And if we are forced to fit into very limited space, clearly the history warrants the lion's share of the space, so if something's gotta go....
:::*If there was room, then it would make perfect sense to map the orthography to the phonology... but there really isn't. And there is no requirement for the ''readers'' to understand the division between the two - this is up to us editors to make the judgment call. It's a kid's book - they're not going to miss the phonology if it's not there, and they're not going to suffer as students of the language because this isn't supposed to teach them Esperanto, just give them an idea that it exists, along with a ''little'' taste of what it is. This is one chapter in a larger book, and few (if any) of the other chapters discuss phonology. We have to work within the community standards. Unless you want to include phonology ''everywhere'', then it shouldn't be here. (Incidentally, what I was planning to do eventually was link each of the letters in the alphabet to a sound file of the letter being pronounced. That doesn't change the length of the print book, but gives bonus material to people who view the hypertext version.)
:::If you think it's '''''really''''' important to mention that Esperanto is phonetic (or orthographic, or both), then you can do that with a single sentence. All you need to do is: &quot;Esperanto uses the Latin alphabet, like English, except without q, w, x, and y, and with new letters ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭ. &lt;list the alphabet&gt; Each letter is only pronounced one way (unlike in English, where a is different in fat, fate and father&quot;), and there are no silent letters.&quot; And that's all there is to it. But I don't really think it adds all that much. (That actually has the benefit of being better than what's there now, because what's there now is technically wrong in the details.)

::::Just a quick comment for now:  I was actually surprised to hear you characterize this article as fifty percent longer than German.  Although I was readily able to work out your basis for that, I think &amp;mdash; size of page in bytes &amp;mdash; that really isn't how I was measuring the relative lengths.  IMHO byte count doesn't matter much anymore.  You can't see it when you're reading.  I was using a much more simple-minded hands-on measure: vertical length of the article in my browser.  By that measure, when I first expressed concern here about length this article was longer than German, but now it's about twenty percent shorter than German.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 00:40, 12 February 2010 (UTC)

:::::Byte count is exactly what you see when you're reading. Assuming two pages use roughly the same concentration of markup, the page with the bigger byte count is the page that will take you longer to read. Page length (as in how long the page is in the browser window - I'll use &quot;size&quot; for byte size and &quot;length&quot; for length in browser window) is a measure of formatting. The Esperanto page may ''look'' shorter than the German one, but that's because:
:::::*Unlike the German page, the Esperanto word list is columnized. If you removed the columnizing, the Esperanto page would be longer.
:::::*Unlike the German song, the Esperanto songs are columnized. If you columnized the German song, the page length would be cut dramatically.
:::::*The German page uses lots of call backs to the definitions in the intro, which take up a lot of vertical space. This isn't new information, just a reminder of what the kids should have read already. Esperanto only has the definition for &quot;constructed language&quot;. If we put in definitions for just &quot;native speaker&quot; and &quot;secondary language&quot;, the Esperanto page length would get close (or, alternately, if the German page took them out, it would get shorter).
:::::*The German page uses templates that won't show up in the print version. That means that even though it looks longer when viewed as a standalone page, it will be shorter in the actual book.
:::::Basically, length is a misleading metric. If I were to go and format the German page nicely - without adding or removing a single bit of info - I could shorten the page length by half, easy. Size isn't perfect, but it's much more reliable. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 01:41, 12 February 2010 (UTC)

::::::The columnization is a telling point, certainly.  You make a good case for byte count as a more useful size-heuristic than vertical length.  When it comes to contemplating specifics of where to cut, though, I'm pretty sure I use pure intuitive feel.  My intuition tells me, for example, that the writing system(s) section feels ''much'' shorter to me now than it did in its [{{fullurl:{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Esperanto|oldid=1715504#What_writing_system.28s.29_does_this_language_use.3F}} next most recent tables incarnation], despite the fact that by those objective measures they're pretty much the same.  (The difference seems to be that the text is more cohesive and a bit more narrowly focused; imho, not splitting the text around the tables is at least half of the effect.)

::::::I'm also at a loss to articulate objectively why I think ''this'' additional detail doesn't overburden the article, although it's probably something to do with what I consider a rather light-hearted attitude toward the sounds/letters combined with the fact that that detail quietly ''fits'' into the historical motivation of the language (without actually explaining the connection, which would probably come across as heavy-handed).  In terms of numbers of print pages... I guess I just rate the writing section valuable enough that I'm inclined to look for significant cuts elsewhere before stepping back for a wider view and bringing the writing section back into play.  (And if I eventually felt I had to shorten it, my first try would be to remove the tables and keep all the current text.)

::::::You seem to think in terms of greater uniformity between articles, a trend visible in your [[Wikijunior talk:{{BOOKNAME}}#Standard list of basic words to learn?|Standard list of basic words to learn? proposal]].  I think in terms of encouraging some variation between articles in what is covered and how deeply, with the common structure of the sections and general patterns broadly followed within the sections, but also some outliers to keep things a little spontaneous.  I would consider the Esperanto writing section such an outlier.  Saying the alphabet in every language would rob it of its novelty at the same time it would cause it to take ''lots'' of space in the book rather than a little extra space in one article.  It only makes sense to me as an outlier.  (I'm still mulling over the standard basic words proposal.)

::::::I did say a while back that you had an advantage because you know the article in depth.  I'll add to that that you have a real disadvantage in that you evidently know ''too much'' about the subject.  Even worse, you know enough to realize it's all ''interesting''.  An enthusiast trying to pare down material about the subject of their enthusiasm is a grim sight.

::::::Any idea where you heard the under-64-page figure?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 04:30, 12 February 2010 (UTC)

:::::::Guh, I'm a goof, sorry. It's [[Wikijunior talk:Languages#Language coverage|'''''48''''' pages]], not 64.

:::::::You're absolutely right in saying I'm basing my standards on the book rather than the chapter, and all the criticisms about doing that are spot on. ''Why'' am I doing that? Because, as you noticed ^_^; I know too much about the subject, and could easily ramble on for 48 pages myself. I can't use the Esperanto chapter itself to gauge how much is enough, so I use the other chapters.

:::::::If you want my personal opinion, I agree with you: the chapter is fine as is (although, I do think someone else should take an edit run through the history). I would ''prefer'' to see that all the other languages were brought ''up'' to this standard, rather than having Esperanto pared down to the existing standard (which is why I am starting a push toward getting standardized phrases across the languages). But... is it more practical to ask 30 other chapters to change to this standard, or this chapter to adapt to their standard? My position is this: I am compromising for now by trying to bring Esperanto down to the community standard... ''while'' attempting to raise the community standard... so that if the community standard does rise up, I can use [{{fullurl:Wikijunior:Languages/Esperanto|oldid=1714264}} the information I saved] to restore the page to where I think it should be.

:::::::Variation between the languages is all fine and good - in fact, it's a great idea - but Esperanto is like the 200th most spoken language in the world. ^_^; Most people will go their entire lives without seeing or hearing anything in Esperanto (other than a few background noises in movies like ''Blade''). It shouldn't be the biggest (''by far'') chapter in the book. Clearly that's a sign that something is out of whack: either the rest of the book is too short, or Esperanto is too long. (Incidentally, I've been looking at expanding the Japanese page quite a bit. It doesn't even list katakana, and doesn't say a word about vertical vs. horizontal writng... things that I think are interesting, because you could then mention to kids that Japanese books are &quot;backwards&quot;. But for now, I am deep in my [[Esperanto]] book improvement project.) --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 20:41, 12 February 2010 (UTC)

{{outdent|:::::::}}
Although I started this thread with an article-wide concern, the scope of my postings has been getting mostly narrower and narrower.  It's time for me to revisit wider issues, reassessing and clarifying my positions.

I don't think the article ''as a whole'' is fine as is.  I'd no longer say it's too long, because &quot;length&quot; isn't the right word for what I mean.  Nor &quot;size&quot;.  Something less suggestive of gross form; perhaps &quot;weight&quot; or &quot;magnitude&quot;.  Say the article is &quot;too heavy&quot;.  The reason I'm not particularly worried about the current Writing system(s) section, in particular, is that it feels lighter to me than the preceding with-tables version.  The song/poem/story section isn't overweight, I think, nor the phrases.  The words list may be (too many number words), and the authors section should lighten up a little (that one won't be straightforward, as it probably ''shouldn't'' get shorter, only lighter).

But then there's the history section.  My sense is that it's way too heavy.  Reducing that is going to be ''brutal''; to be safe, you may want to bite down on a scrap of leather when the time comes.

I'm pretty sure you're the wrong person to do these weight-reductions; you're just too close.  I remarked on that before; but there's more going on here &amp;mdash; a larger perspective in which to place your situation.  Some languages like to proselytize, using their hosts (the people who are like the cells of their bodies) to gain footholds in further potential hosts, and languages like that will tend, statistically, to have heavier articles here; but even amongst those, Esperanto is in a unique position.  It isn't the dominant language of any region, from which it would acquire new hosts automatically; it's an exception to the rule that a language is a dialect with an army.  It has to, and ''does'', win converts in every generation just to stay alive, which isn't true even of the more aggressive natural languages.  That's fine for Esperanto, but I don't think ''how much a language wants to spread itself'' should be a determining factor in the size/weight/magnitude of its article here.  (Note that, as with all memetics, this is attributing the actions of individual people to a deliberate purpose that is usually not deliberate by the people who actually do them.)

On the other articles of the book, I'm uncomfortable with a systematic expansion across all of them.  It's not at all obvious to me that the average magnitude is actually all that wrong.  There's a certain logic to the idea that most of the articles should be like popcorn or the like &amp;mdash; individual pieces that are very light and can be scarfed down one after another in numbers that add up (though of course these pieces are nutritious).  A few of the completed articles might benefit from pinpoint, very limited additions, but there might also be some judicious reductions to some of the long ones.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 06:10, 13 February 2010 (UTC)
: The section on history has a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10.7 and a Gunning fog index of 14.5. Both of these numbers indicate that there's some work to do here in terms of simplifying the writing. It's 723 words long (just FYI). The section on where it is spoken has a grade level of 7.7 and can pretty easily be brought down to 6.5 (which is what I aim for when I'm writing for Wikijunior.)

== List vs. tables for &quot;what words can I learn?&quot; section ==

I just rewrote the &quot;what words can I learn?&quot; section - mostly to change the words that were there - but while I did it I replaced the table formatting with lists instead. Really... that was just because that was how i wrote the list of words. ^_^; Much easier to make a list of words as a list rather than in wikitable formatting. ^_^;

But I do have some reasons for picking one over the other. They're all entirely unscientific, and based only on how ''I'' read, so your mileage may vary.

Tables are great for associative data - information where you're trying to say &quot;here's A, and here's the B associated with A&quot;. If we were making a vocabulary list for an actual Esperanto lesson, a table would be perfect, because we would want to show &quot;here's the Esperanto word, and here's the English meaning associated with it&quot; (or vice versa, linguistically). But in ''this'' case, we're not trying to teach the kids the language; we're not trying to teach them associations between Esperanto words and English ones (or vice versa). We're just trying to show them a bunch of Esperanto words so they can ''see'' what Esperanto words ''look like''. Technically, we really don't even need the English translations there at all... they're just incidental to the goal of that section (of course, when we give them the English translations, they can play with using those words meaningfully... but that's not really the primary goal, the primary goal is just to show them the words). We could, in theory, just list a bunch of Esperanto words and say, &quot;there, there are some basic Esperanto words that you can learn, as the section title promises&quot;. The English translations provided as asides are just icing to spice up the words, not information they are expected to learn associatively.

But most importantly, I don't know if everyone does this, but whenever I read text that has a table in the middle of it... I don't read the table. ^_^; I read the surrounding text to find out what I am expected to see in the table, and refer back to the table to see what the text was talking about. I don't actually sit there and read through a table. Tables are like figures, or illustrations... they ''add'' to whatever the primary text is... but they, themselves, aren't the primary text. Me, personally (and I would imagine most people, especially kids), I find it more natural to scan down a list than to parse a table. Tables are just unnatural - first you have to examine the structure of the table (is it vertical or horizontal), then you have to examine how the data is laid out (English or Esperanto first?), ''then'' you begin scanning the table, all the while keeping in mind the structure and layout so what you're scanning makes sense. On the other hand, a list is a list - people make lists naturally without thinking (shopping lists, to-do lists, etc.). Lists are just natural and easy to understand - the only drawback is they're not great at formatting associated data.. but again, that's not the goal here.

But you know, really, this is all moot. What ''should'' be done is someone should make templates for the book, so the word lists for ''every'' language look like this:
&lt;pre&gt;{{Words you can learn start}}
{{Words you can learn section|Basic Greetings}}
{{Words you can learn|eo|Saluton!|Hello!}}
{{Words you can learn|eo|Bonan matenon!|Good morning!}}
...
{{Words you can learn end}}&lt;/pre&gt;

And for a more complicated example:
&lt;pre&gt;{{Words you can learn start}}
{{Words you can learn section|Basic Greetings}}
{{Words you can learn|ja|今日は！|Hello!|alt-script=こんにちは！|pronunciation=konnichwa}}
{{Words you can learn|ja|おはようございます！|Hello!|pronunciation=konnichwa}}
...
{{Words you can learn end}}&lt;/pre&gt;

And then, all the languages in the book will be formatted the same.

I may even do that myself one day... but I have other projects to focus on for the time being. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 04:37, 6 February 2010 (UTC)

: The interesting prospect of templates such as you describe makes the tables-versus-lists question that much more important to resolve (although I actually have in mind another target for templating: I've more than half worked out how to set up a system of templates so we can easily generate correctly formatted vocabulary boxes that automatically extract the correct definition from the glossary).

: Here are two thoughts on the other side of the question.

:* I suggest that the list format is not so easy to read &amp;mdash; or, to be precise, each individual ''entry'' in these lists is not so easy to read.  More so for the phrases.  My basis for this is rather primal (although I'm afraid I won't express it very well, not being a perceptual psychologist, or whatever the name is for someone who would know the scholarly name for this effect):  the use of a punctuation mark to separate the foreign-language phrase from its English translation requires extra mental effort for the reader, because they have to assimilate the whole to sort out which glyph is the separator before they can do the more rapid sort of processing on each half that becomes possible when you know what frame of mind to approach it with.  The more unfamiliar the script of the other language is, the harder this separation task is.  A table makes this trivial, by providing a visual separation between the two that can be processed before the reader even begins to assess either version of the phrase.  Each of the two versions of the phrase is then easier to process, because the reader does know what frame of mind to approach each version with.  It seems to me that if you are looking through a text in a strange language, and you unexpectedly hit several consecutive words in English, it will take you a moment longer (an &quot;extra neuron firing&quot; is the way I often describe this sort of thing) to process than if you had gone into it already expecting English, because you have to decide that it ''is'' English, switch out of your admiring-an-unfamiliar-language mode, and switch into your reading-English mode.

:* I think there is an associative component to what we'd like to gently get across.  No, I certainly agree, we aren't trying to teach the language; but ideally, we'd like with these few words and phrases to suggest the &quot;look and feel&quot; of the language, and the parallelisms between the different entries here carry some of that, which is communicated better by the table format than by the list format.

:--[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:21, 6 February 2010 (UTC)

::Hm, perhaps. As i said, i didn't really give it all that much thought before doing it - i made it as a list, and just copy-pasted it and left it because it looked presentable. I figured they would have to be redone with templates anyway someday, so it didn't matter how I formatted it. With templates, the tables-versus-lists questions becomes a book-wide decision, which I consider beyond my scope.

::How about a mid-way measure between tables and lists? Something like this:

{|
!colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;|'''Basic Greetings:'''
|-
|style=&quot;padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 3em;&quot; |&lt;span lang=&quot;eo&quot;&gt;''Saluton!''&lt;/span&gt;
|&quot;Hello!&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 3em;&quot; |&lt;span lang=&quot;eo&quot;&gt;''Bonan matenon!''&lt;/span&gt;
|&quot;Good morning!&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 3em;&quot; |&lt;span lang=&quot;eo&quot;&gt;''Bonan vesperon!''&lt;/span&gt;
|&quot;Good evening!&quot;
|}
{|
!colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;|'''Simple Words:'''
|-
|style=&quot;padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 3em;&quot; |&lt;span lang=&quot;eo&quot;&gt;''Jes''&lt;/span&gt;
|&quot;Yes&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 3em;&quot; |&lt;span lang=&quot;eo&quot;&gt;''Ne''&lt;/span&gt;
|&quot;No&quot;
|}

::The big space there between the languages makes the separation natural - no parsing of any letters or symbols required. But at the same time there are no distracting lines and borders, and no need to try and figure out what structure the data's in. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 17:30, 6 February 2010 (UTC)

:::Interesting.  Whereas my attitude toward the visible lines is that they make it easier to zip visually from one side of the table to the other without having to work at which item on the right aligns with the element one started at on the left (or vice versa).  So I ''like'' the visible lines (depending on details of format, of course).  Seems I'm preferring somewhat more structured layout and somewhat less structured choice of content.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:36, 12 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

This page is a joke. Get someone good to work over this entire &quot;book.&quot; It is like a page written in 1996 by a sophomore undergrad who just took a single course by a biased prof. Seriously, the lack of neuroscience, the lack of data, it is awful. And the philosophy is awful. The Churchlands aren't eliminativists about consciousness. Read their actual work, not what people say about them. They are eliminativists about propositional attitudes, not consciousness (or mental representations more generally). This embodies the biases and ignorance of a blog entry. Very annoying, useless will not cite it in my book on consciousness. I am dumber having read any of this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please write your own reviews as applicable.  Please only reply if you have owned the pieces yourself.  Also please include your email address for reference.
  
==Battle Version==
I personally have every piece replaced with Battle Version linkage and I have been extremely impressed.  No visible wear on any of the pieces after many track days and a year of daily driving.  Excellent customer service as well. - DJPimpFlex@hotmail.com

==Cusco==
==Kazama==
==Power Trix==
==Tein==
I have Tein inner tie rods.  They were very cheep, S14/Z32 size and came with the inner spacers to help with the steering angle. - DJPimpFlex@hotmail.com
==JIC==
==KTS==
I have had their outer tie rods and I have been impressed with the quality of the pieces.  Very nicely made and improve the steering feel greatly.  I wouldn’t run them for daily driving because the pot holes and constant movement and jolts may wear them prematurely. - DJPimpFlex@hotmail.com

==Energy Suspension==
I have these for my steering rack bushings.  Also helped with the steering feel and they were much cheaper than nismo's comparable units. - DJPimpFlex@hotmail.com

I have the ES Master bushing kit for my 89... great kit for the price. Keep in mind that the install is quite a job, most of the bushings you eed to remove have a metal collar that will either need to be pressed out, or more than likely if you're doing it yourself, cut out with a hacksaw. Once installed the kit is great. - zackt69@hotmail.com

==Tanabe==
==Nismo==
==Nams==
==SPL Parts==
I'm running SPL T/C rods and tie rods w/ Z32 inner tie rods. All the parts have performed as expected, and there is literally no play in the front end at all. VERY thick, sturdy parts at a good price. - IMPerfection

Chrome plated pieces easily rust but are fine after powder coating. Shinhed

==Megan Racing==

I installed Megan Racing traction control links and toe control rods on my S13 a couple of months ago and have not had any problems so far. They have held up just fine under some spirited driving and they show no signs of wear, rust, etc. I've been under the car several times since I installed them and the parts are cinched in as tightly as the day that I installed them.

      <comment>/* ISIS */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=ISIS=
The best I have seen on the market is the ISIS. It has a completely new housing, and is very easy to install. It is cheaper than the B&amp;M and does not have rattle at high rpms. ISIS is a new company and is now being recognized for having very solid products. Give them a try and you will not be disappointed.

=Fidanza=

Hint:
NEVER take the shifter off the bass B&amp;M provides. If you do it will never shift the same again.
ALWAYS remove the assembly, plate and shifter, as one unit. :-)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=ACT=
(cost)

Not my preferred clutch. Friction material tends to shear off with aggressive driving. Also has an extremely stiff pressure plate. This helps with increased load bearing, but places a high load on the thrust bearings of the engine.

=Clutch Masters FX400=
$485.00

This is my single plate design of choice. Not real good wear if used for daily driving in stop and go traffic and areas that require you to stop on hills (Seattle, San Francisco). The pressure plate is not overly stiff, just solid. The clutch relys on a good strong ceramic friction material to do the work. The feel is that of an on/off switch, instant and strong engagemnet.

=Exedy Stage 1 (SR20DET)=
(cost)

This is a single plate, organic clutch upgrade for the SR20DET motor.  The pedal effort is very close to stock and the feel is also close to stock.  Its rated up to 240lbs of torque, so its only for lightly modified cars.  I am a little dissapointed with it and I wish I went with a harsher clutch/lightweight flywheel set up.

=XTD Stage 3 Racing Clutch=
$129.00 on EBAY

This is a 6 puck MIBA copper ceramic clutch. I have had mine for about 30,000 miles on my NA/KA. the enguagement is pretty stiff and took a little bit to get used to , but once I did it got fun. My car can launches hard and I can pop the clutch and spin tires if I want to on my stock KA. They are rated to 320HP

Some recent stage 3 clutch pressure plate has very light pedal pressure. It's not a very solid feeling and definitely not suitable for drifting.

      <comment>/* Greddy */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Several Brands of Headers are Available for the 240SX Including:

==Hotshot==

==OBX==
EGR inlet on the headers didn't line up well with the EGR pipe running from behind the engine. Had to extend the o2 sensor wire. The steering bolt scraps the headers causing car to &quot;catch&quot; briefly. Irritating, but you can notice a reasonable power gain.

==Greddy==
The Greddy header is a 4-1 short header design that bolts to a secondary &quot;downpipe&quot; that ends at the location of the stock cat. These headers are prone to cracking, welds giving up around the collector and the flange on the head. These headers are very loud.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Mass Air Flow Sensor (MAFS) measures the amount of air that has passed through the intake.  This information is used by the ECU to determine how much fuel should be mixed with the air.

The limit of a stock 240SX MAFS can be mixed with enough fuel to generate about 250hp.  Air flow beyond this amount is not properly metered, meaning not enough fuel will mix with the air.  This can lead to engine detonation (air/fuel mixture exploding spontaneously in the combustion chamber before the spark plug fires), and can destroy an engine.

One method for modification to a MAFS is to &quot;trick&quot; the sensor, in conjunction with larger flow injectors.  For instance, the popular 370cc injectors swapped the SR20 engine will flow approximately 30% more fuel than stock injectors.  By increasing the cross-sectional area of the intake piping by 30%, the MAFS unwittingly sends the correct signal to an standard ECU to mix a good A/F ratio.  This technique should be used with caution because if you are using a turbo to increase air flow and a modified intake pipe, the ECU will adjust the air/fuel ratio but not the ignition timing and this can damage the engine.  Some options to counter this problem are to back off the base timing, or use a product such as MSD's Boost Timing Master to retard the timing under boost.

The safer, and more popular modifications for a MAFS are to swap with other units that can meter more air.  This is typically done in combination with an upgraded ECU and injectors.  The Z32 MAFS is probably the most popular.  The Q45 MAFS is another option, and some have reported success with a Ford Mustang MAFS.  Your ECU must be aware of this change.  Jim Wolf Tech offers reprogrammed ECUs for Z32 and Mustang MAFS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aftermarket ECU's'''

Engines in today’s cars are controlled by computers known as engine control units or ECU’s. These ECU’s control all aspects of the motor’s operation, including ignition, timing, fuel delivery and spark. They are programmed to deliver a specific balance of air and fuel to the motor. This balance is also known as the air/fuel ratio (a/f ratio) When the motor is modified with upgraded components such as larger injectors, bigger turbo, cams, boost level, air fuel meter, the stock ECU is unable to maintain the proper air fuel ratio. A lack or overabundance of air or fuel will blow the motor. To prevent this from happening, aftermarket companies also manufacture ECU upgrades to allow the motor to run with the upgraded components and provide the proper a/f ratio and ultimately increase horsepower, torque and overall performance.

There are 2 types of fuel computers: Piggyback and standalone. Piggyback fuel computers only control ignition timing and fuel delivery. The stock ECU controls all other functions of the motor. Standalone fuel computers are a &quot;plug and play&quot; setup where you replace the stock ECU with the aftermarket ECU. The after market standalone controls all aspects of the engine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A piggy back EMS system intercepts the signals from the load sensors, modifies them, then inputs them into the ECU. This can be an effective way to tune your engine.

'''''Travels with Charley: Search of America''''' is a [[:w:travelogue|travelogue]] by [[:w:American|American]] author [[:w:John Steinbeck|John Steinbeck]].  It documents the driving trip he took with his [[:w:poodle|poodle]], Charley, around the [[:w:United States|United States]] in the [[:w:1960s|1960s]].  He wrote that he was moved by a desire to see his country on a personal level, since he made his living writing about it. He had many questions going into his journey, the main one being &quot;What are Americans like today&quot;. However, he found that the &quot;new America&quot; did not live up to his expectations.

He traveled throughout the United States in a specially made camper called Rocinante, named after the horse of [[:w:Don Quixote|Don Quixote]]. He started his travels in Long Island, New York. His trip was one that outlined the border of the United States, going all throughout the North, through the Pacific Northwest, down into his native Salinas Valley, across to Texas, up through the Deep South, and then back to New York. His whole trip encompassed nearly 10,000 miles.

== Summaries: Part 1 ==
In the two chapters of Part 1, [[:w:Steinbeck|Steinbeck]] describes his life long wanderlust and his preparations to travel the country after 25 years.  He is 58 years old in 1960 and at the end of his career, but he felt that he &quot;was writing of something ''he'' did not know about, and it seemed to ''him'' that in a so-called writer this is criminal&quot; (6).  He has a truck custom-designed for his journey and plans on leaving after Labor Day from his home in [[:w:Sag Harbor|Sag Harbor]], Long Island, New York.  Steinbeck must delay his trip slightly due to [[:w:Hurricane Donna|Hurricane Donna]] which makes a direct hit on Long Island.  He demonstrates his determination and toughness, even at his age, in wading out in the harbor at the height of the storm to save his boat the ''Fayre Eleyne''.

== Summaries: Part 2 ==
=== Long Island to Connecticut (pages 19-42) ===
In the first chapter of Part Two, Steinbeck begins his trip, traveling by ferry (boat) from Long Island &lt;ref&gt;https://www.longislandferry.com/Default.asp&lt;/ref&gt; to Connecticut.  Whilst on a ferry, Steinbeck cautiously watches a group of submarines surface, and discusses the new atomic submarines with a sailor as they approach the Naval Submarine Base New London[http://americanhistory.si.edu/Subs/const/index.html] where many of the new [[:w:nuclear submarines|nuclear submarines]] are stationed.  This introduces a theme that hangs over this chapter as Steinbeck notes that the &quot;''submarines are armed with mass murder, our silly, only way of deterring mass murder''&quot; (21).  He talks to a sailor stationed on a sub who enjoys being on them because they offer all kinds of – future” (22).  Steinbeck seems to credit this uncertainty about the future to rapid technological and political changes.   He mentions the wastefulness of American cities (start with second paragraph of article to see how NYC &quot;dealt&quot; with waste problems) and society, and the large amount of waste as a result of everything being &quot;packaged&quot; (as he passes Hartford and Providence).
Moving on, Steinbeck purchases a large quantity of liquors. Then, he meets a friendly farmer who allows him to park on his property; the two discuss Kruschev and politics.   
Steinbeck discusses many common points brought up in society today. That stage in life where everyone has to slow down because they are “not as young as they once were” is one of the barriers he mentions. He goes on to say that he would rather not settle down. He wants to live life as long as he can (19). 
He also brings up that as we grow old, and aren’t able to do as much as we would like it, we tend to get sympathy and concern from a lot of people. This makes the oldest of the family almost become baby like. Steinbeck comments that he would rather be a grown adult than a big baby (20). 

He has a discussion with a farmer in the White Mountains &lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitwhitemountains.com/&lt;/ref&gt; about Krushchev’s visit to the United Nations&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/29/newsid_3087000/3087171.stm&lt;/ref&gt; and the approaching presidential election&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/kennedy-nixon/kennedy-nixon.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.  The two seem to conclude that a combination of fear and uncertainty over the future has limited discussion over the election.  Steinbeck seems to learn more about local people through morning radio, although he notes that due to the [[:w:Top 40|Top 40]]: &quot;If ''Teen-Age Angel''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jacquedee63.com/teenangel.html&lt;/ref&gt; is top of the list in Maine, it is the top of the list in Montana&quot; (35).    

==== Reading Guide Questions for pages 19-42 ====
* What causes the fears people seem to have of the future at this time?
* Why might Steinbeck feel that the beginning of the nuclear age is limiting political discussion?
* Do the new national charts (Top 40) minimize regional cultural differences?
* What do you think are some events or reasons why America wastes so much more than other countries?

=== Maine (pages 43-74) ===
Steinbeck starts off this part of his journey on [[:w:US Highway 1|US Highway 1]] for a visit to [[:w:Maine|Maine]]. On his way to Maine he notices a commonality between most of the “summer” stores. They are all closed for the winter. Antique shops, that border a lot of the roads up North, sell old “junk” that Steinbeck would buy if he thought he had room for it. During his trip, he stops at a little restaurant just outside the town of [[:w:Bangor|Bangor]]. It’s here he learns that other people’s attitudes can greatly affect your own attitude. As his journey to discover America continues, Steinbeck heads towards Deer Isle. He decides to go to Deer Isle because a friend of his went every time he traveled to Maine. His friend always raved about [[:w:Deer Isle, Maine|Deer Isle, Maine]], but could never describe exactly what about it was so captivating. When Steinbeck arrived at the house where he was supposed to stay, he met a very terse cat and ate the best lobster he had ever tasted.  For the final part of his visit to Maine, Steinbeck traveled around several towns throughout the state and visited popular outdoor clothing stores such as [[:w:Abercrombie and Fitch|Abercrombie and Fitch]].

In this section, Steinbeck makes quite a few references to the changes in the culture of America in this segment. The first change that he makes apparent early on in this section is the waitress in the restaurant of an auto court located outside of Bangor. This waitress sucked all of the happiness out of everyone with her dismal attitude. He, being tired from a long day of driving, could not resist and had his happiness drained away. To add to his depression, many of the hotel items were covered in plastic, making the room feel less homely and welcome. It was only when Charley made Steinbeck walk him and he saw the Aurora Borealis did he regain his joy and awe of this country. This incident is an example of the change of American culture from a homely society to a protect-by-alienation society. 

Another change he noticed was during his journey to Deer Isle. Being a man who constantly finds himself lost he asked a state trooper for directions. He had been warned, later on of course, to never ask a local for directions because they will often mislead you. While the officer did NOT mislead him, being that he is bound by the law to assist, he did not say a word to Steinbeck. He merely pointed and motioned to the destination in which he wanted to go. Through this act the officer displayed that people had become less trusting of those they did not know. Aroostook County, being one of the three great potato producers of our country according to Steinbeck, during the planting/harvesting season is home to many French Canadians who have crossed the border to make a small profit. In his travels to northern Maine before turning west, Steinbeck came across one such family of workers. While cautious at first, the Canucks, as they have come to be called, were very friendly with Steinbeck. As an act of good will Steinbeck opened an old bottle of Cognac he was saving for a special occasion, and it was with this that the family really became sociable. While not exactly American, the Canucks display that small part that still exists inside those of the time. Although the threat of Communism appeared to everywhere and everyone had to be cautious, inside they were all just as friendly as the Canucks. 

Most of this section was to remind people that Maine was very large and although vastly empty as far as person per square mile went still very much an important aspect of the United States’ culture in the 1950’s. The auto court, the protective yet bothersome aspect of life, the state trooper being an embodiment of many suspicious and cautious people, and Aroostook County being a place of un-American yet inner American migrant farmers.

=== Upstate New York and Niagara Falls (74-94) ===
On pages 74-94, Steinbeck travels to the  Niagara Falls.  As he travels on, he experiences the way people are different everywhere he goes.  He describes how wherever you go people’s attitudes and beliefs are going to change depending on where you are. For example, when he went to New England, he saw that people there spoke tersely and usually waited for the newcomer to come up to them and confront them. He explained how strangers talked more freely without caution as a sense of longing for something new and being somewhere other than the place they were.  They were so used to their everyday life that when someone new came to town, they were eager to explore new information and imagine new places. 
 
John Steinbeck talks about a lot of different things he comes across. He talks about the Connecticut River [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_River] at points and how he doesn’t remember it being so long and wide. On his way navigating the river he comes across a motel, but to his disappointment, it is empty. He spends the night in his car with Charley and leaves the next morning feeling like he was a trespasser. Going up the Connecticut to New England also drew his attention as he saw people’s attitudes change. New Englanders were more to themselves, so Steinbeck would have to come up to each of them for help.

Niagara Falls [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagra_Falls] is one of the largest water falls in North America, and also serves as the borderline between New York (United States) and Canada. Steinbeck talks about how when he was younger, the laws of getting into and out of Canada were a lot less limiting then they were now. He becomes angry when he is forced to turn around to go get Charley vaccinated before moving on. 

Traveling further, Steinbeck discovers that America and technology is quickly advancing to give Americans instant gratification.  Vending machines became a big part of America, and started at Steinbeck’s early age. They started off as snack machines only, but through more advanced technology, they can fit whole meals that Steinbeck gets, such as hot soup, coffee, toiletries and even aspirin by simply putting money in a machine. He is very impressed with how the technology seemed to get better in his absence.

Steinbeck’s last day in Vermont is a Sunday, and he puts on his best suit, shaves, and combs his hair to go to church. Sitting in the John Knox [http://www.greatsite.com/timeline-english-bible-history/john-knox.html] church and listening to the minister gave him a new perspective on sins in life. They weren’t just tiny things that were harmful to children, but should also be considered as big things, that should be taken with dignity. The minister says they are “No damn good”. Steinbeck is so impressed, he gives the church five dollars, and stays after to shake hands with and speak to the minister.

Truck drivers now-a-days are always seen on roadways, but to find them at rest stops [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_stop] and actually talk to them was a thrill for Steinbeck. He notices how these people are just like the men he met out at sea, who have touched base in every major port in the world, and how truckers are similar only on land. He is fascinated how they set goals for their work, and know almost everything there is to know about America, from the driving, to the rest stops and waitresses. He likes talking to them because they open up to him more, as do other people in Mid-western states. He can also see small towns, become big cities from when he was a boy, and loves the idea of knowing where you’re going, but remembering where you’re coming from.

==== Reading Guide Questions for pages 74-94 ====
* How have the advancements of technology affected the attitudes and beliefs of American citizens?
* Why do you think that Steinbeck writes about the government and what reasons do you find for him disliking the government?
* How did people's attitudes in different states affect the way John Steinbeck viewed America?
* How has traveling changed since Steinbeck's time (motels, interstates, and highways)?

=== Midwest Cities (95-125) ===
In the beginning of the section, John Steinbeck travels to the Midwest states. As he travels he notices a change in the growth of cities in the Midwest versus the last time he went (pg 105, 95). Also, he notices the overall family population growing. As he begins to talk to the locals he makes the point of contrasting the emotions of people in the north versus people in the Midwest. Another thing that was mentioned a lot during this section were the stereotype of a woman. They are often used for advertising during this time period (pg 117-118). He says that they welcomed a newcomer in their town with warmth and curiosity unlike people in New England (pg 107-108). 

Traveling further, Steinbeck notices the advancing technology, which leads him to the overall curiosity about Mobile homes. One of the important things he notices are the house hold appliances and the televisions. Televisions become colored during this time period which was a huge impact in the technological industry (98-99). He begins interviewing families that live their life in a mobile home. They discuss points like, if you are living in a mobile home and you are ready to move on to a new place or job, you simply &quot;pick up&quot; your mobile home and leave (pg 95-104).

As he moves deeper in the Midwest, Steinbeck begins to see the colors of the people living down there. He realizes that the number of people immigrating to America has changed over time. He learns that because of immigration in the past it effects a families &quot;roots&quot; and discovers the Nationality act of 1965. He makes conversation with a man that enters his camping site, and discovers more about the lifestyle that development since his last trip there (110-113). At the end of the section, John Steinbeck starts to develop a character in his mind called Lonesome Harry while he was sitting in a room. This character develops and takes life until the end of the section (223-225). 

==== Reading Guide Questions for pages 95-125 ====
* Do you think that if your family comes from some place foreign or their heritage is not American, their ways of life will be different from a typical American?
* Do you think one area of the United States is more materialistic than the others?

== Summaries: Part 3 ==
=== Wisconsin and North Dakota (125-157) ===
In the Wisconsin and North Dakota section of ''Travels with Charley'', Steinbeck travels to many places such as Sauk Centre and Illinois. Sauk Centre is a city Steinbeck travels through to get to North Dakota. Sauk Centre was also home to Sinclair Lewis whom Steinbeck knew. 
Upon stopping in the visitors center, he laments at being forced to leave behind the wondrous W.P.A Guides To The States[http://www.mydfz.com/wpa/wpa.htm]. 
Some other places he mentioned include St. Paul and Minneapolis. Minneapolis is the largest city in Minnesota. Steinbeck gets lost in the city to which one person replies, &quot;How can you get lost in Minneapolis?&quot; 

Steinbeck stops at a diner for directions and realizes that our American society is oblivious to its surrounding, life, and culture. Steinbeck mentions that Americans have put &quot;cleanliness first, at the expense of taste&quot; (141) (as he travels through [[:w:Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo, North Dakota]]), and that the mentality of our nation has grown bland. Allowing his thoughts to slip back to his time in Minnesota, Steinbeck says, &quot;It looks as though the natural contentiousness of people has died&quot; (142) implying the seemingly political ignorance that the society seemed to cling to, and bringing before our eyes the lack of risk our once rebellious nation now embraces. Throughout the section Steinbeck uses simple, symbolic entities he encounters in his travels to express his views of the mindset of the country. For instance, he goes on at one point to speak of a herd of turkey, and after casting criticism and ridicule at the source of [[:w:Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving]] dinner, ends this string of insults with an unexpected transition to American life. He states, &quot; And suddenly I thought of that valley of the turkeys and wondered how I could have the gall to think turkeys stupid. Indeed, they have an advantage over us. They are good to eat&quot;(129). The section closes with John Steinbeck and Charley getting ready to head to Montana and encounter whatever epiphanies may come.

Steinbeck says “Do they find their emotional fair so bland that it must be ladened with sex and sadism through the medium of paperback.” He is speaking of how books with these aspects often draw more attention from the society of that day because these components made books more exciting and enjoyable to the people in society. When applied to a broader scale of things, life in general, things that are deemed as “bad” by society are more stimulating to many people of that society and even society today. When a form of entertainment is composed of these bad things such as “sex, sadism and homicide”, it becomes more appealing to society. He relates this to food because he believes that society “has put cleanliness first, instead of taste”, this applies what he is trying to get across with the books as well. Often society will sacrifice quality for what is exciting or arousing to them. What is deemed as acceptable by the society itself is mainly what populates the minds and thoughts of those in it. What is deemed “cool” is often used in place of the real quality of something far superior, but cast away into the darkness, fore it is deemed “unworthy” by those who cannot or will not value its worth. 

Steinbeck speaks of politics of the time as not discussed much. “It seemed to me partly cautious and partly lack of interest, but strong opinions were just not stated”, by this Steinbeck is speaking of society being afraid to speak out. The society of the time was based on conformity, and speaking out against the government was like blasphemy. At the time there was much to be afraid of, if you spoke against the government or America or had anything to do with the sort, you might be accused of being a communist and even executed on terms of treason or espionage. Of course, the government needs to be spoken out against from time to time; there have been enough scandals to verify this. A few paragraphs after this Steinbeck meets a man who opens up a new understanding of political feeling of the time. After some conversation pertain to this, the man says “Oh, sure, hardly a day goes by that somebody doesn’t take a belt at the Russians.” It is revealed here that there is allot of hostility against the Russians at this time and many people blamed unfortunate mishappenings on them. In the society of time “Nobody can find fault with you if you take out after the Russians.” Once again conformity in society is seen, people used the Russians [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_war] as a scapegoat for their own personal faults. As long as you stayed in one belief, against the Russians, you were secure from your own flaws. The man also states, “You think then we might be using Russians as an outlet for something else, other things” and &quot;Why, I remember when people took everything out on Mr. Roosevelt” these two things put society and politics hand in hand yet again. In society mistakes are very unwanted, people want to be perfect and they want their country to be perfect. Society often takes every problem with itself or its environment on one centralized being or group. At that time it was the Russians.

==== Reading Guide Questions for pages 125-157 ====
* What does Steinbeck mean by Americans having put &quot;cleanliness first, at the expense of taste?&quot; How do you know? 
* John Steinbeck ties turkeys to humans at one point during his inner pondering. What statement may he being saying about American lifestyle and attitude in comparison to turkeys? 
* John Steinbeck talks about the evacuation route on US Highway 10 in this section.  What do you think that the Evacuation Route symbolizes in society? What fears does it represent?

=== Montana, Yellowstone, Idaho, and Washington (158-180) ===
In this section Steinbeck notices differences between himself and other people, between his home life and the way life is for those in different states.  &quot;I am in love with Montana,&quot; says Steinbeck on page 158. He explains this as a place unaffected by television, and a place with kind, laid back individuals. &quot;It seemed to me that the frantic bustle of America was not in Montana&quot; (158).  Here he also pays his respects to the Sioux chief Sitting Bull, which to him represents how people once were so infatuated with their land, they'd risk anything to keep it, fight until the end, like Sitting Bull and his fight for land. 

In the next part of this section, Steinbeck is in Custer, at the battlefield of [[:w:Little Big Horn|Little Big Horn]]. He travels through the Injun Country and thinks of an author who wrote a novel about war against the [[:w:Nez Perce|Nez Perce]] tribes. Steinbeck here shows a theme that opposes war, in his book, the author explains: &quot;It was the saddest duty he had ever preformed&quot; (160).
Steinbeck and Charley then travel to [[:w:Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone National Park]] (161) which is a place that &quot;is no more representative of America than [[:w:Disneyland|Disneyland]]&quot; (161).  These parts, along with others from the book, are examples of the theme that your mood changes with your surroundings. This theme is also apparent when Charley sees the bears in Yellowstone. Steinbeck is surprised at his aggressive and crazy behavior (164).

The next visit is to the [[:w:Great Divide|Great Divide]] in the Rocky Mountains. He thinks of the French explorers [[:w:Lewis and Clark|Lewis and Clark]] and wonders whether or not the men were impressed with what they found in America. This thought adds to the idea that the people who live in beautiful places, often don't realize it, and they take what they have for granted.  He also expresses how the explorers would find modern people lazy. For instance, it took those men two and a half years to travel to the Pacific Ocean from St. Louis. Now, it takes just a month if you dawdle, a week if you drive, and five hours if you fly. Steinbeck makes people today seem small and sluggish, like if they don't have any real accomplishments even a tenth as remarkable as what these men did.

Finally, Steinbeck constantly shows that people are never happy staying in one place. He shows this through the eyes of the teenager he meets at the cabins. The teenager, along with many people in the book so far, are constantly wondering what it is like somewhere else, they are never content with what they have (171-172).

* Why was it so important for Steinbeck to visit General Custer and Sitting Bull? 
* Does Steinbeck's actions make him seem like a true American?
* If you could change one thing about Americans what would it be? How would this impact America? 
* What is Steinbeck's point when he says that Yellowstone &quot;is no more representative of America than Disneyland (161).&quot;

=== Seattle, Oregon, and California (180-208) ===
In these pages Steinbeck visits the West Coast. First he goes to Seattle, Washington. He notices how much the city has changed. Before it was a small city sitting on a hill with lots of rural and country roads surrounding it, but now it has eight-lane highways and is a lot more industrialized. 
Steinbeck grew up around this area, so much of this section is him revisiting the area and seeing it’s changes and progressions. During this section Steinbeck makes a reflection when seeing the [[:w:Columbia River|Columbia River]] (180) and how [[:w:Lewis and Clark|Lewis and Clark]] (180) must have felt when coming west. After this he notices the change that the west has underwent and he says on page 180 that “It was only as I approached Seattle that the unbelievable change became apparent.” A main point he states, while seeing all of this change and modernization is “I wonder why progress looks so much like destruction.”(181) This shows that he sees it as a possible detriment to the area and to the authenticity of the land. 

Later on, while driving in Oregon he blows a tire and has to try to fix it, and he does just enough so that he gets to a small service station. There, a scary looking man (the owner) helps Steinbeck and arranges for larger tires to be brought to Steinbeck. This is when Steinbeck realizes that you can’t judge a person by appearance. Though the specialized tires were hard to come by, the problem was solved in mere hours by the unexpected generosity of the gas station attendant.

In the next section, Steinbeck focuses on the giant redwood trees[http://www.shannontech.com/ParkVision/Redwood/RedRedwoods.html] (188) and ancient [[:w:Sequoia|Sequoia]] Trees (195) that he has come to appreciate and adore in his lifetime. He says, “The vainest, most slap-happy and irreverent of men, in the presence of redwoods, goes under a spell of wonder and respect.”(189) This quote shows this appreciation, and more of the things he says to describe the trees really displays the way he is fearing this lack of appreciation as the times become more modern. “‘If I thought he did it out of spite or to make a joke,’ I said to myself, ‘I’d kill him out of hand.’”(191) Steinbeck thinks this to himself when his loyal companion Charley cannot appreciate the trees as he can. 

In the next sections, he visits a bar of his youth where he meets and catches up with many friends, learning that a lot of regulars and childhood chums have passed away. Steinbeck thinks about how he is a ghost since all the people he grew up with were dead.  He then heads up to Fremont’s Peakseems to say goodbye to his hometown for the last time. During the time it takes for him to say good bye he makes an allusion to a book by Thomas Wolfe [http://www.ah.dcr.state.nc.us/sections/hs/wolfe/Main.htm] ''You Can't Go Home Again''(201) This section of the story is concluded with, “I printed once more on my eyes, south, west, and north, and then we hurried away from the permanent and changeless past where my mother is always shooting a wildcat and my father is always burning his name with his love.”(208). This shows that even though he knows the country is changing, his memories of the towns he lived in will always be with him.

== Summaries: Part 4 ==
=== Arizona, New Mexico, Texas (219-248) ===
This section of the story follows John Steinbeck and his dog Charley through Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. He does not spend much time in Arizona or New Mexico, but he does appreciate the beauty of the vast mountains in those regions (227-230). We discover how close Steinbeck is to his dog, and get a deeper look at their relationship. The majority of the section is based on Texas where he spends a few days over Thanksgiving.

Upon arriving in Texas Steinbeck discovers that Charley is ill, but he took him to a veterinarian and learned that Charley merely had Prostatitis and that a few days stay would cure him (235). Steinbeck describes Texas and its different aspects that make it very unique from other states. He comments on the Panhandle [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/PP/ryp1.html] which is the Northern most part of the state where Texas borders New Mexico and Oklahoma. Steinbeck also comments on the Rio Grande Valley,[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_Valley] which is really a delta rather than a valley.
 
Steinbeck felt that &quot;people either passionately love or passionately hate Texas,&quot; referring to people who are just passersby like himself (229). He discusses a book about a tiny group of rich Texans that was written by Edna Ferber [http://www.apl.org/history/ferber/edna.bio.html], and relates it to his own experience with a family similar to the one in the book.  Steinbeck stays with this family with his wife who flew into the state to celebrate Thanksgiving. The two of them visit friends and have a Thanksgiving party. Also on Thanksgiving Steinbeck goes quail hunting with some of the men (235-242). He then goes on to talk about the black and white relations in the South compared to the relations in the North and in his hometown of Salinas, California, sharing the theory of &quot;[[:w:separate but equal|separate but equal]]’ (248). Steinbeck writes about the desegregation of schools [http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/18_03/stra183.shtml] and how there is a change in the North. In the southern states, such as Texas, he mentions a bit about how when people are not proud of something they have been involved in, that they don't like to welcome any witnesses, because they believe that witnesses may be the ones causing all the trouble. This enables him to revert back to his childhood in California, writing about an African-American family that he knew, the Coopers, and never seemed threatened by them or noticed much of a difference, relating back to black and white relations[http://www.oycf.org/Perspectives/4_022900/black_white.htm] during that time. 

In the last pages of this section, Steinbeck comments briefly on his home town of Salinas, California. “Although people around the country are individuals, certain customs and characteristics are similar,” (244). Steinbeck makes a number of statements about politics, human nature, and regional differences. In the quote above, he is stating that through out his travels he has noticed that no matter where you travel in the Unites States, the people might be different but our culture is for the most part everywhere. He realizes that although Americans are individuals and come from different regions, he also realizes that “there are many customs that assimilate then into like-minded people.&quot; 
 
==== Reading Guide Questions for pages 219-248 ====
* When you traveled to a different state, was it different as your home state or the same?
* Steinbeck says, “The south is a place of hatred, violence, and bigotry,” (pg. 243-248). Why do you think that Steinbeck feels this way about the south?
* Do Steinbeck's comments about Texas reflect what he finds in the rest of the South?

=== New Orleans and Mississippi (249-273) ===
In the second to last chapter of Part Four, Steinbeck is drawn to the “distortion of normal life” (249) and leaves Texas in search of the so-called &quot;Cheerleaders&quot;[http://www.southerninstitute.info/civil_rights_education/divided12.html] (256) who are protesting the integration of black children in a school in New Orleans.  Before reaching the city, Steinbeck welcomes in the “singing language of [[:w:Acadia|Acadia]]” (252) while recalling the memory of an old friend, Dr. St. Martin, who healed children and Cajuns. Upon entering New Orleans, Steinbeck immediately encounters the racism of the South and soon finds that racism was not only towards blacks, but also towards Jews, “ It’s the goddamn New York Jews cause all the trouble” (254). Steinbeck then experiences the “bestial and filthy” 256) show that the Cheerleaders put on while the black children entered school. The applause and praise of the crowd brought Steinbeck to realize that there were no thoughtful people like his old friends Lyle Saxon and Roark Bradford, in the city and that they had “left New Orleans misrepresented to the world” (259). After the incident, Steinbeck no longer desired to visit some of his favorite places, like Gallatoir’s Restaurant [http://www.gayot.com/restaurantpages/info.php?tag=NORES9946&amp;code=NO], fearing more racially divided ideals. In search of a secluded place, he sits beside the Father of Waters or [[:w:Mississippi River|Mississippi River]], and encounters a man who looks similar to Greco San Pablo. They eat together and talk of Lewis Carroll [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/carroll/carrollov.html] and the “queer” (261) epitaph by Rober John Croswell. After giving a ride to both a wary black man and a racist white man, Steinbeck becomes aware that the Southern people are afraid to change their way of life just as the [[:w:Cockneys|Cockneys]] children in London were and that they will accept that fear despite the Gandhi inspired works of Martin Luther King.  

==== Reading Guide Questions for pages 249-273 ====
* Why do you think that the &quot;Cheerleaders&quot; protesting was censored in the media and do you think the media was for or against integration based on their censoring? 
* Do you think it is within human nature to discriminate? Why or why not? 
* Why do you think race is so important in this section?

Mehercule! There are numerous grammatical errors in this guide...pending full review, I recommend these translations be approached cum grano salis.

I believe that it should not be &quot;ubi vivis&quot;  &quot;ubi habitas.&quot;

:Salve! Please go ahead, be bold and correct them. Etiam, know that some of us are trying to see if Latin can be learned to be spoken. Gratias ago.--[[User:Jondel|Jondel]] 08:43, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Quot annes habes?&quot; seems wrong.  It should be &quot;Quot annos habes?&quot;

Why are there macrons on some words but not others? --[[http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usor:Secundus_Zephyrus Zephyrus]]

&quot;Tūne Paula es?&quot; doesn't look quite right to me. Shouldn't it be &quot;Esne tū Paula?&quot;?

== NPOV deviation ==

Goodness, there is plenty of deviation from NPOV here.

&quot;The strongest claims for the Italian pronunciation are its undeniable beauty ...&quot; I shan't deny it either, but this implies it has more beauty than the classical pronunciation. This is wholly subjective.

&quot;'Classical' pronounciation ... makes the claim that it is what the ancient Romans actually spoke, although the claim remains uncertain as the classical pronunciation is a reconstruction based on philological research.&quot; It goes on to cite &lt;i&gt;Vox Latina&lt;/i&gt;, which has statements of ancient grammarians and other direct evidence.

&quot;To some, the classical rules ... produce an unpleasing effect.&quot; Weasel words, and ones that can go the other way, too. [[User:Carolus|Carolus]] 04:13, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>The front brake q45 description was incorrect.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many brake upgrades for the 240sx.  Bellow is a list of them and the process of putting them together.

=Stock brake spec and known compatible replacements=
Front options for S-chassis

s13 USDM ('89-'94) rotors are 252x20mm (non ABS) or 257x22mm (with ABS)

180SX/Altima rotors are 280x22mm

Z32 rotors are 280x 26mm or 30mm


rear options for S-chassis

S13 - 10&quot; non-vented rotor, smaller single piston caliper, integral handbrake

S14/S15 - 10&quot; non-vented rotor, larger single piston caliper, integral handbrake

A31 Cefiro - 10.5&quot; vented rotor, smaller single piston caliper, drum handbrake

J30/Q45 - 11&quot; vented rotor, larger single piston caliper, drum handbrake

Z32/R32 - 11.75&quot; vented rotor, 2-piston caliper, drum handbrake

=General notes on brakes=
When considering upgrading brakes several factors tie in to the end result. An often overlooked function of a braking configuration is the bias. Brakes should not be upgraded in front or rear only.  Rather, the amount of applied braking torque should be increased proportionally front and rear for appropriate feel/bias (e.g. 6 piston front brakes with stainless lines up front and stock pads/lines in the rear can actually decrease overall braking performance).

'''I cannot emphasize enough how important bias is in a braking setup. Just being able to lock-up your front tires easier does NOT mean you are now able to stop quicker!!'''

'''All''' the parts need to be considered in a braking setup to determine if its right for you!

==Master Cylinder==
If you get a larger or smaller master cylinder then for every inch of pedal travel more fluid will be pushed through the lines. Don't just go buying a random larger MC without knowing the specifications, as these have internal valving that determines brake front and rear bias which will severely impact your braking performance.

==Pads==
There are many aftermarket pad companies that produce sport oriented brake pads. There are many different materials a pad may be comprised of, each having its own individual properties. This will impact dust creation &amp; color, rotor &amp; pad wear rate, and A very important thing: '''EVERY PAD HAS A HEAT RANGE.''' This means the pad will ONLY function optimally within a given set of temperatures. OEM brake pads are usually designed to function well in very cold temperatures to moderate braking. When you have had several large hard stops they heat up to a certain point and get out of their range causing the pad to not have the same braking torque and &quot;glaze&quot; the surface.  Glazing is a condition in which the properties of the outermost contact layers change and it essentially polishes the mating surface, decreasing the normal grip levels. This is PERMANENT damage to the pads!  There is a wide range of compounds from stock all the way up to full race. Note that a pad designed for full race will NOT grab sufficiently during daily street driving and you will be unable to stop normally! Get a pad that suits your driving environment and/or style.  If you are going to the track, consider using 2 sets of pads and swap them out at the track.

==Rotors==
Rotors in a braking system do 2 things. They act as a heatsink so they absorb heat when you brake, and dissipate it normally from air moving over them. The larger the rotor, the more the metal. The more the metal, the more heat can be absorbed during braking and the more fade resistance your car will have. Stock brake rotors are &quot;blanks&quot;; this means that they are just a flat surface. This is the surface your brake pad will mate to and provides the largest total available clamping area per revolution. There are several different variations of the standard brake rotor; some of them are often misunderstood and aren't quite as relevant today as they once were.

[['''Slotting:''']] Doing this to a brake rotor does have benefits, but is more visually appealing than beneficial. Slotting a rotor provides angled slots along the surface that exist to help wipe the pad surface clean on every pass. This ensures a fresh pad surface at all times and it does in fact help protect a pad against fade since it always scrapes off the top layer. It also helps with water and debris evacuation.
There are several problems with slots however that outweigh these benefits. One of them is the fact that part of the brake pad is not in contact with the rotor at any given time. This means a lower total square inch area of friction material doing what its there for - applying braking torque. If part of your pad isn't touching, then what's the purpose of it being there? Another issue is with the manufacturing process and physical properties. A slotted rotor is thinner in some areas and although more structurally sound than cross drilling, it still weakens the rotor by providing.  This makes the rotor more prone to warping. Another problem depends on if you get a more &quot;economy&quot; production. This means the fresh blank gets churned out in high numbers by a shop that isn't doing it for a quality name but the almighty dollar. In turn, they are cut too hard and too fast by the machine making metals first heat treating an uneven distribution. Its heat treated around and in the cut but the areas nearby don't get hot enough so the isolated spots modified the grain structure of the metal permanently but not all of it. This will also make them more prone to warping. Another problem with slotted rotors is they can tend to create an undesirable pulsating pedal feel by nature. The level is application variant (i.e. larger or more numerous slots translate to more pulsing).

[['''Cross drilling:''']]
Cross-drilling a rotor is a practice adopted probably 50 years ago when the materials for a braking pad were mainly a crude organic base. These pads when heated would produce a gas that would get trapped between the pad and the rotor and making a cushion of air between the pad and the rotor.  Cross-drilling was created to give the gas an area to escape through. '''MOST MODERN RACING PADS ARE DESIGNED WITH DIFFERENT METALLIC MATERIALS THAT ALMOST NEVER PRODUCE MORE THAN A FINITE LEVEL OF GAS.'''  This means that cross-drilling a rotor is no longer needed in 99% of applications. Because of the previous need and the stylish benefits these are still widely sold and people are very misinformed on their need. Cross-drilled rotors have a large amount of metal removed and suffer the same problems of slotting. This metal is not in contact with the pad so that is less overall available pad contact surface area for braking torque. This also means less metal available to absorb heat, essentially functioning as if you had a smaller rotor. Also similar to slotted roters, production of cross-drilled rotors can be problematic if they are drilled too fast, causing the initial heat treating to be in isolated spots, and modifying the grain structure of the metal permanently. Another issue is when drilled, a rotor may receive microscopic cracks in the surrounding area. This can cause severe issues, perhaps to the point that a rotor may actually CRACK IN HALF! If you feel you must have cross-drilled rotors for looks, don't get &quot;economy&quot; versions. The best quality cross-drilled rotors have the holes actually CAST or FORGED into the rotor and have a much lower loss in structural integrity.

==Brake Lines==
Braided stainless steel lines are a great upgrade for any brake system with rubber lines. OEM brake lines tend to be a very soft rubber that expands slightly when pressure is applied. The expansion rate is not linear however so the impact on pedal feel from having them won't be either. Stainless braided lines have the metal reinforcement to deter expansion and result in a stiffer, more linear feel. When purchasing lines, consider those with a plastic or similar outer sleeve protector. This way if rubbing occurs, it wont wear through the stainless braiding, maintaining the integrity of your braking system.

==Brake Fluid==
Using quality brake fluid is very important for any performance-oriented driver. There are different classifications and rating systems by the department of transportation that determine the minimum dry and wet boiling temperatures. The higher the boiling temperature, the more likely you are able to resist high heat braking without gassing out the lines. Boiling brake fluid introduces air pockets instead of fluid which compress when pressure is applied vs the fluid. This means the pedal might sink to the floor but any line pressure isn't getting to the caliper! That can be very dangerous, and you can tell if your brake fluid is getting to the point where its been boiled by looking at it. fluid appears white if it has ever boiled and should be changed.

		Dry / Wet boiling temp

DOT 3  		401ºF  	284º F POLYGLYCOL ETHER BASED FLUID

DOT 4 		446º F 	311º F POLYGLYCOL ETHER BASED FLUID

DOT 5 		500º F 	356º F SILICONE BASED FLUID

DOT 5.1 	518º F 	375º F POLYGLYCOL ETHER BASED FLUID

Dry boiling temp is the fluid in its virgin state. Wet boiling temp is the fluid + 3% water by volume.

Dot 3,4, and 5.1 are all inter-mixable without any negatives. Dot 5 fluid is silicone based and cannot be mixed.
Silicone fluid has its ups and down. It is non corrosive to paint unlike normal brake fluid, and it doesn't mix with water so its boiling temps stay the same (actually a negative) Since it doesn't absorb the water the water stays separate. No brake system is completely sealed and will always absorb water. If the system absorbs water but it stays separate you will have 2 fluids, one of them with a very low boiling point (bad) Silicone fluid also has more compressibility by nature and will cause a more &quot;spongy&quot; pedal feel.

Fluid sold in metal cans absorb water far less than plastic cans while on the shelves. A good common practice would be to change your brake fluid once every 6 months when your car sees a lot of &quot;spirited&quot; braking, And bleed them well every change to be sure there is no air in the system. Bleeding before/after track events is a good idea to be sure your brakes are optimal for the event and you didn't boil your fluid during.

==Calipers==

When upgrading your brake system a larger caliper may be used to provide more braking torque. There are several deciding factors with caliper choice that impact the overall effectiveness. Increasing the overall piston diameter will distribute the braking force over a larger area and generally provide more clamping force whether going to a larger piston than stock in single piston designs, or migrating to a multi piston setup. Bigger and more doesn't always mean better however. Too much braking torque for your setup might mean you can lockup the tires from just tapping the pedal, and making an &quot;on/off&quot; feel impossible to modulate. 

Choose a caliper appropriately sized for your tires and application used (just because you can lock all seasons doesn't mean you can stop efficiently on r-compounds)
Caliper mounting brackets determine the pad and caliper clamping location on the rotor. Think of it like a torque wrench... The farther out you brake the more torque you can apply to stop the car and the more overall surface area the pad will contact in 1 full revolution. It may be a sufficient enough upgrade to just get larger rotors and relocate your calipers/pads farther out by extending the bracket.

==Speed Bleeders==
An often overlooked part of the brake system is the installation of speed bleeders.  These do nothing for performance, but everything for sanity.  They make it so you can bleed the brakes efficiently and by yourself.  All you do is crack them a 1/4 turn and pump away.  there is a bearing inside the bleeder that every time you let off the pedal is returns in to stop air from coming in as well.  Very worth while thing to do, epically if you plan on track racing your car.

=Stock Upgrades=
The stock 240sx front brakes are single piston units with 9.8&quot; ventilated rotors.  The rear is a 10.2&quot; rotor and a single piston caliper with an integrated e-brake. These brakes are sufficient for most people and with appropriately upgraded pads/fluid/lines. Rule of thumb if you can lockup your brakes then a larger brake caliper is not needed for the speeds and tire compounds your using. These brakes are more than adequate for daily driving and some track use, but once your start doing some serious racing you will need to upgrade parts appropriately to handle the heat and to avoid the dreaded brake fade. The stock brakes will be great for spirited driving and light track, But research your options and decide on an upgrade appropriate to you. Several factors need to be considered. Something with larger rotors is needed for more repetitive stops, and something with a larger amount of clamping force is needed if you are not able to push your current tires to the locking point (while using pads with an appropriate heat range).

=Z32/Skyline Front Brakes=
By far the most popular brake upgrade for the 240sx.  The stock brakes on the 240sx are fine for autocross and track days on stock power, but as soon as you get more power and start attaining more straight away speeds you are going to want to upgrade to big brakes to handle the heat and to help avoid brake fade. Skyline brakes are almost identical, but do come with some small variations in width.  Also some JDM S14's came with 300zx brakes from the factory.  Another note about z32 brakes is that they are bigger so wheel clearance can be a problem.  Only 7 spoke S13 alloys sometimes clear.  S14 stock wheels will clear z32 brakes,   You can shave off the Nissan lettering on the outside of the caliper to gain more clearance, and you can also run wheel spacers to also help with wheel clearance. But remember about your wheel offset when using wheel spacers.
==Parts Necessary==
You will need the following parts to make the Z32 front brakes work on your 240sx.
===Calipers===
There are many different versions of the Z32 brake calipers.  There are some that are aluminum and some that are cast iron.  There are some that accept 26mm wide rotors and some that accept only 30mm rotors.  26mm aluminum calipers were only used on 1990 non turbo model 300zx's.  30mm aluminum calipers were used on 1990 twin turbo and all 1991-1992.5 300zx's (turbo and non turbo).  30mm iron calipers were used on all 1992.5-1996 300zx's.  The best way to see if you have aluminum or iron is with a magnet.  Obviously if its aluminum a magnet will not stick to it.  
===Rotors===
There are many different rotor designs to choose from, but make sure you get the rotors to match your calipers.  You can get slotted, cross-drilled or both on the same rotor.  These features help with the heat dispersal by giving you more surface area, although they do eat away at your pad quicker than blanks.  The 300zx came with 5 lug wheels as well as 5 lug rotors.  This is not a problem for S14 SE's because they all came with 5 lug stock, but for us S13 guys there are 2 options.

===Lines=== 
Conversion lines are necessary for doing the conversion.  SPL parts sells them for a very reasonable price.  The fitting going onto the caliper is different from the stock style.  The stock fitting is a banjo style, and can be made to work with an appropriate adapter, otherwise z32 brakes will need 10mm Inverted Female (IF) flare fittings.  Also steel braided brake lines are recommended because they help with brake feel and are less likely to fail, unlike the stock rubber lines.

==Installation==
Installation is very straight forward.  Remove and replace everything and bleed the system of air.  The only tricky parts is the removal of the dust shields.  The stock dust shields are designed for stock rotors, and since the Z32 brakes are so much bigger they must be modified/removed.  You can either take the whole set up apart and remove them completely or simply cut them so that they are out of the way, the choice is yours.

=Z32 Rear Brakes=
The stock rear brakes on the 240sx are single piston with an integrated e-brake.  The Z32 rear brake set up is comprised of a 2 piston caliper, an 11.6&quot; rotor and a separate drum e-brake.  The swap can be difficult, but it does help complete a total braking system.
==Parts Necessary==
===Calipers===
The rear calipers from any z32 will do, but once again make sure that they match your rotors.  
===Rotors=== 
These come in many designs similar to the front rotors, and the same 4-5lug solutions apply.


===Other Parts===
You can directly bolt on the rear brakes the same as the front if you wish, but you will not have an e-brake.  The only part that is not bolt-on is the hydraulic line, which requires a different fitting on the caliper end.  Solutions can be had from local shops that make custom brake lines or from online shops that specialize in the 240SX, and stock the necessary lines.  To make the e-brake work you will need the Z32 rear drum assembly and the e-brake cables.  Some people have used the Z32 aluminum uprights, but it is not necessary and requires the use of different rear lower shock mounts.


For the 240SX you will also need to get e-brake extension cables.  If you can find them, R33 cables are long enough without extension.

s13 can use the 300zx ebrake cables no problem.

==Installation==
You need to remove the stock calipers and remove the spindle from the control arm.  Also unbolt the axle so that you can get the spindle free from the car.  Remove the hub from the stock assembly and put the new splash shield/ z32 e-brake assembly onto your hub.  After this is complete reattach the spindle to the hub assembly.  Run the e-brake cable through the sub-frame towards the e-brake handle, and then reattach the spindle assembly.  Put the caliper back on, attach the brake lines, attach the e-brake cables, bleed the system and you're done.

=Q45 Front Brakes=
Q45 brakes are a cheaper still upgrade to the brakes of your 240sx.  They don't have the Nissan logo on the calipers.  They are dual piston calipers that, compared to stock, provide about 25% more clamping force with a larger rotor and ~40% more pad surface area.  They also have the pistons on the inside of the caliper so the wheel clearance is almost the same as with stock brakes, allowing the ability to continue running many different-sized wheels.  Pads have many options as with all the other brake options we have here.  The lines are the same fittings as stock so you can reuse your stock lines to save even more money.

You will need the following parts to make the Infiniti Q45 front brakes work on your 240sx:  2003 Sentra SE-R Rotors (Not Spec-V, those won't fit) mean you won't have to do a 5-lug swap.
The only stock wheels that fit over Q45 front brakes are &quot;teardrops&quot;, and any stock 240sx wheel that is 16&quot; or greater. Stock r32 fit also because they are 16&quot;.

==Calipers==
You will need a set of calipers from a 90-96 Infiniti Q45.  These calipers are larger than the stock 240sx calipers.  They use two 42.8 mm pistons instead of one 54mm piston to increase clamping force.  These calipers will bolt onto the stock location as well as use the stock banjo brake lines.

==Rotors==
There are many different rotor designs to choose from, but make sure you get the rotors to match your calipers. You can get slotted, cross-drilled or both on the same rotor.  These features help your brake pad stay in contact with the rotor by providing a place to contain debris.  Another point is that when some pads rub against the rotor, a gas is released, and this layer of gas between the pad and rotor reduces the brake's effectiveness.  A slotted or cross-drilled rotor provides a pocket into which the gas can be compressed, leaving more of the pad material in contact with the rotor.  It is pointed out above that perhaps modern pad compounds do not release this gas.  Regardless, these rotors will wear out brake pads quicker than blanks. The Q45 came with 5 lug wheels as well as 5 lug rotors. This is not a problem for S14 SE's because they all came with 5 lug stock, but for us S13 guys there are 2 options. One is to convert to 5 lug (which is explained elsewhere on this wiki), or you can have the rotors re-drilled for the 4x114.3 lug pattern. Any competent machine shop should be able to do this.  The Q45 rotors are approximately the same diameter as the 300z rotors, however the width of the rotor is in between the two thicknesses available from the 300z.  The rotors are 28mm thick.---NEW POST---4 lug Nissan Altima rotors are the same diameter as 300zx and Q45. They are not as thick but are centered between the caliper perfectly. I have been using this set up for a few months with some extra shims and it works great. This really saves time and trouble because there is no need to re-drill or convert to 5-lugm and they are around $30 each at any Autozone.
!!New Post!! Also Sentra SE-R Spec-V Brembo rotors can be used

==Pads==
The brake pad options are the same as with stock and they come in a lot of different compounds from mild to wild. Once again make sure you are getting the correct pad for the caliper/rotor set up you have.


==Lines==
Conversion lines are not necessary for doing the conversion, but make sure your brake lines are in good condition for safety's sake.   Steel-braided brake lines are superior because the walls don't flex as much under pressure (more pressure to act directly on the calipers), and they also provide increased durability.  The stock 240sx fitting is a banjo-style end and the Q45 calipers use the same connection.

==Installation==
The installation of the Q45 brakes is simpler than it would sound.  The hardest part is cutting away or removing the splash guard from the front wheel hub.  This can be done with a set of tin snips or an angle grinder.  Once the splash guard has been removed the Q45 rotors and calipers will go on the same way the stock ones came off.  Tighten down and bleed the brake system.


==Benefits==
One of the benefits of the Q45 brake upgrade over many of the other one available is that the calipers and rotors are significantly less expensive than the 300zx and 240sx rotors and calipers.  Furthermore, because they use the banjo brake lines the swap is quicker and can be done without having to replace as many parts.  The Q45 calipers do not use as large an amount of brake fluid as the 300zx calipers due to the smaller piston sizes.  Though not super critical, the brake bias is slightly changed by the q45 caliper upgrade.

=Infiniti M30 Brake Upgrade=

The M30 brake upgrade that is also available for the 240sx.  The M30 used a larger rotor and single piston floating caliper which will increase braking power.  The M30 was also a 4 lug vehicle, which makes it an ideal upgrade for those looking to increase their braking power without having to replace the 4 lug hubs or re-drill the rotor.

==Calipers==
The rear M30 brake use an integrated drum design for the parking brake.

==Rotors==
According to PartsAmerica.com, M30 [http://www.partsamerica.com/ProductDetail.aspx?MfrCode=RAY&amp;MfrPartNumber=96251&amp;PartType=221&amp;PTSet=A  front rotors ] are 10.78&quot; in diameter and .865&quot; (approximately 22mm) thick.  The [http://www.partsamerica.com/ProductDetail.aspx?MfrCode=RAY&amp;MfrPartNumber=96252&amp;PartType=221&amp;PTSet=A  rear rotors] are solid 10.47&quot; in diameter and .394&quot; (10mm) thick.

=Maxima / 180sx spec Brake Swap=
The owners of S14's ('95-'98), can upgrade their brakes using 1995 Nissan Maxima calipers, rotors and pads, and for those with 4 bolt use 1995 Nissan Altima rotors with a 3mm spacer between the caliper and the spindle.

For the owners of S13s ('89-'94) You can upgrade your stock front brakes to JDM 180sx spec using USDM parts. This upgrades main benefit is the additional mass to the rotor for heat dissipation. The caliper pistons are not so large as to impact braking bias more than a trivial amount. The following will be needed for this swap: [[Image: S13vs180brakes.jpg|thumb|stock non abs s13 brakes VS 180sx style brakes]]

('93-'97) 1st generation Nissan Altima rotors. These are 280x22mm and have a 4x114 bolt pattern.

('89-'99) 3rd and 4th generation Nissan Maxima brake calipers

('89-'99) 3rd and 4th generation Nissan Maxima brake caliper mounting brackets

('89-'99) 3rd and 4th generation Nissan Maxima brake caliper mounting bracket hardware kit

('89-'99) 3rd and 4th generation Nissan Maxima brake pads

These parts all directly bolt onto the s13 with no major modifications needed. This swap retains near stock
[[Image: Padoverhang.jpg|thumb|stock non abs s13 brakes VS 180sx style brakes]]
Before and after pictures of swap done on '90 240sx without abs:



Concerns worth noting:

-The brake swap will not fit anything smaller than a 15&quot; alloy wheel. This will not clear a stamped steel wheel and drags on the caliper parallel surface.

- The stock rotor dust shield no longer clears the larger brake rotor. Modifications or removal to this are necessary for fitment. 2&quot; deep slices with shears spaced 1.5&quot; apart should be sufficient to allow the outside edge to be bent flat.

-The pad hangs over the edge from this setup by approximately 5mm. Although it is visually striking, it does not negatively impact braking performance or cause any reliability issues.

=Master Cylinder Upgrade=
This only really applies to the Z32 brakes set up.

The stock master cylinder on the 240sx manual transmission is a 7/8&quot; piston.  That is fine for stock brakes, but you are now pushing between 10 and 12 pistons.  Stock is just 4, so you can imagine that you will need a bigger master cylinder to help push more fluid and get the brake feel and bias closer to where you want it.  There are many options of master cylinder sizes to go to.  Many people have run all of these on different brake set ups, so its up to preference on which one you prefer.  I have had a 7/8 (stock) 15/16 and a 17/16 and I think the 15/16 is perfect (stock brakes rear Z32 front).  The 17/16 was much too stiff and hard to modulate.
==Master Cylinder Sizing==
===15/16 MC===
This came off of either a Z31 300ZX or an S12 200SX.  This is the best set up if you plan on running Z32 front brakes with stock rear brakes.  The bias is close to stock and the feel is perfect.

===1&quot; MC===
This came off of Z32 300ZXs made after 2/91.  It is bigger than a 15/16&quot;, so this is better for a full brake conversion (front and rear Z32).

===17/16 MC===
This is off of Z32 300ZXs made up to 2/91, and it is the biggest master cylinder you can get.  It will give you an even firmer pedal feel.

==Installation==
On a S13 240sx with ABS these should all be direct bolt on, as the ABS models only have 2 lines running to the master cylinder.  For non ABS you have to take out the middle screw (5 sided hex key) and put in a flare fitting to match your brake hard line.  This can be attained from your stock master cylinder by cutting it out.  As soon as you get this part out lightly tap it into the master cylinder.  It is impossible to get it all the way in, so just get it to sit upright and use the brake line to make it square in the master cylinder.  For S13 the lines are all in the right place, but for S14 you are going to need to bend the lines around to meet up with the master cylinder.  Be careful not to kink them when you are doing this.  Unbolt the old master cylinder from the brake lines and the brake booster and reinstall the new one.  Done and done.

=Aftermarket Big Brake Kits=
There are many aftermarket brake kits out on the market for the 240sx.  These kits are usually very big (13&quot;+ rotors) and they require the use of 17&quot; rims.  Also they usually come with 2 piece rotors, that is where the hat (the part that the wheel sandwiches between itself and the hub) and the rotor are 2 different pieces like Arizona z cars.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==

Marathi uses the devanagri writing system, which is used in other languages such as Hindi and Sanskrit. Traditionally, the Modi script was used, but it was very difficult to use for printing and therefore the devanagri script was adopted and is now the standard writing system for Marathi.

==How many people speak this language?==

Approximately 90 million people speak Marathi all over the world. Since it is similar to Hindi and other Indian languages in general, it is possible for many non-Marathi speaking Indians to understand some basic phrases and sentences in Marathi, especially speakers of Gujarati and Konkani.

==Where is this language spoken?==

Marathi is spoken in the Maharashtra state of India. Marathi is also the official language of the state and is considered as one of the eighteen official languages of India. Now, Marathi is also spoken in Maharashtrian communities all over the world.

==What is the history of this language?==

The prelude to Marathi Language is 'Maharashtri Prakrit' Language. Maharashtri was the most popular amongst all Prakrit languages. It was spoken from Malwa and Rajputana (north) to the Krishna and Tungabhadra River region (south) including Modern Maharashtra in India.  Maharashtri was spoken for 1000 years (500 BC to 500 AD). It was used in numerous works of literature, and its literary use was made famous by the Sanskrit playwright Kālidāsa. The Gāhā Sattasaī, Setubandh and Karpuraman̄jarī (कर्पुरमंजरी) are attributed to King Hāla Satavahana (r. 20-24 CE). Gāhā Sattasaī, an anthology of over 700 love poems, has been established as the most famous work of literature in Maharashtri. Maharashtri Prakrit was commonly spoken until AD 875. Maharashtri apabhraṃśas remained in use until the 13th century and was used widely in Jain literature and formed an important link in the evolution of Marathi. This form of Apabhraṃśa was re-Sanskritised and eventually became Marathi. The early Marathi literature written during the Yadava (850-1312 CE) was mostly religious and philosophical in nature. The earliest known Marathi inscription found at the foot of the statue at Shravanabelgola in Karnataka is dated c. 983. Mukundraj's Vivek Sindhu (around 1188 CE), with its 18 chapters and 1671 verses, is considered as the first major book in the Marathi language. It is clear that Marathi became extensively used in the thirteenth century onwards with patronage from Yadava Kings of Devgiri. Some of the earliest works like Bhavarth-dipika (Dyaneshwari) were written during this period. Bhavarth Deepika is a 9000-couplets long commentary on the Bhagavad Gita. With advent of Muslim rulers, Persian and Arabic words also became part of language. The celebrated Maratha king Shivaji Bhonsale greatly encouraged the spread and use of Marathi, which was the language of his people.  It was during Shivaji's time that some of the greatest Marathi works were written, and Marathi literature advanced and developed since his reign.

After the British colonized India, many English words and phrases entered Marathi usage.  Even though there are Sanskrit and Marathi replacements, many Marathi-speakers prefer to use English words sometimes, such as &quot;police&quot;, &quot;T.V.&quot;, &quot;computer&quot;, &quot;radio&quot;, &quot;fridge (or refrigerator)&quot;, etc.  This use of English words, however, is significantly lesser in rural dialects and in scholarly contexts.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==

Many books have been written in Marathi, on various topics. Tukaram, a Maharashtrian Saint, wrote ''abhangas'', or small poems that discouraged evil practices. Other famous authors include B.B.Borkar, Pralhad Keshav Atre, Hari Apte, Vishnu Khandekar, Balchandra Nemade, P.L. Deshpande, Tarabai Shinde, V.V. Shirwadkar, and Narendra Jadhav.

==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==

Marathi word - Latin version of the word - English translation
*नमस्कार - namaskaar - hello, good morning, afternoon, etc., and goodbye.
*तुम्ही कशे आहात? - tumhi kashe aahaat? - How are you?
*मी ठीक आहे, आणि तुम्ही? - mee theek aahe, aani tumhi? - I am fine, and you?
*तुमच नाव काय आहे? - tumcha naav kaay aahe? - What is your name?
*माझ नाव राहुल आहे. - maazha naav Rahul aahe. - My name is Rahul.

The word order in Marathi sentences is different from those in English. In Marathi the verb usually comes last in the sentence. For example in the sentence given above for &quot;What is your name?&quot;, the order the words are actually said in Marathi is &quot;your name what is&quot;. &quot;tumcha&quot; means your, &quot;naav&quot; means name, &quot;kaay&quot; means what, and &quot;aahe&quot; means is.

===Colours===

It is arguably the best diff for drifting, and not arguably the best diff for the money.

Its extremely debateable because of the price/effectiveness compared to the welded for strict drifting use.  These also need constant attention and rebuilds because the internals ware rather quickly.

I don't think it's &quot;extremely debateably&quot;, welded diff's might be fine for the price, however a clutch type would definitley be better if they both cost the same amount. I don't think any D1 drivers use a welded diff.

&lt;big&gt;'''Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Treatment Overview==
*Early stage was initially treated with surgery; however, an MRC trial showed that radical RT provides better survival than surgery in operable patients. Meanwhile, systemic chemotherapy was also quite effective
*Two separate meta-analysis using 2 different techniques, both published in 1992, showed that addition of thoracic RT to systemic chemotherapy improves survival. Reduction in risk of death was 17%, with absolute benefit ~5% at 2 years. Combined modality therapy became the standard of care. However, RT dose, duration, and timing was not settled
*RT dose evolution:
**Dose used in most of the historical trials (and those reviewed in the meta-analyses) was 40-50 Gy QD, based on radiobiological data showing small cell radiosensitivity 
**An Intergroup trial (INT-0096) showed a significant benefit to hyperfractionation, comparing standard 45 Gy QD in 5 weeks vs. 45 Gy BID in 3 weeks. There was a 10% survival advantage at 5 years, with improved local control. However, Grade 3 esophagitis was significant (27%)
**RTOG 97-12 was a hyperfractionated dose-escalation study, which reached MTD at 61.2 Gy in 5 weeks given QD/BID. Its feasibility was confirmed by RTOG 02-39. This protocol serves as one arm of a current Phase III CALGB trial
**CALGB evaluated QD dose escalation, which didn't reach MTD at 70/35. The feasibility of concurrent 70 Gy QD was confirmed by CALGB 39808. This protocol serves as another arm of a current Phase III CALGB trial
**Ongoing CALGB 30610 trial is evaluating the control arm of 45 Gy BID (INT-0096) vs. a hyperfractionated 61.2/25 arm (RTOG 97-12) vs. high dose 70/35 arm (CALGB 39808), all concurrent with cisplatin/etoposide
*to be continued ...

==Surgery vs. RT==
*'''LCSG 832''' -- Induction + surgery + RT vs Induction + RT
**Randomized. 328 registered, 146 randomized. Small cell lung cancer, limited stage (excluding SCV+ and positive pleural effusion), resectable disease after induction.

==Chemotherapy +/- RT==
===Meta-analysis===
*'''Pignon; 1992''' PMID 1331787 &amp;mdash; &quot;A meta-analysis of thoracic radiotherapy for small-cell lung cancer.&quot; (Pignon JP, N Engl J Med. 1992 Dec 3;327(23):1618-24.) 
**13 trials. 2103 patients with limited stage. Pts with extensive disease were excluded. Compared chemo alone vs chemo + thoracic RT. Median F/U for survivors 3.6 years
**Outcome: Risk of death for chemo + RT group was 0.86 (SS), corresponding to 14% reduction in mortality. 3-year OS chemo alone 9% vs. chemo-RT 14% (SS), absolute benefit 5.4% . Did not show a difference between early and late thoracic RT.
**Conclusion: Thoracic RT moderately improves survival in patient with LS-SCLC treated with chemotherapy
**Comment: chemotherapy was cyclophosphamide-based or doxorubicin-based regimens; did not use cisplatin + etoposide which is the modern standard of care.

*'''Warde; 1992''' - PMID 1316951 &amp;mdash; &quot;Does thoracic irradiation improve survival and local control in limited-stage small-cell carcinoma of the lung? A meta-analysis.&quot; Warde P et al. J Clin Oncol. 1992 Jun;10(6):890-5. 
**Does the addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy improve survival and local control in limited stage SCLC?
**Meta-analysis. 11 randomized trials. Odds ratio for OS @ 2-years was 1.53 (benefit for RT); improves 2-year survival by 5.4%. OR for LC is 3.02, improved by 25.3%. More treatment related deaths by 1.2%.

===Concurrent Chemotherapy +/- RT===
*Chemotherapy alone without RT leads to LF in 75-90% of pts. Addition of XRT reduces LF to 30-60%.
*Cisplatin + etoposide (PE) is modern standard of care. Introduced in 1970s but emerged as primary therapy in early 1980s. Advantage is that PE can be given concurrently with full doses of thoracic RT with less toxicity than older doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide-based regimens.

**Phase II. ''Stopped early due to positive experience.'' 37 patients with LS-SCLS. CT staged. Chemo paclitaxel 200 mg/m2, carboplatin AUC 5, etoposide 100 mg. IFRT 45/25 QD. Target: primary tumor, LN+ short axis &gt;=1 cm on planning scan after 1 cycle of chemo. RT start after 2nd chemo cycle. PCI 30/12 or 20/15
**Outcome: Median OS 19 months, 5-year OS 27%. In-field recurrence 16%, distant recurrence 51%, ''regional (elective LN) failure subset not reported''
**Severe Toxicity: hematologic 57%, esophagitis 27%, pneumonitis 6%, dyspnea 19%, lethargy 22%
**Conclusion: Chemotherapy with concurrent IFRT effective
**Comment PMID 17595661 (Updated data, 2007): Elective node failure 5% (1 ipsilateral SCV, 1 hilar). In-field failure 24%. Difference from De Ruyscher above (PMID 16949169) less intense RT so it is possible in-field failures occurred before nodal failures. Also unclear why their failures were in SCV region only

===Hyperfractionation===
'''''Rationale:''''' small cell lung cancers are radiosensitive and have a small shoulder in the dose response curve. Dose-limiting toxicity is 45 Gy BID in 3 weeks, or 61.2 Gy QD/BID in 5 weeks concurrent with cisplatin/etoposide.

**Note: the BID split course (5-1/2 wks) is not the same as the Turrisi BID regimen (3 wks). The media OS &amp; 5-yr OS for the QD/50.4 Gy group was 20.6 m / 21% compared with BID arm in the Turrisi randomized trial (45 Gy, BID in 3 wks) 23 m / 26% -- but these trials cannot be directly compared.

*'''ECOG / Intergroup 0096 / RTOG 8815''' (1989-1992) -- early 45 Gy QD vs. 45 Gy BID
**Randomized. 417 patients with LS-SCLC (pleural effusion, contralateral hilar/SCV excluded). Arm 1) RT 45/25 @1.8 Gy QD over 5 weeks vs. Arm 2) RT 45/30 @1.5 Gy BID over 3 weeks. RT started on Day 1 of chemotherapy; 4 cycles of cisplatin 60 mg/m2 and etoposide 120 mg/m2 (EP) Q3W. RT fields included bilateral mediastinum, ipsilateral hilum. Inferior border 5 cm below carina or including hilum. Elective ipsilateral SCV forbidden. PCI 25/10 given after chemotherapy for patients with CR
**'''8-years; 1999''' PMID 9920950 [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/340/4/265 Full text] &amp;mdash; &quot;Twice-daily compared with once-daily thoracic radiotherapy in limited small-cell lung cancer treated concurrently with cisplatin and etoposide.&quot; (Turrisi AT et al. N Engl J Med. 1999 Jan 28;340(4):265-71.) Median F/U 8 years
***Outcome: Median OS QD 1.6 years vs. BID 1.9 years (SS); 2-year OS 41% vs 47%; 5-yr OS 16% vs 26%. Local failure QD 52% vs BID 36% (p=0.06)
***Toxicity: Grade 3 esophagitis QD 11% vs. 27%, no difference in Grade 4 esophagitis
***Conclusion: Survival exceeds that of any previous randomized trial.  Small difference between QD and BID at 2 years but 10% improvement at 5 years. 
**Comment: Not a comparison of once a day vs twice a day since the biologically effective doses weren't equivalent. 45 Gy BID is closer to about 60 Gy QD, which is the current &quot;standard&quot; dose (60-66 Gy) for once a day RT. However, at the time of the trial, 40-50 Gy QD was the standard dose

*'''Mayo; 1996''' PMID 8610649 &amp;mdash; &quot;Infusion cisplatin chemotherapy and hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy for small-cell lung cancer.&quot; (Frytak S, Am J Clin Oncol. 1996 Apr;19(2):193-8.)
**Phase II. 60 patients, 29 LS-SCLC. Infusion cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (CEPi). Hyperfractionated split-course RT 48/32 given 24/16 @ 1.5 Gy BID with 2 week break, started cycle 4-5 of chemo (modified MGH H&amp;N protocol). RT field post-chemo volume, GTV + 2cm + regional LNs
**Outcome: median OS 2.2 years, 2-year OS 55%
**Conclusion: Safe and effective program for treating SCLC

===Continuous vs Interdigitated split-course RT===
*'''EORTC LCCG''' (1989-1995) -- continuous RT 50/20 vs interdigitated split RT 12.5/5 x4
**Randomized. 349 patients. Chemotherapy cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (CDE). Arm 1) continuous RT 50/20 started week 13-19 vs Arm 2) interdigitated split course RT 50/20 on weeks 5, 9, 13, and 17 @ 12.5/5
**'''1997''' PMID 9256127 -- &quot;Randomized trial of alternating versus sequential radiotherapy/chemotherapy in limited-disease patients with small-cell lung cancer: a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Lung Cancer Cooperative Group Study.&quot; (Gregor A, J Clin Oncol. 1997 Aug;15(8):2840-9.)
***Outcome: 3-year OS continuous 15% vs interdigitated 12% (SS). No difference in local relapse
***Toxicity: Grade 3-4 neutropenia continuous 77% vs interdigitated 90% (SS); toxicity compromised treatment dose delivery, such that full RT delivered in continuous 93% vs interdigitated 77% (SS).
***Conclusion: Interdigitated schedule not superior; hematological toxicity compromised treatment delivery

*'''Wake Forest''' (1987-1992) -- Continuous RT 50/25 vs. Split course RT 25/10 + 25/10
**Randomized. 114 patients. Arm 1) RT continuous 50/25 during chemo cycle 1-2 vs. Arm 2) RT split-course 25/10 + 25/10 during chemo cycle 1-3. Chemo cisplatin/etoposide cycle 1, 2, and 5 + cyclophosphamide/vincristine/doxorubicin cycle 3, 4, and 6. PCI after CR
**'''2005''' PMID 15845179 -- &quot;Split-course versus continuous thoracic radiation therapy for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer: final report of a randomized phase III trial.&quot; (Blackstock AW, Clin Lung Cancer. 2005 Mar;6(5):287-92.) Median F/U 1.2 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS continuous 18% vs. split-course 17% (NS); no difference in patterns of failure
***Toxicity: Grade 3+ esophagitis continuous 9% vs. split-course 4%
***Conclusion: Interdigitated split-course RT not better than continuous RT

===Dose escalation===
*'''CALGB 39808''' (1999-2000) PMID 15145163 -- &quot;70 Gy thoracic radiotherapy is feasible concurrent with chemotherapy for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer: analysis of Cancer and Leukemia Group B study 39808.&quot; (Bogart JA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jun 1;59(2):460-8.)
**Phase II. 63 patients. Induction chemo (paclitaxel + topotecan) x2 cycles, followed by concurrent chemo-RT. RT 70/35 (uncorrected, prescribed to isocenter). Field included Stations 3, 4, 7 and 5, 6 on left to 44 Gy, then PTV = GTV + hilar LNs + 1cm. Chemo carboplatin AUC 5, etoposide. PCI offered for CR/PR
**Outcome: Median OS 1.9 years
**Toxicity: 90% patients proceeded to TRT. Grade 3+ dysphagia 16%. 1 treatment-related mortality
**Conclusion: 70 Gy QD can be delivered safely; initial efficacy encouraging

*'''CALGB; 1998''' (1989-1994) PMID 9817271 -- &quot;Phase I study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose of radiation in standard daily and hyperfractionated-accelerated twice-daily radiation schedules with concurrent chemotherapy for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer.&quot; (Choi NC, J Clin Oncol. 1998 Nov;16(11):3528-36.)
**Phase I, dose escalation. 50 patients. RT initial volume 40 Gy, increasing boost, delivered QD or BID. Chemotherapy cisplatin/cyclophosphamide/etoposide (PCE) x3 + cisplatin/etoposide x2. RT started at 4th cycle
**Escalation: MTD for BID RT was 45 Gy in 30 fractions in 3 weeks. MTD for QD RT was &gt;70 Gy in 35 fractions in 7 weeks.
**Outcome: 2-year OS BID 52%, QD 54%
**Conclusion: MTD for BID and QD concurrent RT determined

==Current trials==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Companies in Atlas Shrugged''', the [[w:Ayn Rand|Ayn Rand]] novel, generally, are  divided into two groups, these that are operated by sympathetic characters are given the name of the owner, while companies operated by evil or incompetent characters are given generic names.  In Atlas Shrugged men who give their names to their companies all become [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Strikers]] in due time.

==Amalgamated Switch and Signal==
A company run by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Mr. Mowen]] and located in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Connecticut]].  They have supplied Taggart Transcontinental for generations.  [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] orders [[Technology in Atlas_Shrugged|Rearden Metal]] switches from them.

Amalgamated Switch and Signal appears in [[../Structure|section]] 171.

==Associated Steel==
Associated Steel is the company owned by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Orren Boyle]].  The company was started with just a few hundred-thousand dollars of [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Boyle's]] own money, and hundreds of millions of dollars in government grants.  Boyle used this money to buy out his competitors, and now relies on influence peddling and political favors to run his business.

Associated Steel is mentioned in [[../Structure|sections]] 111, 114, 131 and 171.

==Ayers Music Publishing Company==
Ayers Music Publishing Company is the publisher of the music of [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Richard Halley]].  [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] contacts [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Mr. Ayers]] to inquire as to the existence of [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Halley's Fifth Concerto]].

Ayers Music Publishing Company is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 114.

==Barton and Jones==
The company, located in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Denver]], that supplies food for the workers rebuilding the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]].  They go bankrupt in the middle of the project.

Barton and Jones is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 171.

==d'Anconia Copper==
A copper and mining company founded by [[Minor Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Sebastian d'Anconia]] in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Argentina]] during the time of the Inquisition.  Each man who ran the company saw it grow by 10% in his lifetime, so by the time [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Francisco d'Anconia]] heads the company it is the largest in the world.  His dream, from childhood, is to increase the size of the company by 100%.

d'Anconia Copper is mentioned in [[../Structure|sections]] 152 and 171.

==Hammond Motors==
A car company in Colorado.  They make the best cars on the market until the founder disappears.

[[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] buys a Hammond on his trip to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] in [[../Structure|section]] 171.

==Incorporated Tool==
A company that is contracted to deliver drill heads to Taggart Transcontinental but who fail to do this.  It is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 171.

==Phoenix-Durango==
The Phoenix-Durango is an old, small railroad located in the Southwest run by  [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dan Conway]] that has been insignificant for most of its existence.  However, the Phoenix-Durango grows rapidly when [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Ellis Wyatt]] revives the economy of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] and Taggart Transcontinental's [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]] fails to service Wyatt adequately.  Later, [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|James Taggart]] conspires to get the Phoenix-Durango driven out of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] with the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule]].

The Phoenix-Durango is mentioned in [[../Structure|sections]] 111, 114, 131 (alluded to), 132, 145, 146, 147 and 152.
The Phoenix-Durango is the only company run by a symapthetic character that is not named after the founder.

==Rearden Coal==
A business founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] prior to the founding of Rearden Steel.  It is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 121.

==Rearden Limestone==
A business founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] prior to the founding of Rearden Steel.  It is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 121.

==Rearden Ore==
The first business founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]].  It is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 121.

==Rearden Steel==
A company founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] about ten years prior to the start of the story in the novel.  Rearden bought an abandoned steel mill in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Philadelphia]] at a time when all the experts thought that such a venture would be hopeless.  He turned it into the most reliable and profitable steel company in the country.

As [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] struggles to save Taggart Transcontinental, she becomes increasingly dependent on Rearden Steel.

Rearden Steel is mentioned in [[../Structure|sections]] 111, 114, 121, 131 (alluded to), 161 and 162.

==Summit Casting==
A company in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Illinois]] under contract to deliver rail spikes to Taggart Transcontinental.  They go bankrupt before they can deliver, prompting [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] to fly to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Chicago]] and buy the company to get it started again.

Summit Casting is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 171.

==Taggart Transcontinental==
The fictional [[w:companies in atlas shrugged|railroad]] run by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]].  Her commitment to the railroad creates one of the book's major conflicts.

Taggart Transcontinental was founded by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Nathaniel Taggart]] who lived three generations (or so) prior to Dagny's generation.  It was built without any grants, loans, or favors from the government; it thus differs profoundly from the transcontinental  railroads of our history, which financed themselves with their extensive land grants.   It was the last railroad that was still owned and controlled by its founder's descendants.  Its motto is, ''From Ocean to Ocean''.

The 'flagship' of Taggart Transcontinental is the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Taggart Comet]] which runs from [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|New York]] to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|San Francisco]], and which has never been late.

==United Locomotive Works==
An incompetent company that is supposed to deliver Diesel engines to Taggart Transcontinental. The order is delayed in perpetuity, and the [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|president]] of the company refuses to ever give a straight answer as to why this is so.

The United Locomotive Works is mentioned in [[../Structure|sections]] 133 and 141.

==Wyatt Oil==
The oil company run by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Ellis Wyatt]].  Wyatt's father had squeezed a living out of the oil fields in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]], but when Ellis Wyatt took over the business took off.  He discovered a technique for extracting oil from wells that had been abandoned as dried up.  The success of Wyatt Oil that followed this discovery suddenly and unexpectedly turned [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] into the leading economy in the country.

Wyatt Oil traditionally relied on Taggart Transcontinental's [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]] to ship its oil.  But when that company could not grow fast enough to keep up with the booming [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] economy, Wyatt started using the small but well-managed Phoenix-Durango instead.  This prompted [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|James Taggart]] to make deals with his friends to drive the Phoenix-Durango out of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]].  Afterwards, [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] has to rebuild the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]] so it can supply transportation to Wyatt Oil - if she fails, the economy of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]], and of the whole country, could collapse.

Wyatt Oil is mentioned in [[../Structure|sections]] 111, 132 and 171.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Greece has used the Greek alphabet since the 9th century B.C.  The Greek alphabet was the first alphabet to introduce the concept of a vowel.  It contains 24 letters, as shown here.

:Α, Β, Γ, Δ, Ε, Ζ, Η, Θ, Ι, Κ, Λ, Μ, Ν, Ξ, Ο, Π, Ρ, Σ, Τ, Υ, Φ, Χ, Ψ, Ω

==How many people speak this language?==

About 12 million people speak Greek, making it the 52nd most common language.

==Where is this language spoken?==

Greek is an official language in [[Wikijunior:Europe/Greece|Greece]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Cyprus|Cyprus]], and the European Union, but some people speak Greek in Bulgaria, Albania, Italy, and Turkey.

Some Wikipedia content has been allowed on Wikibooks under limited situations, or if it is deleted from Wikipedia ''because'' it violates some standard that it is not encyclopedic, like a bunch of cookbook recepies or a How-to manual that was started on Wikipedia instead of Wikibooks.

Some literary study guides have been started on Wikibooks, but you should be prepared to make it a substantial book-length work if you really want it to stay here.  Please look at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] for an excellent example of how this has been done.  I'm not expecting really elaborate treatment of what you have done here, but it is more than a few extra paragraphs of new content.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:22, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

:Wikibooks is for educational &quot;textbooks&quot; and study guides. This is a study guide. The teacher who made this content did so for a class and for classroom study and for class test taking purposes. This is not an encyclopedia article, unless it was radically altered. ''you should be prepared to make it a substantial book-length work'' - not really, look at the other study guides on Wikibooks, no one is beholden to create a book length work. Muggle's is an excellent example, but not everyone has the time to personally do that, consider this a &quot;stub&quot; that other people can build on. Frankly the fact that came it from Wikipedia is irrelevant, and it was only on Wikipedia for less than a hour. It was moved here because this is the appropriate project for educational study guides, which is what this was created as, and for, by a teacher, for his/her class. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 21:31, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

== Study guide, not encyclopedia ==

Most of this was written by a &quot;newbie&quot;, a K-12 teacher in NJ, with no experience on Wikipedia or Wikibooks. Rather than delete things, we need to be kind to newbies, and direct them how to conform to the standards.

This is a study guide and not an encyclopedia article.

Rationale:

#The lead section (2 paragraphs) is copied from Wikipedia because it provides context and background for the book, so ignore that. Delete or rewrite the lead if you want.
#The &quot;summaries&quot;, while they do summarize parts of the book, do so for didactic reasons to educate the reader. It is much too specific and lengthy for Wikipedia, these are specific passages quoted and commented upon for educational reasons, for the reader to ask themselves questions, thematic concerns, focusing on specific issues deemed important. 
#There are &quot;Reading Guide Questions&quot; at the end of each section designed to further educate the reader on the questions focused on in the summaries.

And BTW this ''could be'' adapted to Wikipedia standards with some work (I very well might do that), but it would no longer be a study guide, which is what the original author intended and wanted. 

If this is not a Study Guide, I don't know what is. While it may not conform to exactly what other study guides look like on Wikibooks, that is a matter of style and further development, which can be changed and worked on.  The biggest reason it is a study guide is because ''it was written to be a study guide'' by a teacher for a classroom setting for test preparation purposes. --[[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 22:00, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

===Supporting &quot;policies and guidelines&quot;===

From [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]]:

:Wikibooks is an instructional resource:

:The site should primarily be used for developing textbooks, textbook-like books, and supporting book-based instructional materials (i.e. annotated texts such as an the Works of Shakespeare with aids for reading and study, for example, '''or extensive book summaries''').

From [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]

:Wikibooks includes books based on Wikipedia articles

:Note that &quot;based on&quot; does not mean &quot;verbatim copies of&quot;. Wikipedia articles sometimes have a tendency to get rather long, and Wikipedia editors have a tendency to trim them down to a limit of around 32k of text. When this happens, it is permitted to fork such content from Wikipedia, provided the content is reformatted as a book, as per [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]], and the Wikipedia entry is clearly marked to indicate that this fork now exists on this site, and further content should be added to the book, and not the Wikipedia article. When forking content from Wikipedia, you should correct any links which previously pointed to other Wikipedia articles so that they continue to point to those same articles, and not to non-existent articles on the Wikibooks site.

----

Considering that I wrote (well, helped establish and worked with the wording of) the above policy, I think I understand it somewhat.  This was a verbatim copy of what was on Wikipedia earlier, and that was my motivation for removing this content.  Mind you, all I'm asking is for you to defend why you moved it here, and to understand why this content needed to come here.  I think the admin that was culling the content on Wikipedia has a very unusual sense of what &quot;original research&quot; is really about, and this isn't it.  This is a scholarly review of a book and detailing key points of what is within the book.  As such, I think it could be an excellent article on Wikibooks in its current format with a little bit of nip and tuck to clean it up in some areas to make it seem more like a Wikipedia article, and perhaps work a tiny bit on the POV, as such it has.  I guess you are not willing to take on that fight.  The content wasn't put on Wikibooks until after it had been removed from Wikipedia.

As far as comparing this to other literary study guides, I would call most of those you cite as book stubs.  This is something that has been debated here on Wikibooks off and on over the history of the project, but is considered a very low priority item to worry about right now.  Often stubs will languish like this for quite some time after the initial creation of the content, which is one reason why we strongly encourage the content to remain on Wikipedia if it is even close to fitting on that project:  It will simply get more attention and development by remaining on Wikipedia.  The discussion about stubs is to decide if an eternal stub (one with no edits for more than a year and really only one one or two people contributing to them in the first place) should be deleted.  I hope this content does not fall into that category.  That discussion is not over, so certainly it is an issue for the future.

The copyright issue is something that should be resolved, as a formal disclaimer like &quot;I have obtained copyright permission from the author to publish this on Wikipedia/Wikibooks under the GNU Free Documentation License&quot; or &quot;I grant copyright permission under the GFDL&quot;.  For me that is sufficient, and I'm going to assume good faith on this issue.  The other point raised was that this content &quot;did not fit with WP:NOT where wikipedia is not a critical reviewer.&quot;  I have no idea what this means, other than to suggest that things like book or movie reviews are not done on Wikipedia.  But they are done... well sort of.  A NPOV synopsis of movies and books often are given on Wikipedia, and even nominated as brilliant prose or featured articles.  To suggest that this content could not be worked into a book synopsis with a NPOV is beyond me.

The point here ultimately is that I think you gave up too quickly on Wikipedia and let another editor get the best of you.  Unfortunately, what is an excellent article candidate on Wikipedia, potentially even a featured article eventually, is going to be a book stub instead here and ignored.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:43, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

:As I already said, Rob, the text can easily be copied back to Wikipedia (copy-edited for NPOV, length and formatting), we both agree on that. Plus there is currently a &quot;See also&quot; link to this page from the Wikipedia article. But, Wikipedia is not a study guide, with a study guide here, the teacher and students (and anyone else) have greater leeway in expanding the study guide as an educational resource. This is what Wikibooks was made for.  The &quot;author&quot; is [[:w:User talk:Tmchale|User talk:Tmchale]], a teacher, (and students), at a K-12 in NJ, and they have given default permission by uploading it, but also by direct consent on the talk page(s) on Wikipedia.  -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 05:37, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

::Generally if it is a substantial addition of text, we prefer to have explict granting of copyright permission.  I do see, however, that some form of granting that permission was obtained, and even the admin on Wikipedia was willing to revert the deletion because of copyright flaws.  Instead, it was violating Wikipedia standards that were mainly cited as justification for deletion.  My concerns that this is going to be a very stubby book that is largely ignored by the Wikibooks community IMHO will prove itself out in a year or two.  I have the patience to wait and see, but it takes a critical mass for some Wikibooks to fully develop.  I don't think this has quite enough material to do that.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:33, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

:::Given the statistics, your probably right, but are we running low on space, is there a one year grace period and things are purged? I thought this was a &quot;100 year project&quot;, this guide could suddenly bloom in 5 years, when another class picks it up; Ive seen stuff languish for that long on Wikipedia, just takes the right person to come along and expand it. Also I'm not sure how big a Study Guide for this book would be, it's a short book with one main character and no plot, mainly a lot of themes. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 23:00, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
::::There is no specific time frame, and this is something that we are trying to deal with right now in terms of what is something we can keep if nobody is working on it, and it is obviously just an initial start but no real meaningful content.  Often people will start a &quot;book&quot; with an outline, but it doesn't go anywhere else after that, with some of these book outlines being here for more than two years.  And this project is only three years old.  In terms of running low on server space, that is not really the issue.  Most of the stuff is being removed from Wikibooks because it either violates some basic principles, such as being a copyright violation or a personal essay that preaches a religious or political doctrine, or that it is seriously detracting from our primary mission of being a forum for authoring textbooks.  Books like [[How to Rape]] are one of those.  (Yes, a book with that title was started here.)

::::This content about Steinbeck is certainly not going to fall into any of those sorts of content.  Occasionally there is some content that is so poorly written from a gramatical viewpoint that it is embaressing to have here, but the usual response is if you are so critical of it, clean it up.  I don't know of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects will last 100 years, but there certainly is some strong motivation for people to be involved and try to maintain the content.  Wikibooks will be a very different place even 5 years from now, and there are some very interesting parallels with Wikipedia in terms of its growth and development.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:28, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Are you planning/proposing to implement an effective (auditable) voting system or stick with the one sock puppet one vote &quot;consensus&quot; survey system pioneered by Wikipedia?  [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 18:40, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

: Currently, for [[WB:BOTM]] and [[WB:COTM]], any user with 20 edits can vote. Users around here seem to be reluctant to discount votes from those who have 20 edits, even if they appear to be sockpuppets. For an &quot;editorial board&quot; (or an &quot;editorial council&quot;, as I prefer to call it), I would suggest approval voting, a system like BOTM and COTM, except that the winners would be the top five, instead of the top one.

: For the council to be effective, it would need to start with only reserve powers, acting when other mechanisms fail. Also, there must be a mechanism for the community to declare no-confidence and force the council to disband, so that the council does not hijack the wiki from the community. I remain undecided about whether to support the creation of such board or council. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:31, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

::At the Staff Lounge there seemed to be some reasonable arguments in favour of a &quot;loose&quot; council or board. This is why I have watered down the proposal to the idea of a loose group of administrators who enforce policy as required (ie: only when there is real trouble) rather than any elaborate scheme. This committee would be a backstop rather than a frequently used organ. I would hope that the [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]] and [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] policy would keep the peace in normal circumstances. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:47, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

==Voting==

===Yes, this should be an enforced policy===

# [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:58, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
# [[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 15:17, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

===No, this policy should be rejected===

# [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:00, 27 April 2006 (UTC) First, please note that we should have a well-publicised discussion period before having any policy vote, and then the vote should also be well-publicised, have clearly stated success v fail criteria and a time limit. As far as the proposal is concerned it is bureaucratic and wholly unnecessary. What sort of problems is it meant to resolve? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:00, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
#:If a policy is enforced there must be some form of enforcement process - otherwise it can just be ignored. This proposal is to solve the problem of the absolute absence of any enforcement apparatus in Wikibooks. Without an enforcement mechanism there is no point in having &quot;enforced&quot; policies. Are you are against the idea that any policies should be enforced? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:10, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
#::But there is an enforcement procedure - namely that anyone who sees a policy breach can act sensibly to resolve that knowing that they do so with community support. We are a relatively slow volume wiki, but we have 18 active administrators plus many other users who are not administrators who enforce policy. If you are concerned about a significant breach that does not look like it will be rectified, then you should follow it up on the staff lounge. That should work. If that gets no response, it'll probably because no-one agrees with you that it is worth worrying about, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:53, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
#::::But an item in the staff lounge may easily be ignored. This does not mean that &quot;no-one agrees&quot;, it just means that people are either too busy or do not want to get involved. Even if an item is not ignored and 3 users suggest enforcement this can just be ignored by the offender! The staff lounge is frequently archived and all the offender need do is enter reams of text to ensure a rapid archive. What you are suggesting is simply putting off any structured response to violation of enforced policies until something truly dire occurs. 
#::::The simple truth is that &quot;enforced policy&quot; has no more meaning than &quot;proposed policy&quot; if there is no enforcement mechanism. We must at least have a minimal enforcement apparatus. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:14, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
# Why do we need to include an additional level of bureaucracy in the clean-up process? Any user or administrator, met with a violation of policy, is free to change the page content to match policy, or solve the dispute through acceptable means. What we need perhaps is to finalize the dispute resolution policy, and then we won't need this. I vote '''no''' to this policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:39, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
# I don't think we need this policy in current shape. As Whiteknight has said before, this is another lever of bureaucracy and we are currently able to cope with violating of enforced polices. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:10, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
# I looked at the proposed policy, and I think it has good ideas, including the review of policy enforcement decisions by a loose panel of admins, who afterall have recieved some level of community support. I think this less-than-formal structure fits well with the culture here at 'books. However, I have some concerns before I can support such a policy, including what authority and what steps such a panel can use. Are we establishing mini, temporary, Wikipedia-style Arbitration Committees who can ban users for particularly bad actions or behavior? If we are, does this policy require Wikimedia Foundation Board of Directors approval before it is enacted? Is there a danger of users engaging in judge shopping by getting three of their admin friends to form a tribunal? Additionally, the policy's requirement of mandatory action after a single user's request could result in abuse of admin time and effort. Frivilious cases should be able to be dismissed without forming a tribunal. What happens if enough of the active admins refuse to participate in a dispute brought to them? Just some random concerns.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Going to the Library ==
Going to school and staying out of the house is the best possible thing to do if you want to study. Being inside the house, a person may be tempted to turn on the television or play around on the Internet. This is why going to a library is recommended. Make sure you make a meal for yourself so you can study for a few hours there.

Of course, a library is not the quietest place around, if the surroundings are not controlled. Cell phones are the demons of today's world that wishes to have silence. Colleges are also not without their chatty valley girls with similes committing suicide. This is why I recommend getting the type of '''ear muffs''' a person wears when shooting a gun. Don't buy a gun, or use a gun in school; buy the ear muffs used. The ear muffs, at times, are better than noise canceling headphones. Ear muffs greatly reduce the sound level of your surroundings.

Also, unless you really, really have to use it, '''stay away''' from the Internet and a computer.
Sometimes, when a person gets on the Internet, he or she dabbles time in listening to music, reading a blog, or etc. instead of doing school work. Staying away from a computer is best when studying in a library.

When inside the library, find a quiet place to sit. Make sure this area has ample lighting; lighting has an effect on the circadian system of the human body and keeps the mind awake and active.

[[Image:thorshamri.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A picture of the &quot;armoured egg of life&quot; (brynfjöregg).]] 
In 1992 the Belgian Herman Jozef Braekmans became interested in Icelandic terminological work.  During the 90’s, the emphasis in his work lied mainly on the search for native names for the chemical elements and a completely native terminology for chemical compounds.  At the end of 1999 he released a small booklet titled “''Icelandic Alternatives for the Names of the Chemical Elements''”.  In 2000 he made contact with the Dutch linguist Fabian Valkenburg, the man behind the Bond tegen Leenwoorden (Union against loan-words), who helped Braekmans construct the website Nýyrðasmiðja Málþvottahús (Neologistic factory: a language laundry).  Braekmans tried to find cooperators on the is.islenska newsgroup but most of the people there firmly rejected the idea of purism.  In 2003 he decided to present his words as an ultrapurist superset language called Háfrónska (November 2003).  Before that he somtimes refered to the language as ofuríslenska or Hypericelandic.  In 2005, he asked the Icelandic reverend Pétur Þorsteinsson to take the lead.  During the last months of that year Breakmans created an additional web-page about High Icelandic symbolism (see below)  The project received some minor media attention in Iceland, but only a few fanatics continue Braekmans' work.  The Icelandic television channel Stöð 2 had a small item on the project in November 2005.  Although many people see the language as a joke and a mockery of Icelandic language protectionism, Braekmans is dead-serious about it.

==Ultrapurism==
The emphasis in High Icelandic mainly lies on málgjörhreinsun (ultra purism), the most extreme form of linguistic purism. Again this is a personal term of the creator, signifying that everything that can be expressed by human speech is to be considered a target for puristic intervention, even proper names, geographical names, and names of chemicals. According to Braekmans the first signs of ultrapurism go back to the neologistic excesses of the 19th century Fjölnismenn. In their magazine Skírnir, they translated personal names like 'Robert Peel' and 'John Russell' as Hróbjartur Píll and Jón Hrísill respectively. Also geographical names were translated: Góðviðra (Buenos Aires), Sigurborg (Cairo), Slettumannaland (Poland). In contrast to the existing Icelandic language policy, the removal of latinisms and germanisms in the old language is considered a top priority.  In Braekmans opinion, the fact that Iceland has experienced the strongest wave of linguistic purism of all languages, makes it the most characteristic an important element of the language.  More so than the old literature (other languages like Tamil also have an impressive literal tradition) and the fact that Icelandic has changed so little during the last millenium (Greek has changed as less as Icelandic during the same period).  For this reason, he believes that staunch linguistic purism should be the main value feature in Icelandic society and be pursued.

==High Icelandic symbolism==
[[Image:fjallbarn661.jpg|thumb|right|The woman and child of the mountains]]
[[Image:High Icelandic Hammerflag.svg|thumb|right|The High Icelandic hammerflag]]
During the last months of 2005 Braekmans and a few neologist poets created Saga Fjallbarnssins ‘The saga of the Mountain child’.  In this story the High Icelandic symbolism is explained. 
# '''Brynfjöregg''': The armoured fjöregg (vital egg).  A 'vital egg' (fjöregg) is the equivalent of a ‘life-thread’ in Icelandic symbolism.   It is a familiar motif in Icelandic folklore, where one can destroy trolls, giants, etc., by finding where their &quot;life-egg&quot; (fjöregg) is hidden and hurling it at them so that it hits them in the face, or on the temple or nose, or (most frequently) between the eyes or on the forehead. These life-eggs came in a variety of colors,  some were golden.  Many Icelanders still consider their language as the ‘vital egg’ of their culture.  When it breaks, the thing it symbolizes dies.  The High Icelandic ‘brynfjöregg’ is composed of two viking-helmets forming an oval armour around the egg, symbolizing language protection.
# '''Fjallbarn''': The so-called linguisticly immaculate child of the mountains (Hið slettulausa Fjallbarn) of Fjallkonan (Woman of the mountains), the female incarnation of the Icelandic nation, and Bergrisinn (The Rock-giant), one of the four protectors of Iceland.  In High Icelandic symbolism, a child born on the national holiday and whose mother takes the trouble to make this happen at Thingvellir is called a ‘fjallbarn’. 
# '''Þórsfrónvé''': Thor’s flag of Iceland, an alternate Icelandic flag with the same division of the three colours but with a stylized ‘hammer of Thor’ replacing the Danish Crusaders’ cross. 
#'''Nýyrðaskáld''': A nýyrðaskáld (neologist poet) is a native speaker of Icelandic, who differs from a ‘nýyrðasmíður’ (word-builder) in that ‘unlimited purism’ and ‘language protection’ are holy commitments.  They wear a blue shirt, a red tie and a characteristic cap, patterned like a viking-helmet with the colours of the Icelandic flag.  Both Icelandic flags are represented because a viking-helmet pattern on a cap always results into an inverted T-shape.  The cap again symbolizes the protection of the language against foreign influence.

==English - High Icelandic names of the chemical elements==

{| border=1 cellspacing=3 style=&quot;font-size:100%;&quot;
|- 
|align=center colspan=5|'''Names of  the chemical elements'''
|- 
|| English || High Icelandic || explanation 
|-
|| actinium || hnossarblý || The daughter of protactinium (freyjublý, because it has properties of elements of the vanadium group (freyjujárn) and because it ends as lead. Hnoss was the daughter of Freyja.
 |-
|| aluminium || leirstál || Aluminium is the metal in ‘clay’. This idea was once expressed in nowadays obsolete terms like the 18th century Swedish ‘lerjord’ (literally ‘clay-earth’ but designating ‘alum-earth’) or the Dutch expression ‘het zilver in klei’ (the silver in clay). These references to ‘clay’ exist even in present day-nomenclatures. An example of this is the Polish word for aluminium ‘glin’,which derives from ‘glina’ (clay). In Icelandic we can found a term upon the same idea: ‘leirmálmur’. 
|-
|| americium || heimríkisblý || The continent is named after Amerigo Vespucci.  The name amerigio is the early-medieval Italian form of the German name &quot;Heinrich&quot; (earlier: &quot;Heimerich&quot; from: Old German heim = &quot;home, estate&quot; + Old German ric = &quot;force, power, government&quot;). The truly Icelandic name of America is HEIMRÍKI. 
|-
|| antimony || hvarmtin || ‘Eye-lid tin’. The term ‘kohl’ (antimony trisulfide), is a Semitic word used in early Biblical references and is the Arabic word for antimony sulfide, a fine cosmetic powder, used as eye make-up by women of the Middle East. In such countries as India and Yemen, they even went so far as to throw the powder directly into their eyes to increase their brilliance or sparkle. The word ‘surma’, which denotes the same product has become the name for antimony in most Altaic and some slavic languages. The native Mongolian term for this element ‘budag’ also means ‘eye-pigment’.
|-
|| - || stafmálmungur || The metalloid in type-metal.
|-
|| argon || letiloft || from the Greek 'a-, (negative prefix) and 'ergo' (working), the lazy gas)
 |-
|| arsenic || vomálmungur || The metalloid historically known for its deadly poisons. Although selenium and tellurium form exceedingly toxic compounds, it is arsenic that will always be associated with its killing properties, due to the classical reputation of its deadly toxic minerals. 
|-
|| astatine || stundarsöltungur, valtsöltungur || The instable halogen. 
|-
|| barium || þungjörðungur || The metal in ‘heavy earth’. The term ‘heavy earth’(þungjörð) was used for barium oxide.). Examples in other languages: Old Dutch ‘zwaaraarde-metaal’ (heavy-earth metal) 
|-
|| berkelium || birkilóarblý || ‘Birkiló’ is the Icelandic etymological equivalent of ‘Berkeley’
 |-
|| beryllium || sætumálmur || The former name of Beryllium is glucinum, from Greek glykos ‘sweet’.  Beryllium salts have a sweet taste.
|-
|| bismuth || ísblý || Very unusual (and very useful) is the fact that solid bismuth has a lower specific gravity as liquid bismuth. So solid bismuth floats on its own melt like ice on water and expands when crystallizing.). This effect is furthermore only known from water(ice), gallium and germanium. 
|-
|| boron || harðmelmingur || Boron is the the hardest metalloid.
 |-
|| bromine || rokroði || volatile redness 
|-
|| cadmium || eitursilfur || The very poisonous metal in the neighbourhood of silver. 
|-
|| calcium || beinmálmur || Calcium is situated on the same period as iron so the rules of cross-wise positioning aren’t broken. In Icelandic ‘KELKI’, an i-shift derivation of ‘KALK’ is possible. 
|-
|| californium || gullríkisblý || The element was named after the nick-name of California: The 'golden' or 'gold' state. It was named after the great gold rush. 
|-
|| carbon || kolefni || existing name 
|-
|| cerium || þórstin || The lighter brother of ‘þórsblý’ (Thorium), which is also, like ‘tin’ tetravalent. 
|-
|| cesium || andgull || When free from surface contamination, the metals Li, Na, K and Rb are silver-bright and lustrous. Caesium, however, is PALE GOLD in colour in both solid and liquid states. Because cesium is an incredible reactive metal, it was believed to be always contaminated by oxygen. Only recent techniques of purification prooved its genuine golden colour. Many reference works, who mentioned ceasium as a ‘silvery-white’ metallic element, are beginning to correct this mistake. The most unnoble metal has the same colour as the (only symbolically) noblest metal.
|-
|| chlorine || selti  || In Europe the term ‘halogen’ (salt-builder) has once been taken under consideration as a name for chlorine for it was the single known member of the halogen series. In some eastern countries like Japan, chemists prefered to derive the element’s name from ‘salt’, which in its original meaning stood for the chlorine-containing NaCl compound, rather than referring to the colour, which underlay the creation of the Western term: en-so. The old Czech name for chlorine was ‘solík’, derived from ‘s?l‘ (salt). In Icelandic, related words are often differentiated (in the root syllable) by the i-shift. Some names of elements are i-shift derivations of names of their chief sources: e.g. ‘loft’ (air) became ‘lyfti’ (nitrogen), eldur (fire) has been converted into ‘ildi’ (oxygen) and from ‘vatn’, the equivalent for hydrogen ‘vetni’ was derived. Analogous to these examples ‘selti’ would be the name for chlorine. 
|-
|| || bleikiloft || This term refers to the bleaching properties of elemental chlorine and its compounds. The name of the preceding element ‘brennisteinn’ served as a model for the coining of this neologism. The first part of the compound is a verbal derivation, designating a characteristic property (brenni, bleiki), the second part is a noun, refering to the state of aggregation of the element (steinn, loft). The word is based on the old Hungarian name ‘halvany’, derived from ‘halványit’ (to take the colour out of, to bleach).
|-
|| || gallreykur || Although an alkaline substance, bile has some characteristics in common with chlorine. It has a greenish-yellow colour and has corrosive properties. There’s also an etymological connection. The Greek translation of bile (khole) is related to ‘khlorós’ (greenish-yellow), which is the root of the name ‘chlorine’. 
|-
|| chromium || brynskin || Armour-shine. A metal known for its high lustre. It is the hardest of all metals. It equals corundum in hardness (9 on Mohs’scale). 
|-
|| cobalt || fjörvamálmur || The only metallic element found in a vitamin (B12) 
|-
|| copper || eir|| The existing name.  The synonym ‘kopar’ is foreign and can’t exist in High Icelandic. 
|-
|| curium Cm || miðkjarngull || The central ‘nuclear gold’.  Curium is the central element in the actinide series. 
|-
|| dysprosium || torfenginmálmur || Dysprosium comes from Greek ‘dysprositos’ and means ‘hard to get at’ was discovered in 1886 by Lecoq de Boisbaudran. The name is based on the difficultness of separation of the element. Neither the oxide nor the metal was available in relatively pure form until the 1950s following the development of ion-exchange separation and metallographic reduction techniques. The Greek prefix ‘dys-‘ is related to Icelandic ‘tor-‘.
|-
|| einsteinium || albjartsblý || albjartur, aðalbjartur = Albert Einstein. 
|-
|| erbium || ???? || This element is for the time being untranslatable. 
|-
|| europium || kvöldlandsefni|| 
|-
|| fermium ||efni hundrað || Fermium is the hundredth element 
|-
|| fluorine || átloft || Fluorine is a pale yellow gas that is a powerful oxidizing agent. It is the most reactive and electronegative of all the elements and reacts with practically all substances. 
|-
|| francium || stundarmálmur || named after stundarsöltungur At, which is the daughter-product of 'francium'. Francium is the most unstable of the first 101 elements. 
|-
|| gadolinium || leyndarjárn || Gadolinium is unique in being ferromagnetic up to room temperature. No other chemical elements except iron, cobalt and nickel are ferromagnetic. 
|-
|| gallium || ísmálmur || Gallium exhibits the unique property of melting at an ordinary temperature (29°C) and the liquid metal can exist in the supercooled state at a temperature as low as 0°C. The metal expands on solidifying like ice. As a consequence, solid gallium floats on its own melt like ice on water and expands when crystallizing. It shares this property only with two other metals (bismuth and germanium). At extremely high levels of purity, the metal takes on a glassy white appearance. In earthly temperate environments gallium is, like ice, a thawing substance. 
|-
|| germanium || hálftin || The prefix ‘hálf’ refers on the one hand to the semimetallic properties of germanium and on the other to its being situated exactly in the middle between silicon and tin. In this latter sense the prefix is used in the same way as someone in his semitwenties is called ‘hálfþrítugur’. 
|-
|| gold || gull || the existing name 
|-
|| hafnium || hliðarblý || 
|-
|| hahnium || hanaefni || The German name ‘hahn’ means ‘cock’ 
|-
|| helium || kóngsloft || The three heavier noble gases can be converted into fluorides, argon into insertion compounds, but not helium or neon. But a few insertion compounds are now predicted for helium. If confirmed by experiments, this will end the chemical nobility of helium leaving neon as the only inert element. It is the second noblest of the noble gases, the royal gas (kóngaloft). The use of ‘king’ as a superlative of ‘noble’ isn’t unprecedented in the chemical nomenclature. Think of aqua regia, royal water (kóngavatn). The latter substance was so named by the alchemists because it dissolves gold and platinum, at that time called ‘the royal metals’. Another characteristic of helium is its nuclear stability. The most abundant isotope He 4 has magic numbers for protons and neutrons. The only other gas possessing this property is oxygen (O-16), but this element is most unnoble in chemical respect. Helium is a royal gas both in its chemical and nuclear properties. The Dutch dictionary mentions the synonym ‘zonnegas’ (sólarloft), a native equivalent of the standard term. It is true that most of the helium in our solar system is found in the sun’s interior, but hydrogen is still the most abundant solar gas. 
|-
|| holmium || hólmefni || 
|-
|| hydrogen || vetni, frumloft || existing name 
|-
|| indium || skræksilfur || Indium and tin produce the so-called tin-cry if a bar of the pure metal is bent. Indium is situated more closely to silver than is tin. 
|-
|| iodine || þengi || The old Czech name of the element was ‘chaluzík’, derived from ‘chaluha’ (sea-weed). We can also refer to the original source of iodine, the seaweeds, from which it has been recovered on a commercial scale for a long time: ‘þengi’. 
|-
|| iridium || litagull || Because of the variety of its colours, the metal was called after Iris, the godess of the rainbow. We can use ‘gull’ because the metal is known as a silvery white metal but with a yellowish cast. 
|-
|| iron || járn || 
|- 
|| krypton || stikuloft || because The SI standard definition of the length of the metre was based on a certain amount of wavelengths of the orange-red emission line emitted by krypton-86 atoms. 
|-
||lanthanum || leyndarmálmur || The icelandic name means ‘secret metals’, which is close enough to the idea expressed by the word lanthanein (to be conceiled, which is the origin of ‘lanthanum’. 
|-
|| lead || blý, sakk || from ‘sakka’, (sinker, which were originally made of ‘lead’ 
|-
|| lithium || sálmálmur || The best-known metallic element in psychopharmaceuticals. 
|-
|| lutetium||  leðjuhólmsefni || Lutatia means ‘mud-hovels’, from ‘lutum’ (mud), ancient name of Paris. The Romans call it ‘Lutetia’ Parisiorum, the mud-town of the Parisii, lying on the ‘île de la cité’ (These kind of islands are called ‘hólmur’ in Icelandic. 
|-
|| magnesium || klémálmur || Soapstone, the most abundant magnesium compound is often used in ‘kljásteinn’, also called ‘kljár’ or ‘klé). Soapstone is also called ‘kléberg’ in Icelandic. In Icelandic, the derivation ‘TELKI’ from ‘TALK’ is possible. 
|-
|| manganese || valjárn || Because manganese ores were confounded with magnetic iron ores. 
|-
|| mendelevium || mundilleifsblý || Mendeleev means ‘descendent of Mendel’. In German the name ‘Mendelsohn’ is the Germanic equivalent of the Russian name. Mendel is a Yiddish pet form of ‘Menahem’, which means ‘ comforter’ in Hebrew. The closed Icelandic name that sounds alike is ‘Mundill’, mentioned in the orðsifjabók. It is the name of a sea-king. It also exists as the first member in the mythological name Mundilfari. The Russian ‘-ev’ ending means the same as ‘-son’ in Icelandic patronymic names. The suffix ‘leifur in proper names means ‘descendant of’ and is semanticly similar with the ‘ev’ ending. The name Mendeleev (German spelling ‘Mendelejeff’) in High Icelandic is MUNDILLEIFUR (descendant of Mundill (Mendel)). 
|-
|| mercury || flotmálmur || kvikasilfur is a loan-translation 
|-
|| molybdenum || lífssilfur || Molybdenium is the only element on the period of silver that has a biological function. 
|-
|| neodymium || nýtvíburamálmur || Didymia is sometimes called the ‘twin earth’. It consists of ‘praseodymia’, which means ‘leek green twin earth’ and ‘neodymia’ (new twin earth). Neodymium is the most abundant metal in dydymium. For that reason we call neodymium the ‘new twin earth metal’ 
|-
|| neon || glóloft || Coined after the Maori word ‘haukura’ (hau = air, gas + kura (red glowing). The brightness of the discharge of neon is the most intense of all noble gases. In Icelandic the reddish-orange colour can be translated by ‘gló-‘. It is the only totally inert element and the most noble element of the periodic table.
|-
|| neptunium || njarðarblý || named after the star Neptune, Njörð 
|-
|| nickel || hvíteir || Nickel is situated left of copper. The resemblance between the most important ore of nickel (niccolite, kupfernickel) and copper-ore is so striking that both minerals were more than often confused. The clearest point of distinction between the pure metals is of course the colour. The latter is silvery-white, while copper has a reddish-brown colour. Two periods up in the same series we encounter a similar case: platinum, a white metal that precedes the lustrous yellow gold. In many languages, also in Icelandic, the name for platinum was found upon its colour, differing from the neighbouring gold (hvítagull, white gold). In the same way, nickel could be designated as ‘hvíteir’ (white copper). 
|-
|| niobium || freyjusilfur || The heavier brother of ‘Freyjujárn’ on the period of silver. 
|-
|| nitrogen || hyldi, lyfti|| existing names 
|-
|| nobelium || elfráðsblý || Alfred’s lead 
|-
|| osmium || þefmálmur || The stinking metal. Of the platinum metals, osmium is the most rapidly attacked by air. The powdered metal, even at room temperature, exudes the characteristic odour of the poisonous, volatile tetroxide. 
|-
|| oxygen || ildi || The gas that make things burn. The word is derived from ‘eldur’ (fire). 
|-
|| || líft || Icelandic ‘loft’   + ‘líf’.  A calque of the 18th century term of the English chemist Robert Boyle: ‘vital air’. 
|-
|| palladium || gleypisilfur || sometimes called ‘metal sponge’ because the metal can absorb up to 900 times its own volume of hydrogen. 
|-
|| phosphorus || hélog || After the first name 'aerial noctiluca', coined by the British chemist Robert Boyle.  Noctiluca was named ‘hélog’ in the 19th century but the term became obsolete.  In High Icelandic it is revived in the meaning of phosphorus. 
|-
|| platinum || hvítagull || existing name 
|-
|| plutonium || heljarblý || Named after the Nordic equivalent of the name Pluto 
|-
|| - || kjarngull || Substances, valuable to men are often compared to gold as appears from some alternative designations: e.g. the black gold (coal), the liquid gold (gasoline), the soft gold (fur) and so on. This way of name-giving is also applicable to plutonium for it was the first and still is the most important element used in nuclear power industry. Uranium was known before people knew about its fissionability. 
|-
|| polonium || múspellsblý || The lead in the group of ildi, brennisteinn (surtsgull), the “elements of fire”. 
|-
|| potassium || andeir || the unnoble metal in group 1A on the same period as copper, which is situated in group 1B, compare andsilfur (rubidium) and andgull (cesium). 
|-
|| praseaodymium || grænburumálmur || The lanthanide in the leek-green earth, also sometimes called ‘green twin earth’): grænburajörð (praseodymium). 
|-
|| promethium || eldþjófsmálmur || Promethium stole the fire of the gods. 
|-
|| protactinium || freyjublý || The element that desintegrates into lead which has the properties of elements in the Vanadium group (freyjujárnsflokkur). 
|-
|| radium || magnablý || Radium-isotopes are mostly alpha-decay products of Thorium-isotopes. Magni was the first son of Thor. He inherited Mjölnir. 
|-
|| radon || geislaloft || radon = magnaloft (see ‘radium’), thoron = þórsloft (see ‘thorium’), actinon = hnossarloft (see ‘actinium’). 
|-
|| rhenium || rínefni || 
|-
|| rhodium || góðsilfur || The noblest metal on the period of silver. Rhodium has been used for honours, or to symbolize wealth, when more commonly used metals such as silver, gold, or platinum are deemed insufficient. In 1979 the Guinness Book of World Records gave Paul McCartney a rhodium-plated disc for being history's all-time best-selling songwriter and recording artist. Guinness has also noted items such as the world's &quot;Most Expensive Pen&quot; or &quot;Most Expensive Board Game&quot; as containing rhodium. 
|-
|| rubidium || andsilfur || The unnoble, alkali counter-part of silveron the same period but in the A series. 
|-
|| ruthenium || ofurjárn || super-iron 
|-
|| rutherfordium || nýhlíðarmálmur || The new transition metal 
|-
|| samarium || efstingjamálmur || named after a mineral Samarskite, which was named in the honour of COLONEL samarski. 
|-
|| Scandium || þorþveitarjárn || the mineral thortveitite  is the primary source of scandium. It was named after Olaus Thortveit (Icelandic: Þortveit).  The element belongs to the iron-group of transition elements. 
|-
|| Seaborgium || ofurtorsoði || super-, or eka-tungsten 
|-
|| selenium || rætlumelmingur || radish-metalloid. Selenium and selenides are detected by heating the powdered mineral on charcoal and are detected by a very pronounced smell described as radishes or rotting radishes. The element also occurs in radishes to a significant extent. The Old Hungarian name for Selenium is ‘reteny’ derived from ‘retek’ (radish). The Icelandic ‘rætla’is the purely Icelandic equivalent of ‘hreðka’ and ‘radísa’. 
|-
|| silicon || sandkol, sendi || the carbon in sand (silicon dioxide). 
|-
|| silver || silfur || existing name 
|-
|| sodium || sæmálmur || The terms ‘muriatic acid’ and ‘marine acid’ were synonymous terms for what is now called ‘hydrochloric acid’, thus signifying its relation to the sodium contained in brine (Latin: muria) or sea (Latin: mare). Since sodium is the most abundant metallic element in sea water we could refer to it as the ‘marine metal’ (sæmálmur). An example of the use of this particular compound is Maori: ‘konutae’ (sea-metal, konu-, prefix denoting a natural metal, tae, sea. 
|-
|| strontium || beinsilfur || The bone-metal on the period of silver. 
|-
|| sulphur, brimstone || brennisteinn || existing name 
|-
|| || surtsgull || The gold of Surtr, the fire giant 
|-
|| tantalum || þorstmálmur || The oxide Ta2O5 is insoluble in acid, and was unable, just as the mythological Tantalos in the Hades, &quot;to quench his thirst&quot;. 
|-
|| technetium || gervisilfur || The artificial element on the same period as silver. 
|-
|| tellurium || múspellstin || The prefix ‘Múspells-‘ is used for elements of the chalcogen familily. The chalcogens are ‘the elements of fire’. Fluorine and Chlorine are more aggressive, but they are much rarer than their periodical predecessors. They could never have become the large part of a breathable atmosphere on a planet. So it was oxygen that was named after ‘fire’ instead of F and Cl. This is visible in the names ‘ildi’ (oxygen, the element that eables burning), ‘brennistein’ or ‘surtsgull’ (sulphur), the fire-coloured burning element, which was considered to be earthy equivalent of fire in Alchemy.
|-
||- || kóngsmálmungur || Gold has for some reason a special affinity for tellurium. The most abundant gold-compounds found in nature are the various tellurides of which calaverite is the most important. For that reason tellurium is called ‘kóngsmálmungur’ (compare: Aqua regia (king's water) was named after its property to dissolve gold, the king of metals) 
|-
|| terbium || mógætisjörðungur || Its oxides (earths) are chocolate in colour. chocolate = mógæti. 
|-
|| thallium || linblý || Thallium is always described as resembling soft lead. I can’t imagine a better description for this element. In the neighbourhood of lead on the periodic table only one applies to the description ‘soft lead’: thallium. 
|-
|| thorium || þórsblý || Named after the minerals thorite and thorianite. 
|-
|| thulium || nyrstingjamálmur || nyrstingar = the northernmost people 
|-
|| tin || tin || existing name 
|-
|| titanium || léttjárn || The light metal on the iron-group of transition elements.  Scandium rather belongs to the so-called rare-earth elements. 
|-
|| tungsten || torsoði || Tunsten has the highest boiling point (5660°C) of all substances). The Icelandic ‘wolfram’ is a foreignism and ‘þungsteinn’ is a loan-word from Swedish. 
|-
|| uranium || áablý || Metallic element having the two heaviest of the three so-called parent isotopes, which could also be called forefathers in the radioactive series. I used the term ‘áablý’ (forefather lead) because the planet-name Uranus, from which the name of the element is derived, was originally the name of the forefather of all Greek gods. 
|-
|| vanadium || freyjujárn || The name originates from ‘Vanadís’(the fairy of the Vanir), which was a nick-name of the godess Freyja. 
|-
|| xenon || framandloft || from Greek 'xeno', strange 
|-
|| ytterbium || ytribæjungur || The name Ytterby is composed from ytter = outer (Icelandic ‘ytri’), and by = village (Icelandic ‘bær’, genitive ‘bæjar’), and means ‘outer village’. 
|-
|| yttrium || leyndarsilfur || The brother of lanthanum (leyndarmálmur) on the period of silver. 
|-
|| zink || eirgyllir || In 1677, a chemist called Kunckelin pronounced that cadmia (zinc ore) is a metallic calx and that it gives the copper a golden-yellow copper by giving its metal up to it. Zinc is the ‘golden-yellow-maker’ of copper. 
|-
|| zirconium || hliðartin, tinfrændi || The equivalent of tin in the group of transition elements

==Native names of large numerals==

* miklund: million.  From 'mikil-hund-rað'.  The adjective 'mikill' is a translation of Greek 'megas', which is the Greek etymological and semantical equivalent.
* þursund: billion.  From 'þurs-hund-rað'.  The word 'þurs' means 'giant' and is a translation of 'giga-' (which is related to English 'giant'.)

The names of the following three magnitudes of thousand are coined by employing 'þús-' (from þúsund, denoting a thousand units) and 'þurs-' (from þursund, denoting a billion units): þús-þursund (thousand times a billion), þurs-miklund (A billion times a million) and þurs-þursund (a billion times a billion).

|-
|10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;|| miklund (mikill, mégas) || milljón || million

|10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;|| tímælt þúsund || kvintilljón || nonillion
|}


For numbers larger than 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; the formula 'X-mælt þúsund' is employed.  The origin of this method can be found in the Íslensk Orðsifjabók (Icelandic etymological dictionary), where the entry 'kvinkvilljón' (10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;) is explained as 'fimmmælt milljón'.

== Introduction ==

'''For Homeschoolers and Other Educators'''

Lapbooking in its most basic form is an educational tool where the student makes small foldables, miniature books, or other small paper activities and places them in a specially folded file folder to accompany a unit study. The paper miniatures are often referred to as ''minits''. Lapbooking, however does not need to be limited to file folders as you will see in the coming chapters. The how-to pages are heavily illustrated with photos making the instructions easy to follow. A young child from about pre-school age to around seven years-old will need adult help in completing the minits. An older child, from about age 8 up, will likely be able to complete minits on his/her own.

== Warning about POV issues ==

Please refer to our policy here:  [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]]

It is a point of view that a language should be pure, and not everybody will have this same point of view.  A Wikipedia article on this topic is found here to compare:  [[w:High Icelandic]]  Please also note the discussion on the talk page for this Wikipedia article as well:  [[w:Talk:High Icelandic]].  This brings out most of my concern here for this Wikibook as well.

I'm not throwing up the ugly NPOV tag on this page, because I don't think it needs it right now.  This is mainly just a warning that perhaps the content could drift toward a NPOV violation and you need to be careful.  Otherwise, please continue to develop this content as best as you can.  You might want to get some ideas from the [[German]] and [[French]] Wikibooks in terms of style and how some outstanding language books have been put together. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:11, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Image copyright problem: [[:Image:200px-Travels_charley.jpg]] ==

You recently uploaded [[:Image:200px-Travels_charley.jpg]], a picture of the front cover of the book, ''Travels With Charley''. However, you neglected to specify copyright or license information for the image. All images require permission from the copyright holder under a free license, unless [[w:fair use|fair use]] applies, and you need to give this information. Images without a free license or fair use become '''deleted'''.

My guess is that you did not have permission or license to include the front cover image into Wikibooks. Therefore, you need to determine if [[w:fair use|fair use]] applies, then
* [[:Image:200px-Travels_charley.jpg|Edit the image page]] and add [[WB:ICT|a copyright tag]] such as {{tl|fairuse}}
* '''or''' request for, or otherwise wait for, the removal and deletion of the images.

Sorry if this is a problem, but as the uploader of the image, you are best positioned to defend the image against deletion, should you want to do so. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:37, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

I also marked nearly every other image on the [[Travels With Charley: In Search of America]] as '''no license''', and one I marked as a copyright violation of http://www.pecos-tx.org/ ... Did you read the [[Special:Upload|Upload file]] page when you uploaded the images? It says:

&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Most images on the internet are copyrighted and are not appropriate for uploading to Wikibooks. You also cannot modify them and upload them here.'''&lt;/span&gt;

I am suspicious of all of your images, because one is from http://www.pecos-tx.org/ and that web site does not use a free license (such as our [[GNU Free Documentation License]] or a Creative Commons Attribution or Attribution-ShareAlike license) and does not appear to be in the public domain. However, if anyone gave you free license on one of the images, please ''save that image'' and add a [[WB:ICT|license tag]].

Please be more careful when uploading images. You are welcome to continue contributing to Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:40, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

Thanks.  I'll take care of the images.  The book picture (and two others) were taken off 
of Wikipedia.  Shouldn't they be governed by the free documentation license?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Proposed name change==

I'd like to change all the subpages of this book so that they begin with &quot;Acoustics/&quot; rather than &quot;Acoustics:&quot; to make it in line with the current naming convention. I trust such a change won't be controversial, but note it here in advance to allow for comments, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:02, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

==Science and Technology==

I support distinguishing science from technology.  Technology changes rapidly from month to month; yesterday's technology will be obsolete tomorrow.  Scientific principles may grow in complexity and understanding, but never lose validity.  Understanding science requires studying mathematics and acquiring knowledge slowly but surely, in the form of laws and theories; but understanding technology requires following trademarks, products, licensing, and copyrighted names and details which apply primarily to commercial products.  Technology, while important, is expensive.  Science is free.  Technology is driven by the motive of making profits.  Science is open and motivated by intellectual curiosity.  But above all, when people are seeking information, they can usually determine in advance which they are looking for, and making this elementary distinction helps them decide, and information providers determine, where it belongs.  The distinction may involve complications, but I believe it's worthwhile. [[User:D021317c|D021317c]] 05:40, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

* I don't understand the point or purpose of your comment... Can you please make the connection? [[User:Stevenmitchell|Stevenmitchell]] ([[User talk:Stevenmitchell|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stevenmitchell|contribs]]) 20:03, 17 June 2011 (UTC)

== Support name change ==
Agree with Jguk that Acoustics/ is better, considering current conventions. [[User:Wildtornado|Wildtornado]] 06:28, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

== Featured Books getting vandalised ==

Why not show the approved versions of books (rather than the drafts) that have links from the main page  so that the vandalism is not as noticeable

== Duplicated topics ==

Many chapters of this book were simply copied from an earlier book called &quot;Engineering Acoustics&quot; with no reference or acknowledgement.  The chapters were cosmetically altered but are obviously copies of the original.  This is plagierism, and there should be something to prevent such thing.  The chapters in question should have been replaced by links to the original page.  The authors would have been better off editing the original and cleaning it up.

== PDF ==

I would like to request that a PDF version of this book be made.  It would be very useful.

DONE --[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 10:22, 15 March 2013 (UTC)

==No References, Citations or even a Bibliography==
Why would this book have been recommended as an open book? There are no references, no citations or notes - not even a bibliography. As mentioned above by a contributor under the section entitled &quot;duplicated topics&quot;, that user believes that this is information hijacked from a book entitled, &quot;engineering acoustics&quot;. I have no idea if that is correct or not, but the fact that it uses or cites no references whatsoever, should be alarming to Wikipedia, especially for it to be a &quot;featured book&quot;. Without any form of reference, the likelihood to have been plagiarized at the very least in parts if not all is very high... For any writing to take place, there are source materials that provide the base of the article or book. Who writes an authoritative non-fiction text without sources? No one. This should have been a red flag to Wikipedia... [[User:Stevenmitchell|Stevenmitchell]] ([[User talk:Stevenmitchell|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stevenmitchell|contribs]]) 20:25, 17 June 2011 (UTC)

== Music production ==

This excellent book and its subject material would be extremely important--some might say vital--to music producers and audio engineers as well as to physicists. As it crosses a boundary between two very distinct fields (one an art, one a science) I think it should be listed in the musical category, as well as tucked away in the sciences. I hope this will make sense, and that I'm not stepping on any toes by already making the appropriate change. I am a new Wikibookian and just want to give assurance that I'm not just editing away senselessly.--[[User:AJRussell|AJRussell]] ([[User talk:AJRussell|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AJRussell|contribs]]) 23:25, 22 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Sanskrit is written in the Devanagari script, one of the oldest writing systems in the world.  Some other languages such as Hindi and Marathi are also written in Devanagari, but Sanskrit is the first language to use this writing system.  Originally Sanskrit was not a written language, and when it started being written, a number of different scripts were used initially, until Devanagari became the standard.

==How many people speak this language?==
A little more than two hundred thousand (200,000) people in the world can speak Sanskrit very well. Sanskrit is an old language and is mostly used by priests and scholars of old texts including many religious ones. Many people know at least a little Sanskrit because of the importance it has to other Indian languages and the Hindu religion.

==Where is this language spoken?==
Sanskrit was used widely in ancient times, but nowadays there are very few areas in the world where this language is spoken.  It was invented in India, and some communities in India still speak in Sanskrit.  Many Asian Buddhists can also speak Sanskrit.  It is found in Hindu holy writings and hymns.  It is known to be used regularly in some areas in South India, though. In many remote villages in India Sanskrit is spoken even today. Sanskrit is the official language of the Indian state of Uttarakhand.

==What is the history of this language?==

There are many theories to how Sanskrit came into existence. One of them is about an Aryan migration from the west into India who brought their language with them. Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe. The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of Upanishads, Sanskrit just faded due to hierarchy.  Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served to be the source for many modern Indian languages, just like Latin is the source for European languages like French and Spanish.

Sanskrit was considered a high-level language and was spoken by officials, kings, noblemen, etc.  It was difficult for the common man to comprehend Sanskrit.  Sanskrit eventually became almost extinct, but it was kept alive by holy men, scholars, and Buddhists.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
Many ancient writers such as Vyasa, Valmiki, Kalidasa, Bhasa, Bhartruhari, and Chanakya wrote in Sanskrit.  It is a rich language and they became famous for enriching it further.  The great Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata, are written in Sanskrit, as are the Vedas, Upanishads, and Subhashitratnani.

===Sanskrit===
&lt;poem&gt;
कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।

—श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता (२:४७)
&lt;/poem&gt;

===In English letters===
&lt;poem&gt;
karmany evadhikaras te ma phaleshu kadachana

—Shri Bhagvatgita (Chapter 2 verse 47)
&lt;/poem&gt;

===English Translation===
&lt;poem&gt;
Your right is to work only,
But never to its fruits;
Let not the fruits of action be thy motive,
Nor let thy attachment be to inaction.
—Shri Bhagvatgita (2:47)
&lt;/poem&gt;

* karmani—prescribed duties
* eva—certainly
* adhikarah—right
* te—of you
* ma—never
* phaleshu—in the fruits
* kadachana—at any time

      <text xml:space="preserve">If this text is for school age children, it is important to maintain simple sentence and paragraph structure.  It is also more important to use accurate language than flamboyant language.  It troubles me that I had to struggle with a few of the sentences here.  I've got a heck of a lot of education and if I can't determine the meaning of a sentence, I doubt that a school kid could.  For instance, what is the following non-sentence really trying to say:
:Specialist cats like African servals that catch birds and rodents using their unique talents, aerial acrobats like the South American margay and rugged adventurers like the sand cat that eke out a living under difficult conditions. 
I can't tell which activity or quality refers to which creature. The details are open ended. Off the top of my head, I can't recall the hunting styles of these small wild cats.  This &quot;description&quot; doesn't help me. 

I'm not saying that the writing in this article is incoherent or unintelligible.  Just that we all need to keep working to make this very worth-while project succeed.[[User:Ande B.|Ande]] 09:42, 7 April 2006 (UTC)


What cat rules the European continent?  About three times on the 'Meet the Cats' page, it is mentioned that they are found in all continents except Australia (and sometimes Antarctica).  Perhaps the English lion is included.

Also, didn't Australia have a Tasmanian Tiger or some such? ~ Apostrophyx

I definitely see a need for a revision and the elimination of some of the unneccesary parts of this introduction.  For one thing I found the first paragraph a little confusing.  (Maybe it's me?)  Also the first few sentances of the paragraphs should be an introduction to the main point of the paragraph.  Nice work though! [[User:Khsater|Khsater]] 03:18, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

== Hii inchi na ya nani? ==

Any idea what language this is or what part of Africa it's from? It seems pretty vague to just say &quot;In Africa....&quot; [[User:Wasabe3543|Wasabe3543]] 14:23, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

The ARM architecture is a widely used 32-bit RISC processor architecture.
In fact, the ARM family accounts for about 75% of all 32-bit CPUs, and about 90% of all embedded 32-bit CPUs.
ARM Limited licenses several popular microprocessor cores to many vendors (ARM does not sell physical microprocessors). Originally ARM stood for &lt;i&gt;Advanced RISC Machines&lt;/i&gt;.

Some cores offered by ARM:
* ARM7TDMI
* ARM9
* ARM11

Some examples of ARM based processors:

* Intel X-Scale (PXA-255 and PXA-270), used in &lt;!-- some? most? all? --&gt; Palm PDAs
* Philips LPC2000 family (ARM7TDMI-S core), LPC3000 family (ARM9 core)
* Atmel AT91SAM7 (ARM7TDMI core)
* ST Microelectronics STR710 (ARM7TDMI core)
* Freescale MCIMX27 series (ARM9 core)

The lowest-cost ARM processors (in the LPC2000 series) have dropped below US$ 5 in ones, which is less than the cost of many 16-bit and 8-bit microprocessors.

== Thumb calling convention ==

In ARM Thumb code, the 16 registers r0 - r15 typically have the same roles they have in all ARM code:

* r0 - r3, called a1 - a4: argument/scratch/result registers.
* r4 - r9, called v1 - v6: variables
* r10, called sl: stack limit
* r11, called fp: frame pointer (usually not used in Thumb code)
* r12, called ip
* r13, called sp: stack pointer
* r14, called lr: link register
* r15, called pc: the program counter

The standard C calling convention for ARM Thumb is:&lt;ref name=&quot;toolkit&quot;&gt;
ARM.
[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0041c/DUI0041C.pdf ARM Software Development Toolkit].
1997.
Chapter 9: ARM Procedure Call Standard.
Chapter 10: Thumb Procedure Call Standard.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Subroutine-preserved registers ====
When the return address is placed in pc (r15), returning from the subroutine,
the sp, fp, sl, and v1-v6 registers must contain the same values they did when the subroutine was called.

==== The stack ====
Every execution environment has a limit to how low in memory the stack can grow -- the &quot;minimum sp&quot;.

In order to give interrupts (which may occur at any time) room to work,
at every instant the memory between sp and the &quot;minimum sp&quot; must contain nothing of value to the executing program.

Systems where the application and its library support code is responsible for detecting and handling stack overflow are called &quot;explicit stack limit&quot;.
In such systems, the sl register must always point at least 256 bytes higher address than the &quot;minimum sp&quot;.

==== Caller-preserved registers ====

A subroutine is free to clobber a1-a4, ip, and lr.

==== Return values ====
If the subroutine returns a simple value no bigger than one word, the value must be in a1 (r0).

If the subroutine returns a simple floating-point value, the value is encoded in a1; or {a1, a2}; or {a1, a2, a3}, whichever is sufficient to hold the full precision.

==== A typical subroutine ====

The simplest entry and exit sequence for Thumb functions is:&lt;ref name=&quot;toolkit&quot; /&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;an_example_Thumb_subroutine:
    PUSH {save-registers, lr} ; one-line entry sequence
    ; ... first part of function ...
    BL subroutine_name 	;Must be in a space of +/- 4 MB 
    ; ... rest of function goes here, perhaps including other function calls
    ; ...
    POP {save-registers, pc} ; one-line exit sequence
&lt;/source&gt;

== ARM calling convention ==

The standard C calling convention for ARM is specified in detail by ARM PLC.&lt;ref&gt;
The [http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0042b/IHI0042B_aapcs.pdf &quot;Procedure Call Standard for the ARM Architecture&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest entry and exit sequence for 32-bit ARM functions is very similar to Thumb functions:&lt;ref&gt;
RealView Compilation Tools Developer Guide
[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0203j/Cacjfjei.html &quot;Calling between C, C++, and ARM assembly language&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://simplemachines.it/doc/arm_inst.pdf ]
section &quot;Stacks and Subroutines&quot; p. 59
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0204j/Cacbgchh.html#id4849289 &quot;Stacking registers for nested subroutines&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;an_example_ARM32_subroutine:
    PUSH {r4-r11, lr} ; one-line function prologue
    ; ... first part of function ...
    BL subroutine_name 	;Must be in a space of +/- 4 MB 
    ; ... rest of function goes here, perhaps including other function calls
    ; ...
    POP {r4-r11, pc} ; one-line exit sequence (function epilogue)
&lt;/source&gt;

Using alternate mnemonics for the same instructions,
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;an_example_ARM32_subroutine:
    ; Push the return address (in LR) and the work registers
    ; &quot;store multiple registers, full descending&quot;
    STMFD sp!,{r4-r11, lr} ; aka PUSH {r4-r11, lr}
    ; (A &quot;sp&quot; alone would leave the stack pointer unchanged.
    ; We must use &quot;sp!&quot; to update the stack pointer appropriately.)
    ; ... first part of function ...
    BL subroutine_name 	;Must be in a space of +/- 4 MB 
    ; ... rest of function goes here, perhaps including other function calls
    ; ...
    ; Pop the return address (into PC) and the work registers
    ; and return automatically.    
    ; &quot;load multiple registers, full descending&quot;
    LDMFD sp!,{r4-r11, pc} ; aka POP {r4-r11, pc}
&lt;/source&gt;

The BL (branch-and-link) instruction
stores the return address in the link register LR (r14) and loads the program counter PC (r15) with the subroutine address.
Typical subroutines (as shown above) immediately push that return address onto the stack.
That frees up r14 so that the subroutine can call sub-subroutines of its own.

==== Subroutine-preserved registers ====

Typically r4-r11 are used to hold local variables of the currently-executing routine.

The registers r4-r11 are &quot;subroutine-preserved registers&quot; --
When the subroutine places the return address in pc (r15), returning from the subroutine,
the registers r4-r11 and the stack pointer sp (r13) must contain the same values they did when the subroutine was called.

Typical subroutines (as shown above) immediately push the values of those registers onto the stack.
That frees up r4-r11 to hold local variables of the currently-executing subroutine.

Optimizing ARM compilers save and restore the precise subset of r4-r11 and r14 (if any) actually modified by that subroutine,
since it is a little slower (but otherwise harmless) to save and restore registers that are unused by that subroutine.

==== scratch registers ====

A subroutine is free to clobber r0-r3, r12, and the link register lr (r14).

The first four registers r0-r3 are used to pass argument values into a subroutine and to return a result value from a function.

== Mixed ARM32 and Thumb calls ==

Normal function calls are easy with the BL instruction.
A person types

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;    BL destination_subroutine
&lt;/source&gt;

and the assembler and linker will automatically Do the Right Thing --
inserting the appropriate (32-bit-long) ARM32 BL instruction for ARM32-to-ARM32 or ARM32-to-Thumb call
or the appropriate (32-bit-long)&lt;ref&gt;
[infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0234b/i107462.html &quot;Thumb Branch with Link (BL)&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt; Thumb BL instruction for Thumb-to-Thumb or Thumb-to-ARM32 instruction.

(Some mixed calls and some long branches require the linker
to insert code that overwrites scratch register r12 with a temporary value.
Exactly how the linker does that can be confusing,
especially when you mix in using the BX and BLX instructions.&lt;ref&gt;

Nouns and verbs are great, but sooner or later you'll want to start describing them; sure, you've got a fruit, but what colour is it? What shape is it? Is it hard or soft? How bouncy is it? To answer questions like these you'll probably want some ''adjectives''.

== Agreement ==

Everyone learns in school that adjectives are words that describe a noun. Because of their close relationship with nouns, many languages will force their adjectives to &quot;agree&quot; with the noun they're modifying. Most of the time this means that adjectives will have different forms depending on the form of their noun. Adjectives can agree with any of the details that we discussed back in nominal morphology; Case, Number, Gender, or anything else that a language might decide to mark on its nouns.

In English, we have nothing like this, so just to make it a little easier to understand here's an example of how English verbs and nouns inflect to match each other.

 *The horses eats an apple.

To any English speaker that sounds incorrect. The problem is that &quot;horses&quot; is a ''plural'' word, and &quot;eats&quot; is the third person ''singular'' verb &quot;to eat&quot;. To make this correct you would have to change the noun to its singular form:

 The horse eats an apple.

The other possibility would be to change &quot;eats&quot; to a plural:

 The horses eat an apple.

Now that's slightly awkward because it means a bunch of horses are eating one apple, but it's grammatically correct. In many languages, adjectives have to match nouns in the same way that English verbs have to match their subjects. Let's pretend that English had adjectival inflection for a moment. What would it look like?

Singular noun phrases (remember &quot;noun phrases&quot; from earlier?) could look just as they do in real-world English: &quot;solid table&quot;, &quot;happy child&quot;, &quot;brown dog&quot;, &quot;tall woman&quot;. Suppose that plural noun phrases had the plural ending &quot;-s&quot; on adjectives: &quot;solids tables&quot;, &quot;happys children&quot;, &quot;browns dogs&quot;, &quot;talls women&quot; &amp;mdash; these would all be correct in this hypothetical version of English.  The adjectives would become &quot;plural&quot; along with the nouns they modified.

Don't get the impression that the affix that is added to the adjective has to look the same as the one that is added to the noun. I could have said that our hypothetical English has plural adjectives ending with &quot;-pa&quot;; &quot;solidpa tables&quot;, &quot;happypa children&quot;, &amp;c. It's just that &quot;-s&quot; is a very natural sounding suffix in English.

Returning to reality, languages that have agreement on their adjectives include Greek, Latin, Polish, and Russian. Esperanto is an example of a conlang which does this too: ''alta viro'' (a tall man), ''altaj viroj'' (tall men). Some languages, such as German, have a complex system of adjectival endings which depend on the gender, number and case of the noun, as well as what type of determiner, if any, precedes the adjective.   (Determiners are words like 'a', 'the', 'this', 'all', 'my' etc.)

 ein großer Mann &quot;a tall man&quot;
 der große Mann  &quot;the tall man&quot;
 
 eine große Frau &quot;a tall woman&quot;
 die große Frau  &quot;the tall woman&quot;
 
 ein großes Haus &quot;a big house&quot;
 das große Haus  &quot;the big house&quot;
 
 Ich sehe einen großen Mann &quot;I see a tall man.&quot;

Remember, any concept that can be marked on the noun can also be agreed with by the adjective, so be inventive. In your own language you may choose to have a similarly complex system, a simple system, or no adjective inflections at all.

== Comparison ==

The most common kind of inflection that is found only on adjectives, rather than applied to adjectives in agreement with nouns, is ''comparison''. In English, we have three different &quot;degrees&quot; of comparison; ''positive'', ''comparative'', and ''superlative''.

Comparison is a way that two nouns that both possess a certain quality (specified by an adjective) can be compared. Many Indo-European languages have this three-degree system; in some languages, as in English, some words are inflected, some have distinct words for the different forms ([[Wikipedia:suppletion|suppletion]]) while others have their comparative forms marked with separate particles. Here's a table of some of the English forms:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
! Positive
! Comparative
! Superlative
|-
| good
| better
| best
|-
| strong
| stronger
| strongest
|-
| beautiful
| more beautiful
| most beautiful
|}

There are other possibilities, as well. A system of augmentative or diminutive affixes might be used for both nouns and adjectives, and take the place of comparative forms; so the same affix might turn &quot;hill&quot; into &quot;mountain&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; into &quot;stronger&quot; or &quot;very strong&quot;. There might be only two, or more than three degrees of comparison in the system.

== Adverbs ==

Most people think of adverbs as being just like adjectives except that they help to describe verbs instead of nouns. But actually, adverbs can be used to describe more than just verbs:

; Verb      : &quot;She ran ''quickly''.&quot;
; Adjective : &quot;The ball is ''definitely'' red.&quot;
; Sentence  : &quot;''Naturally'', he did what he could.&quot;

This apparent versatility comes from the fact that adverbs are a &quot;catch-all&quot; category. That is, when people find a word that isn't a noun, verb, or other known part of speech they'll usually call it an adverb regardless of whether it can be used to describe verbs.
&lt;!-- TODO: how you work with adverbs in your conlang --&gt;

== Distinction of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs ==

In English, French, Greek and many other Indo-European languages it makes sense to describe verbs, adjectives, and adverbs as three different &quot;parts of speech&quot;. But in some languages, like German or Turkish, adjectives and adverbs are essentially the same part of speech; the same word in the same form can modify a noun or a verb, if it makes sense to do so. For example, in English we use an adjective like &quot;fast&quot; to describe nouns and an adverb like &quot;swiftly&quot; to describe verbs, but German uses the word &quot;schnell&quot; for both.

In some other languages, there is no distinct category of adjectives as opposed to verbs; the meanings expressed by adjectives in English, Greek and so forth are expressed by ''stative'' intransitive verbs. Esperanto allows modifier root words to be inflected as adjectives, adverbs or stative verbs as the speaker thinks suitable:

 Li kuras rapid'''e''' &quot;He runs quick''ly''&quot;     (adverb)
 Li estas rapid'''a''' &quot;He is ''quick''&quot;         (adjective)
 Li rapid'''as'''      &quot;He quick''s'' (hurries)&quot; (stative verb)

This web site is a ''wiki'' - any user can change any page, and when you click &quot;Save page&quot;, everyone sees the same changed page that you do. Thus, if you delete from pages, other users like myself have to revert those changes before they can read the page.

If you are still confused about how it works, feel free to play around in the '''[[Wikibooks:Sandbox]]'''. Thanks, --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:22, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

I have been following this recipe and hoping for good results!  It appears someone has gone to a lot of effort to put this recipe together with nice photos and everything.  I have a suggestion to make, that the yeild could be shown at the top of the recipe near where the ingredients are listed.  (The # of pies the recipe is for).  The ingredients seem to make 1 pie, but the photos are for making a double batch.  It is unclear until one gets the ingredients chopped up how many pies we're making. 
Thanks

== this pie is not vegan ==

This recipe in mis-filed
The BUTTER in the crust disqualifies this as Vegan

Any proven suggestions ?( vegetable shortning or coconut oil )
:Butter is dairy so I will make the change &lt;u&gt;''but''&lt;/u&gt; it is '''still''' vegetarian.  [[User:Ebe123|Ebe123]] ([[User talk:Ebe123|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ebe123|contribs]]) 22:59, 23 June 2011 (UTC)</text>

: I would have thought that by demonstrating what an icon looks like, it assist to demonstrate (and therefore educate) the reader on the context of certain things.  The dashboard (for example) isn't normally accessed by its name, and it more likely seen as an icon on the dock.  New users may wonder what that icon is.  In this instance, I see that its use on this project *is* educational. [[User:Neolux|Neolux]] 06:33, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SORTING THROUGH YOUR GOODS AND ORGANIZING THEM OR DISPOSING OF UNWANTED THINGS ==

Most people are packrats to some degree. Nearly everyone's home has old junk in it that should no longer be there. Of course, what is categorized, as old junk is entirely subjective to your personal opinion. Only you know what you still want or need. So you should try to decide before move day just what all you want to be transported to the new residence and what all you want to dispose of. Arrangements should be made well in advance for disposal of unwanted things. Agencies such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army can help with this but be aware that when they arrive to collect things from you they may turn down some things that you are counting on them to remove. So be sure to have alternative arrangements for disposal in place such as community garbage pickup service or dumps.


== PACKING AND BLANKET WRAPPING ==

Then, once disposables have been identified, all goods that are being kept and that can be boxed should be properly and carefully boxed up and labeled. Goods that cannot be boxed such as furniture should be blanket wrapped if possible to protect them. Normally, moving blankets can be obtained from truck rental facilities in advance for pre-move wrapping of non-vital furniture. Blanket wrapping is very important for furniture protection and is not easy to do. The rest of your things will have to be moved unprotected, so just be very careful with them and try to carry some of the smaller things in your car. Small appliances such as toasters, mix masters, radios, toaster ovens, blenders, George Foreman type grills, etc. should all be carefully packed into boxes and moved as fragiles because they can be quite costly to replace. Remember, you're out to save money and each thing that you can fully preserve from damages during the move saves you repair or replacement money.

== TRUCK RENTAL ==

Rent a big enough truck to move your whole load in one trip unless you are moving very nearby in which case a smaller truck with multiple trips will be fine. Carefully inspect the truck for existing body damages and note them on your rental contract. Make sure the truck body is clean inside and if you have a lift gate – thoroughly test it. Study and learn good truck driving techniques and how to safely get in and out of the truck cab and the side or back of the truck. Be aware of bad weather truck driving considerations too. Always keep a big distance interval between your truck and other traffic. Make wide swings around corners so as not to have cut off accidents and watch your height restrictions on overpasses and viaducts.


== MOVING HIGH VALUE ITEMS SUCH AS CURRENCY / COIN / STAMP COLLECTIONS, HIGH VALUE ARTWORK, EXPENSIVE SMALL STATUARY, ETC. ==

Do all of this kind of moving very carefully by yourself. If anything gets broken or disappears for some reason you only want yourself to blame. Don't trust anybody else with these kinds of light, valuable items because if anything goes wrong with them, it will become a nightmare for you. Breakage or loss of these kinds of valuables can lead to accusations, outbursts of anger, loss of friendship or close relationship, police involvement, law suits, etc., etc., etc.


== PROVIDING YOUR MOVING / PACKING HELPERS WITH SNACKS, MEALS, BEVERAGES AND BATHROOM FACILITIES ==

When relatives and / or friends are helping you to pack up and move your home it’s wise to make conditions for them as comfortable as possible. During working periods, just having tasty snacks and non-alcoholic drinks on hand can do that. Ordering pizzas, chicken, oriental food or other kinds of meals will also be appreciated. Remember, these folks are giving you their help and saving you the cost of employing costly packers and movers, so these relatively inexpensive, thoughtful gestures will help to make their work for you much more pleasant.

You can also let them pick their own radio stations or TV stations while they're packing your things up. Again this makes the work environment more pleasant for them. And be sure there is plenty of bathroom tissue, Kleenex and air freshening spray where it can be easily found in the bathroom so your people don't have to ask embarrassingly for it.

Never bring forth alcoholic beverages for your helpers until the day's work is completed. Alcohol makes people get prematurely tired and lazy so save it until everything to be done that day is actually finished. Then maybe go ahead and relax and unwind with a couple of drinks with them but don't let anyone who's driving get legally drunk. Any DUI's issued that evening would be a terrible downer for the recipient, for you and for any of your folks who helped out.

== DISASSEMBLE BEDS AND DESKS, SAVING ALL HARDWARE ==

== REMOVE MIRRORS FROM DRESSERS OR WALLS ==

== REMOVE AIR CONDITIONERS FROM WINDOWS ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to learn how to relocate household goods properly, a number of factors need to be considered in order for you to avoid painful and costly personal injuries and / or expensive damages to your furniture so that you can move as economically as possible.

THE PRIMARY MOVING DAY CONSIDERATIONS ARE....

In Correct Order of Priority –

# [[Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Movers safety when moving]] 
# [[Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Safety of the article being moved and the surfaces involved]] 
# [[Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Minimizing moving time spent on each moving task]] 
# [[Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Meeting moving time deadlines]]
# [[Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Minimizing Your Aggravation]]	
# [[Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Minimizing Moving Costs]] 


Minimizing moving costs should be your very last consideration, even though it's your first objective. 

If you keep all of the above-mentioned considerations about moving yourself in the above given proper order as you do your move, you will find that you automatically end up nicely saving all of the money you're hoping to save!

You do not want to have any of the above mentioned considerations out of this order at any time or you will make faulty decisions that could increase your moving costs, cause you a lot of aggravation and significantly increase the time you spend on your move. Take a few moments to think about each of these 6 categories and their priority of consideration.

For instance, if you rush the moving task you will in effect be putting the (1.) Safety of the movers and (2.) Safety of the article being moved into lower priority than (3.) Minimizing your overall time spent moving. As a direct result of that shift in priorities, furniture can be unnecessarily damaged and / or someone could be seriously injured which would bring you guilt and a lot of problems such as a costly injury and / or expensive damages to your furniture and / or to expensive floor surfaces. Besides forcing you into increased costs, you will also encounter unwanted aggravation and who knows how much extra time spent rectifying these problems. Therefore, we have given you quite a bit of information about each of these considerations for your review so that by keeping the right priorities you will make right moving day choices and accomplish all of your time and money saving goals.

First and foremost, it is wise for all of your movers to know safe moving techniques in order to avoid personal injuries. These are the worst kinds of problems to encounter on moving day. You certainly don't want to see anyone get hurt helping you and it can get quite costly at a hospital to treat some emergency injuries. 

Second, you obviously don't want valuable furnishings damaged so you will need to learn how to properly pack and / or snuggly blanket wrap as many of your household goods as possible in order to protect them.

You will need to learn floor, wall, door and ceiling protection in order to avoid costly and aggravating real estate property damages.

Additionally, you need to learn correct trucking procedures in order to avoid truck accidents, occupant injuries and / or furniture damage on the truck

Shortcutting any of these tasks could cause you to have some very painful and / or costly personal injury and / or property damage expenses that could and should have been easily avoided. The old axiom - better safe than sorry - is certainly true when you're moving!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Proper and complete Packing is one of the most important things that you can do to save time, money, and aggravation on moving day! Packing as many of your household goods as possible protects them and makes them easy to carry and transport. If you are not fully packed when your moving crew arrives then they have to take time out from the moving task to help you finish your packing. If the packing is already done on moving day it will be much less aggravating for you and everyone concerned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Complete Packing will Expedite your Move on Moving Day. ==

Proper Packing is one of the most important things that you can do to save time, money, and aggravation! If you are not fully packed on moving day then your moving crew will have to take time out from the moving to help you finish your packing and your moving day will go on and on and on…. 

Basically, use common sense when packing. Pack heavier things like books and canned goods in smaller boxes, and pack lighter things in progressively larger boxes. Never make a box heavier than the lady of the house can handle, since she may be the one who ends up moving it around before or after the move.

Go to [[/Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Packing Tips/|Packing Tips]] for a complete write-up on what to do (with some how to do) instruction on proper packing.
==Prepare a Moving Checklist==

Prepare a moving checklist as soon as you know that you are going to move in order to minimize the time you'll need to spend on the whole moving task. Once you've made your checklist be sure to follow it but be prepared to make corrections as reality forces adjustments to your plans. It should include a timetable for packing, premoving and moving day activities along with a list of….

In its current state, no links point to the [[coq au vin]] page, so no one will find it.

Are you trying to start a new book, or are you writing a recipe for the [[Cookbook]]? Cookbook recipes are supposed to have page names prefixed with &quot;Cookbook:&quot;. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:49, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

== Adding contents to the Cookbook ==

Again, I will repeat what was said earlier:  If you want to add a new recepie to the Cookbook, please title it with the '''Cookbook:''' prefix.  This is the only way it can be included with the other recepies.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:41, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Module and linear space ==
An additive group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a ''module'' over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, or ''R-module'' for short, if the ''scalars'', the members of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, satisfy the following properties: if &lt;math&gt;x, y \in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt;
* (i) Both &lt;math&gt;\alpha x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x + y&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;
* (ii) &lt;math&gt;(\alpha \beta) x = \alpha (\beta x)&lt;/math&gt; (associativity)
* (iii) &lt;math&gt;\alpha (x + y) = \alpha x + \alpha y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\alpha + \beta) x = \alpha x + \beta x&lt;/math&gt; (distribution law)
* (iv) &lt;math&gt;1_R x = x&lt;/math&gt;

By definition, every abelian group itself is a module over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;x + x + x + ... = nx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar. Finally, a ''linear space'' is a module over a field. Defining the notion of dimension is a bit tricky. However, we can safely say a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt;-vector space is ''finite-dimensional'' if it has a finite basis; that is, we can find linear independent vectors &lt;math&gt;e_1, e_2, ..., e_n&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V} = \{ a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + ... + a_n e_n; a_j \in \mathcal{F} \}&lt;/math&gt;. Such a basis need not be unique.

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite-dimensional &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt;-vector space. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}^*&lt;/math&gt; has the same dimension as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; does; that is, every basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; has the same cardinality as every basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}^*&lt;/math&gt; does.''

It can be shown that the map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{V}^*&lt;/math&gt; cannot be defined constructively.[http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/meta.doubledual.html] (TODO: need to detail this matter)

'''1 Theorem''' ''If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is a TVS and every finite subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is closed, it then follows that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is a Hausdorff space.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x \ne y&lt;/math&gt; be given. Moreover, let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be the complement of the singleton &lt;math&gt;\{y\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is open by hypothesis. Since the function &lt;math&gt;f(z) = x + z&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(0) = x&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, we can find an &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; open and such that &lt;math&gt;\{x\} + \omega \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Here, we used, and would do so henceforward, the notation &lt;math&gt;A + B = &lt;/math&gt; the union of &lt;math&gt;\{ x + y \}&lt;/math&gt; taken ''all'' over &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \in B&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, since the function &lt;math&gt;g(x) = -x&lt;/math&gt; is continuous and so is its inverse, namely &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, we may assume that &lt;math&gt;\omega = -\omega&lt;/math&gt; by replacing &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; by the intersection of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\omega&lt;/math&gt;. By repeating the same construction for each &lt;math&gt;x + z&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;z \in \omega&lt;/math&gt;, we find &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\{x\} + \omega + \omega \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. It then follows that &lt;math&gt;\{x\} + \omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{y\} + \omega&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint. Indeed, if we write &lt;math&gt;x + z = y + w&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;z, w \in \omega&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;y = x + z - w \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

== Normed spaces ==

A vector space is said to be ''normed'' if it is a metric space and its metric &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; has the form:
:&lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \|x - y\|&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the function &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt;, called a ''norm'', has the property (in addition to that it induces the metric) that &lt;math&gt;\| \lambda x \| = |\lambda| \| x \|&lt;/math&gt; for any scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. We note that:
:&lt;math&gt;\|x+y\| = d(x, -y) \le d(x, 0) + d(0, -y) = \|x\| + \|y\|&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;d(x+z, y+z) = \|x - y\| = d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt;.

It may go without saying but a vector space is ''infinite-dimensional'' if it is not finite-dimensional.

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; be normed spaces. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is an infinite-dimensional and if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero, there exists a linear operator &lt;math&gt;f:\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; that is not continuous.&lt;br /&gt;

== Baire's theorem ==

A normed space is said to be ''complete'' when every Cauchy sequence in it converges in it.

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of a Banach space &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; carrying the same norm. Then the following are equivalent:''
:''(a) &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is complete.''
:''(b) &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is closed in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.''
:''(c) &lt;math&gt;\sum \|x_k\| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\sum x_k&lt;/math&gt;.''
Proof: (i) Show (a) &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; (b). If &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is complete, then every Cauchy sequence in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; has the limit in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;; thus, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is closed, then every Cauchy sequence converges in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is complete. Hence, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is complete. (ii) Show (a) &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; (c). Let &lt;math&gt;x_j \in G&lt;/math&gt; be a Cauchy sequence. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\left \| \sum_0^n x_k - \sum_0^m x_k \right \| = \left \| \sum_m^n x_k \right \| \le \sum_m^n \| x_k \| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n, m \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, &lt;math&gt;\sum x_k&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy, and converges in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; since the completeness. Conversely, since a Cauchy sequence is convergent, we can find its subsequence &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\| x_{k+1} - x_k \| &lt; 2^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\sum \| x_{k+1} - x_k \| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
If the summation condition holds, then it follows that &lt;math&gt;\sum x_{k + 1} - x_k&lt;/math&gt; converges in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; converges in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as well. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Corollary''' ''&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is incomplete but dense in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is not closed in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; has empty interior, &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{Q}} = \overline{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

We say a set has ''dense complement'' if its closure has empty interior.

The next is the theorem whose importance is not what it says literally but that of consequences. Though the theorem can be proved more generally for a pseudometric space; e.g., F-space, this classical formulation suffices for the remainder of the book.

'''3 Theorem''' ''A complete normed space &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; which is nonempty is never the union of a sequence of subsets of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with dense complement.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;E_n \subset G&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of subsets of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with dense complement. Since &lt;math&gt;\overline{E_1}&lt;/math&gt; has empty interior and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has nonempty interior, there exists an nonempty open ball &lt;math&gt;S_1 \subset (G \backslash \overline{E_1})&lt;/math&gt; with the radius &lt;math&gt;\le 2^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\overline{E^2}&lt;/math&gt; has empty interior and &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; has empty interior, again there exists an nonempty open ball &lt;math&gt;S_2 \subset (S_1 \backslash \overline{E_1})&lt;/math&gt; with the radius &lt;math&gt;\le 2^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;. Iterating the construction ''ad infinitum'' we get the decreasing sequence &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Now let &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; be the sequence of the centers of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy since: for some &lt;math&gt;N \le n, m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\|x_n - x_m\| &lt; 2^{-N} + 2^{-N} \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;N \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
It then follows &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges in &lt;math&gt;G \backslash \bigcup^{\infty} E_n&lt;/math&gt; from the compleness of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Corollary (open mapping theorem)''' ''If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are Banach spaces, then a continuous linear surjection &lt;math&gt;f: A \to B&lt;/math&gt; maps an open set in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to an open set in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Left as an exercise.

The following gives an nice example of the consequences of Baire's theorem.

'''3 Corollary (Lipschitz continuity)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; = the set of functions &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{C}^0 ([0, 1])&lt;/math&gt; such that there exists some &lt;math&gt;x \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;|u(x + h) - u(x)| \le n |h|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x + h \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;.
''Then (i) &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^0 ([0, 1])&lt;/math&gt; is complete, (ii) &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is closed and has dense complement, and (iii) there exists a &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{C}^0 ([0, 1])&lt;/math&gt; that is not in any &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., one that is differentiable nowhere.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: (i) &lt;math&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; is complete; thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^0&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach space by some early theorem. (ii) Let &lt;math&gt;u_j \in S_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence, and suppose &lt;math&gt;u_j \to u&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|u(x + h) - u(x)|&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le |u(x+h) - u_j(x+h)| + |u_j(x + h) - u_j(x)| + |u_j(x) - u(x)|&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\to n|h|&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;j \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Thus, &lt;math&gt;u \in S_n&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Stone-Weierstrass theorem says that every continuous function can be uniformly approximated by some infinitely differentiable function; thus, we find a &lt;math&gt;g \in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}([0, 1])&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\| u - g \|&lt;/math&gt;.
If we let &lt;math&gt;v = g + {\epsilon \over 2} \sin Nx&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;v \in \mathcal{C}^0 ([0, 1]) \backslash S_n&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; has dense complement. Finally, (iii) follows from Baire's theorem since (i) and (ii). &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

More concisely, the theorem says that not every continuity is Lipschitz because of Baire's theorem.

'''3 Lemma''' ''In a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the following are equivalent:''
* ''(i) Every countable union of closed sets with empty interior has empty interior.''
* ''(ii) Every countable intersection of open dense sets is dense.''
Proof: The lemma holds since an open set is dense if and only if its complement has empty interior. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

When the above equivalent conditions are true, we say &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a ''Baire space''.

'''3 Theorem''' If a Banach space &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has a ''Schauder basis'', a unique sequence of scalars such that
:&lt;math&gt;\| x - \sum_1^n \alpha_k x_k \| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;,
then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is separable.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:

The validity of the converse had been known as a ''Basis Problem'' for long time. It was, however, proven to be false in 19-something by someone.

== Duality ==

The kernel of a linear operator &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\ker(f)&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all zero divisors for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. A kernel of a linear operator is a linear space since &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0 implies that f(\alpha x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0 = f(y)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;0 = f(x + y)&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, a linear operator has zero kernel if and only it is injective.

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a linear functional. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;\ker(f)&lt;/math&gt; is closed.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, then &lt;math&gt;\ker(f) = f^{-1} \mid_{\{0\}}&lt;/math&gt; is closed since a finite set is closed. Conversely, suppose &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous. Then there exists a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_j \to x&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{j \to \infty} f(x_j) - f(x) = \lim_{j \to \infty} f(x_j - x) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, &lt;math&gt;\ker(f)&lt;/math&gt; is not closed. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Theorem''' ''If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a linear functional on &lt;math&gt;l^p&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, x_3, ...) = \sum_1^{\infty} x_k y_k&lt;/math&gt;''
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;y_k = f(\delta(1, k), \delta(2, k), \delta(3, k), ...)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta(j, k) = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;j = k&lt;/math&gt; else &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The ''dual'' of a linear space &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;G^*&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all of linear operators from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., either &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;). Every dual of a linear space becomes again a linear space over the same field as the original one since the set of linear spaces forms an additive group.

'''Theorem''' ''Let G be a normed linear space. Then''
:''&lt;math&gt;\|x\| = \sup_{\|y\| = 1} |&lt;x, y&gt;|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|y\| = \sup_{\|x\| = 1} |&lt;x, y&gt;|&lt;/math&gt;''.

The duality between a Banach space and its dual gives rise to.

Example: For &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; finite, the dual of &lt;math&gt;l^p&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;l^q&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;1/p + 1/q = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''3 Theorem (Krein-Milman)''' ''The unit ball of the dual of a real normed linear space has an extreme point.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: (TODO: to be written)

The theorem is equivalent to the AC. [http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Axiom%20of%20Choice%20and%20Zorn.pdf]

== The Hahn-Banach theorem ==

== Hilbert spaces ==

A linear space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''pre-Hilbert space'' if for each ordered pair of &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique complex number called ''an inner product of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and denoted by &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle_\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following properties:
* (i) &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle_\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is fixed.
* (ii) &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle_\mathcal{X} = \overline {\langle y, x \rangle_\mathcal{X}}&lt;/math&gt; (where the bar means the complex conjugation).
* (iii) &lt;math&gt;\langle x, x \rangle \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; with equality only when &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

When only one pre-Hilbert space is being considered we usually omit the subscript &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;.

We define &lt;math&gt;\| x \| = \langle x, x \rangle^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; and indeed this is a norm. Indeed, it is clear that &lt;math&gt;\| \alpha x \| = | \alpha | \| x \|&lt;/math&gt; and (iii) is the reason that &lt;math&gt;\| x \| = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the triangular inequality follows from the next lemma.

'''3 Lemma (Schwarz's inequality)''' ''&lt;math&gt;|\langle x, y \rangle| \le \|x\|\|y\|&lt;/math&gt; where the equality holds if and only if we can write &lt;math&gt;x = \lambda y&lt;/math&gt; for some scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.''

If we assume the lemma, then since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(\alpha) \le | \alpha |&lt;/math&gt; for any complex number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; it follows:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\| x + y \|^2&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \| x \|^2 + 2 \operatorname{Re} \langle x, y \rangle + \| y \|^2&lt;/math&gt;

|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\le (\| x \| + \| y \|)^2&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Proof of Lemma: The lemma is just a special case of the next theorem:

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a pre-Hilbert and &lt;math&gt;S \subset \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; be an orthonormal set (i.e., for &lt;math&gt;u, v \in E&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\langle u, v \rangle = 1&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;u = v&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\langle u, v \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero.)''
* ''(i) &lt;math&gt;\sum_{u \in S} \langle x, u \rangle \le |x|&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;.''

Proof: (TODO)

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence in a pre-Hilbert space with &lt;math&gt;\|u_j\| = 1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \sum_{j \ne k} | \langle u_j, u_k \rangle |^2 &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;(1 - \Gamma) \sum_{j=m}^n | \alpha_j |^2 \le \| \sum_{j=m}^n \alpha_j u_j \|^2 \le (1 + \Gamma) \sum_{j=m}^n | \alpha_j |^2&lt;/math&gt; for any sequence &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j&lt;/math&gt; of scalars.
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be a set of all pairs &lt;math&gt;(i, j)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;m \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m \le j \le n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i \ne j&lt;/math&gt;. By Hölder's inequality we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{(j, k) \in I} | \langle \alpha_j u_j, \alpha_k u_k \rangle | \le \sum_{j=m}^n | \alpha_j |^2 \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.
Since
:&lt;math&gt;\| \sum_{j=1}^\infty \alpha_j u_j \|^2 \le \sum_{j=m}^n |\alpha_j|^2 + \sum_{(j,k) \in I} | \langle \alpha_j u_j, \alpha_k u_k \rangle |&lt;/math&gt;,
we get the second inequality. Moreover, 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=m}^n | \alpha_j |^2 \le \sum_{j=m}^n \langle \alpha_j u_j, \alpha_j u_j \rangle  + \sum_{(j, k) \in I} \langle \alpha_j u_j, \alpha_k u_k \rangle + | \langle \alpha_j u_j, \alpha_k u_k \rangle |&lt;/math&gt;
and this gives the first inequality. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Theorem (Bessel's inequality)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; be an orthonormal subset of a pre-Hilbert space. Then for each &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the space,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{u \in U} |\langle x, u \rangle|^2 \le \|x\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum can be obtained over some countable subset of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and the equality holds if and only if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is maximal; i.e., &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is contained in no other orthogonal sets. &lt;br /&gt;
Proof: First suppose &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is finite; i.e., &lt;math&gt;U = \{ u_1, u_2, ... u_n \}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j = \langle x, u_j \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Since for each &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle x - \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j u_j, u_k \rangle = \langle x, u_k \rangle - \alpha_k \langle u_k, u_k \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;, by the preceding theorem or by direct computation,
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|x\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\ge \| \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j u_j \|^2 = \sum_{j=1}^n |\alpha_j|^2&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is maximal. Let &lt;math&gt;y = \sum_{j=1}^n \langle x, u_j \rangle u_j&lt;/math&gt;. Then by the same reasoning above, &lt;math&gt;x - y&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to every &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt;. But since the assumed maximality &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;. Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n |\langle x, u_j \rangle|^2 = \| \sum_{j=1}^n |\langle x, u_j \rangle u_j |^2 = \|y\|^2 = \|x\|^2&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, suppose that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is not maximal. Then there exists some nonzero &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\langle x, u \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;u \in U&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n | \langle x, u_j \rangle |^2 = 0 &lt; \|x\|^2&lt;/math&gt;.
The general case follows from the application of Egorov's theorem. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Corollary''' ''In view of Zorn's Lemma, it can be shown that a set satisfying the condition in (ii) exists.'' (TODO: need elaboration)

'''3 Lemma''' ''The function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is continuous each time &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is fixed.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: If &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, from Schwarz's inequality it follows:
:&lt;math&gt;| f(z) - f(x) | =  | \langle z - x, y \rangle | \le \| z - x \| \| y \| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;z \to x&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Given a linear subspace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;, we define: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^\bot = \{ y \in \mathcal{H}; \langle x, y \rangle = 0, x \in \mathcal{M} \}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt; is the intersection of the kernels of the continuous functionals &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \langle x, y&lt;/math&gt;, which are closed; hence, &lt;math&gt;M^\bot&lt;/math&gt; is closed. (TODO: we can also show that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^\bot = \overline{\mathcal{M}}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;)

'''3 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a linear subspace of a pre-Hilbert space. Then  &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\| z \| = \inf \{ \| z + w \| ; w \in \mathcal{M}\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The Schwarz inequality says the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;| \langle z, z + w \rangle | \le \|z\| \|z + w \|&lt;/math&gt;
is actually equality if and only if &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z + w&lt;/math&gt; are linear dependent. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Theorem (Riesz)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a pre-Hilbert space and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be its subspace. The following are equivalent:''

Proof: If &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{M}} = \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;z \in \overline{\mathcal{M}} \cap \mathcal{M}^\bot = {0}&lt;/math&gt;. (Note: completeness was not needed.) Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt; is not dense, then it can be shown (TODO: using completeness) that there is &lt;math&gt;y \in \overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\|x - y\| = \inf \{ \|x - w\|; w \in \mathcal{M} \}&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, &lt;math&gt;0 \ne x - y \in \overline{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;. In sum, (i) implies (ii). To show (iii), we may suppose that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not identically zero, and in view of (ii), there exists a &lt;math&gt;z \in \ker(f)^\bot&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\|z\| = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f(xf(z) - f(x)z) = 0&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \langle xf(z) - f(x)z, z \rangle = \langle x, \overline f(z) z \rangle - f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
The uniqueness holds since &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle = \langle x, y_2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;y = y_2&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, (iii) implies reflexivility which implies (i). &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A complete pre-Hilbert space is called a ''Hilbert space''.

* ''(ii) then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^{\bot\bot} = \bar \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.''
Proof: (i) Let &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; be given. Define &lt;math&gt;f(w) = \langle w, x \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;w \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous and linear on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a Hilbert space, there is &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(w) = \langle w, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;\langle w, x - y \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;w \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;; that is, &lt;math&gt;x - y \in \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;. The uniqueness holds since if &lt;math&gt;y_2 \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x - y_2 \in \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(w) = \langle x, y_2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and the representation is unique. (ii) If &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, then since &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^{\bot \bot}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \subset \mathcal{M}^{\bot\bot}&lt;/math&gt; and taking closure on both sides we get: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{M}} \subset \overline {M^{\bot\bot}} \subset M^{\bot\bot}&lt;/math&gt;.
Also, if &lt;math&gt;x \in \overline{M}^{\bot\bot}&lt;/math&gt;, then we write: &lt;math&gt;x = y + z&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y \in \overline{M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z \in \overline{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|z\|^2 = \langle x - y, z \rangle = \langle x, z \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x = y \in \overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \subset \overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{M}} \subset \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^{\bot\bot} \subset \overline{\mathcal{M}}^{\bot\bot}&lt;/math&gt;, the corollary follows. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus)''' ''The following are equivalent.''
* (i) The derivative of &lt;math&gt;\int_a^x f(t) dt&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* (ii) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely continuous.
Proof: Suppose (ii). Since we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\inf_{x \le t \le y} f(t) \le (x-y)^{-1} \int_x^y f(t) \le \sup_{x \le t \le y} f(t)&lt;/math&gt;,

== Differentiation ==

''Differentiation'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is to take the limit of the quotient by letting &lt;math&gt;h \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;{f(x + h) - f(x) \over h}&lt;/math&gt;.
When the limit of the quotient indeed exists, we say &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
The derivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\dot f&lt;/math&gt;, is defined by &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; = the limit of the quotient at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

'''3.8. Theorem''' ''The power series:''
:&lt;math&gt;u = \sum_0^{\infty} a_j z^j&lt;/math&gt;
''is analytic inside the radius of convergence.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The normal convergence of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; implies the theorem.

To show that every analytic function can be represented by a power series, we will, though not necessarily, wait for Cauchy's integral formula.

We define the norm in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, thereby inducing topology;
:&lt;math&gt;\| x \| = \| \sum_1^n x_j^2 \|^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The topology in this way is often called a ''natural topology'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, since so to speak we don't artificially induce a topology by defining &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

'''3. Theorem (Euler's formula)'''
:&lt;math&gt;z = |z|e^{i \theta} = |z|(cos \theta + sin \theta)&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof:

'''3. Theorem (Cauchy-Riemann equations)''' ''Suppose &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{C}^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;. We have:
:''&lt;math&gt;{\partial u \over \partial \bar z} = 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;{\partial u \over \partial x} - {1 \over i} {\partial u \over \partial y} = 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:

'''3. Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;u, v&lt;/math&gt; are non-constant and analytic in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Re }u = \mbox{Re }v&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;u = v&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;g = u - v&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;0 = \mbox{Re }g = g + \bar g&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Im }g = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and hence g = 0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

This furnishes examples of functions that are not analytic. For example, &lt;math&gt;u(x + iy) = x + iy&lt;/math&gt; is analytic everywhere and that means &lt;math&gt;v(x + iy) = x + icy&lt;/math&gt; cannot be analytic unless &lt;math&gt;c = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

A operator &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ''bounded'' if there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;C &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\| f(x) \| \le C \| x \|&lt;/math&gt;.

'''3.1 Theorem''' Given a bounded operator &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, if

then &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \beta = \gamma&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Since &lt;math&gt;\beta \le \gamma&lt;/math&gt; can be verified (FIXME) and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is inf,
:&lt;math&gt;\|f(x)\| = \left\|f\left({x \over \|x\|}\right)\right\| \|x\| \le \alpha \|x\| \le \beta \|x\| \le \gamma \|x\|&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \le \beta \le \gamma&lt;/math&gt;.
But if &lt;math&gt;\alpha \|x\| &lt; \gamma \|x\|&lt;/math&gt; in the above, then this is absurd since &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is sup; hence the theorem is proven.

We denote by &lt;math&gt;\| f \|&lt;/math&gt; either of the above values, and call it the ''norm'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;

'''3.2 Corollary''' ''A operator &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded if and only if is continuous.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, then we find &lt;math&gt;\| f \|&lt;/math&gt; and since the identity: for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\| f(x + h) - f(x) \| \le \| f \| \| h \|&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous everywhere. Conversely, every continuous operator maps a open ball centered at 0 of radius 1 to some bounded set; thus, we find the norm of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\| f \|&lt;/math&gt;, and the theorem follows after the preceding theorem. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Proof: F has a basis of n elements.

'''Theorem''' ''If H is complete, then &lt;math&gt;H^n = \{ \sum_1^n x_j e_j : x_j \in E \}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a cartesian space of E) is complete&lt;br /&gt;''

:&lt;math&gt;|z_n - z_m| = \left| \sum_1^n (z|e_j)e_j - \sum_1^m (z|e_j)e_j \right| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n, m \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
Since orthogonality, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;|(x_n - x_m) e_1 + (y_n - y_m) e_2| = |x_n - x_m| + |y_n - y_m|&lt;/math&gt;,
and both &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt; are also Cauchy sequences. Since completeness, the respective limits &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;; thus, the limit &lt;math&gt;z = x e_1 + y e_2&lt;/math&gt; is in E_2. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem shows in particular that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb {R}, \mathbb {R^n}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{C^n}&lt;/math&gt; are complete.

'''3. Theorem (Hamel basis)''' ''The Axiom of Choice implies that every linear space has a basis''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: We may suppose the space is infinite-dimensional, otherwise the theorem holds trivially.

FIXEME: Adopt [http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/%7Ekf262/COBOR/L5.pdf]. '''3. Theorem (Fixed Point Theorem)''' ''Suppose a function f maps a closed subset &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of a Banach space to itself, and further suppose that there exists some &lt;math&gt;c &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\|f(x) - f(y)\| \le c \| x - y \|&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a unique fixed point.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence: &lt;math&gt;x, f(x), f(f(x)), f(f(f(x))), ... &lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x \in F&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\| s_{n + 1} - s_n \| = \| f(s_n) - f(s_{n - 1}) \| \le c \| s_n - s_{n - 1} \|&lt;/math&gt;.
By induction it follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\| s_{n + 1} - s_n \| = c^n \| s_1 - s_0 \|&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence since:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\| s_{n+1} + ... s_{n+k} - s_n \| \le \sum_0^k \|s_{n + j}\| \le \| s_1 - s_0 \| c^n \sum_0^k c^j&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;= \| s_1 - s_0 \| c^n(c - 1)^{-1}(1 - c^{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;.
|}
That &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is closed puts the limit of &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the uniqueness follows since if &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(y) = y&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\|f(x) - f(y)\| = \|x - y\| \le c \| x - y \|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;1 \le c&lt;/math&gt;unless &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. Corollary (mean value inequality)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable. Then there exists some &lt;math&gt;z = (1 - t)x + ty&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;t \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\|f(x) - f(y)\| \le \| f' (z) \| \| x - y \|&lt;/math&gt;''
where the equality holds if &lt;math&gt;n = m = 1&lt;/math&gt; (mean value theorem).&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:

'''Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f: E \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;E \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and is open. If &lt;math&gt;D_1 f, D_2 f, ... D_n f&lt;/math&gt; are bounded in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt; be given. Using the assumption, we find a constant &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; so that:
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_E | D_i f | &lt; M&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i = 1, 2, ... n&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;\delta = \epsilon (nM)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;|h| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x + h \in E&lt;/math&gt;. Let
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_k(t) = f \left( x + \sum_1^k(h \cdot e_j)e_j + t(h \cdot e_{k+1})e_{k+1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.
Then by the mean value theorem, we have: for some &lt;math&gt;c \in (0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;,
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;| \phi_k(1) - \phi_k(0) |&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= |h| \left| D_k f(x + \sum_1^k (h \cdot e_j)e_j + c(h \cdot e_{k+1})e_{k+1}) \right|&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;&lt; |h| M&lt;/math&gt;.
|}
It thus follows: since &lt;math&gt;\phi_k(0) = \phi_{k-1}(1)&lt;/math&gt;,
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;| f(x+h) - f(x) |&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= |\phi_n(1) - \phi_1(0) | = \left| \sum_1^n \phi_k(1) - \phi_k(0) \right|&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;&lt; |h| nM &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem (differentiation rules)'''' ''Given &lt;math&gt;f, g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; differentiable,''
* ''(a) (Chain Rule) &lt;math&gt;D(g \circ f) = (D(g) \circ f)D(f)&lt;/math&gt;''.
* ''(b) (Product Rule) &lt;math&gt;D(fg) = D(f)g + fD(g)&lt;/math&gt;''.
* ''(b) (Quotient Rule) &lt;math&gt;D(f / g) = g^{-2} (D(f)g - fD(g))&lt;/math&gt;''.
Proof: (b) and (c) follows after we apply (a) to them with &lt;math&gt;log&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h(x) = x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and the implicit function theorem. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem (Cauchy-Riemann equations)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u:\Omega \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable if and only if &lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial x}u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial y}u&lt;/math&gt; are continuous on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial z} u = 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable. Let &lt;math&gt;z \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = \mbox{Re}z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = \mbox{Im}z&lt;/math&gt;.
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;u'(z)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \lim_{h \in \mathbb{R} \to 0} {u(x+h, y) - u(x,y) \over h} = {\partial \over \partial x}u(z)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \lim_{h \in \mathbb{R} \to 0} {u(x, y+h) - u(x,y) \over ih} = {1 \over i} {\partial \over \partial y}u(z)&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Since &lt;math&gt;x = {z + \overline{z} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = {z - \bar z \over 2i}&lt;/math&gt;, the Chain Rule gives:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial \bar z} u&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \left( {\partial x \over \partial \bar z} {\partial \over \partial x} + {\partial y \over \partial \bar z} {\partial \over \partial y} \right) u&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;={1 \over 2} \left( {\partial \over \partial x} - {1 \over i} {\partial \over \partial y} \right) u&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=0&lt;/math&gt;.
|}
Conversely, let &lt;math&gt;z \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. It suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;u'(z) = {\partial \over \partial x} u(z)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given and &lt;math&gt;x = \Re z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = \Im z&lt;/math&gt;. Since the continuity of the partial derivatives and that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is open, we can find a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; so that: &lt;math&gt;B(\delta, z)  \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;s \in B(\delta, z)&lt;/math&gt; it holds:
:&lt;math&gt;\left| {\partial \over \partial x}(u(s) - u(z)) \right| &lt; \epsilon / 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| {\partial \over \partial y}(u(s) - u(z)) \right| &lt; \epsilon / 2&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;h \in B(\delta, 0)&lt;/math&gt; be given and &lt;math&gt;h_1= \Re h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_2 = \Im h&lt;/math&gt;. Using the mean value theorem we have: for some &lt;math&gt;s_1, s_2 \in B(\delta, z)&lt;/math&gt;,
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;u(x+h_1, y+h_2) - u(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= u(x+h_1, y+h_2) - u(x, y+h_2) + u(x, y+h_2) - u(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= h_1 {\partial \over \partial x} u(s1) + h_2 {\partial \over \partial y} u(s2)&lt;/math&gt;
|}
where &lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial y} u = i {\partial \over \partial x} u&lt;/math&gt; by assumption. Finally it now follows:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\left| {u(z + h) - u(z) \over h} - {\partial \over \partial x} u(z) \right|&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \left| {h_1 \over h} \right| \left| {\partial \over \partial x} (u(s_1) - u(z)) \right| + \left| {h_2 \over h} \right| \left| {\partial \over \partial x} (u(s_2) - u(z)) \right|&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;&lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;
|}

'''3 Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{A}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; and suppose &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is connected. Then the following are equivalent:''
* ''(a) &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is constant.''
* ''(b) &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Re}u&lt;/math&gt; is constant.''
* ''(c) &lt;math&gt;|u|&lt;/math&gt; is constant.''
Proof: That (a) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (b) is obvious. Suppose (b). Since we have some constant &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; so that for all &lt;math&gt;z \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;|e^u| = |e^{\Re u} e^{i \Im u}| = |e^{\Re u}| = e^M&lt;/math&gt;,
clearly it holds that &lt;math&gt;|u| = |\log e^u| = M&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, (b) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (c). Suppose (c). Then &lt;math&gt;M^2 = |u|^2 = u \overline{u}&lt;/math&gt;.
Differentiating both sides we get:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = {\partial \over \partial z} u\overline{u} = u {\partial \over \partial z} \overline{u} + \overline{u} {\partial \over \partial z} u&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{A}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial z} \overline{u} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{u} {\partial \over \partial z}u = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;\overline{u} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;u = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial z}u = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is constant since &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is connected. Thus, (c) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (a). &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

We say a function has the ''open mapping property'' if it maps open sets to open sets. The ''maximum principle'' states that equivalently
* if a function has a local maximum, then the function is constant.

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;u: \Omega \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. The following are equivalent:''
* ''(a) &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is harmonic.''
* ''(b) &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; has the mean value property.''

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;u: \Omega \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; has the open mapping property, then the maximum principle holds.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{A}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is open and connected. Let &lt;math&gt;\omega = \{ z \in \Omega : |u(z)| = \sup_\Omega |u| \}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; has a local maximum, then &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty. Also, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is closed in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\Omega = u^{-1}({\omega})&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a \in \omega&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is open, we can find a &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; so that: &lt;math&gt;B = B(r, a) \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;u(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is open by the open mapping property, we can find a &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;B(\epsilon, u(a)) \subset u(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;. This is to say that &lt;math&gt;u(a) &lt; \epsilon + u(z)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;z \subset B(r, a)&lt;/math&gt;. This is absurd since &lt;math&gt;a \in \omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u(z) \le u(a)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;u = \sup_\Omega |u|&lt;/math&gt; identically on &lt;math&gt;B(r, a)&lt;/math&gt; and it thus holds that &lt;math&gt;B(r, a) \subset \omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is open in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is connected, &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \omega&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;u = \sup_\Omega |u|&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Talogintza Bilbon.jpg|right|thumb|Making ''talo'' (Basque corn tortilla)]]
[[Cookbook:Tortilla|Tortillas]] are a type of [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] popular in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[:Category:Central American recipes|Central America]], commonly made from [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|wheat flour]] or [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|masa]]. This recipe is for the masa (corn) variety; see [[Cookbook:Flour Tortilla|Flour Tortilla]] for the wheat flour version.

There is also an unrelated dish, [[Cookbook:Spanish Omelet|Spanish Tortilla]], which is a type of [[Cookbook:Omelette|omelette]].

== Ingredients ==
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|masa]] (masa harina, masa lista)
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==
[[Image:Balboa 20 bg 120603.jpg|right|thumb|Making tortilla in San Diego]]
# In a large bowl, stir together the masa and salt.
# Add the water, and mix together well.
# Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead for 5 minutes.
# Divide the dough into 1/4 cup (3 oz / 90g) portions and form them into balls.
# Roll each ball into a flat round about 6 inches (10cm) in diameter and 1/8 inches (0.25cm) thick.
# Heat a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. 
# Place the tortillas one at a time into the dry hot skillet; cook until brown on one side, then turn and brown the other side.
# Remove from the skillet and keep warm in cloth towel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey, I'm Shadowsong, I recently joined Wikipedia because I like the idea of an open-source encyclopedia and I got tired of my posts being signed with a bunch of numbers. I probably won't be doing a huge amount of editing since my knowledge in most areas isn't advanced enough to really help out with articles. Most of my contributions will be in the RuneScape series as I've been playing the game for several months now and I know quite a bit about it. I also like to go around correcting spelling errors because they annoy me. 

My other interests include reading and tae kwon do. My all-time favourite book is His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman. I also try to read Dutch books ocassionally since that's my native language and I'm trying to reteach myself spelling. I've been living in America for a couple of years and the English influence is starting to show. Other than that my life basically consists of going to school and doing homework, I'm in 10th grade right now and school is getting to be very time-consuming.</text>

:&lt;big&gt;''Alphabet and pronunciation''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;p&gt;
__NOTOC__

The Icelandic alphabet consists of 32 letters. There are also 3 letters used for foreign words, and 1 obsolete letter. Icelandic uses the latin alphabet, which is the same as the English alphabet and most Western European languages. There are some letters that are not found in English, and even some letters that only Icelandic uses.&lt;p&gt;

Letters which are not part of the Icelandic alphabet, but are used in foreign words are:

The final letter, '''Z''', is no longer used in Icelandic. The only place you might find this letter is in historic names of structures, organisations, and the like, such as '''Verzló''' (a school in Reykjavík), or in the Icelandic newspaper, ''Morgunblaðið''.

|}

&lt;big&gt;'''Notes:'''&lt;/big&gt;

* '''Ð''' and '''Þ''' are pronounced similarly. Also, Icelandic words never begin with \Ð, and no words end with Þ.
* '''I''' and '''Y''' share the same pronunciation, as do '''Í''' and '''Ý''' also.
* '''HV''' is pronounced as '''KV'''.
* Double '''LL''' is pronounced something like ''tl'', with a flattened tongue and a click.
* In Icelandic, the '''R''' is trilled, though not as much as Spanish or Italian. It is &lt;u&gt;never&lt;/u&gt; pronounced like a French ''r'' or a Scottish ''loch''.
* '''U''' is said like the English ''u'' except with rounded lips
* There are no guttural sounds in Icelandic
* There are no silent letters in Icelandic. There are a few exceptions in spoken language where a letter might produce a different sound than usual. Otherwise, Icelandic is a very phonetic language
* When there are double letters in a sentence, there is a slight glottal stop with a breath of air. Try saying the word, ''bottle'' but like ''baht-tle''
* If a '''K''' is followed by a t, then the sound changes and becomes a soft k, virtually the same as a spanish j/g, gente (e.g. lukt - lantern)
* Likewise, a '''P''' followed by a t changes into an f sound (e.g. Að skipta - to shift)
* '''F''' in the middle of a word is often pronounced as a v (e.g. Að skafa - to shave)
* '''F''' followed by an l will change to a b-sound (afl is pronounced as abl
* If you are not able to type in Icelandic letters, you can substitute '''Ð''' with '''D''', '''Þ''' with '''TH''', '''Æ''' with ''AE'', and '''Á, É, Í, Ó, Ö, Ú, Ý''' with ''A, E, I, O, U, Y''

== Diphthongs ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 95%&quot;
!'''Diphthong'''||'''Sound'''
|-
|&lt;center&gt; au &lt;/center&gt; ||&lt;center&gt; Pronounced as '''öi''' &lt;/center&gt;
|-
|&lt;center&gt; ei, ey &lt;/center&gt; ||&lt;center&gt; like the ''ay'' in st'''ay''' &lt;/center&gt;
|-
|}

== Stress ==
Stress in Icelandic &lt;u&gt;always&lt;/u&gt; falls on the first syllable. The only exception is in the word &quot;halló,&quot; which usually has stress on the second syllable.

== Dialects of Icelandic ==
One may read in some books and websites that there are no significant Icelandic dialects – this is true as all dialects have assimilated into the standard spoken language. However, people from Reykjavík tend to speak a little differently from people from Akureyri, Egilstaðir, Ísafjörður and other countryside towns and villages. For example, the word for ''hot dog'' in Icelandic is '''pylsa'''; in Akureyri, they would say ''pil-sah'' but in Reykjavík you often will hear '''pulsa'''. Another example is the word for ''to want'', '''langar''': in Ísafjörður (the northwestern part of Iceland), you often will hear ''lahng-ar'' but in Reykjavík you will hear ''lángar''.

== How to go on ==

Considering the big amount of work and the little amount of time we had, our course made a quiet good effort. I want to encourage anybody who wants to, to contribute to the exisiting frame. Here are some suggestions:

== ToDo ==

# References not only at the bottom, but also in the text (&quot;As we can see in the text of Zwaan (1)...&quot;)
# Correct the referencing section
# Finding better suitable pictures
# If there are publications with good graphics, kindly ask the publisher to license it under a free license.
# Extend anything of which you have a good knowledge
# As we are not native speaker, it is likely *cough* that there are problems with the language. ;) 
# If you are a student, spread the word about this project and especially this book :)
# Create a PDF-Version

== Please pay attention to ==

# Good referencing. This is serious scientific content!
# Structure. 

== A little note ==

Guys, I just want to say: this is great!! Reaally appreciate!!&lt;br&gt;

== Perceptual systems ==

Why is there nothing on perceptual systems? They are most often considered a part of cognitive neuroscience. -- Heida Maria

== Something is repeated ==
Some parts of this books are repeated at two different places in this book. I have to look into this later. --[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 21:20, 18 March 2013 (UTC)</text>

The '''Editorial Board''' is a project that helps to proofread, edit, and revise books, so that they can become higher-quality resources. Any book can be nominated for review by an editorial board, although [[wikibooks:Featured books|featured books]], and [[Wikibooks:Good books|generally good books]] are given priority.

== Goals ==

Volunteer members of this project will:
*Find and mark books that are &quot;good&quot;
*Proofread good books, edit, revise, and generally improve those books.

The project should use the guideline [[Wikibooks:Editorial board guidelines]].

== Nominations ==

Books that are in need of review from an editorial board can be listed below.

== Resources ==

*[[Wikibooks:Editorial board guidelines]]
*[[meta:Help:Displaying a formula]]
*[[Help:Contents]]
*[[Wikibooks:Volunteer editors]]

== Members ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Turn this into a proposal ==

There is some talk about turning this page from a wikiproject into a policy proposal. Implicit in this talk is the idea of making the editorial board more then simply a casual group project into a standing entity with some &quot;authority&quot; over specific matters here on wikibooks. An editorial board constructed in this matter would either be:
#A local analog of the wikipedia Arbcom, or
#A local counterpoint of our own local Arbcom (which is also in a proposal stage).
The second option would open up the idea of decentralized authority, which many people might agree with. Barring the details, should this be a policy proposal or a wikiproject? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:10, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:I'm all for making it a policy proposal. We can have an elected group of several talented book-writers who are well-versed with book production and are also experts in one or more fields. We won't have full coverage of all subjects possibly, but I think such a group of perhaps five or seven individuals will form a very nice board. This way we can keep behavior issues separate from book production, a thing that could certainly slow down progress here. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:31, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:: I'm not really sure what is intended here, what does the editorial board have to do with arbcom? I think that it might be a better idea to keep it as a wikiproject so that it doesn't ''encourage'' people to go to arbcom with editorial disputes. I think instead the editorial board should probably be more involved with books in which the editors are ''not'' directly involved so that a more NPOV decision on what's a good book can be reached, and more appropriate decisions can be made. Of course, the actual authors of the book would have a say on why a book could deserve to be recognized and what should be improved, just the &quot;authority&quot; on whether something qualifies as a good book should be left to a more neutral party IMO. If this became part of the policy, of course, I would probably support it. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 22:43, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:::The idea is that content disputes (disputes between one or more editors concerning the content of a page) is not the same as a behavior dispute (although there is plenty of potential for one to turn into the other). I think it would be a bad idea to make the arbcom, which is essentially a disciplinary committee, handle content disputes as well.  We would invoke the editorial board to handle disputes that did concern the authors of the book: if those authors are stalemated by a content dispute, we need to have a &quot;higher authority&quot; on matters of content to turn to. Beyond this &quot;official duty&quot; of the editorial board, there would also be a number of unofficial duties, such as reviewing, editing, and publishing good wikibooks. An editorial board would likely be kept small, and be able to call upon &quot;experts&quot; in various fields to help answer questions on particular subjects. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

== Changes, Moving forward ==

I have made a few small changes to the text of this proposal, some of which are relatively small. In particular, in response to some criticism, I have removed mention of the editorial board being able to resolve disputes. The task of content dispute resolution will be left to [[Wikibooks:Decision making]], and [[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution]], and this board will not be an official part of that process. That said, however, I have added text that the board can lend guidance to wikibookians if asked, which means that the board could potentially be asked to act as a mediator in a content dispute. I leave it up to the discretion of the board as to whether or not to participate in such activities. 

I really want to move forward on this issue, even if the current text of this policy is not satisfactory. I do want to have some kind of editorial-board-ish entity here, and I do want to work towards editing and eventually publishing (depending on a local definition of &quot;publish&quot;) some of our better books. Changes to this proposal are fine, but in the interest of progress, I would ask that all criticisms be constructive. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:07, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

: The new text about guidance seems more appropriate to me. I like your most recent change as far as having a centralized point of contact because, indeed, though there are many contributors to the project anyone who would be interested in using our books for classes and such, and they'd need someone to contact for more information (the staff lounge seems to be the place where this kind of thing occurs at the moment). '''Question''': Would you want this to be a liaison to publishing companies too? Though I guess this could be considered a part of the &quot;etc&quot;, but IMO this would a different ball of wax than a liaison to consumers because with publishers you have to make sure they follow the GFDL, which is fundamentally different from traditional publishing methods, and this could require the assistance of a lawyer and the courts and all of that if they decide they want to try and break the law and claim exclusive rights or something...  maybe not a direct issue for the editorial board but probably is one for the publishing board, unless the books are to be published independently or something. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 01:58, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

::My vision basically includes printed versions, and versions of our books on CD being distributed to schools and libraries. I don't think we should follow the traditional &quot;publication&quot; model, where books get an ISBN number, and are sold for profit. Our books are already freely available from our website, So i dont think we need to worry about getting our books to appear on Google Books, or Amazon, or anything like that. We can call PDFs of our book the &quot;finished product&quot;, and then distribute those books directly to consumers electronically. Once the teachers/libraries had our books in PDF form, they could print them for the students, or distribute them in some other manner. As to the legal issues, I want to get the WMF involved in this process. Jimbo has expressed some interest and support in the past, and that's something that I think we need to exploit. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:09, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

::: Sounds good to me, the PDFs are available here but we could distribute them on CD for convenience and such, and I agree with your wish to get WMF involved, they have more legal weight than a couple of volunteers (I know they usually are the ones that want to know about major copyright stuff). And the money we make from the CDs would simply be used to help keep the project running, kind of like a fundraiser. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 02:32, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

:::: I'm not particularly interested in making any money off our books, and I think that making any kind of profit off our books would probably just create more legal problems. Of course, we can work on these details later. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:10, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

::::: Ah, but what if an individual author (say, he is the primary author of an excellent book) wants to make profit? I would say, he can go and publish it on his own, with the &quot;wikibooks&quot; version being edited by the board. He can request it to be taken off and we should be kind enough to comply. I doubt it has to be written down, but I think it would be optimal for the members of the board to keep something like that in mind. (it seems like common sense to me) --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:11, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
:::::: I dont think that's an issue. Any person can sell a GFDL textbook for profit, whether or not they are the author of the book. There are no restrictions on the ability to profit from GFDL texts, although since they are freely available here, it is unlikely that anybody is going to pay much for them. Since all text contributions here have been expressly released to Wikibooks for use under the GFDL, a request from an author to remove those materials from our site isn't binding and cannot be enforced. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:32, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Resolving editing disputes==

An '''edit war''' occurs when text is reverted repeatedly to a previous form or when repeated changes or minor additions are made that amount to a repeated reversion of text. If reversions occur more than three times any contributor or an administrator may create a '''disputed edit''' page, containing the disputed text, and revert the original text to the form that was present before the dispute arose. The live page may not be changed whilst the dispute is in progress. The '''disputed edit''' page may not be referenced on any of the pages of the 'live' book although it may be referenced in Talk/Discussion pages. The edit dispute must be resolved on the '''disputed edit''' page before integration back into the book. Resolution will have occurred if all parties agree, or failing this, and after a cooling off period of two weeks, if a majority of parties including a neutral administrator agree. PDF Files may not be created whilst a book has a '''disputed edit''' page and will be deleted if produced.

If an edit war is resolved the original contributors may not restart the same dispute. Contributors who do so may be suspended or banned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page should be a documentation of the internals of the actual GC implementation, the interface, restrictions ...

==Introduction==

The actual Implementation has following characteristics:
* conservative (vs. precise and internal pointers)
* stop-the-world (vs. incremental vs. concurrent)
* mark and sweep (vs. copying)
* non-moving (vs. moving)

see also [[wikipedia:Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29|Garbage collection]]

==File structure==
;std.thread:Support the GC with the actual position of the stackpointer.
;/internal/gc/gc.d: the GC interface, a wrapper around the implementation.
;/internal/gc/gcx.d: the GC implementation
;/internal/gc/gcstub.d: stub for the gc, to prevent linking into application


==Threads==
To stop the world, the gc calls Thread.pauseAll(). The stop mechanism on Linux works with the Signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. In case of pausing the Thread, the signal handler stores the current stack pointer in stackTop, so this pointer is always uptodate.

==How does it works==
The GC is only called when memory should be allocated and currently none is available. If the gc is not able to free enough memory, new memory is requested from the system.

Entry point is gcx.d fullCollect()

#mark phase
##scan stacks of all threads
##scan roots (global variables)
##scan ranges (non gc managed memory which can also contain references to gc-objects)
#finalize all collected objects
#sweep the unused memory

==Further information==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why use RTAI for real-time applications? ==

Real-time application need 

* efficient executing code
* deterministic behaviour

Actually development for real-time applications is mainly made in embedded systems in the language C.

More and more is done in C++ and on PC plattforms. With D there is an alternative to C++.
But there are non-deterministic features in D (like in C++ also)

* dynamic memory allocation
* dynamic casts
* garbage collection
* exception handling

In a real-time environment not all has to be deterministic. So it is in the hand of the developer not to use these features in the real-time task.

      <text xml:space="preserve">With kernel 2.6 all information about devices is hold in the /sys directory. 
You can find your device under /sys/bus/pci/devices/.
Each PCI device directory is named with the a combination of &quot;bus:slot.function&quot;. In the device directory you find files named:
;vendor: Vendor-ID is a unique number for each vendor. It is assign from the pci-sig and requires a membership.
;device: Device-ID is a vendor unique number, chosen by the vendor.
;irq: the assigned IRQ [[w:IRQ Handling in RTAI|IRQ Handling in RTAI]]
;resources: The memory images of the device with their flags
;resource0: A virtual file for the config space of the device
;resource1-5: Virtual files with the memory images.

== Format of .../resource ==
A file can look like this:
 0x00000000feafe000 0x00000000feafefff 0x0000000000000200
 0x00000000feaf0000 0x00000000feaf7fff 0x0000000000000200
 0x00000000feafd000 0x00000000feafdfff 0x0000000000000200
 0x00000000feafc000 0x00000000feafcfff 0x0000000000000200
 0x00000000feac0000 0x00000000feadffff 0x0000000000000200
 0x00000000fea40000 0x00000000fea7ffff 0x0000000000000200
 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000

The lines, are the images 0..6, 0 is config space, 1-5 are device dependent, 6 is an optional ROM.
The first column is the start addresses of the images, the second column contains the end address (inclusive). The third column contains the flags for the image. The constants for the flags can be found in &lt;tt&gt;/usr/src/linux/include/linux/ioport.h&lt;/tt&gt;. 

;IORESOURCE_IO: The image can only be access via IO-ports (outb, inb,.. macros)
;IORESOURCE_MEM: The image is accessible via normal memory access
;IORESOURCE_IRQ: ???
;IORESOURCE_DMA: ???
;IORESOURCE_PREFETCH: access to the image can be cached (no side effects)
;IORESOURCE_READONLY: the memory is read only
;IORESOURCE_CACHEABLE: memory writes can be cached
;IORESOURCE_RANGELENGTH: ???
;IORESOURCE_SHADOWABLE: ???
;IORESOURCE_BUS_HAS_VGA: ???
;IORESOURCE_DISABLED: ???
;IORESOURCE_UNSET: ???
;IORESOURCE_AUTO: ???
;IORESOURCE_BUSY: Driver has marked this resource busy


== mmap an image ==
The image file .../resource1-5 are ready to use. So you have only to do the two steps, open and mmap:
 uint aLength = 4096
 uint mFileDescriptor = open( &quot;/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:02:09.0/resource2&quot;, O_RDWR );
 uint* ptr = cast(uint*) mmap(
        null,
        aLength,
        PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
        MAP_SHARED,
        mFileDescriptor,
        0);
 // If ptr == -1, than the user was probably not root
 assert( cast(uint)ptr != uint.max );
 uint[] mMemory = ptr[0 .. aLength/4];

If you are done, don't forget to close the resources:
 munmap( mMemory.ptr, mMemory.length );
 close( mFileDescriptor );

      <text xml:space="preserve">RTAI has user space interrupts called RTAI USI. 

== Let Linux assign a IRQ number for you PCI device==
But before one can use them, the hardware interrupt has to be mapped to interrupt in Linux. Therefore it is necessary to build a kernel module for the pci device, that registers the interrupt. With this action, the device gets a new interrupt number, which can be used in the usi. 

== Writing an interrupt handler==
Create a realtime thread:

In the thread make a loop, looking like that:
 public void run(){
   const int irqNum = 5;
   rt_request_irq_task( irqNum, null, RT_IRQ_TASK, 1 );
   rt_startup_irq( irqNum );
   rt_enable_irq( irqNum );
   while( true ){
     int overrun = rt_irq_wait( irqNum );
     if( overrun == RT_IRQ_TASK_ERR )
       break;
     // if program should quit, break here
     // Do the irq handling
     rt_ack_irq();
   }
   rt_release_irq_task( irqNum );
 }

      <text xml:space="preserve">To make the task timing with [[../|RTAI]] you have two possibilities 
*periodic timer mode
*oneshot timer mode
You can read about this in [http://www.rtai.org/documentation/magma/html/api/sched_overview.html An overview of RTAI schedulers]. To show the differences:
;periodic mode: The 8254 chip is used. It runs with a fixed frequency of 1193180 Hz. If you want to make a cyclic event for 1 kHz, it can set the timer period to 100 µs. In the cyclic task always call an rt_sleep_until() with the next time. The result is 1 kHz task with jitter of 100 µs.
;oneshot mode: The internal clock goes with the cpu clock. For each timer event, [[../|RTAI]] has to reprogram the timer for the next event. This is an overhead, but has the advantage of highest time resolution.

To make a cyclic task with LXRT, first create a new thread as usual.
 threadHandle = rt_thread_create( &amp;threadFunc )

then implement the thread like this 
 void threadFunc()
   {
     RT_TASK *handler;
     handler = rt_task_init( 0, 0, 0, 0);
     if (handler==null){
       // error handling
     }    
     rt_allow_nonroot_hrt();
     mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE);
     
     //rt_set_periodic_mode();
     rt_set_oneshot_mode();
     
     RTIME period = nano2count( 1_000_000_000l );
     start_rt_timer(period);
     
     rt_make_hard_real_time();
     RTIME currentTime = rt_get_time_ns();
     while( stopCondition )
     {
       currentTime += period;
       rt_sleep_until( currentTime );
       
       // the work to do ...
     }
     
     stop_rt_timer();
     rt_make_soft_real_time();
     rt_task_delete(handler);
   }
With such setup, you can achieve jitter lessen than 10 µs.

===Comment===
Is there a similar policy at English Wikipedia? How does it work? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:33, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

:Wikipedia contains numerous topical articles from the status of a particular pop group to the affairs of the British deputy prime minister; an edit dispute policy that takes disputes to one side, out of the public eye, would not be acceptable in such an environment. 

:At Wikipedia there is a 3 reversions rule where no more than 3 reversions may be made but this is often ignored and just makes the argument into a slanging match on the talk page eventually resulting in appeals to arbitration committees etc. It also allows editors to wait until a few changes have been made and then sneak their interpretation into an article. An editable version of the disputed page, out of the eye of readers, would be a way of focussing on the problem of achieving a workable text rather than concentrating on any perceived idiocies of opponents. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:16, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

::I've made some proposed alterations to the policy text, inserted below beneath a header. Originally I just put everything in the active voice, so the policy was clearer ''to me'', but then I began seeing things which I thought we should try to work out.  Existing PDF files should be allowed to stay, especially if the book was already in complete form, for example.  
::Even as I've written it, though, I can see other difficulties.  What happens when an edit war spills out of one page or chapter into the whole book?    Do we need further clarification of the difference between ''vandalism'' and an ''edit war''?  Do the authors and editors of a completed book have any right to keep their book's particular take on a subject more or less even? (For example, if someone decides the [[Ancient History]] textbook needs more alien invasions and cites Zechariah Stitchin in the bibliography, do those changes stay over the objections of ancient historians? Why shouldn't the new contributors be asked to go out and produce their own book, [[Aliens in the Ancient World]]? [[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 16:01, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

=====Resolving Editing Disputes=====

::An '''edit war''' occurs when a user or a small group of users &lt;s&gt;(3 or fewer)&lt;/s&gt; repeatedly revert text to a previous form, or when such a user or group make a series of minor changes or additions that amount to a repeated reversion of text. Edit wars are not [[Vandalism]]; they are differences of opinion regarding the substance of a given book.  Ideallly, edit wars should be resolved with research and references to primary sources, not bickering and personal attacks.

::If a user or group perform reversions more than three times, any contributor or an administrator may remove the text from the main page, and move it to a '''disputed edit''' page which contains both versions of the disputed text. The main page should be reverted to original text present before the dispute began. The live page may not be changed while the dispute is in progress.

::A banner and single link to the '''disputed edit''' page may be placed on the &lt;s&gt;main page&lt;/s&gt; section of the book where the dispute has occurred. Otherwise it may not be referenced on any of the pages of the 'live' book although it may be referenced in Talk/Discussion pages. Interested users -- readers and contributors -- must resolve '''disputed edit''' page before integration back into the book. &lt;s&gt;Resolution will have occurred if all parties agree; or failing this, and after a cooling-off period of two weeks, if a 2/3 majority of involved parties (defined as all users involved in the debate, ''plus'' active users who contributed to the book but were not involved in the ''disputed edit'' debate), plus one neutral administrator agree; the goal should be to have a large number of project participants happy with the results of the editorial procedure, so that they remain productive and participating users.&lt;/s&gt;

::Users may not attach PDF files to a book while a book has a '''disputed edit''' page. They should be deleted when attached, though existing PDF file versions of the book may remain.

::&lt;S&gt;Once an edit war is resolved, the user or group may not restart the same dispute.  However,&lt;/s&gt;In the interest of NPOV, a user or group of users should be encouraged to develop their own book projects on the same subject, so that would-be readers can make use of everyone's expertise, and have multiple resources for their own efforts.

:::Possible solutions to edit wars can include but are not limited to: 
:::* Contrasting paragraphs in which roughly equal POVs are given roughly equal space;
:::* Contrasting paragraphs in which a distinctly minority viewpoint receives some but not equal space;
:::* Research by both parties, and substantial links to high-quality primary and secondary sources; or
:::* a new Wikibook project in which either new or old contributors develop a parallel but distinct text with different editorial assumptions.

::As always, good faith on the part of all users until proven otherwise is assumed. &lt;s&gt;Readers and contributors alike&lt;/s&gt; All contributors should seek to present high-quality products on Wikibooks. &lt;s&gt;Contributors who continue an edit war after resolution are formally warned, then suspended for two weeks, and finally banned.&lt;/s&gt;

::&lt;S&gt;Once resolved the dispute may not be re-opened by any editor without the agreement of a majority of editors, or in the case of a tied vote, the agreement of a majority of editors and a neutral administrator. Disputes that have been resolved may only be re-opened through editor's communicating on Talk Pages, not through pre-emptive changes of text in the book.&lt;/s&gt;

::&lt;s&gt;Editors who do not adhere to these rules will be warned and, if warnings are ignored, banned.&lt;/s&gt;

-------

:::That makes no sense. How do we re-open a dispute and get agreement from other editors, unless we raise the topic again? we have to mention the dispute, and argue the point if we want to get a majority of editors to agree with us. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:53, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

::::The editors would contact each other on the Talk Page or the editor's Personal Talk Pages and debate the idea of re-opening the dispute - perhaps this would help them to resolve it without the need to re-open it.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:58, 5 June 2006 (UTC) - I have added a line to the text above to include this. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 19:02, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:::: I crossed out some more sections of my policy edit to remove some bureaucracy, and I don't much like what I see, even though I wrote some of it.  I think we do need some sort of way of resolving editorial disputes within books, that allows them to work towards a higher vision — but books also need to be completed, and shutting down a whole book or section for days or weeks while uncompromising editors on both sides wrangle...  well, that's not what I'm here to do.  [[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 19:38, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

===Yes, this should be an enforced policy===

1. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:59, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt;I agree with this for now, but the policy needs to be cleaned up. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:42, 28 April 2006 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
:This policy needs far too much work right now for me to cast my vote towards it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:05, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
2. The content could be more robust and informative, but the basics are there. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 02:02, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

3. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 10:07, 3 May 2006 (UTC). One question, who has the authority to ban users who revisit a dispute

4. Good enough. [[User:German Men92|Je suis]] 16:34, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

===No, this policy should be rejected===

1. I appreciate the good intentions, but this is far too prescriptive. Generally speaking, the more red tape, the more it is exploited by those who troll and act in bad faith. WP has seen this happen time and time again. In my view, if a disruptive user adds something entirely unhelpful - such as a number of whole paragraphs into a GCSE Chemistry textbook that is unconnected with the GCSE syllabus - it should be deleted and if the user persists in re-adding it, despite having pointed out to them why it is being deleted, that disruptive user should be blocked. Under this policy, the good faith contributor seeking to remove the paragraphs will fail - they will be the first to do 3 reverts, they will be the one having to set up an alternative version of the page, and the disruptive editor will have succeeded in preventing a PDF version of the page being created. If the dispute does get resolved the right way, and a later disruptive editor (perhaps a sockpuppet of the previous one) re-adds the disputed material, the original editor would end up being suspended or banned if they tried to stop it - or, indeed, even mentioned it, as that would rekindle the old dispute. In short, this proposal prevents admins from dealing with trolls the way they should be dealt with (ie being quickly chucked off the site), and instead requires good users to give equal (or more weight if we add in the sockpuppets) to those who seek to disrupt, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:54, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

::Which admin would do the blocking and on what authority? Would an admin be able to judge on a technical issue? 

::It seems to me that your main objection to the policy is the way that it could lead to an unfair ban. You mentioned the problem of a sock puppet re-instating an erroneous change to trigger a ban of another editor - clearly the policy needs to address this. The 3 revert victory for the non-good faith contributor would not occur because the book is reverted back to before the edit dispute (ie: before this contributor objected).

::The principle idea of the policy is to get serious edit disputes out of the mainstream of Wikibooks. Taking the &quot;edit war&quot; offline is the first step. This would prevent editors from ruining the book during the disagreement. There would also be no personal benefit from the argument because it would be out of the public eye. 

::What is needed is a way forward that answers your concerns about bans but still protects books against serious disputes. 

::I would suggest changing the text about banning if the dispute is reopened to:

::&quot;The dispute may not be re-opened by any editor without the agreement of a majority of editors, or in the case of a tied vote, the agreement of a majority of editors and a neutral administrator. Editors who do not adhere to these rules will be warned and, if warnings are ignored, banned.&quot;  

::(Changing the text in the book in such a way as to produce a reversion is reopening the dispute).

::This adresses your concern that a non-good faith editor might try to trap another editor. There is no '3 revert victory' because the text is re-instated to the form it had before the first objection during the phase of compromise on an &quot;disputed edit&quot; page. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:39, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

::I have integrated this change into Andrew's text above. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:48, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

2.
:::I have reconsidered this policy, and removed my '''yes''' vote from above, because I feel that this policy is too wordy, too demanding, and too preachy. We don't need to be told precisely how many reverts constitute an edit war, how long a person must be banned for such a violation, who may or may not discuss the topic, etc. A discussion should never be closed: we don't need a majority of editors to continue a discussion on which complete concensus was not reached. I feel that if an edit war or a similar dispute is raging in which page content is changing quickly and in bad faith, administrators can choose to protect the page from edits for an arbitrary &quot;cool-off&quot; time, and to redirect attention to the appropriate discussion venue. Edit conflicts are allowed to happen, and users are permitted to disagree ad infinitem: people with differing beliefs on the content of a particular page should never be banned, reprimanded, or have their content arbitrarily rolled-back to an older version simply because they care. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:00, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

::::But what about a biology text book for 15 year olds. Suppose some cult disagrees with evolution and continually reverts the text, what sort of study guide would that provide if the text were always changing? What if the admin were a member of a faith group with strong feelings on the issue? We need some sort of constitutional protection before such things happen. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 19:09, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

::::All this policy is attempting to do is '''to provide a stable text''' even if the subject matter is found to be contentious by a particular editor or small group in society. It seeks to do this by allowing full discussion and consensus building on the &quot;disputed edit&quot; page. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 19:13, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:::::I don't think stability is worth the price of attempting to script everybody's actions in the case of a dispute. If one admin is clearly biased, and uses those biases to insert controversial text into a given module, then that admin can be disciplined accordingly. What we should not do is take away the power of judgement and freewill from our admins. Even if we do have this policy in place with all it's rules and penalties, biased admins can still abuse their powers if they choose to. Adding in all sorts of thou-shalt-nots is not a good idea. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:29, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:: Are we trying to make stable texts?  No, we're trying to make free texts.  Stable texts are produced for the profit of their copyright holders and publishers.  Free texts reflect the needs of their users.  Bernard of Clairvaux in the 12th century sent a letter in which he complains, &quot;I sent you my book to read, but you have kept it and copied it and sent it to the world, and now there are so many words I cannot take back, and men have put words in my mouth that they think I should have said.&quot;  At least we have the satisfaction of a history, so that what we said, and what was added to us, is recorded.  That's about the best we can hope for here.  '''I vote No.''' [[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 19:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:::I agree with you about rigid texts. Entirely. But in the '''Editing Disputes Policy''' all we are trying to achieve is a relative stability in the special circumstances of a dispute that has got out of hand. Although you are voting &quot;No&quot; to rigidly stable texts should that &quot;No&quot; also apply to a process that allows disputing editors to move to a consensus rather than fighting an edit war on the pages of a book? I would propose to adopt what is largely your text for this special case of edit warring (see above). [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 20:42, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

* Here's the text of this proposed policy again, revised to active voice, but without my additions (which were a bad idea... for which I apologize).

::An edit war occurs when a user reverts text to a previous form repeatedly, or when a user or group of users make repeated changes or minor additions that amount to a repeated reversion of text. If they make reversions more than three times, any contributor or an administrator may create a disputed edit page, containing the disputed text, and revert the original text to the form that was present before the dispute arose. No one may edit the live page while the dispute is in progress, nor reference the dispute page on any other page of the live book, though it may be discussed on Talk/Discussion pages.  Interested parties must resolve difficulties on the disputed edit page before the text is integrated back into the book. All interested parties must find a compromise; if they cannot, after two weeks, a majority of parties plus a neutral administrator may agree on a text.   No one may attach PDF Files while a book has a disputed edit page and administrators will delete them when uploaded.
::If an edit war is resolved the original contributors may not restart the same dispute. Contributors who do so may be suspended or banned.

3. I see this policy as punitive rather than editorial.  It creates an opportunity for bad-faith contributors to manipulate policy, and it sets no guidelines for moving toward a better text: &quot;Revert a text too often and we'll smack you one&quot; vs. &quot;Find ways to integrate many visions into a text.&quot;  Some books would become filled with disputed edit pages because rival editorial groups would be more interested in bringing this ''Editing disputes'' policy into action than in finding a way to a better text.  I say '''yes to a process that mediates between dissenting and argumentative editors''', but I'm not sure that this is it.  How about a more filled-out version of, ''disputed edits should be settled through research, citation of primary sources, direct communication and frank exchanges of ideas between users, with some arbitration by a neutral administrator when necessary''? -[[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 19:42, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

4. '''Oppose''': this policy isn't a policy, more like a description. I'd suggest putting teeth into it, modeling after [[w:WP:3RR]], and using other toofs such as [[w:WP:RFC]] in order to keep it &quot;democratized&quot;. At least there should be a clear way for the admins to wiegh the merits of each side aside from personal opinion.  -- [[User:SBJohnny|SB_Johnny]] 15:07, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

5. '''rejected''': A clear Book Community policy should be created first and any reversions should be policed by its members contributors/authors that have invested time providing content to a work.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:47, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

==Comments==

:Editing disputes boil down to one of three situations:
:#Two or more editors, all here with the aim of improving Wikibooks, disagreeing over something.
:#Two or more editors, where there is at least one Wikibookian acting in good faith with the aim of improving Wikibooks, and at least one user who isn't
:#Two or more editors, all of whom are not editing here with good faith
:Situation 1 may get heated, but really is very likely to be resolved somehow. We can point out ideas to help them resolve their differences and remind people that talking about differences and aims is most likely to lead to resolution. But really, this sort of situation will be resolved.
:In situation 2, we should warn and then, if necessary, block the disruptive editor (at least until there is a commitment to behave) and let the good faith editor continue improving wikibooks uninterrupted.
:Situation 3, once identified, is relatively easy. An admin comes in and blocks everyone until they agree to behave.
:The only problem then is how to distinguish between the three situations. This calls for some judgment - and this judgment call should be based on admins' knowledge of the users, including user contribution history, how the user accesses wikibooks (if known) (eg open proxies are out), whether likely sockpuppets are involved, whether there is evidence of typical troll behaviour, whether it appears that the user is genuinely trying to help improve the wikibook or wikibooks or is only concerned with the particular area in dispute, evidence of disruptive behaviour on another Wikimedia project, and so forth. Admins, aided by comments from other users, ought to be free to use their experience and judgment on this one - trying to give hard and fast rules is, quite simply, unlikely to work, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:03, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

== Deletion of older modules ==

[[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] allows the speedy deletion of:

: ''&quot;A page that has been nominated for deletion due to a general reorganization of the Wikibook by the contributors. In this situation, please note the location of the relevant discussion that occured regarding the page cleanup.&quot;''

Recently [[User:Nov ialiste|Nov ialiste]], the main contributor, reorganised this book and listed some modules for deletion on the front [[Novial]] page. There was some discussion at [[User talk:Kernigh#Novial book]]. Thus I proceed to delete the nominated modules. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:26, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

Thanks.[[User:Nov ialiste|Novialiste]] 13:10, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

== pdf? ==

This is an excellent Wikibook and I'd like to thank [[User:Nov ialiste|Novialiste]] for taking the time and effort to further this fascinating language. When will you be doing a pdf version? And when will you finish the translation of AIL? [[User:Delano|Delano]] 03:51, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

*The translation of AIL will proceed little by little. I didn't think of making a pdf but I will look into it. Thanks for your encouragement. [[User:Nov ialiste|Novialiste]] 17:15, 18 October 2007 (UTC)

== Novial clubs and information? ==

I know that Novial is an easier, cleaner and more international language design than Esperanto or even Ido, and I would love to see it succeed and develop a community of millions of speakers. However, it seems like the Novial community is vanishingly small. Nov_ialiste, are you around? What other Novial resources can you point me to?

By the way, I would like to comment that this book is too brief for its own good, and it is written in a fairly confusing way. The book seems abbreviated excessively,

* Using phrases like &quot;D F R&quot; instead &quot;German/French/Russian&quot; or at least standard language codes like DE/FR/RU
* Failing to quote words or otherwise separate them from the sentences that discuss them, e.g. &lt;&lt;Besono is from F besoin, not from besogne&gt;&gt; instead of &lt;&lt;'Besono' is from FR 'besoin', not from 'besogne'&gt;&gt;.
* Failing to provide translations for many/most Novial phrases: &lt;&lt;Note especially the plural forms in -es: me have six fratres, du fratros e quar fratras; men patres es in London, my parents are in London.&gt;&gt;
* Showing equivalence by mere juxtaposition, &lt;&lt;Onkles uncles and aunts, onklos uncles, onklas aunts. Here Italian, which has zio uncle, zia aunt, says zii for uncles and aunts&gt;&gt; instead of, say, &lt;&lt;Onkles = uncles/aunts, onklos = uncles, onklas = aunts. Here Italian, which has 'zio' (uncle), 'zia' (aunt), says 'zii' (uncles and aunts)&gt;&gt;

Also, I can't believe Mr. Jesperson doesn't bother to introduce any of the crucial words in Novial such as 'li', 'e', 'es', 'in', etc., before using them. In addition, he seems to assume we are all familiar with multiple European languages, so he thinks there are some points he does not need to explain. Finally, his English is very complex and of an archaic style, so non-native English speakers may have difficulty with it. It seems to me this book could use a revised edition written more clearly and less compactly. ...sigh... Maybe a third translation is in order, English-to-English with simpler phrasing and some clarifying notes added. --[[User:Qwertie|Qwertie]] ([[User talk:Qwertie|talk]]) 00:39, 10 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

==Evolutionary Rather Than Revolutionary==
That's awesome man. I've lost count of the people i've seen come and go from Wikipedia because of the bizzare pseudo-anarchy/oligarchy there. Hopefully with some time off and the increasing experience i'm getting in real world politics, i'll be able to help you with your new and improved versions of my thoughts. [[User:Karmafist|Karmafist]] 03:53, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:42, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
::RobinH&amp;mdash;Sorry, I've been swamped over at Wikipedia and Life too! I'll take a peek at the policy proposals sometime this weekend. It's been a while so I don't know what good it will do!

;copied from [[User talk:Xania]]
I had trouble getting '&amp;' to behave in a link forming template and consequently need a number of pages double moved (''I'd stubbed in before I noticed the url malformation''). That is ''possibly some'' to back over the redirect where they came from initially... OR at least one like that as below. I'm still trying to juggle organizing things into 4+ sub-books (Divisions) vice 4+ volumes, so I've no list yet to hand off. 
:re: There may be the one mess I'm thinking of.'' 

* What's the'' 'going rate' ''and the ''best place'' to commission such work. I pay top-Wiki-dollars! &lt;G&gt; Seriously, is there an admins notice board, etc.

:The IRC channels can be found on [[Wikibooks:Contact_us]].  There is usually somebody in the channels but not sure how quick their responses might be.

== Re: [[User_talk:Jesdisciple#Stumbled_over_your_C.2B.2B_book_work_today|Stumbled over your C++ book work today]] ==

Thanks for the template references and luck. :) I'm having trouble deciding the order of some things in the C++ book, so if you're familiar with the language I'd appreciate your thoughts on where I left off.

I tried to teach from example code, by implementing simple projects. I wanted to only explain what showed up in the example code, and thereby avoid the unnecessary parts of the language. Unfortunately, not everything necessary ended up in the example code early enough for my liking. So I was writing a page for cleaning that situation up. I got frustrated (and changed jobs) and left it for a while, but I'll revisit it soon. --[[User:Jesdisciple|Jesdisciple]] ([[User talk:Jesdisciple|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jesdisciple|contribs]]) 12:40, 5 October 2014 (UTC)

: I can follow along and hum A FEW BARS! Been programming in one language or another since 1976, but my C++ is more student level in need of a refresher than that of a current expert. I just recently picked up a compiler since I lost my last in a HDD crash 6-7 years ago, so I have some rust to blow off.
 
: Last I did any big project coding C++ &amp; C# were the ''new fancy-schmancy'' versions of C trying to horn in on the ''ANSI Standard C'' we'd been using for our 2.5 millions of lines of code. 

: OTOH, I understand the ''cart-before-the-horse problem quite well''. Consider what I used as a solution with [[Trainz/Glossary]] and [[Trainz/references/Notations]] and see templates {{Tl|TG}} and {{Tl|TN}} respectively. Giving a link of a term to an explanation of the concept might be able to break your logjam. In my case the audience might be Mary Mom Homemaker trying to help Edger Eight years old to Ron Retired Railway worker, aged 77&amp;mdash; with his newly bought first PC so he can run this Trainz Simulator thing and stop being bored, to bone fide technical gurus. At least your audience doesn't quite have THAT kind of span! 

: I expect to be looking over your work, but the C++ learning curve and such are definitely back burner for me for the next few months. If you have a particular set of or single page etc. you want an opinion feel free to ask. I'm often on skype and you can email me as well. Use At gmail, same name. 'frank'-dot-'a'-dot- my last name on the skype. Steam VOI as well, but let's do email before getting into that user name! // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 23:38, 8 October 2014 (UTC)</text>

Hi! I registered in Wikipedia several months ago but it's now that I'm planning to contribute the expansion of the encyclopedia.Although I'm interested mainly in history and linguistics, I do revere the arts and the natural sciences, of which geography and biology are my preferred ones.


P.S.: I'd like to solicit any Hungarians that are part of the Wikipedia community to work on expanding the Hungarian language book at wikibooks. I beg you not to be pesimistic about your language and not to underestimate your culture! I'm interested in learning the language but unfortunately there are currently only two lessons:(</text>

==About me==
* My working life began with literally cleaning up excretia and other animal messes, working in my father's kennels caring for many animals boarding or hospitalized in his Animal Clinic attached to our home in Western Pennsylvania. I also assisted his large animal practice helping tasks on farm calls where he'd vaccinate, neuter, and provide other services to the farmers of three counties in Southwestern Pennsylvania, which lead to some interesting moments, like slipping and falling face down in a gooey pig pen chasing and trying to grab young piglets for treatment and ear tagging. Herding recalcitrant bovines and lassoing a reluctant horse punctuated quite a few of my early days. My father, a child of the depression was the hardest worker I've ever known, and quite a few of those experiences beside him stick in my memory as both fond and pleasant&amp;mdash;or others, ''at least as repulsive'' as that day above with its 'feces and urine saturated mud' on face and in mouth. Helping turn and deliver an fetus during the occasional breach birth in equine or bovines comes to mind for several reasons, not least being they always seemed to be between midnight and dawn when the emergency call came waking the whole household, nor the 2 am knocks on the door because someone's dog or cat was hit by an automobile. 
&amp;nbsp;
:We also kept a few livestock of our own, so I had to muck out stalls and feed large animals on schedule and I became an accomplished horseman along the way starting with ponies and later quarter-horses. In between chores, in those safe 1960's days, me and my crew ran wild riding bicycles for tens of miles to visit various attractions, not least of which were several railyards where we met the occasional true hobos of the era. That and a more spoiled only child friend of mine with a really nice Lionel train layout started a lifetime love of Railroading, as the era of mixed Steam Locomotives and Diesel-Electric came into it's final phase. The smoking Iron Horse is only a museum relic these days.
&amp;nbsp;
:Later on, as I graduated Junior High, Dad focused mostly on small animal veterinary work, we moved and he had staff tending the kennels in a new office begun some years earlier, and I took a position as a 14 y.o. drug store cashier and the next summer, began also pumping gas after spending a couple of months boarding and helping on a farm with a buddy and fellow wrestler from our neighborhood where we built some amazing muscles and put up a lot of hay bales in hay stacks, mucked more stalls,a and after a time, lent a hand in the twice daily milking regimen controlling a dairy farmers schedule&amp;mdash;all under fairly tough, no-nonsense owner-operators. The latter two positions, as well as prior experiences helping maintain the machinery of a combined miniature golf course and Golf driving range owned and operated by our family led me into more and more mechanical taskings, eventually an association with two of the main mechanics and their drag racing muscle cars where we'd change engines and transmissions completely in marathon hurried efforts, sometimes in as little as 2-3 hours in the late night crunch in order to be ready for the next days racing.
&amp;nbsp;
: Later I became a youthful mechanic for another garage recommended by the owner of the first as his station was taken by eminent domain for a highway ramp expansion which never happened. His building site is now a strip mall, but his service business lives on now under his son in a garage five miles away, but without gas pumps. By the time I was 20, my new boss wanted me to become a junior partner, for I was his chief mechanic, though too young to be certified as an inspection mechanic under Pennsylvania law until I passed the magic age of 21, and could in that day also vote. I was in college by then and limited to working just weekends for him, with a daily part time position at a garage located far nearer campus.
&amp;nbsp;
* So my adult working life began with putting myself through two years of college sometimes working 2-3 part time jobs, mainly as a Mechanic, but also including a stint as a restaurant bus boy, short order cook, then assistant manager. I worked that era also as a radio station DJ, heading up both a Classical Music show and two contemporary music shows, one a busy Saturday night caller request gig. This got me into a fascination with electronics technology, where with my heavy science concentration in High School and as a pre-Med majors track in college with a minor in Economics I found a complimentary interest, eventually earning an FCC license.
&amp;nbsp;
:One of my primary majors was in Chemistry and that open the door for me to take a position as a lab chemist assuring various vats of chemicals in an electrical box manufacturers production line were set up properly for electroplating and more importantly the company was not discharging untreated and illegal effluents in the early days of the United States Clean Water Act and the Environmental Protection Agency. Alas that position also taught me a hard lesson about discretion, for it ended suddenly when a chance lunch-wagon comment I'd made to someone who was complaining that perhaps they should see someone in the AFL-CIO about forming a union got back to the plant manager. Woops!
&amp;nbsp;
:I bounced back from that by hiring on two days later with a company that specialized in fixing water towers, so spent six weeks earning excellent pay doing work way up high which nearly killed me in one incident, while swaying side to side using a 3,000 psi paint gun repainting the outside of the water tower in question on a bosun's chair. I learned to paint, weld and sandblast during that stint and also learned to correctly (but illegally) drive a semi-tractor with which I hauled our semi-trailer from Cincinnati to South Delaware, ''because no one else could'', when our normal driver had emergency family matters to attend to, and our schedule was set up months before. I'd learned to drive at the age of 11-&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; on a jeep on the family driving range, so cranky manual transmissions like the unsynchronized tractor transmissions I'd drove on that farm were an old experience, as was double clutching to shift gears. In short, I learned young that you did what you had to do to get any and all jobs done!
&amp;nbsp;
* A year later, focusing on bringing up my grade point average and so after limiting my fourth semester jobs to less than 20 hours a week as part-time Janitor and short order cook having assumed I'd still find it easy to find work armored with youthful confidence and its characteristic ignorant assumptions of personal invincibility, I experienced a personal financial disaster/dilemma for in the summer of 1974 the economy had crashed because of the OPEC Oil Embargo of 1973-'74 causing rampant gas station waiting lines, and ''no one was hiring'' college kids, not even the one garage where my boss had urged me to become a junior partner, which would have meant dropping out of college&amp;mdash;a temptation I wrestled with for some months. He'd hired a replacement and business was down for him too.
&amp;nbsp;
:I eventually found a position as a part time toll collector on the Pennsylvania Turnpike which paid minimum wage to summer hires like myself that were no where close to the mechanics wages I'd earned in years before. I was tempted to pursue that amazingly dirty and dangerous water tower work, but wasn't ''so desperate'' to want to return there without greater need. Sufficient College tuition savings, not being a realistic goal under the circumstance, I joined the US Navy (A long lifetime love&amp;mdash;I'd been nominated and accepted into Annapolis, only to get a medical down check because of eyesight&amp;mdash;my first real life traumatic event was getting that letter!), went through boot camp and advanced electronics schools (what else!) and in the summer of 1975 joined the Submarine force where I got more schooling and also earned an associates in electronics by correspondence courses. I became really good at troubleshooting electronics, and worked then on my first computer, a secret 'large suitcase-size kludge-of-a-thing' in those days called NavSat, these days known as a GPS system and found ubiquitously in cellular telephones! I also took a correspondence course from the Newspaper Institute of America, with a design on someday writing. Alas, most of my books remain unfinished, but I did submit a few short stories here and there over the years, mainly in science fiction. I did however learn then how to program software on another far more powerful and modern system while idling away the many hours we spent 'punching holes in the ocean' patrolling for or tracking Soviet submarines and wrote two analysis programs that were adopted in the Atlantic Fleet as standard tools.
&amp;nbsp;
* Leaving the Navy where I'd advanced rapidly as possible in the enlisted ranks, I stayed in the Active Reserves for many a year, eventually being recruited into a unit which specialized in educating other reserve units because of my teaching skills, so segued from a technical expert resource pool for the Sub Base in Groton, CT to teaching up others, better maintaining the Navy's readiness state.
&amp;nbsp;
:When I'd entered civilian life again, I'd first taken a supervisors position with an IC manufacturer in Philadelphia (a mistake), then a position as a super-tech for another major IC manufacturer as the right hand man for one of their most prolific patent holders and inventors. In retrospect, voluntarily leaving that position three years later, by then working as a junior engineer and attending night school for an full engineering position, was the most regrettable mistake of my life. It took me some years over a decade to appreciate that, but the first company was acquired and eventually downsized, the other R&amp;D focused company continues to shine on Wall Street and in cutting edge electronics designs. 
&amp;nbsp;
* Subsequently, I spent the next decades working engineering positions, frequently as a test or production engineer needing a computer savvy engineer with skills in analog and digital electronics, also frequently automating manufacturing or designing and implementing computerized manufacturing testing systems, did some of the control designs for the medical laser industries and worked in a lot of military-aerospace companies, most recently on the F-22 stealth fighter. 
&amp;nbsp;
* These days I'm a self-employed Hardware/Software engineer that built two 'Personal Computers' from scratch before IBM joined the Home Computer design races and their marketing department coined the terms [[w:Personal Computer|Personal Computer and PC]]. That bit of experimental electronics and writing in assembler level code you see has paid off far more than many an university level course over my history. Later, I had one 'all software' position held as an employee in a small company for ~2.5 years where, pushing 40 years, I got to help write the more than 2.000,000 lines of [[w:Standard C|Standard C]] underlying an advanced database 4th generation language called Infinity, while concurrently taking graduate courses in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering. Infinity was sold to Data General and thence to Oracle, and disappeared as a product, but the technology lives on in fast data base accesses.
&amp;nbsp;
: Since then I've returned to my niche of being an all around engineer able to design and implement software controlled hardware needs-whether the hardware is mainly analog or digital, or a mix of the two. That has been my niche and strength, for their aren't many of us able to feel comfortable in both sides of electrical engineering and know computer architecture as well, with in my case also offer a company the bonus I have a proven body of work writing software for firmware (e.g. embedded systems) and drivers which applications use to interface with hardware.
&amp;nbsp;
* I started helping write and clean up the English Wikipedia around the middle of 2004 as an Anonymous (IP) contributor, and gradually became more and more invested in my leisure time assisting that effort, mainly back then in historical articles, another love of mine. Later I spent a period de-geeking technical articles in engineering and various sciences. Sometime in early 2005 I broke down and established a user name and normal account, and between then and now made more than 50,000 quality edits. Typically, they take quite a bit of careful editing, so I've always been ticked off by the casual way some editors use rollbacks totally disrespecting the time and thought and stress I put in making an article communicate clearly, without dismissing previous text where and whenever possible. 
&amp;nbsp;
* My normal contributions take well over half an hour per edit, and I've been known to take several painstaking days of endless edits and previewing with a longer article fix-up before saving and committing changes into the article&amp;mdash;my priority is always to communicate clearly to the less well informed, if you'll allow, dumbing down particularly introductions where the page creators assume a knowledge basis and immediately speak 'Geek'. Hence I write for those 12-16 year old kids and stay at home moms who may, like I did myself in Junior High and High School, be reading anything and everything in 'chain readings' of encyclopedia topics&amp;mdash;trying to assimilate the gist and thrust of various bodies of knowledge. (In study periods an lunch free time my youthful geek time frequently found me with stacks of 6 or more encyclopedias, cross reading with a vengeance on topics of interest.) I still read eclectically, though deteriorating eyesight makes reading today far more problematic.
&amp;nbsp;
* Here, along with helpers from the Trainz online communities, particularly Yesterdayz Trainz, I hope to put together a series of tutorials that take the edge off the massive learning curve facing a new user of the complicated Trainz operating environments, likely the most complicated software any private computer owner is or will ever possess. At the moment, I'm facing a cart-or-horse first situation&amp;mdash;how do I split the difference between the demands of free content imposed by the Wikimedia Commons copyrights policies, while being able to upload the many screenshots the largely pictorial tutorials need to be effective training pages about Trainz. I find it ironic that a Foundation styling itself as an educational institution is so backward as to not realize there is nothing unique and special about an image anyone can more or less duplicate and re-create by running the same software. If [[w:N3V Games|Auran/N3V Games]] is recalcitrant about releasing some copyrights, I may be doomed to having wasted weeks of preparation and the carefully collected images supporting my outlines will be so much trash on my hard drives. //[[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 19:50, 10 June 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Installing RTAI on Debian/Ubuntu with 2.6 Kernel ==

Download the kernel source with the Debian/Ubuntu patches. 

Try to build the kernel and boot. So you can be sure later problems are RTAI related.

Download an actual RTAI release. Patch the kernel sources with the appropriated patch from &lt;rtaidir&gt;/base/arch/i386/patches/
 cd /usr/src/linux
 patch -p1 &lt; ~/rtai/magma/base/arch/i386/patches/hal-linux-2.6.14-1.0-10.patch

In Ubuntu 6.06, there was a problem in smpboot:904 the patch failed, and has to be inserted manually.

configure the Kernel with
 make menuconfig

*No module versioning
*Active the Adeos patches (since a version between 2.12..2.15 this is no more necessary. This option is now called interrupt pipelining and is automatically enabled)
*Give the kernel an appended name like &quot;-rtai&quot;

Build the kernel
 make menuconfig
 make install modules_install

install it into grub and boot

Goto the rtaidir and 
 make menuconfig

Deselect the support for C++ in kernel, since this is not supported for 2.6 kernels.

After saving the config, do a
 make
 sudo make install

Reboot and have a look at dmesg. Now try to load the modules.
 cd /usr/realtime/modules
 sudo insmod rtai_hal.ko
 sudo insmod rtai_lxrt.ko

Recheck dmesg

== What writing system(s) does this language use? ==

The Swedish alphabet uses the 26 letters of English, and ''å'', ''ä'', and ''ö'' being categorised as separate letters, alphabetised after z. This is the alphabet, then:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Å Ä Ö

* Å is pronounced like ''aw'' in ''s'''aw''''' or like the ''o'' in ''m'''o'''re''. The accent above the A is called a ring.
* Ä is pronounced like ''ai'' in '''''ai'''r'' or like the ''a'' in ''b'''a'''re''. The accent above this A and the next O is called diaeresis.
* Ö is pronounced like the ''u'' in ''b'''u'''rn'' or like ''ea'' in ''l'''ea'''rn''.

The letters ''q'', ''w'', and ''z'' are more often seen in names and foreign words than in words that are native to Swedish.

== How many people speak this language? ==

Swedish is spoken by about 9 million (9,000,000) people.

== Where is this language spoken? ==
Swedish is spoken primarily in [[Wikijunior:Europe/Sweden|Sweden]], where it is the native language.  However, it is a minority language in [[Wikijunior:Europe/Finland|Finland]] because Finland was once part of Sweden and a part of the Finnish population speaks both Finnish and Swedish as a native language.

== What is the history of this language? ==
Around the 9th century, Old Norse began to split into Old West Norse (which was spoken in Norway and Iceland) and Old East Norse (spoken in Sweden and Denmark). In the 12th century, the dialects spoken in Denmark and Sweden began to diverge even more, becoming Old Danish and Old Swedish in the 13th century: Old Swedish developed into the Swedish spoken today.

== Who are some famous authors or poets in this language? ==

Probably the best known Swedish children's book is ''Pippi Longstocking'' (''Pippi Långstrump'' in Swedish) by Astrid Lindgren.  This book has been translated into 70 languages!  Astrid Lindgren also wrote ''Karlsson-on-the-Roof'' (''Karlsson på taket''), ''Mio, my Mio'' (''Mio, min Mio''), and many other stories for children.

Tove Jansson was from Finland, but she wrote books in Swedish. She created a series of children's books about the Moomins (''Mumintrollen''), a family of creatures called Moomin trolls. The Moomins live in their house in the Moomin valley (''Mumindalen''), though in the past their residences have included a lighthouse and a theatre.

Some authors writing for an adult audience are:
* Hjalmar Bergman (novels, short stories, and plays)
* Karin Boye (poetry and the science fiction novel ''Kallocain'', among others)
* Selma Lagerlöf (''Gösta Berlings saga'' and other novels)
* Vilhelm Moberg (''Utvandrarna'' and other novels)
* August Strindberg (novels, short stories, and plays)

=== The national anthem of Sweden ===

====In Swedish====

Du gamla, Du fria, Du fjällhöga nord&lt;br /&gt;
Du tysta, Du glädjerika sköna!&lt;br /&gt;
Jag hälsar Dig, vänaste land uppå jord,&lt;br /&gt;
Din sol, Din himmel, Dina ängder gröna.&lt;br /&gt;
    
Du tronar på minnen från fornstora dar,&lt;br /&gt;
då ärat Ditt namn flög över jorden.&lt;br /&gt;
Jag vet att Du är och förblir vad Du var.&lt;br /&gt;
Ja, jag vill leva jag vill dö i Norden.&lt;br /&gt;


====In English====

You ancient, You free, You mountainous north&lt;br /&gt;
You serene, You – full of joy and beauty!&lt;br /&gt;
I greet You, fairest land on earth,&lt;br /&gt;
Your sun, Your sky, Your green landscapes.&lt;br /&gt;

You dwell on the memories of great ancient days,&lt;br /&gt;
when, honoured, Your name flew across the earth.&lt;br /&gt;
I know that You are and will remain what You were.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== 3D vector format ====
Three-dimensional vector files can be divided into two groups in the same way as 2D file formats. Programmes for producing 3D files include AutoCAD, ArchiCAD, 3DStudioMax, Rhino etc. The main openly published standard format is VRML ( Virtual Reality Markup Language ). Another widely used format is DXF which is touted by AutoDesk (the makers of AutoCAD) as the transportable file format for 3D drawings. The DXF format, as implemented by AutoCAD is not an ideal solution as outlined in Why Isn't DXF Good Enough? by the Open Design Alliance. It is however a well supported format by many programmes and is widely used to transport files from one programme to another.

'''Recommendation'''
* Do not use vector graphics to store important information unless unavoidable.
* Keep original files on CD with copies in VRML and/or DXF format. Keep paper copies.

== What writing system(s) does this language use? ==
Finnish uses the Latin Alphabet. However, like Swedish, it has 3 extra letters. These letters are: Å/å, Ä/ä, and Ö/ö.

== How many people speak this language? ==
Six million people speak Finnish, most of whom live in [[Wikijunior:Europe/Finland|Finland]].

== Where is this language spoken? ==
Finnish is spoken mainly in Finland.  It is spoken as a minority language in [[Wikijunior:Europe/Estonia|Estonia]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Sweden|Sweden]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Norway|Norway]], and [[Wikijunior:Europe/Russia|Russia]].

== What is the history of this language? ==
Finnish is one of the Uralic languages, originating probably some where in the Volga-area in the modern Russia. It had migrated into the Baltic area as early as the stoneage, several thousand years ago. 

It is believed that the Baltic-Finnic languages evolved from a proto-Finnic language, from which Sami was separated around 1500–1000 BC.  It has been suggested that this proto-Finnic had three dialects: northern, southern, and eastern.  The Baltic-Finnic languages separated around the 1st century, but continued influencing each other.  Consequently, the Eastern Finnish dialects are mostly from Eastern proto-Finnic, while Southwestern Finnish dialects share some features with Estonian.

Written Finnish did not exist until created by Mikael Agricola, a Finnish bishop from the 16th century.  He based his orthography (writing rules) on Swedish, German, and Latin.  Later, the written form was revised by many people.  It was somewhat different from contemporary Finnish orthography as different letters (such as c, x, q, and w — nowadays much less common) were used.

The Reformation marked the real beginning of writing in Finnish. In the 16th century, major literary achievements were composed in Finnish by people like Paavali Juusten, Erik Sorolainen, and Jaakko Finno, as well as Agricola himself. In the 17th century, books produced in Finland were written in Finnish, Danish, Norwegian, Estonian, German, and Swedish. However, the most important books were still written in Latin. Finnish and Swedish were small languages of lesser importance.

The modern language was developed in the 19th century by the fennoman lingusts, mainly by Elias Lönnrot, the collector and writer of ''Kalevala'', the national epic.  He invented a lot of words in the language like fever (in Finnish: kuume).  Modern literature started to develop in the later half of the 19th century with the publishing the first novels and plays.

== What writing system(s) does this language use?==
[[Image:Latin alphabet world distribution.png|thumb|left|Where the Latin alphabet is used today]]

Latin uses what is today called the '''Latin Alphabet'''.  This alphabet is thought by many historians to have been a modified version of the ancient Greek alphabet, which in turn is also a variation of ancient Phoenician writing.

The Latin alphabet is the basis for most European languages and for many other languages around the world, which is why it may look familiar to you if you are reading this in English.

One important difference is that lowercase letters were not usually used in writing classical Latin. Another difference is that the Romans did not use our letters J, U, and W. These letters developed later, as variants of I and V. Because of this, Julius Caesar's name would have been written IVLIVS CAESAR.

== How many people speak this language? ==
Latin is considered a dead language.

The meaning of &quot;dead language&quot; is unclear in this case, but it is commonly taken to mean that  there is no one left speaking it as their mother tongue.

Although it is technically possible for people who have learned Latin to speak it, it is considered an unusual thing to do, and normally two such people will use Latin to understand each other only if they have no other language in common.

Still, Latin is sometimes needed by linguists and scientists. It is still the official language of one country: [[Wikijunior:Europe/Vatican City|the Vatican]], though the form of the language spoken there may be different from the ancient form. Some people also use Latin to translate writing on Roman or ancient artifacts. There are also ''Conventiculum''s [pl. Conventicula](conventions) where people may have Latin conversations.
   
Linguists may need to know Latin, as it is one of the roots of nearly all modern European languages. Scientists often use Latin, along with Greek, to name new species or chemicals.

== Where is this language spoken? ==
The official language of [[Wikijunior:Europe/Holy See|Vatican City]] is Latin, even though the language is considered extinct. Two thousand years ago, Latin was spoken throughout the Roman Empire, which extended at its height from Portugal to Iraq and from Britain to North Africa.  During the Middle Ages and the early modern era, Latin was the predominant language of the Roman Catholic Church and of universities in western Europe.  It still is the official language of the Roman Catholic Church.  Many Latin words and phrases are still used in the fields of law, science, and medicine. For example, ''et cetera'' comes from Latin, meaning &quot;and other things&quot;.

== What is the history of this language? ==
Latin is a member of the family of Italic languages, and its alphabet, the Latin alphabet, is based on the Old Italic alphabet, which is in turn derived from the Greek alphabet. The English alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet. Latin was first brought to the Italian peninsula in the 9th or 8th century B.C. by migrants from the north, who settled in the Latium region, specifically around the River Tiber, where the Roman civilization first developed. Latin was influenced by the Celtic dialects and the non-Indo-European Etruscan language in northern Italy, and by Greek in southern Italy. 

Although surviving Latin literature consists almost entirely of Classical Latin, a language from the 1st century B.C., this language progressed into Vulgar Latin, which significantly differed from Classical Latin in grammar, vocabulary, and eventually pronunciation. Although Latin remained the main written language of the Roman Empire, Greek came to be the language spoken by the well-educated elite, as most of the literature studied by Romans was written in Greek. In the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which became the Byzantine Empire, Greek eventually supplanted Latin as both the written and spoken language. In the western half, Latin was always the major language.

== Some famous people who spoke this language ==

*Julius Caesar — A famous military general who later went on to be the first emperor of Rome.  He wrote down accounts of all of his battles in the [[w:Gallic Wars|Gallic Wars]].
*Suetonius — A historian who is probably most famous for his biographies [[w:The Twelve Caesars|The Twelve Caesars]], the first twelve rulers of the [[w:Roman Empire|Roman Empire]].
*Virgil — A poet who wrote the [[w:Aeneid|Aeneid]], a book on the founding of the city of Rome (based partly on legend).
*Cicero — Probably the best Roman orator, well known for his work in politics and law.
*Livy — An author of Ab Urbe Condita, a history of Rome as a city.  His writings are very convoluted — most of his sentences and phrases have some sort of subordination to them.
*Catullus — A poet who writes about and to his friends, about his girlfriend, to insult others, or to give condolences.
*J.R.R. Tolkien — A famous author in the 20th century who wrote The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit (though not in Latin).

==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==
The poet Ovid was banished from Rome in 8 AD by Augustus, Julius Caesar's great-nephew.  This is the first 2 lines of the poem ''Tristia'' (meaning &quot;Sorrows&quot;), which Ovid wrote to express his sadness about his banishment.

In Latin:
&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px; padding: 0.2em&quot;&gt;
''Parue — nec inuideo — sine me, liber, ibis in urbem:''&lt;br&gt;
''ei mihi, quod domino non licet ire tuo!''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In English:
&lt;blockquote width =80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px; padding: 0.2em&quot;&gt;
''You will go, my little book, without me to the city, but I don't envy you.''&lt;br&gt;
''Go on — go to the city forbidden to me — forbidden to your master.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This song by an unknown poet from the 16th Century was popular with students some time ago when everybody had to learn Latin at school: 


In Latin:
&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px; padding: 0.2em&quot;&gt;
''Flevit lepus parvulus&lt;br&gt;
''clamans altis vocibus:&lt;br&gt;
''Quid feci hominibus,&lt;br&gt;
''quod me sequuntur canibus?&lt;br&gt;
''Neque in horto fui&lt;br&gt;
''neque holus comedi.''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


In English:
&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px; padding: 0.2em&quot;&gt;
''Wept the little rabbit,&lt;br&gt;
''shouting with high voice:&lt;br&gt;
''What did I do to the humans,&lt;br&gt;
''that they chase me with dogs?&lt;br&gt;
''I was not in the garden,&lt;br&gt;
''and I did not eat the vegetables''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{expand}}
Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit, usually refered to as '''TCAT''', is a network of bus services in [[w:Tompkins County|Tompkins County]], [[w:New York|New York]]. The vast majority of TCAT service is based around the City of Ithaca, New York, and several routes serve [[w:Ithaca College|Ithaca College]], [[w:Cornell University|Cornell University]], and Tompkins Courtland Community College (TC3)

==Routes==

Currently, there are more than thirty bus routes that comprise the TCAT system. Routes are identified by number and are usually indicated on a marquee at the front of the bus, and sometimes on the side as well. Some notable routes are as follows:

'''Route 10''' is a loop shuttle service between the Cornell University Campus and downtown Ithaca (The Commons.) Service is every ten minutes, the most frequent of any route on the system, and runs Monday through Friday 7:30am to 5:30pm

'''Route 11''' connects the Ithaca College Campus with downtown Ithaca. It runs every half hour Monday through Saturday until 7:00 PM and hourly on Sunday until around 5:00 PM. It also serves  the Longview Retirement Home.

'''Route 15''' connects the Ithaca Commons with Wegmans Supermarket, also stopping at Walmart, Kmart, Lowes Home Improvement and other shops along the way. Connects with the 11 route.

'''Route 30''' links the Commons with the Pyramid Mall, running through the Cornell Campus along the way. Service is every half hour, during peak periods every fifteen minutes. Runs seven days a week.

'''Routes 80 and higher''' solely serve the Cornell Campus, many other routes pass through the Cornell Campus. Route 81 serves between A lot and B lot in Cornell campus. Route 82 serves between Hasbrouk apartment complex for graduate students and East Hill Plaza. Route 83 serves between West Campus and North Campus via Uris Hall in Central Campus. 

'''Routes 90 and higher''' provides night services. Route 90 serves between Ithaca Commons and Robert Purcell Community Center in Cornell campus. Route 92 and 93 serves various points at Cornell campus including North campus, West campus, and East Hill Plaza. More frequent services are provided during the weekend.

==Zones and Fares==

Fares are based on TCAT's zone system. When riders travel within one zone (which is the case for the majority of passengers), they pay the single-zone fare. Riders that travel through two or more zones pay the multi-zone fare. On weekends there is one fare for all zones -- the single zone fare.

Zone 1 includes all of the City of Ithaca and the neighborhoods of South, East, and West Hill, and the Northeast neighborhood areas -- including the Tompkins County Airport, the Cayuga Medical Center, and Pyramid Mall.

Zone 2 covers the outer suburban areas of the county and the rural towns (includes Lansing, Etna, Freeville, Dryden, McLean, Groton, Brooktondale, Slaterville Springs, Danby, Newfield, Enfield, and Trumansburg).

Adult single fares are $1.50 and $3.00 for single and multi zone trips respectively. Child fares are $1.25 and $2.50, and fares for seniors and disabled persons are 75 cents and $1.50. Various pass options also exist ranging from a single day pass to an annual one offering unlimited travel anywhere on the system. Although no special fares for college students exist, there are several semester pass options for Ithaca College and Cornell University students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cleanup in under 5 minutes ==

&lt;s&gt;At 03:22, 9 April 2006, [[Special:Contributions/Dwilliams274|Dwilliams274]] put on a {{tl|cleanup}} tag, but forgot the parameter: {{tl1|cleanup|''reason for cleanup''}}. Meanwhile, I diverted the red links to Wikipedia. I was doing a section edit, so there was no edit conflict. I see nothing else to cleanup, and Dwilliams274 never gave a reason, so I now remove the tag. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:26, 9 April 2006 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

Before I could remove the tag, Dwilliams274 changed it to {{tl1|cleanup|This is not a textbook}}. This looks like a good start to a textbook, so I removed the tag. Is there some reason why this is not a textbook? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:57, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

What are you doing? I wonder how you discovered the cleanup tag, but it takes a parameter: {{tl1|cleanup|''reason for cleanup''}}. You can check '''[[Wikibooks:Template messages]]''' if you want to know which templates are available.

Its optional, but there is a '''Show preview''' button, and you can use that instead of &quot;Save page&quot; to check your work. Thanks, --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:28, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

Let me give you hint. I looked at the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=MapleStory/Stars&amp;action=history history of MapleStory/Stars], and noticed that you were repeatedly saving the page.

You can use the '''Show preview''' button to check your work without saving the page. (It is button to the right of the &quot;Save page&quot; button.) It is optional, but it is slightly faster; you get the edit box back on the next screen, instead of having to click &quot;Edit this page&quot; again. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:35, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Repairing permissions has become one of those things that somehow gets recommended by the community as a great fix. It's really just something that helps to confuse users and make the whole process more complicated than it should be. It does have its uses, but is not a useful step at any point in the Mac OS X installation process.

For that matter, even if you recommend to do it once (just to make sure things run smoothly. It is a good time to schedule that sort of thing, you might say), you don't need to do it twice. Repair permissions checks the permissions of Apple-installed files to be sure they match what's on record. If this is done at the beginning, all the permissions on the drive will be correct. The installer will, by default, install the new files with correct permissions. Therefore, all the permissions are correct. Alternatively, say there are some incorrect permission and you don't repair before the install. After the installation, all the new files will be correct. Repair permission then checks the files against its database and repairs the ones left behind that are still incorrect (these files, by the way, even if they're of incorrect permissions, are not going to interfere with the success of the installation). All permissions are now correct. This is true either way after one install.

But that makes a short story long. The basic idea is, repair permissions does not need to be included in a guide to installing OS X, but if you insist on including it, at least don't have it twice.

:The installation works as root, which means permissions are meaningless. That means, repairing permissions BEFORE reinstalling Tiger is a complete waste of time, it can't possibly have any effect. - ([[User:Tobberoth|Tobberoth]] 09:10, 6 April 2007 (UTC))</text>

This book should probably be renamed from &quot;Programming:D&quot; to &quot;D Programming&quot;, as per [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Depreciation_of_the_&quot;Programming:&quot;_psuedo_namespace]]. (Note that there's a bot to do the work.)

-- [[User:Kwi|Kwi]] | [[User talk:Kwi|Talk]] 12:42, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

:I absolutely agree with you. The more appropriate name for this book would be &quot;D Programming&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
:-- Markus

I have renamed the book, replacing &quot;Programming:D&quot; with &quot;D Programming&quot; in all page names.

Additionally, I've taken the liberty to rename the following pages in accordance with what seems to be the accepted style (compare, for instance, [[C Programming]]). See the [[#Style]] section below.

* [[Programming:D/Documentation Comments]] -&gt; [[D Programming/Documentation comments]]&lt;br&gt;(Avoiding title case for chapters, except when the chapter title actually refers to the title of e.g. a product.)
* [[Programming:D/GNU D Compiler (GDC)]] -&gt; [[D Programming/GNU D Compiler]]&lt;br&gt;(Dropping the &quot;(GDC)&quot; bit from the chapter title.)
* [[Programming:D/Digitalmars D (DMD)]] -&gt; [[D Programming/Digital Mars D compiler]]&lt;br&gt;(Dropping the &quot;(DMD)&quot; bit from the chapter title, and changing &quot;Digitalmars&quot; to the proper [http://www.digitalmars.com/ &quot;Digital Mars&quot;].)
* [[Programming:D/Phobos/std.stdio]] -&gt; [[D Programming/std.stdio]]&lt;br&gt;(Flattening the structure; see &quot;Style&quot; below.)
* [[Programming:D/DFL]] -&gt; [[D Programming/D Forms Library]]
* [[Programming:D/GC]] -&gt; [[D Programming/Garbage collector]]&lt;br&gt;(Expanding abbreviations. [[D Programming/DWT]] remains abbreviated though... wasn't sure about that.)

RTAI was left alone, as it seems to be a book-in-the-book, except for:
* [[Programming:D/RTAI/Accessing PCI Hardware]] -&gt; [[D Programming/RTAI/Accessing PCI hardware]]&lt;br&gt;(Dropping title case, again.)

== Style ==

In the interest of settling on one style before the book (hopefully) grows large, I propose the following guidelines:

* No title-case in page titles and headlines, except when the title actually refers to the title of e.g. a product.
: So, &quot;GNU D Compiler&quot;, as that's the name of the product, but &quot;Digital Mars D compiler&quot; with lowercase &quot;compiler&quot;, as the word is merely a descriptor. (&quot;Digital Mars&quot; is, of course, a name, as is &quot;D&quot;.)

* In page titles: Expand all, or most, abbreviations. (Rather vague, I know.)
: So, &quot;Garbage collector&quot;, not &quot;GC&quot;. It seems to me that grey areas include, for instance, &quot;DWT&quot;... use the abbreviation, or spell it out?

* Avoid subpages (aka &quot;use flat structure&quot;).
: The &quot;D Programming/&quot; part is mandated by Wikibooks, but we should avoid creating sub-sub-pages for structuring. (On the other hand, a page called &quot;D Programming/TCP/IP with D&quot; would be OK.)
: I refer to [[w:Wikipedia:Subpages#Disallowed uses]], &quot;'''Do not''' use subpages for permanent content that is meant to be part of the encyclopedia.&quot;, or [[m:Case against subpages]].
: Though there is, of course, a huge difference between Wikibooks and Wikipedia, and not all WP arguments hold here, there's the &quot;Subpage titles are ugly&quot; if nothing else. :-)

* Generally, have [[w:Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Wikipedia's Manual of Style]] apply, where it make sense for a wikibook.

== Revamp ==

I don't mean this offensively, but this book is completely ridiculous.  It's no way to learn D unless you're a compiler.  It needs to be completely erased and restarted from scratch, starting with a good, logical TOC.  I don't really want to just delete this book outright, so I may start another one (does wikibooks let you do that?  Have two books on one topic?).  Or, I may get lazy :)
: No offense taken. This book is more of a 'Reference Manual' rather than a 'How To Program in ...' style of book. I can't see that another book on D, from the perspective of teaching how to use the language, is a bad idea. [[User:Derek Parnell|Derek Parnell]] 02:37, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
: For what little my opinion is worth here, I think that creating a second book on D is a bad idea: We can't even fill the first book with information! Instead, I think a better idea would be to fix what is already here: Add new chapters to this book if you need, or include better information in the chapters that already exist. Starting a new book is a big project, and isn't something that people should attempt without a very very good reason for doing it. If you create a second book on the same subject, they will probably just get merged together in the future anyway, so I would save the effort. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:52, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
: I agree with Whiteknight and I don't understand why a reference manual is needed. What would be the difference to [http://www.digitalmars.com/d/ Walter Bright's D manual] (except for some things missing there, e.g. the full D ABI)? The TOC looks already very similar to Walter's manual. I would propose to generate a guide for beginners in computer programming instead. I have made a few initial changes on [[D_Programming/Types]] which you can think about or throw away. --[[User:Mbutscher|Mbutscher]] 19:05, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
: In my infinite lack of wisdom, I ''have'' started another book.  [[A Beginner's Guide to D]]. --[[User:GregorR|GregorR]] 20:53, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
:I agree with you, guys. This book looks like a reference to the D programming language and it is very similar to the Walter Bright's D manual. I think that this book should be rewritten. Then  you      should decide whether this book must be intended for beginners or intermediate D programming users. As i see, &quot;A Beginner's Guide to D&quot; by GregorR will be a good book for beginners. Therefore you could create a book for intermediate level or a complete d programming book combining begining, intermediate, and advanced levels. What do you think? --[[User:MarkusD|MarkusD]] 5:35, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
: I recommend to create a book for all from beginners to advanced users with most weight to beginners because the well seasoned programmers who want to learn D will probably be happy with Walter's manual (plus maybe some D specific tricks and idioms not described there). I recommend also to decide to work on '''one''' book, either this or Gregor's. Splitting our energy here doesn't make sense --[[User:Mbutscher|Mbutscher]] 19:43, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
::I don't think we should have to even create multiple books for &quot;beginners&quot; or &quot;advanced programmers&quot;. ''Wiki isn't paper'', and we can make a single &quot;book&quot; with multiple sections for different audiences. We can have a &quot;beginners&quot; section with basic chapters, we can have an &quot;advanced&quot; section for seasoned programmers, and we can have a &quot;reference&quot; section, all in the same book! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:08, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
::That's a great idea, Whiteknight. I absolutely agree with you. --[[User:MarkusD|MarkusD]] 5:04, 10 September 2006 (UTC).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a good place for adding tips, tricks, bugs and experiences which would help other owners of players in the Sandisk Sansa e200 series, which consists of:
*Sansa e250 - 2 gig
*Sansa e260 - 4 gig
*Sansa e270 - 6 gig
*Sansa e280 - 8 gig

SanDisk was the first manufacturer to release an 8 gig flash mp3 player. Sandisk released the e280 model on August 21, 2006.

In addition, you can add [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroSD microSD cards], and the battery is user exchangeable.

== Tips and Tricks ==

=== '''Blue Wheel on, Screen off''' ===

If your blue wheel is on, and the screen does not &quot;power on&quot; then hold down the menu button on the front bottom left of the player for about 30 seconds. After 15 the blue wheel will power off, but keep the button pressed down. This allows for a reboot.

=== '''Recovery Mode''' ===         

I was having a problem with my player and after a little back and forth they showed me a back door to recover the system:

If your Player wants you to start in recovery mode

'''1.''' Activate the &quot;HOLD&quot; function    '''2.''' Press &quot;Rec&quot; and hold, while ath the same time pressing &quot;ON/OFF&quot; button and hold.  

After some seconds of pressing there appears a screen reading: Recovery mode: Connect cable
Now connect to your PC. A folder 16mbFORMAT will appear under 'My Computer'. 
Call SanDisk technical support for the most up to date firmware files. 1-866-SanDisk

Note: The firmware is available online via links in their forum at http://forums.sandisk.com/sansa/

There are currently 2 version of the e200s, make sure you get the proper firmware for your version.  

Copy the .MI4 file from the zip to the 16mbFORMAT folder.

The one thing not mentioned is to format the device completely, create a new directory called &quot;sansa.fmt&quot; in the 16mbFORMAT folder.  Then, unplug the USB cable from your computer.  Powering down will not reformat.

=== Playback in Correct Order ===

There are bugs where albums don't always play in the correct order. The first thing you should is download the latest firmware version from Sansa using their firmware updater program available on the site. The latest version should solve this quite easily.

If all else fails, then edit ID3 tags so that the track numbers contain a leading zero.  [http://www.mp3tag.de/en/ MP3Tag] (freeware) and [http://maniactools.com/soft/mp3tag-pro/index.shtml mp3Tag Pro] (shareware) work well for this.

=== Change Video Quality ===

If you want to change the quality of the converted videos (results in smaller size), go to the folder Programs Files → Sandisk → Sansa Media Converter → Profiles, then open the the arp file (SanDisk_E200_MSC.apr) in WordPad or Notepad, go to the optimize section and you can change the quality via video quality. I changed mine from 70 to 30 and it keeps the file about the same size, also you can change the converter from capping it off at 10 minutes, go to split time and change it from 600 (goes by seconds so 600 is 10 minutes) to something like 20,000 and that should do it.

=== Alternative charging methods ===
Sandisk only provides a USB cable for charging the battery. But if you've got a powered USB hub, it's reported to charge the player.  Devices that also send power to its USB but not data (for example, the Xbox 360 and the Playstations 2 and 3, when not employing eyeToy extensions) will charge but not use the 'Connected' dialog. Also any wall adapter to USB (i.e. iPod charger) or any after market adaptations work well too. The Made for Sansa product line sells a SanDisk certified model of this
*Note: You can't listen to/play media while the Sansa is plugged into the USB hub on computers.  You can, however, on some other chargers.  There are several after market products, such as wall and car chargers, that will.

=== Play folders and create playlists ===
Per default, the e200 series does not provide a feature to simply play a single folder of the player's directory structure. This can be useful if the soundfiles do not have correct ID3 tags or a large number of Files is stored on the player.
However, there is a free playlist creator which creates playlists for each folder on the sansa player with one click. it is written in .NET and does not alter the music files (http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/staff/cp/playlist_creator.zip).

=== Driver for Windows 98 ===
Sandisk does not support Windows 98 for the e200 series of players, so they will not make a driver available. The e100 series driver does not work.

There is an independent driver for m200 series in MSC mode http://www.98-drivers.com/sandisk.html
There is also a free generic USB mass storage driver here: http://www.technical-assistance.co.uk/kb/usbmsd98.php

=== Fill Device Automatically in Windows Media Player + Create instant playlists for transfer ===
Peter Gabriel's latest digital venture 'The Filter' have recently released a Windows Media Player and Sansa. This software makes updating your Sansa a very simple process - all you need to do is select a song that you like and a playlist will be instantly generated. This playlist will automatically updated with new songs when you reconnect your device. It is a free download. (http://www.thefilter.com/download.aspx?platform=Windows).

=== Linux Tips ===
The Sansa E series players (and the Sansa Express) work well under Linux. There are some &quot;gotchas&quot;, however:

*'''Mode''' The Sansa's operate in &quot;MSC&quot; mode under Linux. This is not the default mode for the player. You must change the USB mode, the last menu item under the &quot;Settings-&gt;USB&quot; menu, to MSC.
*'''Sync''' After writing files to the Sansa, you should issue a manual &quot;sync&quot; command, then unmount the device.
*'''Important''' The database which stores all of the track info does not automatically update when the USB storage device is ejected. After adding music to your Sansa you '''must''' delete the database directory. When you restart your player the database will be recreated properly.
*'''Playlist creation''' You can upload custom playlist into PLAYLISTS folder in the device. Playlist is in PLP format with .pla suffix, UTF-16LE encoded. [http://home.tiscali.cz/sikorsky/sansa Here] is very simple Linux shell script, converting M3U to PLA.  Also, see (referenced by parent links below) [http://www.anythingbutipod.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=81 Linux Playlist utils].
*More to come...

==Themes==
The firmware inside the e200 series can be modified with [http://www.cerebus.de/iriver/ H3 Mod] to customize menu and user interface of the Sansa. Also called &quot;Themeing&quot;, these Photoshop artistes create vivid and interesting themes, see Other Links.

== Bugs ==
'''Song tags in MSC mode'''

If you update the tags on your songs and then transfer the files to the player, the database still shows the old tags. Removing the songs, refreshing the database and then reuploading the songs works. You can also remove the database file System\Data\Pp5000.dat. But some songs still have screwy tags on the E270, even after MediaMonkey shows correct tags on the computer. And some songs won't show the correct genre, no matter what you do. The genre will show as unknown. To fix that, remove the ID3v1 tags and use ID3v2.3 tags (not 2.4). Linux users may find that the Sansa can't read tags written by their computer, even ID3v2.3 tags.  The tagging program eyed3 has been known to write Sansa-friendly tags in Linux when converting v1 tags to v2.3.

'''Deleting database deletes list of Top Rated Songs'''

This isn't really a bug, just something to keep in mind. When you rate a song, the song file isn't changed, only the database on the player pertaining to that song. So when you delete the database (needed sometimes), you also lose all rating of songs.

'''System noise between tracks'''

Some owners report a system noise between tracks. The noise is the same audio level, independently of the volume setting, so usually only heard during gaps in the playback or at low volume levels. The system noise is supposedly less noticeable with newer firmwares. Some owners say it's still the same even after upgrade. Some say certain earbuds are more susceptible (low impedance, high sensitivity) to the noise than others.

'''MCDI header hides genre'''

Problem: when an MCDI header (Music CD identifier) is included in the ID3v2 tag, the software fails to read the track's genre information. Solution: remove the MCDI header (for example using ID3-TagIT). Note: make sure you refresh the tag database.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Currently (04/05/06) MySQL 5.1 does not come with the installer (Beta Version). Here are instructions to help you with the installation. Details information can be found in the online [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/windows-install-archive.html manual ]. If you follow these recommendations correctly, you should need to get rid of any previous MySQL running in your System.

1. Extract the archive to the desired [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ install ] directory. Traditionally, the MySQL server is installed in C:\mysql. If you do not install MySQL at C:\mysql, you must specify the path to the install directory in an option file.

2. An option file can be created and modified with any text editor (Wordpad..). For example, if MySQL is installed in C:\someDirectory\mysql and the data directory is in C:\mydata\data, you can create an option file containing a [mysqld] section to specify values for the basedir and datadir parameters:

[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=C:/someDirectory/mysql
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=C:/someDirectory/mysql/data

I used the option file found in a pevious version of MySQL and just modified it for this version's directory.


3. To start the server, enter this command:

C:\&gt; &quot;C:\someDirectory\MySQL\bin\mysqld&quot; --console

When the server finishes its startup sequence, you should see something like this, which indicates that the server is ready to service client connections:

mysqld: ready for connections
Version: '5.1.7-beta'  socket: ''  port: 3306

The server continues to write to the console any further diagnostic output it produces. You can open a new console window in which to run client programs. 

The MySQL server can be started manually from the command line. This can be done on any version of Windows. 



To start using MySQL 5.1, you should start a console window and enter this command:

C:\&gt; MySQL -u root

You can stop the MySQL server by executing this command:

C:\&gt; &quot;C:\someDirectory\MySQL\bin\mysqladmin&quot; -u root shutdown


Note: If the MySQL root user account has a password, you need to invoke mysqladmin with the -p option and supply the password when prompted. 
      If you are running another version on MySQL, dont forget to stop the Service.

To Start MySQL as a Windows Service more information can be found in the MySQL 5.1 [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/windows-start-service.html?ff=nopfpls Manual ].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The chapter begins with the discussion of definitions of real and complex numbers. The discussion, which is often lengthy, is shortened by tools from abstract algebra.

== Real numbers ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of rational numbers. A sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be Cauchy if &lt;math&gt;|x_n - x_m| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n, m \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all sequences &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; that converges to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is then an ideal of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt;. It then follows that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal ideal and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} / I&lt;/math&gt; is a field, which we denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

The formal procedure we just performed is called field completion, and, clearly, a different choice of a [[w:Absolute value (algebra)|valuation]] &lt;math&gt;| \cdot |&lt;/math&gt; ''could'' give rise to a different field. It turned out that every valuation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is either equivalent to the usual absolute or some p-adic absolute value, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a prime. ([[w:Ostrowski's theorem]])  Define &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}_p = \mathbf{Q} / I&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the maximal ideal of all sequences &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; that converges to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;| \cdot |_p&lt;/math&gt;.

A p-adic absolute value is defined as follows. Given a prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, every rational number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;x = p^n a / b&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; are integers not divisible by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. We then let &lt;math&gt;|x|_p = p^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;. Most importantly, &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|_p&lt;/math&gt; is non-Archimedean; i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;|x + y|_p \le \max \{ |x|_p, |y|_p \}&lt;/math&gt;
This is stronger than the triangular inequality since &lt;math&gt;\max \{ |x|_p, |y|_p \} \le |x|_p + |y|_p&lt;/math&gt;

Example: &lt;math&gt;|6|_2 = |18|_2 = {1 \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''If &lt;math&gt;|x_n - x|_p \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;|x_n - x_m|_p&lt;/math&gt;''.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
:&lt;math&gt;|x_n - x_m|_p \le |x_n - x|_p + |x - x_m|_p \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n, m \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;s_n = 1 + p + p^2 + .. + p^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;(1 - p)s_n = 1 - p^n&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;|s_n - {1 \over 1 - p}|_p = |{p^n \over 1 - p}| = p^{-n} \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = {1 \over 1 - p}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt; be the closed unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt;. That &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt; is compact follows from the next theorem, which gives an algebraic characterization of p-adic integers.

'''2 Theorem''' ''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_p \simeq \varprojlim \mathbf{Z} / p^n \mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
where the project maps &lt;math&gt;f_n: \mathbf{Z} / p^{n+1} \mathbf{Z} \to \mathbf{Z} / p^n \mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt; are such that &lt;math&gt;f_n \circ \pi_{n+1} = \pi_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\pi_n&lt;/math&gt; being the projection &lt;math&gt;\pi_n: \mathbf{Z} \to \mathbf{Z} / p^n \mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;

The theorem implies that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subspace of:
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{n \ge 0} \mathbf{Z} / p^n \mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;,
which is a product of compact spaces and thus is compact.

== Sequences ==

We say a sequence of scalar-valued functions ''converges uniformly'' to another function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\sup |f_n - f| \to 0&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Theorem (iterated limit theorem)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of scalar-valued functions on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\lim_{y \to x} f_n(y)&lt;/math&gt; exists and if &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly convergent, then for each fixed &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{y \to x} f_n(y) = \lim_{y \to x} \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(y)&lt;/math&gt;
Proof:
Let &lt;math&gt;a_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a uniform limit of &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., &lt;math&gt;\sup |f_n - f| \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given. By uniform convergence, there exists &lt;math&gt;N &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;2\sup |f - f_N| &lt; \epsilon / 2&lt;/math&gt;
Then there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U_x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt; |f_N(y) - f_N(x)| &lt; \epsilon / 2&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;y \in U_x&lt;/math&gt;
Combine the two estimates:
:&lt;math&gt;|f(y) - f(x)| \le |f(y) - f_N(y)| + |f_N(y) - f_N(x)| + |f_N(x) - f(x)| &lt; 2\sup |f - f_N| + \epsilon / 2 = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{y \to x} f(y) = f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''A uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is again continuous.''

=== Real and complex numbers ===

In this chapter, we work with a number of subtleties like completeness, ordering, Archimedian property; those are usually never seriously concerned when Calculus was first conceived. I believe that the significance of those nuances becomes clear only when one starts writing proofs and learning examples that counter one's intuition. For this, I suggest a reader to simply skip materials that she does not find there is need to be concerned with; in particular, the construction of real numbers does not make much sense at first glance, in terms of argument and the need to do so. In short, one should seek rigor only when she sees the need for one. WIthout loss of continuity, one can proceed and hopefully she can find answers for those subtle questions when she search here. They are put here not for pedagogical consideration but mere for the later chapters logically relies on it.

We denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; the set of natural numbers. The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; does not form a group, and the introduction of negative numbers fills this deficiency. We leave to the readers details of the construction of integers from natural numbers, as this is not central and menial; to do this, consider the pair of natural numbers and think about how arithmetical properties should be defined. The set of integers is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. It forms an integral domain; thus, we may define the quotient field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the set of rational numbers, by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} = \left \{ {a \over b} :  \mathit{b} \mbox{ are integers and }\mathit{b}\mbox{ is nonzero }\right \}&lt;/math&gt;.
As usual, we say for two rationals &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x - y&lt;/math&gt; is positive.

We say &lt;math&gt;E \subset \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is ''bounded above'' if there exists some &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;y \in E&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y \le x&lt;/math&gt;, and is ''bounded below'' if the reversed relation holds. Notice &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is bounded above and below if and only if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is bounded in the definition given in the chapter 1.

The reason for why we want to work on problems in analysis with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; instead of is a quite simple one:

'''2 Theorem''' ''Fundamental axiom of analysis fails in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: &lt;math&gt;1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, ... \to 2^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

How can we create the field satisfying this axiom? i.e., the construction of the real field. There are several ways. The quickest is to obtain the real field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; by completing &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.

We define the set of complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = \mathbb{R}[i] / &lt;i^2 + 1&gt;&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is just a symbol. That &lt;math&gt;i^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible says the ideal generated by it is maximal, and the field theory tells that &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a field. Every complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; has a form:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z = a + bi + &lt;i^2 + 1&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.
Though the square root of -1 does not exist, &lt;math&gt;i^2&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as -1 since &lt;math&gt;i^2 + &lt;i^2 + 1&gt; = -1 + 1 + i^2 + &lt;i^2 + 1&gt; = -1&lt;/math&gt;. Accordingly, the term &lt;math&gt;&lt;i^2 + 1&gt;&lt;/math&gt;is usually omitted.

'''2 Exercise''' ''Prove that there exists irrational numbers &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt; is rational.''

=== Sequences ===

''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of numbers, be they real or complex. Then the following are equivalent:
* (a) &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.
* (b) There exists a cofinite subsequence in every open ball.

'''Theorem (Bolzano-Weierstrass)''' ''Every infinite bounded set has a non-isolated point.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is discrete. Then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is closed; thus, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is compact by Heine-Borel theorem. Since &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is discrete, there exists a collection of disjoint open balls &lt;math&gt;S_x&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x \in S&lt;/math&gt;. Since the collection is an open cover of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a finite subcover &lt;math&gt;\{ S_{x_1}, S_{x_2}, ..., S_{x_n} \}&lt;/math&gt;.
But
:&lt;math&gt;S \cap (\{ S_{x_1} \cup S_{x_2} \cup ... S_{x_n} \} = \{ x_1, x_2, ... x_n \} &lt;/math&gt;
This contradicts that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is infinite. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2 Corollary''' ''Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.''
Proof: 

The definition of convergence given in Ch 1 is general enough but is usually inconvenient in writing proofs. We thus give the next theorem, which is more convenient in showing the properties of the sequences, which we normally learn in Calculus courses.

In the very first chapter, we discussed sequences of sets and their limits. Now that we have created real numbers in the previous chapter, we are ready to study real and complex-valued sequences. Throughout the chapter, by numbers we always means real or complex numbers. (In fact, we never talk about non-real and non-complex numbers in the book, anyway)

Given a sequence &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; of numbers, let &lt;math&gt;E_j = \{ a_j, a_{j+1}, \cdot \}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{j \rightarrow \infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \limsup_{j \rightarrow \infty} E_j&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \bigcap_{j=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{k=j}^{\infty}E_k&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \bigcap_{j=1}^{\infty} \sup \{ a_k, a_{k+1}, ... \}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The similar case holds for liminf as well.

'''Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;s_j&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence. The following are equivalent:
*(a) ''The sequence &lt;math&gt;s_j&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.''
*(b) ''The sequence &lt;math&gt;s_j&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy; i.e., &lt;math&gt;|s_n - s_m| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n, m \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.''
*(c) ''Every convergent subsequence of &lt;math&gt;s_j&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.''
*(d) ''&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{j \to \infty} s_j = \liminf_{j \to \infty} s_j&lt;/math&gt;.''
*(e) ''For each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, we can find some real number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., N is a function of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;) so that''
*:&lt;math&gt;|s_j - s| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j \ge N&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof: From the triangular inequality it follows that:
:&lt;math&gt;|s_n - s_m| \le |s_n - n| + |s_m - m|&lt;/math&gt;.
Letting &lt;math&gt;n, m \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; gives that (a) implies (b). Suppose (b). The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem states that every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence, say, &lt;math&gt;s_k&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|s_n - s|&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= |s_n - s_m + s_m - s| &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\le |s_n - s_m| + |s_m - s| &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;&lt; \epsilon \ 2 + \epsilon \ 2 = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
|}. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;s_j \to s&lt;/math&gt;. That (c) implies (d) is obvious by definition.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt; converge to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Then we have:''
:(a) &lt;math&gt;\lim_{j \to \infty} (x_j + y_j) = x + y&lt;/math&gt;.
:(b) &lt;math&gt;\lim_{j \to \infty} (x_jy_j) = xy&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given. (a) From the triangular inequality it follows:
:&lt;math&gt;|(x_j + y_j) - (x + y)| = |x_j - x| + |y_j - y| &lt; {\epsilon \over 2} + {\epsilon \over 2} = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
where the convergence of &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt; tell that we can find some &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; so that
:&lt;math&gt;|x_j - x| &lt; {\epsilon \over 2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|y_j - y| &lt; {\epsilon \over 2}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;.
(b) Again from the triangular inequality, it follows:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|x_j y_j - xy|&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= |(x_j - x)(y_j - y + y) + x(y_j - y)|&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\le |x_j - x|(1 + |y|) + |x| |y_j - y|&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;j \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
|}
where we may suppose that &lt;math&gt;|y_j - y| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Other similar cases follows from the theorem; for example, we can have by letting &lt;math&gt;y_j = \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{j \to \infty} (kx_j) = k \lim_{j \to \infty} x_j&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2.7 Theorem''' ''Given &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; in a normed space:&lt;br /&gt;

* ''(c) &lt;math&gt;\prod (a_n + 1)&lt;/math&gt; converges.''
Proof: If (b) is true, then we can find a &lt;math&gt;N &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n \ge N&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\| a_n \right\|^{1 \over n} &lt; b &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus (a) is true since:,

=== Continuity ===

Let &lt;math&gt;f:\Omega \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{\infty, -\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;. We write &lt;math&gt;\{ f &gt; a \}&lt;/math&gt; to mean the set &lt;math&gt;\{ x : x \in \Omega, f(x) &gt; a \}&lt;/math&gt;. In the same vein we also use the notations like &lt;math&gt;\{f &lt; a\}, \{f = a\}&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

We say, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is ''upper semicontinuous'' if the set &lt;math&gt;\{ f &lt; c \}&lt;/math&gt; is open for every &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and ''lower semicontinuous'' if &lt;math&gt;-f&lt;/math&gt; is upper semicontinuous.

'''2 Lemma''' ''The following are equivalent.''
* ''(i) &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is upper semicontinuous.''
* ''(ii) If &lt;math&gt;u(z) &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sup_{|s-z|&lt;\delta} f(s) &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;.''
* ''(iii) &lt;math&gt;\limsup_{s \to z} u(s) \le u(z)&lt;/math&gt;''.
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;u(z) &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;. Then we find a &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(z) &lt; c_2 &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;. If (i) is true, then we can find a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\sup_{|s-z|&lt;\delta} u(s) \le c_2 &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the converse being clear, (i) &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; (ii). Assuming (ii), for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, we can find a &lt;math&gt;\delta_\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sup_{|s-z|&lt;{\delta_\epsilon}}u(s) &lt; u(z) + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Taking inf over all &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; gives (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iii), whose converse is clear. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is upper semicontinuous and &lt;math&gt;&lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; on a compact set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is bounded from above and attains its maximum.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;u(x) &lt; \sup_K u&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;, we can find &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(x) &lt; g(x) &lt; \sup_K u&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is upper semicontinuous, it follows that the sets &lt;math&gt;\{u &lt; g(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;, running over all &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;, form an open cover of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. It admits a finite subcover since &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact. That is to say, there exist &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \in K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K \subset \{u &lt; g(x_1)\} \cup \{u &lt; g(x_1)\} \cup ... \{u &lt; g(x_n)\}&lt;/math&gt; and so:
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_K u \le \max \{ g(x_1), g(x_2), ..., g(x_n) \} &lt; \sup_K u&lt;/math&gt;,
which is a contradiction. Hence, there must be some &lt;math&gt;z \in K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(z) = \sup_K u&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, then both &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} ( (\alpha, \infty) )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} ( (-\infty, \beta) )&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are open. Thus, the continuity of a real-valued function is the same as its semicontinuity from above and below.

'''2 Lemma''' ''A decreasing sequence of semicontinuous functions has the limit which is upper semicontinuous. Conversely, let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be upper semicontinuous. Then there exists a decreasing sequence &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; of Lipschitz continuous functions that converges to f.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The first part is obvious. To show the second part, let &lt;math&gt;f_j(x) = \inf_{y \in E} { f(x) + j^{-1} |y - x| }&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; has the desired properties since the identity &lt;math&gt;|f_j(x) - f_j(y)| = j^{-1} |x - y|&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

We say a function is ''uniform continuous'' on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; if for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in E&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|x - y| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;|f(x) - f(y)|&lt;/math&gt;.

Example: The function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly continuous on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; since
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x) - f(y)| = |x - y| &lt; \delta = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
while the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt; is not uniformly continuous on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; since
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x) - f(y)| = |x^2 - y^2| = |x - y||x + y|&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;|x + y|&lt;/math&gt; can be made arbitrary large.

Proof:

The theorem has this interpretation; an uniform continuity is a ''global'' property in contrast to continuity, which is a local property.

'''2 Corollary''' ''A function is uniform continuous on a bounded set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it has a continuos extension to &lt;math&gt;\overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given. Since &lt;math&gt;f_j \to f&lt;/math&gt; uniformly, we can find a &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; so that:

Also, since &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and each &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; are uniformly continuous on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and so, we find a finite sequence &lt;math&gt;\{ \delta_0, \delta_1, ... \delta_N \}&lt;/math&gt; so that:

Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \| = \sup_E | \cdot |&lt;/math&gt;. The direct part follows holds since the limit exists by assumption. To show the converse, let &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \lim_{j \to \infty} f_j(x)&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt;, which exists since the completeness of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given.

Since the finite union of totally and uniformly bounded sets is again totally and uniformly bounded, we may suppose that &lt;math&gt;K_2&lt;/math&gt; is a singleton &lt;math&gt;\{ y \}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the pointwise boundedness we have:

showing that (i) holds.
To show (ii) let &lt;math&gt;A = \cup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \{ f(y) \}&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;K \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt; be compact. By Arzela's theorem the sequence &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; is totally bounded with &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \| = \sup_K | \cdot |&lt;/math&gt;.

showing the equicontinuity. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

=== First and second countability ===

'''2 Theorem (first countability)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; have a countable base at each point of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have the following:
* ''(i) For &lt;math&gt;A \subset E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \in \overline{A}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_j \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_j \to x&lt;/math&gt;.
* ''(ii) A function is continuous on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(x_j) \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;x_j \to x&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof: (i) Let &lt;math&gt;\{B_j\}&lt;/math&gt; be a base at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B_{j + 1} \subset B_j&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x \in \overline{A}&lt;/math&gt;, then every &lt;math&gt;B_j&lt;/math&gt; intersects A&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;x_j \in B_j \cap E&lt;/math&gt;. It now follows: if &lt;math&gt;x \in G&lt;/math&gt;, then we find some &lt;math&gt;B_N \subset G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;x_k \in B_k \subset B_N&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k \ge N&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;x_j \to x&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;x \not\in \overline{A}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;E \backslash \overline{E}&lt;/math&gt; is an open set containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and no &lt;math&gt;x_j \subset E&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, no sequence in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. That (ii) is valid follows since &lt;math&gt;f(x_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the composition of continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which is again continuous. In other words, (ii) is essentially the same as (i). &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2. 2 Theorem''' ''&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; has a countable basis consisting of open sets with compact closure.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose the collection of interior of closed balls &lt;math&gt;G_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; for a rational coordinate &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. It is countable since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is. It is also a basis of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;; since if not, there exists an interior point that is isolated, and this is absurd.

'''2.5 Theorem''' ''In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; there exists a set consisting of uncountably many components.''&lt;br /&gt;

Usual properties we expect from calculus courses for numerical sequences to have are met like the uniqueness of limit.

'''2 Theorem (uncountability of the reals)''' ''The set of all real numbers is never a sequence.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: See [http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~twk/Anal.pdf].

Example: Let f(x) = 0 if x is rational, f(x) = x^2 if x is irrational. Then f is continuous at 0 and nowhere else but f' exists at 0.

'''2 Theorem (continuous extension)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f, g: \overline{E} \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; be continuous. If &lt;math&gt;f = g&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f = g on \overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;u = f - g&lt;/math&gt;. Then clearly &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;\overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;{0}&lt;/math&gt; is closed in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u^{-1}(0)&lt;/math&gt; is also closed. Hence, &lt;math&gt;u = 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

, and for each &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_j = \overline{ \{ x_k : k \ge j \} }&lt;/math&gt;. Since for any subindex &lt;math&gt;j(1), j(2), ..., j(n)&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;x_{j(n)} \in B_{j(1)} \cap B_{j(2)} ... B_{j(n)}&lt;/math&gt;.
That is to say the sequence &lt;math&gt;B_j&lt;/math&gt; has the finite intersection property. Since &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is coun

Since &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is first countable, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is also sequentially countable. Hence, (a) &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; (b).

Suppose &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is not bounded, then there exists some &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that: for any finite set &lt;math&gt;\{ x_1, x_2, ... x_n \} \subset E&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;E \not \subset B(\epsilon, x_1) \cup ... B(\epsilon, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
Let recursively &lt;math&gt;x_1 \in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_j \in E \backslash \bigcup_1^{j-1} B(\epsilon, x_k)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;d(x_n, x_m) &gt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any n, m, &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is not Cauchy. Hence, (a) implies that &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is totally bounded. Also, 

[[Image:Hausdorff_space.svg|thumb|right|separated by neighborhoods]]
'''3 Theorem''' ''the following are equivalent:''
* (a) &lt;math&gt;\| x \| = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* (b) Two points can be separated by disjoint open sets.
* (c) Every limit is unique.

'''3 Theorem''' ''The separation by neighborhoods implies that a compact set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is closed in E.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/ProofOfACompactSetInAHausdorffSpaceIsClosed.html]: If &lt;math&gt;K = E&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is closed. If not, there exists a &lt;math&gt;x \in E \backslash K&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;y \in K&lt;/math&gt;, the hypothesis says there exists two disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;A(y)&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(y)&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The collection &lt;math&gt;\{ B(y) : y \in E \}&lt;/math&gt; is an open cover of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. Since the compactness, there exists a finite subcover &lt;math&gt;\{ B(y_1), B(y_2), ... B(y_n) \}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;A(y_1) \cap A(y_2) ... A(y_n)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;z \in K&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;z \in B(y_k)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;z \not\in A(y_k) \subset A&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;A(x) \subset E \backslash K&lt;/math&gt;. Since the finite intersection of open sets is again open, &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is open. Since the union of open sets is open,
:&lt;math&gt;E \backslash K = \bigcup_{x \not\in K} A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is open. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

=== Seminorm ===

[[Image:Vector_norms.png|frame|right|Illustrations of unit circles in different norms.]] Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a linear space. The ''seminorm'' of an element in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative number, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|&lt;/math&gt;, such that: for any &lt;math&gt;x, y \in G&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;\|x\| \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\| \alpha x \| = |\alpha| \|x\|&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\|x + y\| \le \|x\| + \|y\|&lt;/math&gt;. (triangular inequality)

Clearly, an absolute value is an example of a norm. Most of the times, the verification of the first two properties while whether or not the triangular inequality holds may not be so obvious. If every element in a linear space has the defined norm which is scalar in the space, then the space is said to be &quot;normed linear space&quot;.

A liner space is a pure algebraic concept; defining norms, hence, induces topology with which we can work on problems in analysis. (In case you haven't noticed this is a book about analysis not linear algebra per se.) In fact, a normed linear space is one of the simplest and most important topological space. See the addendum for the remark on semi-norms.

An example of a normed linear space that we will be using quite often is a ''sequence space'' &lt;math&gt;l^p&lt;/math&gt;, the set of sequences &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; such that
:For &lt;math&gt;1 \le p &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sum_1^{\infty} |x_j|^p &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
:For &lt;math&gt;p = \infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded sequence.

In particular, a subspace of &lt;math&gt;l^p&lt;/math&gt; is said to have ''dimension'' ''n'' if in every sequence the terms after ''n''th are all zero, and if &lt;math&gt;n &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, then the subspace is said to be an ''Euclidean space''.

An ''open ball'' centered at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\{ z : \| z - a \| &lt; r \}&lt;/math&gt;. An ''open set'' is then the union of open balls.

Continuity and convergence has close and reveling connection.

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be a seminormed space and &lt;math&gt;f: \Omega \to L&lt;/math&gt;. The following are equivalent:''
* (a) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.
* (b) Let &lt;math&gt;x \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in G&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a &lt;math&gt;\omega \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \in \omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(\omega) \subset G&lt;/math&gt;.
* (c) Let &lt;math&gt;x \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(y) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;y \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|y - x|&lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;

Proof: Suppose (c). Since continuity, there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x_j) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;|x_j - x| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;

The following special case is often useful; in particular, showing the sequence's failure to converge.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;x_j \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence that converges to &lt;math&gt;x \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Then a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the sequence &lt;math&gt;f(x_j)&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The function &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The theorem then follows from Theorem 1.4, which says that the composition of continuous functions is again continuous. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; be continuous and suppose &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly to a function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the sequence &lt;math&gt;\|u_j - u\| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;j \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: In short, the theorem holds since
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{y \to x}u(y) = \lim_{y \to x} \lim_{j \to \infty} u_j(y) = \lim_{j \to \infty} \lim_{y \to x} u_j(y) = \lim_{j \to \infty} u_j(x) = u(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
But more rigorously, let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since the convergence is uniform, we find a &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; so that
:&lt;math&gt;\|u_N(x) - u(x)\| \le \|u_N - u\| &lt; \epsilon / 3&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
Also, since &lt;math&gt;u_N&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, we find a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; so that
:&lt;math&gt;\|u_N(y) - u_N(x)\| &lt; \epsilon / 3&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;|y - x| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;
It then follows that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is continuous since:
:&lt;math&gt;\| u(y) - u(x) \| \le \| u(y) - u_N(y) \| + \| u_N(y) - u_N(x) \| + \| u_N(x) - u(x) \| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
whenever &lt;math&gt;|y - x| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''The set of all continuous linear operators from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is complete if and only if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is complete.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; be a Cauchy sequence of continuous linear operators from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. That is, if &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|x\| = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\|u_n(x) - u_m(x)\| = \| (u_n - u_m)(x) \| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n, m \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;u_j(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Since B is complete, let
:&lt;math&gt;u(x) = \lim_{j \to \infty} u_j(x)&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is linear since the limit operator is and also &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is continuous since the sequence of continuous functions converges, if it does, to a continuous function. (FIXME: the converse needs to be shown.) &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

== Metric spaces ==

We say a topological space is ''metric'' or ''metrizable'' if every open set in it is the union of open ''balls''; that is, the set of the form &lt;math&gt;\{ x; d(x, y) &lt; r \}&lt;/math&gt; with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and center &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, called ''metric'', is a real-valued function satisfying the axioms: for all &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = d(y, x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) + d(y, z) \ge d(x, z)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;. ([[w:Identity of indiscernibles|Identity of indiscernibles]])

It follows immediately that &lt;math&gt;|d(x, y) - d(z, y)| \le d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is never negative. While it is clear that every subset of a metric space is again a metric space with the metric restricted to the set, the converse is not necessarily true. For a counterexample, see the next chapter.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;K, d)&lt;/math&gt; be a compact metric space. If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an open cover of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;E \subset K&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\sup_{x, y \in E} d(x, y) &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;E \subset &lt;/math&gt; some member of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; be in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is in some member &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is in the complement of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. If we define a function &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; by for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta(x) = \inf \{ d(x, z); z \in A \in \Gamma, x \ne A \}&lt;/math&gt;,
then
:&lt;math&gt;\delta(x) \le d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;
The theorem thus follows if we show the inf of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is positive. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space. Then every open cover of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; admits a countable subcover if and only if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is separable.'' &lt;br /&gt;
Proof: To show the direct part, fix &lt;math&gt;n = 1, 2, ...&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; be the collection of all open balls of radius &lt;math&gt;{1 \over n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since open balls of radii &lt;math&gt;1, {1 \over 2}, {1 \over 3}, ...&lt;/math&gt;, the centers lying in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, form a countable base for &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, each member of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the union of some subsets of countably many open sets &lt;math&gt;B_1, B_2, ...&lt;/math&gt;. Since we may suppose that for each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; is contained in some &lt;math&gt;G_n \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; (if not remove it from the sequence) the sequence &lt;math&gt;G_1, ...&lt;/math&gt; is a countable subcover of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space. Then the following are equivalent:''
* ''(i) &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact.''
* ''(ii) Every sequence of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; admits a convergent subsequence.'' (sequentially compact)
* ''(iii) Every countable open cover of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; admits a finite subcover.'' (countably compact)
Proof (from [http://www.mathreference.com/top-cs,count.html]): Throughout the proof we may suppose that &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is infinite. Lemma 1.somthing says that every sequence of a infinite compact set has a limit point. Thus, the first countability shows (i) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (ii). Supposing that (iii) is false, let &lt;math&gt;G_1, G_2, ...&lt;/math&gt; be an open cover of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that for each &lt;math&gt;n = 1, 2, ...&lt;/math&gt; we can find a point &lt;math&gt;x_n \in (\cup_1^n G_j)^c = \cap_1^n {G_j}^c&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; does not have a convergent subsequence, proving (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iii). Indeed, suppose it does. Then the sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; has a limit point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;p \in \cap_1^\infty {G_j}^c&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction. To show (iii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (i), in view of the preceding lemma, it suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is separable. But this follows since if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is not separable, we can find a countable discrete subset of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, violating (iii). &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Remark: The proof for (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iii) does not use the fact that the space is metric.

'''2 Theorem''' ''A subset &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; of a metric space is precompact (i.e., its completion is compact) if and only if there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the union of finitely many open balls of radius &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; with the centers lying in E.''&lt;br /&gt;

Thus, the notion of relatively compactness and precompactness coincides for complete metric spaces.

Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;E \subset X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in &lt;/math&gt; the closure of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

== Measure ==

[[Image:Cantor.png|200px|right|Cantor set]]

A ''measure'', which we shall denote by &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; throughout this section, is a function from a delta-ring &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; to the set of nonnegative real numbers and &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is countably additive; i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mu (\coprod_1^\infty E_j) = \sum_1^{\infty} \mu (E_j)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt; distinct. We shall define an integral in terms of a measure.

'''4.1 Theorem''' ''A measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; has the following properties: given measurable sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A \subset B&lt;/math&gt;,''
* (1) &lt;math&gt;\mu (B \backslash A) = \mu (B) - \mu (A)&lt;/math&gt;.
* (2) &lt;math&gt;\mu (\varnothing) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* (3) &lt;math&gt;\mu (A) \le \mu (B)&lt;/math&gt; where the equality holds for &lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;. (monotonicity)
Proof: (1) &lt;math&gt;\mu (B) - \mu (A) = \mu (B \backslash A \cup  A) - \mu (A) = \mu (B \backslash A) + \mu (A) - \mu (A)&lt;/math&gt;. (2) &lt;math&gt;\mu (\varnothing) = \mu (A \backslash A) = \mu (A) - \mu (A). (3) \mu (B) - \mu (A) = \mu (B \backslash A) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; since measures are always nonnegative. Also, &lt;math&gt;\mu (B) - \mu (A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt; since (2).

One example would be a ''counting measure''; i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mu E&lt;/math&gt; = the number of elements in a finite set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, every finite set is measurable since the countable union and countable intersection of finite sets is again finite. To give another example, let &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be fixed, and &lt;math&gt;\mu(E) = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and 0 otherwise. The measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is indeed countably additive since for the sequence &lt;math&gt;{E_j}&lt;/math&gt; arbitrary, &lt;math&gt;\mu(\coprod_0^{\infty} E_j) = 1 = \mu(E_j)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \bigcup E_j&lt;/math&gt; and 0 otherwise.

We now study the notion of geometric convexity.

'''2 Lemma'''
:''&lt;math&gt;{x+y \over 2} = a \left( a {x+y \over 2} + (1-a)y \right) + (1-a) \left( ax + (1-a){x+y \over 2} \right)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt;''.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be a convex subset of a vector space. If &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; a &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(ax + (1-a)y) \le af(x) + (1-a)f(y)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x, y \in D&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;f({x+y \over 2}) \le {f(x) + f(y) \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;  for &lt;math&gt;x, y \in D&lt;/math&gt;
Proof: From the lemma we have:
:&lt;math&gt;2a(1-a)f({x+y \over 2}) \le a(1-a) (f(x) + f(y))&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be a collection of subsets of a set &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. We say &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''delta-ring'' if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; has the empty set, G and every countable union and countable intersection of members of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. a member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''measurable set'' and G a ''measure space'', by analogy to a topological space and open sets in it.

'''2 Theorem (Hölder's inequality)''' ''For &lt;math&gt;1 \le p \le \infty&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;1/p + 1/q = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\int |fg|d\mu \le \left( \int |f|^p d\mu \right)^{1/p} \left( \int |g|^q d\mu \right)^{1/q}&lt;/math&gt;
Proof: By replacing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|g|&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, we may assume that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are non-negative. Let &lt;math&gt;C = \int g^q d\mu&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;C = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the inequality is obvious. Suppose not, and let &lt;math&gt;d\nu = {g^q d\mu \over C}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, since &lt;math&gt;x^p&lt;/math&gt; is increasing and convex for &lt;math&gt;x \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, by Jensen's inequality,
:&lt;math&gt;\int fg d\mu = \int fg^{(1-q)} d\nu C \le \left( \int f^p g^{-q} d\nu \right)^{(1/p)} C&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;1/q = 1 - 1/p&lt;/math&gt;, this is the desired inequality. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''4 Corollary (Minkowski's inequality)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;p \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|_p = \left( \int | \cdot |^p \right)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int \int f(x, y) dx dy &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\| \int f(\cdot, y) dy \|_p \le \int \| f(\cdot, y) \|_p dy&lt;/math&gt;
Proof (from [http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=2987]): If &lt;math&gt;p = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then the inequality is the same as Fubini's theorem. If &lt;math&gt;p &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;,
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\int |\int f(x, y)dy|^p dx &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int |\int f(x, y)dy|^{p-1} \int f(x, z)dz dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|align=right|&lt;small&gt;(Fubini)&lt;/small&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int \int |\int f(x, y)dy|^{p-1} f(x, z)dx dz&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|align=right|&lt;small&gt;(Hölder)&lt;/small&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le \left( \int |\int f(x, y)dy|^{(p-1)q}dx \right)^{1/q} \int \| f(\cdot, z) \|_p dz&lt;/math&gt;
|}
By division we get the desired inequality, noting that &lt;math&gt;(p - 1)q = p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 - {1 \over q} = {1 \over p}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

TODO: We can probably simplify the proof by appealing to Jensen's inequality instead of Hölder's.

Remark: by replacing &lt;math&gt;\int dy&lt;/math&gt; by a counting measure we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\|f+g\|_p \le \|f\|_p + \|g\|_p&lt;/math&gt;
under the same assumption and notation.

'''2 Lemma''' ''For &lt;math&gt;1 \le p \le \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a, b &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;1/p + 1/q = 1&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;a^{1 \over p}b^{1 \over q} = \inf_{t &gt; 0} \left( {1 \over p} t^{-{1 \over q}}a + {1 \over q} t^{1 \over p}b \right)&lt;/math&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;f(t) = {1 \over p} t^{-{1 \over q}}a + {1 \over q} t^{1 \over p}b&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the derivative
:&lt;math&gt;f'(t) = {1 \over pq} \left( t^{-{1 \over p}} a + t^{1 \over q} b \right)&lt;/math&gt;
becomes zero only when &lt;math&gt;t = a/b&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the minimum of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is attained there and is equal to &lt;math&gt;a^{1 \over p}b^{1 \over q}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is taken to 1, the inequality is known as Young's inequality.

'''2 Theorem (Hölder's inequality)''' ''For &lt;math&gt;1 \le p \le \infty&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;1/p + 1/q = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\int |fg| \le \left( \int |f|^p \right)^{1/p} \left( \int |f|^q \right)^{1/q}&lt;/math&gt;
Proof: If &lt;math&gt;p = \infty&lt;/math&gt;, the inequality is clear. By the application of the preceding lemma we have: for any &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int |f|^{1 \over p} |g|^{1 \over q} \le {1 \over p} t^{-{1 \over q}}\int |f| + {1 \over q} t^{1 \over p} \int |g|&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the infimum we see that the right-hand side becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\left( \int |f| \right)^{1/p} \left( \int |g| \right)^{1/q}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The ''convex hull'' in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of a compact set ''K'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;\hat K&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\left \{ z \in \Omega : |f(z)| \le \sup_K|f|\mbox{ for }f\mbox{ analytic in }\Omega \right \}&lt;/math&gt;.
When &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is linear (besides being analytic), we say the &lt;math&gt;\hat K&lt;/math&gt; is ''geometrically convex hull''. That &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact ensures that the definition is meaningful.

'''Theorem''' ''The closure of the convex hull of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the intersection if all half-spaces containing &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let F = the collection of half-spaces containing &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\overline{co}(E) \subset \cap F&lt;/math&gt; since each-half space in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is closed and convex. Yet, if &lt;math&gt;x \not\in \overline{co}(E)&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a half-space &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; which however does not contain x. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\overline{co}(E) = \cap F&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. A function &lt;math&gt;f:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''convex'' if
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_K |f - h| = \sup_{\mbox{b}K} | f - h |&lt;/math&gt;.
for some &lt;math&gt;K \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt; compact and any &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; harmonic on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and continuous on &lt;math&gt;\overline{K}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem''' ''The following are equivalent:
*(a) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex on some &lt;math&gt;K \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; compact.
*(b) if &lt;math&gt;[a, b] \subset K&lt;/math&gt;, then
*:&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda a + (1 - \lambda) b) \le \lambda f(a) + (1 - \lambda) f(b)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;.
*(c) The difference quotient
*:&lt;math&gt;{f(x + h) - f(x) \over h}&lt;/math&gt; increases as &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; does.
*(d) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is measurable and we have:
*:&lt;math&gt;f \left( {a + b \over 2} \right) \le {a + b \over 2}&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;[a, b] \subset K&lt;/math&gt;.
*(e) The set &lt;math&gt;\{ (x, y) : x \in [a, b], f(x) \le y \}&lt;/math&gt; is convex for &lt;math&gt;[a, b] \subset K&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof: Suppose (a). For each &lt;math&gt;x \in [a, b]&lt;/math&gt;, there exists some &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x = \lambda a + (1 - \lambda) b&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;A(x) = A(\lambda a + (1-\lambda) b) = \lambda f(a) + (1-\lambda) f(b)&lt;/math&gt;, and then since &lt;math&gt;\mbox{b}[a, b] = \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(f - A)(a) = 0 = (f - A)(b)&lt;/math&gt;,
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|f(x)| = |f(x) - A(x) + A(x)|&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le \sup \{|f(a) - A(a)|, |f(b) - A(b)|\} + A(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lambda f(a) + (1-\lambda) f(b)&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Thus, (a) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (b). Now suppose (b). Since &lt;math&gt;\lambda = {x - a \over b - a}&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, (b) says:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(b - x)f(x) + (x - a)f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le (b -x)f(a) + (x - a)f(b)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;{f(a) - f(x) \over a - x}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le {f(b) - f(x) \over b - x}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Since &lt;math&gt;a - x &lt; b - x&lt;/math&gt;, we conclude (b) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (c). Suppose (c). The continuity follows since we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h &gt; 0, h \to 0}f(x + h) = f(x) + \lim_{h &gt; 0, h \to 0}h{f(x + h) - f(x) \over h}&lt;/math&gt;.
Also, let &lt;math&gt;x = 2^{-1}(a + b)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;a, b \in K&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;{f(a) - f(x) \over a - x}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le {f(b) - f(x) \over b - x}&lt;/math&gt;

|&lt;math&gt;f(x) - f(a)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le f(b) - f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f \left( {a + b \over 2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le {f(a) + f(b) \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Thus, (c) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (d). Now suppose (d), and let &lt;math&gt;E = \{ (x, y) : x \in [a, b], y \ge f(x) \}&lt;/math&gt;. First we want to show
:&lt;math&gt;f\left({1 \over 2^n} \sum_1^{2^n} x_j \right) \le {1 \over 2^n} \sum_1^{2^n} f(x_j)&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the inequality holds trivially.
if the inequality holds for some &lt;math&gt;n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, then
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f \left( {1 \over 2^n} \sum_1^{2^n} x_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2 \in [a, b]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;. There exists a sequence of rationals number such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{j \to \infty} {p_j \over 2q_j} = \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
It then follows that:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda) x_2)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le \lim_{j \to \infty} {p_j \over 2q_j} f(x_1) + \left( 1 - {p_j \over 2q_j} \right) f(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;

|
|&lt;math&gt;\le \lambda y_1 + (1 - \lambda) y_2&lt;/math&gt;.
|}
Thus, (d) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (e). Finally, suppose (e); that is, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is convex. Also suppose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is an interval for a moment. Then
:&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda a + (1 - \lambda) b) \le \lambda f(a) + (1 - \lambda) f(b)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Proof: If some &lt;math&gt;a_j = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the inequality holds trivially; so, suppose &lt;math&gt;a_j &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; is convex since its second derivative, again &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;&gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. It thus follows:

The convex hull of a finite set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a ''convex polyhedron''. Clearly, the set of the extremely points is the subset of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{co}(K)&lt;/math&gt; is compact. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Example: Let &lt;math&gt;p(z) = (z - s_1)(z - s_2) ... (z - s_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the derivative of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; has zeros in &lt;math&gt;\mbox{co}(\{s_1, s_2, ... s_n\})&lt;/math&gt;.

# Show the following are equivalent with assuming that &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is second countable.
#* (1) &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact.
#* (2) Every countable open cover of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; admits a finite subcover (countably compact)
#* (3) &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is sequentially compact.

Nets are, so to speak, generalized sequences.

# Show the following are equivalent with assuming Axiom of Choice:
#* (1) &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact; i.e, every open cover admits a finite subcover.
#* (2) In &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; every net has a convergent subnet.
#* (3) In &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; every ultrafilter has an accumulation point (Bourbaki compact)
#* (4) There is a subbase &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that every open cover that is a subcollection of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; admits a finite subcover. (subbase compact)
#* (5) Every nest of non-empty closed sets has a non-empty intersection (linearly compact) (Hint: use the contrapositive of this instead)
#* (6) Every infinite subset of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has a complete accumulation point (Alexandroff-Urysohn compact)

__NOTOC__
== Ingredients ==
*1 2⁄3 cup [[Cookbook:Falafel|falafel mix]]
*1 1/4 cup water
* 1 head red leaf lettuce
* 3 tomatoes
* 1 cucumber
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Tahini Yogurt Sauce|Tahini Yogurt Sauce]]

== Procedures == 
=== Prepare Falafel ===
* In a large bowl, add water to falafel mix and stir well. 
* Let stand 15 minutes to absorb the water. 
* Form mix into 3/4 inch balls.

==== Baked! ====
Baked is delicious and healthy.
* Place balls into mini-cupcake tins or onto a cookie sheet. 
* Bake in oven at 375 for 12 minutes.

==== Fried! ====
For a more traditional falafel ball, 
* Heat about 1⁄2-inch vegetable oil to 375°F. 
* Fry balls until brown and crisp (about 3 minutes). 
* Drain and set aside.

=== Prepare Veggies ===
* Clean and chop lettuce.
* Quarter the tomatoes. Chop again until large bite size.
* Peel and slice cucumber.

Toss vegetables with falafels and douse with tahini yogurt sauce. Falafel may be cold or hot for a delicious salad straight outta the PNW.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
Thanks to dry falafel mix and the nature of simple salads, this recipe is pretty fast and easy. Look in the bulk bins at your local hippie grocery store for dry falafel mix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Aesop's Fables - verse version by Babrius==

I've got a website full of Aesop's Fables.

Which one do we choose?

I'm thinking ''The Tortoise and the Hare'' or ''The Boy Who Cried Wolf''.

There is a Perry translation alongside so think about this as we pick and choose.

--[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 07:36, 10 April 2006 (UTC).

:Would be good as an example for Ancient Greek. [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 02:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== Phonetics of the Greek Letters  ==

In both the &quot;Words I can learn&quot; and the song/story sections of this it doesn't have the phonetic pronunciations. I, as a person without any backround in Greek (like the people who would be reading this), have little clue how to pronounce the greek words nor how to say the fable. Prehapes a phonetic pronunciations should be given.
[[User:N1person|N1person]] 14:01, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

== Unsuitable text ==

The &quot;simple story&quot; is totally out of place and also misleading because it is written in a language that is completely antiquated. It differs from today's Greek more than Shakespearean English differs from today's English. See the Wikipedia article on [[w:Katharevousa]] for details.
I replaced this text with a children's song. [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 01:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

* sort [[:Category:Confection recipes]] into [[:Cookbook:Candy recipes]] or other appropriate cats

==History of the Anthem==
Originally written in German, the Swiss Psalm has been translated into all the official Swiss languages. The Swiss government has written a [http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/schweiz/psalm/history.html history] of the Swiss anthem, known as the Swiss Psalm.

The often mentioned three-stanza English translation, exemplified below, is closer to the German lyrics arrangement than the French lyrics arrangement. However the versions by all languages are generally similar in spirit throughout with sentences rearranged or restructured within or beyond a stanza for example.

;German 1st Stanza
{{lang|de|
:Trittst im Morgenrot daher,
:Seh' ich dich im Strahlenmeer,
:Dich, du Hocherhabener, Herrlicher!
:Wenn der Alpenfirn sich rötet,
:Betet, freie Schweizer, betet!
:Eure fromme Seele ahnt
:Gott im hehren Vaterland,
:Gott, den Herrn, im hehren Vaterland.}}

;Common English translation of German 1st Stanza
:When the morning skies grow red
:And o'er us their radiance shed,
:Thou, O Lord, appearest in their light.
:When the Alps glow bright with splendour,
:Pray to God, to Him surrender,
:For you feel and understand,
:That He dwelleth in this land.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Being marked up for being a speedy delete==

First of all, the note to be a speedy delete was added by an anonymous user, which IMHO is a form of vandalism.  If they really had an issue here, they should have taken it up on this discussion page and tried to resolve the issue.  Also, Wikibooks is about much more than just textbooks, and this does qualify as an instructional resource.

Writing a book can be a very painstaking process, and new users should not be expected to get everything down 100% to make it have the &quot;appearance&quot; of a book.  Please, if there is a dispute with this book, bring it up here, especially during the initial development period.

I've taken down the VfD and invoked the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] on this content to give you a little bit of breathing room to create this content.  Please take advantage of this time period.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:52, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== International Space Law ==
International Space Law is a set of documents which govern activities in outer space by the governments of the Earth. While nobody actually lives permanently outside of Earth right now, to suggest there are no existing laws governing activities in space is not accurate either. Right now outer space is governed through various international treaties regarding who is responsible for the equipment that goes beyond Earth and what legal rights may be asserted by governments of many nations. Below are some of the major documents of space law and a brief overview of each document:

[[Image:UNOOSA.svg|150px||right|||Logo of UN Office for Outer Space Affairs]]
*[[s:Outer Space Treaty of 1967|Outer Space Treaty]] - Basic governance of extraterrestrial bodies and relinquishment of sovereignty claims by Earth governments.
*[[s:Moon Treaty|Moon Treaty]] -  Follow up treaty to ''Outer Space Treaty'', but has not been ratified by any major space-faring nation except for France.
*[[s:Limited Test Ban Treaty|Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] - Prohibition of nuclear weapons in space and legal consequences of nuclear detonation in space. Also affects technologies like the Orion project and nuclear rockets.
*[[s:Montevideo Convention|Montevideo Convention]] - declaring requirements to be recognized as a &quot;state&quot; by the UN and other nations.
*[[s:The Antarctic Treaty|The Antarctic Treaty]] - The original international treaty for new territories post WWII, and the basis for much of the current space law even if it doesn't explicitly deal with celestial bodies.

=== United States of America ===
In April 02, 2012 the [[w:Competitive Enterprise Institute|Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)]], a non-profit think tank with the purpose of advancing economic liberty and fighting over-regulation by big government released a new study named {{PDFlink|[http://cei.org/sites/default/files/Rand%20Simberg%20-%20Homesteading%20the%20Final%20Frontier.pdf Homesteading the Final Frontier: A Practical Proposal for Securing Property Rights in Space]}} by Adjunct Scholar Rand Simberg. In it they argue that the U.S.A. should recognize transferable off-planet land claims. Arguing that the 1967 Outer Space Treaty only clearly prohibits declarations of national sovereignty, and noting that the U.S.A. is not a signatory of the 1979 Moon Treaty, which does outlaw private property claims in space. That a legal regime for real estate on the Moon, planets and asteroids could usher in a new era of space exploration at little or no cost to the U.S.A. government. But without off-planet property rights, investors have little incentive to fund space transportation or development.

{{NOTE|The issue of property rights in space, that undoubtedly would bring economic progress, is mostly irrelevant if done in a isolated fashion without a broader international agreement. Without it the only recourse would be the militarization of space, since if other nations do not recognize those property rights they would be required to assure the defense for those claims, be it by private or national means.}}

[[Image:Mars animated sim.gif|150px||left|||]] 
[[Image:Mars Hubble.jpg|130px||right|||Mars seen by the Hubble Space Telescope, Realistic Colors]]
Mars is a frequent topic of discussion regarding colonization possibilities. A project for the colonization of Mars provides an opportunity to examine how we live here on Earth and what aspects of our own planet and its effects on our lives we value and would wish to re-create on Mars. The Mars Project also provides a case-study for further planetary colonization.

Mars overall surface area is similar to the dry land surface Earth, it has large [[w:water|water]] reserves, and has [[w:carbon|carbon]] (locked as [[w:carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere). It may have gone through similar [[geology|geological]] and hydrological processes as Earth and contain valuable [[w:mineral|mineral]] [[w:ores|ores]], but this is debated.

Mars's atmosphere is very thin (averaging 800 Pa or about 0.8% of Earth sea-level atmospheric pressure) and the [[w:climate|climate]] is colder. Its gravity is only around a third that of Earth. Mars is often the topic of discussion regarding [[w:terraforming|terraforming]] to make the entire planet or at least large portions of it habitable.

As of 2011, according to the [http://journalofcosmology.com/Contents12.html Journal of Cosmology], an interplanetary trip to Mars from Earth, could take as little as 10 months, and it would be possible for a privately-funded one-way mission to Mars to depart as soon as 20 years from now. But returning would be virtually impossible (due to payload and energy restrictions).
{{clear}}
In regards to volunteers, in 2011 a special edition of the [http://journalofcosmology.com/Contents12.html Journal of Cosmology], detailing and promoting a privately-funded one-way mission to Mars prompted more than 400 readers to volunteer as colonists. This leads to the conclusion that there are people willing to take on the risk, but it also creates the need to select those that should and are more capable of being successful.

Solar energy would be a problem in mars, there is not only night time to consider but a large amount of dust.

There is an ongoing debate on this topic on the [http://www.marshome.org/mailman/listinfo/mars-civ Mars Civil-Cultural mailing list]. One way that this topic can be explored is to look at the lessons learned from science fiction.

{{TODO| Transwiki of [[Wikipedia:Colonization of Mars]]}}

{{TODO| Mine [[Wikipedia:Exploration of Mars]]}}

=== Life and fossils ===
There is increasing evidences that point to the, at least ancient, presence of life on Mars, this has created a strong scientific interest in colonizing Mars. A study from 2011 from NASA indicates that if life existed on at some point in Mars history, the best chances for it to have survived (or at least to have persisted longer) would have been below the surface. This hypothesis is based in geological studies performed by probes from NASA and the European Space Agency in more than 350 sites, along with what is known of mars today.

=== Water ===
Water is one of the most important substances for life as we know it. In the last three decades upon reviewing images of the surface of Mars taken by the [[w:Viking program|Viking orbiters]] in the 70s, scientists became puzzled by the apparent sloping of rocky material around mountains and cliffs, these deposits, referred to as [[w:Lobate debris apron|lobate debris apron]], seems to extend sometimes for tens of miles. The debate around those formations generated the theory that they may have been formed by the lubrication of the rocky debris by a thin layer of ice, since similar features can be observed on Earth, for instance in [[w:Antarctica|Antarctica]]. 

A new indication that water seems to exist on the planet came from data collected by the [[w:SHARAD|Shallow Subsurface Radar (SHARAD) instrument]] aboard the [[w:Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter|Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter probe]], lunched in August 12, 2005 and operating at destination from 2006 onward. The radar results are consistent with massive deposits of water in middle latitudes, providing further support for the debris covered glacier hypothesis.

Equipment is available to extract [[w:in situ|in situ]] resources (water, air, etc.) from the Martian ground and atmosphere.

=== Agriculture ===
Martian soil contains several nutrients required to support to plant life. With fertilizer and environmental control, it could be used to grow plants.

=== Artifacts and equipment already available ===
There are several artifacts left on the surface of Mars from previous exploration and still working equipment, like monitoring satellites.

== Colonies on the Moon ==
[[Image:Jurvetson - Navigation (by).jpg|250px||center|||]] 
The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, it is also known as Luna in Latin and other languages. Due to its proximity and relative familiarity, Earth's [[w:Moon|Moon]] is also frequently discussed as a target for colonization.

A colony on Luna has several important advantages over a colony on any other [[w:Astronomical object|celestial body]] outside Earth.
One big advantage is that it is close proximity to Earth. It would be comparatively easy to supply any colonization process, place and evacuate colonists, and use radio signals for reprogramming and remote control of robots and other devices on the Moon's surface. Another advantage is the low gravity, allowing for easier exchange of goods and services. But the topmost advantage is that we already have been there.

Astronaut [[w:Neil Armstrong|Neil A. Armstrong]], commander, took this photograph with a 70mm lunar surface camera. While astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin descended in the Lunar Module (LM) &quot;Eagle&quot; to explore the Sea of Tranquility region of the Moon, astronaut Michael Collins, command module pilot, remained with the Command and Service Modules (CSM) &quot;Columbia&quot; in lunar orbit.]]
Solar energy on the moon is a possibility by  the moon has two week nights and similar to Mars dust will constitute a problem, not atmospheric dust but the surface [[w:regolith|regolith]] is an extreme problem, making nuclear power more attractive.

A major drawback of the Moon is its low abundance of [[w:volatile|volatile]]s necessary for life such as [[w:hydrogen|hydrogen]] and [[w:carbon|carbon]]. Water ice deposits was found in relative abundance, especially in some polar craters, that could serve as significant sources for these elements. 

India's first unmanned lunar probe, launched in	22 October 2008, [[w:Chandrayaan-1|Chandrayaan-1]] intended to last for 2 years in a compressive mapping of moon resources has generated data that leads NASA's scientists to estimate the existence of 600 million metric tons of water ice in craters around the Moon's north pole.

The existence of numerous craters near the poles of the Moon that have interiors that are in permanent sun shadow, makes them capable of maintaining very low temperatures. Without the effects from the Sun's radiation water can be indefinitely kept as ice. If this estimation is verified, mining this resource, could serve as a source of life support for future lunar bases as water and oxygen or as propellant for future spacecraft if converted to methane, dramatically reducing the cost of space exploration. NASA in April 2012 contracted [[w:Astrobotic Technology|Astrobotic Technology Inc.]] to determine whether its polar rover can deploy an ice-prospecting payload to the Moon, aiming for such verification.

There are also several magma caves that would facilitate the creation of protected habitats.

== Mercury ==
There is a suggestion that Mercury could be colonized using the same technology, approach and equipment that is used in colonization of the Moon.

{{TODO|Transwiki [[Wikipedia:Colonization of Mercury]]}}

== Venus ==
While the surface of [[Venus]] is far too hot and features [[w:atmospheric pressure|atmospheric pressure]] at least 90 times that at [[w:sea level|sea level]] on Earth, its massive atmosphere offers an alternate location for colonization. At a height of approximately 50 km, the pressure is reduced to a few atmospheres, and the temperature would be between 40-100° C, depending on the height. This part of the atmosphere is probably within dense clouds which contain some sulphuric acid. Even these have a certain benefit to colonization, as they present a possible source for the extraction of water. Thus, the most likely colony on Venus would be a [[w:floating city|floating city]] in the clouds that stays above 50 km above the surface.

This was the origninal text as an introduction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Brewing is the making of beer. Grain (most commonly barley) is allowed to sprout.  Enzymes are produced within the grain which can convert starch into sugars. The sprouting is stopped by heating the grain (a process known as malting). Malted grain can be stored until needed. When the brewing process takes place, the malted grain is cracked or milled to allow access to the starchy interior and then soaked in warm water. The enzymes then turn the starch into sugar, and the resultant thin sweet liquid (known as wort) is drained off the spent grain. The wort is then boiled, usually with the addition of plant-based flavour modifiers. Boiling has the effect of sanitising the wort, and concentrating the sugars present because the volume is reduced as water is evaporated off. After cooling the wort, yeast is added and fermentation takes place: the yeast converts sugars to alcohol and carbon dioxide. The result is an alcoholic drink generically known as beer. Many subtleties and variations on the brewing process exist.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I am planning on changing the text into a more 'introduction' style of text and drawing the reader in.

How would people feel about expanding this book to include home production of other fermented beverages such as wine, mead, and cider?

== Re: Expanding to wine, mead, or cider ==

Wine mead and cider differ from beer in several aspects. I wouldn't think integrating their production with the beer making text would be useful, but seperate sections might be a good idea. Also, the production of these other beverages is not refered to as &quot;brewing,&quot; so I don't think that this wikibook is obliged to discuss them based on the title. However, mentioning the basic processes couldn't hurt much, but each of them deserve their own book, IMHO.

== Forwards ==

I've added a pair of forwards; to the student and to the instructor, with the hope of encouraging this book in the direction of becoming more of a text book than it currently is. I was trying to provide some guidance that a person wishing to learn how to brew (or teach) could follow through the book and become enamored with the process without reorganizing the book. I think it's important for a new brewer to start with an extract beer first, due to the smaller amount of initial investment required and also to the shorter period of time and in depth knowledge required to get that first batch consumed. This is probably due to the way I learned to brew myself; learning from my oldest brother who is still an extract only brewer and then later from reading books such as the Joy of Home Brewing whose organization begins with extract only, extract with grain adjuncts, and then finally with all-grain. While Mr. Papazian's books remain treasured parts of my library, I can't help but hate finding parts of the same material in three seperate parts of the book. I did not have anything to do with the initial organisation of this book, but I feel it can result in a more concise and usable book, provided a decent guide to encourage new comers. Perhaps a wikiversity class on brewing may be in order to fufill the need I see, but I believe that a simple guide would be sufficient while a class would better accomplish such goals live and in person. But I've digressed a bit...

So, I shall now state a goal for myself and any other author, with regard to this book; to write in a manner encouraging to potential brewers while still providing a complete work. Uh, that's kind of vague, but it's the best I have right now. Maybe I'll try again later.....

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A==

* '''adjuncts''' Sources of fermentable sugar other than barley. In extract brewing, any grain added is sometimes referred to as &quot;adjunct&quot;. Some brewers refer to coloured malts as adjuncts.
* '''ale''' A style of beer that uses top fermenting yeast.
* '''alpha acid''' An insoluble resin found in hops that provides the bitter characteristic of beer. The alpha acids are converted to more soluble ''iso'' alpha acids during the wort boiling in the brewhouse stage of the process.
* '''amylase''' The enzyme produced in the barley during malting that is needed for the conversion of the malt starches in the mash to malt sugars.
* '''amylose''' The technical term for large straight starch chains of glucose molecules.
* '''amylopectin''' branched starch molecules.

==B==

* '''back''' a brewhouse vessel, for example under-back or hop-back.
* '''brewing''' Brewing is a generic term used to describe the entire beer production process, however it is technically correct only to refer to the time from beginning the boil until pitching yeast as brewing.
* '''beta acid''' An bitter insoluble resin present in hops that is not considered to add noticeable bitterness.


==D==

* '''dunkel''' German word for dark.


==E==

* '''enzyme''' a biological catalyst that helps a chemical reaction to take place. An enzyme is a special type of protein and in brewing the enzymes are provided by the malt.
* '''ester''' a flavour compound produced by the yeast during fermentation that results in a beer with a fruity flavour. Esters are promoted by higher fermentation temperatures and lower pitching rates. Examples of esters are: ethyl hexanoate (red apple flavour), iso-amyl acetate (banana flavour - sought after in a Bavarian weizen) ethyl acetate (solvent flavour - an unwanted ester).
* '''extract''' the sugars (and to a lesser extent amino acids) recovered from the mash. There are various measures of extract, the most popular are degrees Plato (°P) or specific gravity (S.G.)

==F==

* '''fermentation''' The process in which yeast converts fermentable sugars to alcohol, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and flavouring compounds.
* '''fermentable sugars''' The most common fermentable sugars in an all malt wort are glucose, maltose and maltotriose. Other commonly occurring fermentable sugars are sucrose and fructose.

==G==

* '''grist''' Milled grain from which fermentable starches are obtained; usually barley malt and sometimes adjuncts.
* '''gyle''' Unfermented wort set aside to provide sugars to be used in natural carbonation by krausening.

==H==

* '''hops''' Flower buds of the hop plant used to bitter beer and provide flavor and aroma characteristics.

==I==

* '''IPA''' or '''India Pale Ale''' A style of ale beer that originated from the liberal use of hops as a preservative in English beer destined for the India colony.

==K==

* '''krauesen''' (noun) A layer of foam and dead yeast that forms on the surface of the fermenting beer during the primary fermentation stage.
* '''krauesen''' (verb) A method by which unfermented gyle is added to fermented beer, originating from the same initial wort, to prime natural carbonation.

==L==

* '''lager''' (noun) A style of beer that is produced using lower fermentaion temperatures and a special bottom fermenting yeast.
* '''lager''' (verb) A method of conditioning beer by storing carbonated beer at near freezing temperatures.
* '''lautering''' The process by which spent grist and/or hops are removed from wort.
* '''lauter tun''' A vessel for producing clear wort from the mash. The slotted false bottom holds back the husk material which acts as filter material to produce clear wort.

==M==

* '''malt''' Grain that has be allowed to germinate, and then dried.
* '''mash''' A process by which fermentable sugars, starches, and other flavor characteristics are extracted from malted grains.
* '''mash tun''' a vessel for the mixing of the malt grist and mashing liquor, and for the conversion of the malt starch to malt sugars. In the traditional British mash tun (or a two vessel brewhouse), the vessel is also used for wort separation.

==P==

* '''pitch''' A term used to describe the indroduction of yeast to fermentable wort.

==S==

* '''sparge''' A hot water rinse of grist (mash) to remove additional extract during the lautering process.
* '''steep''' the immersion in water - barley is steeped before germination to increase the water content in the grain to get the germination process started.

==T==
* '''tun''' a brewhouse vessel, for example Mash tun, Lauter tun

==U==

* '''ullage''' The space between the surface of a contained liquid and the top of the container.
* '''under-back''' A vessel between the lauter tun and the wort kettle used to hold the wort until the wort kettle is available. Normally only found in commercial breweries where multiple brews are produced per day.

==W==

* '''wort''' (pronounced &quot;wert&quot;) The product of the brewhouse process - a liquid rich in fermentable barley sugars with the hop bitterness components and nitrogen for yeast growth. The growth medium for the yeast.

==Y==

* '''yeast''' Microorganisms that are applied to the task of converting sugars to alcohol, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and flavouring compounds.

==Z==

* '''zymurgy''' The science of using yeast for fermentation. Also a magazine published by the American Homebrewers Association.

==Input==
For example: a computer disk can have a lot of information on it, and the user selects a particular disk for the task in hand. Then the user activates an '''input''' procedure to have the computer move a copy of the given required information from the disk, where the original remains, into a part of the computer's memory for further use. The original on the disk can, if desired, be deleted.


==Output==
For example: Some work has been done using a computer, and now the result is to be moved from the computer onto a disk, which is one of many possible '''output''' devices. Usually the computer's screen, which is also an '''output''' device, shows exactly what is being done by the user so as to ensure the information concerned ends up at the correct place, '''outside''' of the computer. Often a printer is used, which is another '''output''' device.

=KML Introduction=
(most content here is directly quoted from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language KML wikipedia article])

'''KML''' ('''K'''eyhole '''M'''arkup '''L'''anguage) is an XML-based Markup language for managing the display of three-dimensional geospatial data in the programs Google Earth, Google Maps, Google Mobile, ArcGIS Explorer and World Wind. (The word ''Keyhole'' is an earlier name for the software that became Google Earth; the software was produced in turn by Keyhole, Inc, which was acquired by Google in 2004. The term &quot;Keyhole&quot; actually honors the KH-11|KH reconnaissance satellites, the original eye-in-the-sky military reconnaissance system now some 30 years old.)

The KML file specifies a set of features (placemarks, images, polygons, 3D models, textual descriptions, etc.) for display in Google Earth, Maps and Mobile. Each place always has a longitude and a latitude. Other data can make the view more specific, such as tilt, heading, altitude, which together define a &quot;camera view&quot;. KML shares some of the same structural grammar as Geography Markup Language|GML[http://geoweb.blog.com/313918/]. Some KML information cannot be viewed in Google Maps or Mobile [http://maps.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=41136&amp;topic=1475].

KML files are very often distributed as '''KMZ''' files, which are Data compression|zipped KML files with a .kmz extension. When a KMZ file is unzipped, a single &quot;doc.kml&quot; is found along with any overlay and icon images  referenced in the KML.

Example KML document:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;kml xmlns=&quot;http://earth.google.com/kml/2.0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;Placemark&gt;
   &lt;description&gt;New York City&lt;/description&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;New York City&lt;/name&gt;
   &lt;Point&gt;
     &lt;coordinates&gt;-74.006393,40.714172,0&lt;/coordinates&gt;
   &lt;/Point&gt;
 &lt;/Placemark&gt;
 &lt;/kml&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The MIME type associated to KML is ''application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml''.&lt;br /&gt;
The MIME type associated to KMZ is ''application/vnd.google-earth.kmz'' .

=Basic KML Document Types=
For an XML document to recognize KML specific tags you must declare the KML namespace (listed below).

&lt;kml xmlns=&quot;http://earth.google.com/kml/2.0&quot;&gt;

You will see this declaration in all the example files listed.

In order to see use the examples provided in this chapter you will need to copy and paste the text into any text editor.  Next you will save the file as a .kml.  This can be done by choosing &quot;save as&quot; and naming the file with a .kml extension (You might have to surround the name in quotes ie &quot;test.kml&quot;).
==Placemarks==
Placemarks simply make a clickable pinpoint inside Google Earth at an exact location based on coordinates.  This can be useful for marking a point of interest or a beginning and ending destination to a trip.

The example KML document in the introduction uses the Placemark tag.  If you want to move the placemark to a different location all you would change are the coordinates.

==Paths==
Paths are a series of connected coordinates that can be edited with line styles for a more bold appearance inside Google Earth.  The height and color can be adjusted for a more exaggerated appearance and better clarity.

The following example is a path from Atlanta, Georgia to Nashville, Tennessee.  The code may look a bit complicated but it is mostly just styling/formatting tags with the 4 actual coordinates at near the end.  So if you wanted to use the same style wall but just make a different path, all you would do is change the coordinates.


&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;kml xmlns=&quot;http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1&quot;&gt;

  &lt;Document&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Paths&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Path from Atlanta to Nashville&lt;/description&gt;

    &lt;Style id=&quot;yellowLineGreenPoly&quot;&gt;
      &lt;LineStyle&gt;
        &lt;color&gt;7f00ffff&lt;/color&gt;
        &lt;width&gt;4&lt;/width&gt;
      &lt;/LineStyle&gt;
      &lt;PolyStyle&gt;
        &lt;color&gt;7f00ff00&lt;/color&gt;
      &lt;/PolyStyle&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;

    &lt;Placemark&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Atlanta to Nashville&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;Wall structured path&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;styleUrl&gt;#yellowLineGreenPoly&lt;/styleUrl&gt;
      &lt;LineString&gt;
        &lt;extrude&gt;1&lt;/extrude&gt;
        &lt;tessellate&gt;1&lt;/tessellate&gt;
        &lt;altitudeMode&gt;absolute&lt;/altitudeMode&gt;
        &lt;coordinates&gt;
 		-84.40204442007513,33.75488573910702,83269
 		-84.37837132006098,33.82567285375923,83269
 		-84.79700041857893,35.30711817667424,83269
 		-86.79210094043326,36.15389499208452,83269 
        &lt;/coordinates&gt;
      &lt;/LineString&gt;

    &lt;/Placemark&gt;
  &lt;/Document&gt;
&lt;/kml&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Overlays==
Overlays are graphics that can be placed over an area in Google Earth marked by coordinates.  These graphics can show how an area looked at a different point in time or during a special event (like a volcanic eruption).

This overlay example comes from Google's KML samples webpage and shows what Mt. Etna looked like during an actual eruption.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;kml xmlns=&quot;http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Folder&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Ground Overlays&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Examples of ground overlays&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;GroundOverlay&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Large-scale overlay on terrain&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;Overlay shows Mount Etna erupting 
          on July 13th, 2001.&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;Icon&gt;
        &lt;href&gt;http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/etna.jpg&lt;/href&gt;
      &lt;/Icon&gt;
      &lt;LatLonBox&gt;
        &lt;north&gt;37.91904192681665&lt;/north&gt;
        &lt;south&gt;37.46543388598137&lt;/south&gt;
        &lt;east&gt;15.35832653742206&lt;/east&gt;
        &lt;west&gt;14.60128369746704&lt;/west&gt;
        &lt;rotation&gt;-0.1556640799496235&lt;/rotation&gt;
      &lt;/LatLonBox&gt;
    &lt;/GroundOverlay&gt;
  &lt;/Folder&gt;
&lt;/kml&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can see from the code that it takes the image etna.jpg and places it over the coordinates listed.

==Polygons==
Polygons are a neat feature of Google Earth that allow 3-D shapes to be molded anywhere in Google Earth.  These shapes can be useful for making neat presentations or just showing the world a structure actually looks.

This example is a polygon of Turner Field (The Atlanta Braves' home stadium) in Georgia.  There is no styling on the polygon to keep the code simple.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;kml xmlns=&quot;http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1&quot;&gt;

  &lt;Placemark&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Turner Field&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;Polygon&gt;
      &lt;extrude&gt;1&lt;/extrude&gt;
      &lt;altitudeMode&gt;relativeToGround&lt;/altitudeMode&gt;
      &lt;outerBoundaryIs&gt;
        &lt;LinearRing&gt;
          &lt;coordinates&gt;
                -84.39024224888713,33.73459764262901,28
 		-84.38961532726215,33.73451197628319,28
 		-84.38830478530726,33.7350571795205,28
 		-84.38811742696677,33.73579651137399,28
 		-84.38856034410841,33.73618350237595,28
 		-84.38930790023139,33.73647497375488,28
 		-84.38997872537549,33.73655338302832,28
 		-84.39051294303495,33.73605785090994,28
 		-84.39056804786146,33.73528763589146,28
 		-84.39024224888713,33.73459764262901,28
	 &lt;/coordinates&gt;

        &lt;/LinearRing&gt;
      &lt;/outerBoundaryIs&gt;      
    &lt;/Polygon&gt;
  &lt;/Placemark&gt;
&lt;/kml&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can see from the code, the polygon's 3-D shape is made up from the latitude and longitude coordinates with the height being determined by the 3rd column value inside the coordinates tag (28 in this case).

=Google Earth=
Google Earth is the name of Google's free software that is responsible for handling these KML documents.  It is a virtual world created by a collage of satellite images where a user can manipulate the Earth in any way to see its landscapes, oceans, and cities.

You can find more information and download the software [http://earth.google.com here.]

==Basic Interface Navigation==
The user interface is fairly straight forward and is extremely easy for computer illiterate users to just jump right in and start exploring.  You can completely ignore the toolbars and buttons if you want and just click and grab on the Earth to shake, spin, or roll it as you please.  To zoom in, simply right-click and pull down or up depending on the speed which you prefer to &quot;fall&quot; toward the surface.

If you would like help finding a location you can type in the location (in the form of City, State) in the &quot;Fly to..&quot; search box.  Google Earth will then spin around and zoom in to the location entered.  If you want to take a virtual vacation, Google has some preset locations saved in the window below &quot;Fly to...&quot; labeled &quot;Sightseeing.&quot;  Simply click on one of these locations and be taken to the location where pictures, articles, and comments can be all be viewed.
==Points of Interest==
Points of interest that Google has already marked for users are marked with different color dots and icons.  These can be clicked on for a variety of information ranging from a simple comment, to a panoramic photograph of that exact location.  Advanced users, interested in the code make-up of such a feature, can right click on any of Google's marks and choose &quot;Copy.&quot;  This will copy all the code for that feature where you can just paste it into a text document to see all of the tags and references.

===Setting up an ActionScript application===
To get started coding in ActionScript 2.0 (or AS 2.0 for short which is how I will be referring to it from now on), start up the Flash MX 2004 or later program.  Then create a New Flash Document.  When your new Document comes up, go to where the Timeline is and click the first frame of Layer 1.  Now open up the Actions panel by either clicking on the Actions pane on the bottom of the screen or going to the File menu and clicking '''Window&gt;Development Panels&gt;Actions'''.  Anything you type in here will be run first when you run or test the Flash movie.  Now let’s create a simple program.

Put this code into the Actions panel:
&lt;source lang=&quot;actionscript&quot;&gt;myName = &quot;Robert&quot;
trace(&quot;Hello &quot; + myName);&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cookwork|Merge what's useful here into a main Crepe article}}

==Crepe tips==
Essentially there are a lot of variables in crepe making and over about 10 years of gradual experimentation one learns some of the issues.  Here is my summary and I think it is a lot more useful than the recipe:

===What we're doing===
# Making the thinnest possible pancakes
# You are looking to produce a batter with a particular consistency and elasticity so don't fixate on quantities but learn the way it should look by doing a little experimentation of your own.
## It must flow over the pan quickly and easily to make a thin pancake so it must be very liquid.
## It must be very strong so that it will not break despite being thin.
## It must not stick when it cooks.
## If there are lumps (even small ones) the batter will not flow across the pan nicely.
# It should taste nice

===The Consistency===
# Use strong flour - bread flour is best.  It is very effective to make the mixture the night before and leave it because it tends to get thinner whilst remaining strong - the effect is quite noticeable.
# Sieve the mixture after making it - it's the best way to get rid of lumps.
# Warm the mixture to the point where it does not feel cold to touch.  If the mixture has been in the fridge or you have used cold milk and cold eggs then when it hits the pan it will tend to stick to it and trying to cook it will be a miserable experience.
# The desired consistency is very similar to runny cream. It's hard to get it right and from one day to the next I use different amounts of milk depending on the eggs, etc.  So just start out being a bit conservative and make a couple of crepes and then add a bit more milk and try again.  When you start making crepes that stick, wipe out the pan so it's smooth and oil it. Then mix up some flour with a cup of the now-too-thin mixture and then sieve that back in to thicken the batter.  Next time you'll not push it too far.
# ''Rough guide to quantities:'' I use 5 large eggs to 300g flour and I discard 1 egg yolk.  I add 50g sugar and about 2 tablespoons of rum.  I start off with enough milk to mix comfortably and add more later till I get it nearly right but still a bit thick - this can be corrected the next day when one actually makes it (the batter thins overnight anyhow). This makes a lot of crepes but then I can't see the point of only making a couple.

===The Setup===
# Use a pan that you can twist and turn easily with one hand when you are spreading the mixture - speed is important at this stage and you'll get tired with a heavy iron pan.
# Make sure that the pan has sloping sides - 90 degree angles make it impossible to get the crepe out.
#  I like non-stick pans best - with a thick base if possible.
# Before you begin to cook, heat up the pan with some oil till it is just about to smoke and then wipe out the oil carelessly (i.e., don't try to scrub it all out) with a paper towel.  With metal pans this is essential and I think it's worthwhile with non-stick ones too. Your first 2 crepes will be a bit oily but after that all will be well.
# Cook on a fairly high heat - it tends to make nicer crepes.

===The Technique===
# This is almost too hard to explain and I haven't perfected it yet.  Try to use the minimum amount of mixture - one will often end up with a few holes but this is more than compensated for by the wonderful texture of a soft thin crepe.
## I put the mixture into top right of the pan, tilt to make it run to the lower left, allow a &quot;wide&quot; puddle to form on the bottom left and then tilt the pan back to make the mixture run back across to the lower right - basically a kind of triangle.
## Alternatively, crepe spreading tools are available, although I've only ever seen them for sale in Brittany.  
# The crepe is ready to turn when the surface looks matte (i.e., not glistening with moisture any more). Cook briefly on the other side. It usually takes 2-3 minutes for the first side to fully cook, fifteen seconds on the other.
# Stir the mixture occasionally because flour tends to fall to the bottom of the bowl, leaving the top part too thin and causing your last crepes to be too thick.

===Pitfalls===
# ''Brittle crepes'': add an egg to the mixture.
# ''Sticking crepes with thin mixture'': these never dry out properly and tend to stick to the pan whilst being raw on top.  There is not enough flour in the mixture.
# ''Sticking crepes with cold mixture'': Naughty! make sure the mixture isn't cold!

===Taste===
# Use fewer yolks than egg whites - otherwise they will taste too eggy.
# A bit of brandy or rum to taste will make each pancake subtly better. A small amount of beer or sour milk also give a subtle flavour.
# Waste no time with butter - it can add flavor but it's just annoying because it tends to burn and if you keep your mixture overnight it will solidify and come out of the mixture.  Just add a small amount of cooking oil to the batter to help prevent it from sticking.

===Using a special crepe maker===
If you use a special plate for Crepes as the most creperies do it you have to use another recipe since you manually spread the batter with a batter spreader (T-formed stick) on the hot plate. Therefore the batter must not to be that much liquid otherwise it will run down on the sides of the plate. The benefits of a separate crepe maker is the better control of the heat and it's more consistent than on a pan, also you can make thinner and bigger crepe as the size of a pan is bound to the hotplate it stands on. Traditionally you use a copper pan, the separate plate is a further stage of this tradition.

If you don't have a crepe maker but are interested in one then there are some things you should know. The cheaper plates have a very thin plate which is coated. Because the plate has almost no mass these versions are very lightweight but on the other hand the heat is not very consistent at the surface. Also a coated plate sounds good but it only makes the cleaning easier, making crepe on a coated plate is not that easy as it slips around on the surface and the coating maybe gets scraped off and then hanging on your crepe (you don't want to eat Teflon, do you?). These plates are cheaper because the materials and heating elements are not long-life components. They are okay if you use them only rarely. Just watch out you get a good cheap plate, that means only buy a plate that's even and has no hill at the edge (that hill preserves the batter from flowing over the plate but as you will use a batter spreader it is only a question of practice, otherwise you would use a pan and you would not have to buy a extra device) as it makes the turning of the crepe more difficult than an even plate. If you have some more money over you can spend in a proper crepe plate then please notice: These are very expensive, from around 350$ upwards. They have a solid cast iron plate and a progressive thermostat where you can set the exact temperature the plate should have. For personal use one of these devices will last a lifetime as these professional crepe makers are built from long life components. Because of the massive cast iron they are very heavy, a plate with a diameter of 40cm weights around 23kg. Also you have to burn the fat onto the surface before using, at maximum heat you have to rub it for half a hour with much oil and that will stink a lot so it should be done outside (believe me, it's no great work) but that gives it a coating that is way better than a Teflon coated plate because you only make crepe on it, if it becomes destroyed you can make a new coating and it supports the taste of the crepe. After that the cleaning of the plate is easy, you only have to clean it if it gets dusty or dirty and then you only have to use a wet cloth (never clean it with soap!).

A proven recipe is:

500 g of wheat flour

1 l of milk (do not use low-fat milk with under 3.5% of fat as the crepe will get fragile and dry)

1 egg

50 g of melted butter

a bit of salt (If the batter should be more sweet then you can replace the salt with some vanilla sugar.)

If you like try to add other ingredients as described above but notice that the batter then is maybe no longer flavorful compatible with certain toppings.
The ingredients get mixed, the batter wont get lumpy if you first mix the egg and milk with the salt/sugar and then slowly stir in the (sieved) flour and finally the melted butter. The batter has to stand about half a hour until you can use it. The less gas is in the batter the better the crepe will be so try to stir in as less air as possible. Don't keep that batter for too long without stirring it (for example overnight in the fridge) as it will split into its ingredients and gets gross.
# Regulate the temperature of the plate to 160°C if possible, if there is no temperature scale then you have to find out on yourself what is best suited. But as guideline the batter still should be liquid when you finished your first circular move of spreading.
# Wipe over the plate with a cloth you prepared with a bit of neutral vegetable oil so theres a very thin layer of oil on it. How often you have to repeat it depends on the plate you use but as a general rule every time before you put on the batter.
# When the plate reached the temperature, give the batter on the plate (depending on the diameter of the plate of course you have to use different amounts of batter, at a diameter of 35cm there are 125ml suited, at 40cm it's already 200ml).
# Quickly spread the batter with circling moves of the T-formed batter spreader across the plate but be carefull where the batter already became hard so you won't rip it off. This needs a bit of practice but do never scrub over the surface, the move must come out of the wrist in a flow and don't hold the stick too fast.
# The sides of the batter will arch up as it cooks and and you have to turn it over to cook the other side. For that you can use a special spatula that has a long thin steel or heat resistent plastic blade and no angled handle. It looks like a blade but it is not sharp so you can easily turn the crepe without cutting it and it will later help you to fold it.
# Once you have turned the crepe you can begin with garnishing it. If you want to use something very liquid as topping such as marmalade, juice or alcoholics then you shouldn't do this on the plate as the crepe gets soggy it may seep through and the plate will get sticky at these spots. Remove it from the crepe maker and then garnish it on a plate. If you want to fold it you should only garnish one half of the crepe because if you fold it then the filling may fall down in the fold making it harder to eat, liquid may flow out and the crepe may become messy.
# When the bottom starts to get brown spots it is ready. You can either take it as it is on a plate, roll it or fold it to a quarter or one sixth so it can be easily eaten even without cutlery. You should eat it right away if you don't want the crepe to cool down (and maybe the topping gets solid again for example if you use solid chocolate). The whole procedure takes approx 2-3 minutes, that's really not a long time, in most cases it will take you longer to eat than to make them.
Now you can decide whether you have to take it away sooner or maybe it can take a little bit longer, after all everyone has his own taste and some people like it softer and others like it more crispy. But hear my words, if the crepe gets too crispy (and that means dry) it is not so easy to eat it (you will understand if you have ever ate a dry cake without anything to drink). My personal favorite is when the surface got a bit crispy but inside it's still soft.
Very popular toppings are chocolate creme like Nutella and different chocolate bars (especially Kinder Chocolate). When using solid chocolate just watch out that it is broken to little pieces which got spread over the crepe, never use too big pieces. Good ideas for serving is the crepe on a plate and topped with some powdered sugar, sweetened fruit pieces, ice cream or/and chocolate syrup.

This is a very interesting article. I have but one suggestion: perhaps you could include a pronunciation page? Pronunciation is one of the most important parts to learning a language; without pronunciation, we would not be able to rightly learn this language, or anyother. Just a thought... :( ~~grandma</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inspired by the Wikibook [[Teaching Assistant in France Survival Guide]], this page is geared towards Americans traveling to France '''with their child(ren)''' through the [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIEP CIEP] program.  

If you would like to learn more about this program, please visit the [http://www.ambafrance-us.org/ Embassy of France in the U.S.] web site: [http://www.ambafrance-us.org/culture/education/support/assistant/ Teaching Assistant Program in France].

The process is more involved than for assistants traveling alone.  We hope this page provides a wealth of information and resources for those of you who wish to include your family on this adventure!

For the purpose of continuity, this information is for bringing ''one child''.  Please adjust accordingly for multiple children.

== Pre-Preparation ==

=== Money ===

Assistants make approximately 900€ each month - before taxes.  This amount is suitable for one person to live on (with the help of French government assistance such as the [http://www.caf.fr/ CAF]), however it is '''not recommended''' that you count solely on this income to support your dependents while you are there.

It is highly recommended that you have some money saved up ''before'' leaving for France.  How much?  That's an excellent question, to which I don't yet have an answer.

=== Visa ===

Before applying for a Visa, your child must have a valid [http://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_1738.html U.S. Passport].

Your child will need a [http://www.ambafrance-us.org/visitingfrance/usvisas.asp#6 Long Stay Visa].  This generally takes 3 months to be processed but varies depending on the consulate and whether or not you apply in person.

The Visa fee for yourself is free, however in 2005 the Long Stay Visa for a child of a teaching assistant was $125.  Please inquire as to the fee, as it is subject to change.

You must: 
* provide financial disclosure by showing how you intend on financially supporting your child during your stay (a signed statement from your bank)
* prove that your child has health insurance for the duration of the visit
* provide an address of residence for the time of your stay (most assistants will have this so use the address of the school)

Be prepared with as much information as possible if you apply in person. You may be asked for copies of plane tickets.

(more on these points later)

=== Paperwork ===

Photocopy, photocopy, and photocopy!!!
Bring originals and photocopies of immunizations. 
The French schools want to see proof of a tuberculosis vaccination but proof of a tuberculosis test will be sufficient.
Bring lots of wallet size photos (headshots) of every family member.
Inquire about after school or additional child care available at the Mairie or school. 
Keep documentation about your salary and find out if you qualify for a reduction for school lunch.

== This Wikibook ==

This book was written at '''Wikibooks''', a free online community where people write open-content textbooks. Any person with internet access is welcome to participate in the creation and improvement of this book. Because this book is continuously evolving, there are no finite &quot;versions&quot; or &quot;editions&quot; of this book. Permanent links to known good versions of the pages may be provided.

== What are Control Systems? ==
{{wikipedia|Control system}}
{{Wikipedia|Control engineering}}

The study and design of automatic '''Control Systems''', a field known as '''control engineering,''' has become important in modern technical society. From devices as simple as a toaster or a toilet, to complex machines like space shuttles and power steering, control engineering is a part of our everyday life. This book introduces the field of control engineering and explores some of the more advanced topics in the field. Note, however, that control engineering is a very large field, and this book serves as a foundation of control engineering and introduction to selected advanced topics in the field. Topics in this book are added at the discretion of the authors, and represent the available expertise of our contributors. 

Control systems are components that are added to other components, to increase functionality, or to meet a set of design criteria. For example: 
{{TextBox|We have a particular electric motor that is supposed to turn at a rate of 40 RPM. To achieve this speed, we must supply 10 Volts to the motor terminals. However, with 10 volts supplied to the motor at rest, it takes 30 seconds for our motor to get up to speed. This is valuable time lost.}}

This simple example, however can be complex to both users and designers of the motor system. It may seem obvious that the motor should start at a higher voltage, so that it accelerates faster. Then we can reduce the supply back down to 10 volts once it reaches ideal speed.

This is clearly a simplistic example, but it illustrates an important point: we can add special &quot;Controller units&quot; to preexisting systems, to improve performance and meet new system specifications. 

Here are some formal definitions of terms used throughout this book:

{{TextBox|
;Control System: A Control System is a device, or a collection of devices that manage the behavior of other devices. Some devices are not controllable. A control system is an interconnection of components connected or related in such a manner as to command, direct, or regulate itself or another system.

;Controller:A controller is a control system that manages the behavior of another device or system.

;Compensator:A Compensator is a control system that regulates another system, usually by conditioning the input or the output to that system. Compensators are typically employed to correct a single design flaw, with the intention of affecting other aspects of the design in a minimal manner.
}}

There are essentially two methods to approach the problem of designing a new control system: the '''Classical Approach''', and the '''Modern Approach'''.

== Classical and Modern ==
'''Classical''' and '''Modern''' control methodologies are named in a misleading way, because the group of techniques called &quot;Classical&quot; were actually developed later than the techniques labeled &quot;Modern&quot;. However, in terms of developing control systems, Modern methods have been used to great effect more recently, while the Classical methods have been gradually falling out of favor. Most recently, it has been shown that Classical and Modern methods can be combined to highlight their respective strengths and weaknesses. 

Classical Methods, which this book will consider first, are methods involving the '''Laplace Transform domain'''. Physical systems are modeled in the so-called &quot;time domain&quot;, where the response of a given system is a function of the various inputs, the previous system values, and time. As time progresses, the state of the system and its response change. However, time-domain models for systems are frequently modeled using high-order differential equations which can become impossibly difficult for humans to solve and some of which can even become impossible for modern computer systems to solve efficiently. To counteract this problem, integral transforms, such as the '''Laplace Transform''' and the '''Fourier Transform''', can be employed to change an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the time domain into a regular algebraic polynomial in the transform domain. Once a given system has been converted into the transform domain it can be manipulated with greater ease and analyzed quickly by humans and computers alike.

Modern Control Methods, instead of changing domains to avoid the complexities of time-domain ODE mathematics, converts the differential equations into a system of lower-order time domain equations called '''State Equations''', which can then be manipulated using techniques from linear algebra. This book will consider Modern Methods second.

A third distinction that is frequently made in the realm of control systems is to divide analog methods (classical and modern, described above) from digital methods. Digital Control Methods were designed to try and incorporate the emerging power of computer systems into previous control methodologies. A special transform, known as the '''Z-Transform''', was developed that can adequately describe digital systems, but at the same time can be converted (with some effort) into the Laplace domain. Once in the Laplace domain, the digital system can be manipulated and analyzed in a very similar manner to Classical analog systems. For this reason, this book will not make a hard and fast distinction between Analog and Digital systems, and instead will attempt to study both paradigms in parallel.

== Who is This Book For? ==
This book is intended to accompany a course of study in under-graduate and graduate engineering. As has been mentioned previously, this book is not focused on any particular discipline within engineering, however any person who wants to make use of this material should have some basic background in the Laplace transform (if not other transforms), calculus, etc. The material in this book may  be used to accompany several semesters of study, depending on the program of your particular college or university. The study of control systems is generally a topic that is reserved for students in their 3rd or 4th year of a 4 year undergraduate program, because it requires so much previous information. Some of the more advanced topics may not be covered until later in a graduate program.

Many colleges and universities only offer one or two classes specifically about control systems at the undergraduate level. Some universities, however, do offer more than that, depending on how the material is broken up, and how much depth that is to be covered. Also, many institutions will offer a handful of graduate-level courses on the subject. This book will attempt to cover the topic of control systems from both a graduate and undergraduate level, with the advanced topics built on the basic topics in a way that is intuitive. As such, students should be able to begin reading this book in any place that seems an appropriate starting point, and should be able to finish reading where further information is no longer needed.

== What are the Prerequisites? ==
Understanding of the material in this book will require a solid mathematical foundation. This book does not currently explain, nor will it ever try to fully explain most of the necessary mathematical tools used in this text. For that reason, the reader is expected to have read the following wikibooks, or have background knowledge comparable to them:

;[[Algebra]]
;[[Calculus]]
:The reader should have a good understanding of differentiation and integration. Partial differentiation, multiple integration, and functions of multiple variables will be used occasionally, but the students are not necessarily required to know those subjects well. These advanced calculus topics could better be treated as a co-requisite instead of a pre-requisite.
;[[Linear Algebra]]
:State-space system representation draws heavily on linear algebra techniques. Students should know how to operate on matrices. Students should understand basic matrix operations (addition, multiplication, determinant, inverse, transpose). Students would also benefit from a prior understanding of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, but those subjects are covered in this text.
;[[Ordinary Differential Equations]]
:All linear systems can be described by a linear ordinary differential equation. It is beneficial, therefore, for students to understand these equations. Much of this book describes methods to analyze these equations. Students should know what a differential equation is, and they should also know how to find the general solutions of first and second order ODEs.
;[[Engineering Analysis]]
:This book reinforces many of the advanced mathematical concepts used in the [[Engineering Analysis]] book, and we will refer to the relevant sections in the aforementioned text for further information on some subjects. This is essentially a math book, but with a focus on various engineering applications. It relies on a previous knowledge of the other math books in this list.
;[[Signals and Systems]]
:The [[Signals and Systems]] book will provide a basis in the field of '''systems theory''', of which control systems is a subset. Readers who have not read the [[Signals and Systems]] book will be at a severe disadvantage when reading this book.

== How is this Book Organized? ==
This book will be organized following a particular progression. First this book will discuss the basics of system theory, and it will offer a brief refresher on integral transforms. Section 2 will contain a brief primer on digital information, for students who are not necessarily familiar with them. This is done so that digital and analog signals can be considered in parallel throughout the rest of the book. Next, this book will introduce the state-space method of system description and control. After section 3, topics in the book will use state-space and transform methods interchangeably (and occasionally simultaneously). It is important, therefore, that these three chapters be well read and understood before venturing into the later parts of the book.

After the &quot;basic&quot; sections of the book, we will delve into specific methods of analyzing and designing control systems. First we will discuss Laplace-domain stability analysis techniques (Routh-Hurwitz, root-locus), and then frequency methods (Nyquist Criteria, Bode Plots). After the classical methods are discussed, this book will then discuss Modern methods of stability analysis. Finally, a number of advanced topics will be touched upon, depending on the knowledge level of the various contributors. 

As the subject matter of this book expands, so too will the prerequisites. For instance, when this book is expanded to cover '''nonlinear systems''', a basic background knowledge of nonlinear mathematics will be required.

=== Versions ===
This wikibook has been expanded to include [[Control Systems/All Versions|multiple versions]] of its text, differentiated by the material covered, and the order in which the material is presented. Each different version is composed of the chapters of this book, included in a different order. This book covers a wide range of information, so if you don't need all the information that this book has to offer, perhaps one of the other versions would be right for you and your educational needs. 

Each separate version has a table of contents outlining the different chapters that are included in that version. Also, each separate version comes complete with a printable version, and some even come with PDF versions as well.

Take a look at the '''[[Control Systems/All Versions|All Versions Listing Page]]''' to find the version of the book that is right for you and your needs.

== Differential Equations Review ==
Implicit in the study of control systems is the underlying use of differential equations. Even if they aren't visible on the surface, all of the continuous-time systems that we will be looking at are described in the time domain by ordinary differential equations (ODE), some of which are relatively high-order.

{{TextBox|1=Let's review some differential equation basics. Consider the topic of interest from a bank. The amount of interest accrued on a given principal balance (the amount of money you put into the bank) P, is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt} = rP&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; is the interest (rate of change of the principal), and r is the interest rate. Notice in this case that P is a function of time (t), and can be rewritten to reflect that:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = rP(t)&lt;/math&gt;

To solve this basic, first-order equation, we can use a technique called &quot;separation of variables&quot;, where we move all instances of the letter P to one side, and all instances of t to the other:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP(t)}{P(t)} = r\ dt&lt;/math&gt;

And integrating both sides gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln|P(t)| = rt + C&lt;/math&gt;

This is all fine and good, but generally, we like to get rid of the logarithm, by raising both sides to a power of e:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = e^{rt + C}&lt;/math&gt;

Where we can separate out the constant as such:

:&lt;math&gt;D = e^C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = De^{rt}&lt;/math&gt;

D is a constant that represents the '''initial conditions''' of the system, in this case the starting principal. }}

Differential equations are particularly difficult to manipulate, especially once we get to higher-orders of equations. Luckily, several methods of abstraction have been created that allow us to work with ODEs, but at the same time, not have to worry about the complexities of them. The classical method, as described above, uses the Laplace, Fourier, and Z Transforms to convert ODEs in the time domain into polynomials in a complex domain. These complex polynomials are significantly easier to solve than the ODE counterparts. The Modern method instead breaks differential equations into systems of low-order equations, and expresses this system in terms of matrices. It is a common precept in ODE theory that an ODE of order N can be broken down into N equations of order 1. 

Readers who are unfamiliar with differential equations might be able to read and understand the material in this book reasonably well. However, all readers are encouraged to read the related sections in '''[[Calculus]]'''.

== History ==

The field of control systems started essentially in the ancient world. Early civilizations, notably the Greeks and the Arabs were heavily preoccupied with the accurate measurement of time, the result of which were several &quot;water clocks&quot; that were designed and implemented.

However, there was very little in the way of actual progress made in the field of engineering until the beginning of the renaissance in Europe. Leonhard Euler (for whom '''Euler's Formula''' is named) discovered a powerful integral transform, but Pierre-Simon Laplace used the transform (later called the '''Laplace Transform''') to solve complex problems in probability theory.

Joseph Fourier was a court mathematician in France under Napoleon I. He created a special function decomposition called the '''Fourier Series''', that was later generalized into an integral transform, and named in his honor (the '''Fourier Transform''').

The &quot;golden age&quot; of control engineering occurred between 1910-1945, where mass communication methods were being created and two world wars were being fought. During this period, some of the most famous names in controls engineering were doing their work: Nyquist and Bode. 

'''Hendrik Wade Bode''' and '''Harry Nyquist''', especially in the 1930's while working with Bell Laboratories, created the bulk of what we now call &quot;Classical Control Methods&quot;. These methods were based off the results of the Laplace and Fourier Transforms, which had been previously known, but were made popular by '''Oliver Heaviside''' around the turn of the century. Previous to Heaviside, the transforms were not widely used, nor respected mathematical tools.

Bode is credited with the &quot;discovery&quot; of the closed-loop feedback system, and the logarithmic plotting technique that still bears his name ('''bode plots'''). Harry Nyquist did extensive research in the field of system stability and information theory. He created a powerful stability criteria that has been named for him ('''The Nyquist Criteria''').

Modern control methods were introduced in the early 1950's, as a way to bypass some of the shortcomings of the classical methods. '''Rudolf Kalman''' is famous for his work in modern control theory, and an adaptive controller called the '''Kalman Filter''' was named in his honor. Modern control methods became increasingly popular after 1957 with the invention of the computer, and the start of the space program. Computers created the need for digital control methodologies, and the space program required the creation of some &quot;advanced&quot; control techniques, such as &quot;optimal control&quot;, &quot;robust control&quot;, and &quot;nonlinear control&quot;. These last subjects, and several more, are still active areas of study among research engineers.

== Branches of Control Engineering ==
Here we are going to give a brief listing of the various different methodologies within the sphere of control engineering. Oftentimes, the lines between these methodologies are blurred, or even erased completely.

;Classical Controls:Control methodologies where the ODEs that describe a system are transformed using the Laplace, Fourier, or Z Transforms, and manipulated in the transform domain.
;Modern Controls:Methods where high-order differential equations are broken into a system of first-order equations. The input, output, and internal states of the system are described by vectors called &quot;state variables&quot;.
;Robust Control:Control methodologies where arbitrary outside noise/disturbances are accounted for, as well as internal inaccuracies caused by the heat of the system itself, and the environment.
;Optimal Control:In a system, performance metrics are identified, and arranged into a &quot;cost function&quot;. The cost function is minimized to create an operational system with the lowest cost.
;Adaptive Control:In adaptive control, the control changes its response characteristics over time to better control the system.
;Nonlinear Control:The youngest branch of control engineering, nonlinear control encompasses systems that cannot be described by linear equations or ODEs, and for which there is often very little supporting theory available.
;Game Theory:Game Theory is a close relative of control theory, and especially robust control and optimal control theories. In game theory, the external disturbances are not considered to be random noise processes, but instead are considered to be &quot;opponents&quot;. Each player has a cost function that they attempt to minimize, and that their opponents attempt to maximize.

This book will definitely cover the first two branches, and will hopefully be expanded to cover some of the later branches, if time allows.

== MATLAB ==
{{SideBox|Information about using MATLAB for control systems can be found in&lt;br&gt; '''[[Control Systems/MATLAB|the Appendix]]'''}}

'''MATLAB''' ® is a programming tool that is commonly used in the field of control engineering. We will discuss MATLAB in specific sections of this book devoted to that purpose. MATLAB will not appear in discussions outside these specific sections, although MATLAB may be used in some example problems. An overview of the use of MATLAB in control engineering can be found in the '''appendix''' at: [[Control Systems/MATLAB]].

For more information on MATLAB in general, see: [[MATLAB Programming]].

{{SideBox|For more information about properly referencing MATLAB, see:&lt;br&gt;[[Control Systems/Resources|Resources]]}}

Nearly all textbooks on the subject of control systems, linear systems, and system analysis will use MATLAB as an integral part of the text. Students who are learning this subject at an accredited university will certainly have seen this material in their textbooks, and are likely to have had MATLAB work as part of their classes. It is from this perspective that the MATLAB appendix is written.

In the future, this book may be expanded to include information on '''Simulink''' ®, as well as MATLAB.

There are a number of other software tools that are useful in the analysis and design of control systems. Additional information can be added in the appendix of this book, depending on the experience and prior knowledge of contributors.

== About Formatting ==
This book will use some simple conventions throughout.

=== Mathematical Conventions ===

Mathematical equations will be labeled with the {{tl|eqn}} template, to give them names. Equations that are labeled in such a manner are important, and should be taken special note of. For instance, notice the label to the right of this equation:
{{eqn|Inverse Laplace Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;f(t) 
        = \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{F(s)\right\}
        = {1 \over {2\pi i}}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} e^{st} F(s)\,ds&lt;/math&gt;

Equations that are named in this manner will also be copied into the [[Control Systems/List of Equations|List of Equations Glossary]] in the end of the book, for an easy reference.

Italics will be used for English variables, functions, and equations that appear in the main text. For example ''e'', ''j'', ''f(t)'' and ''X(s)'' are all italicized. Wikibooks contains a LaTeX mathematics formatting engine, although an attempt will be made not to employ formatted mathematical equations inline with other text because of the difference in size and font.

== Systems ==

Systems, in one sense, are devices that take input and produce an output. A system can be thought to '''operate''' on the input to produce the output. The output is related to the input by a certain relationship known as the '''system response'''.  The system response usually can be modeled with a mathematical relationship between the system input and the system output.

== System Properties ==

Physical systems can be divided up into a number of different categories, depending on particular properties that the system exhibits. Some of these system classifications are very easy to work with and have a large theory base for analysis. Some system classifications are very complex and have still not been investigated with any degree of success. By properly identifying the properties of a system, certain analysis and design tools can be selected for use with the system. 

The early sections of this book will focus primarily on '''linear time-invariant''' (LTI) systems. LTI systems are the easiest class of system to work with, and have a number of properties that make them ideal to study. This chapter discusses some properties of systems.

Later chapters in this book will look at time variant systems and nonlinear systems. Both time variant and nonlinear systems are very complex areas of current research, and both can be difficult to analyze properly. Unfortunately, most physical real-world systems are time-variant, nonlinear, or both.

An introduction to system identification and least squares techniques can be found [http://wikis.controltheorypro.com/index.php?title=Introduction_to_System_Identification here].  An introduction to parameter identification techniques can be found [http://wikis.controltheorypro.com/index.php?title=Introduction_to_Parameter_Identification here].

== Initial Time ==

The '''initial time''' of a system is the time before which there is no input. Typically, the initial time of a system is defined to be zero, which will simplify the analysis significantly. Some techniques, such as the '''Laplace Transform''' require that the initial time of the system be zero. The initial time of a system is typically denoted by t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

The value of any variable at the initial time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will be denoted with a 0 subscript. For instance, the value of variable x at time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t_0) = x_0&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, any time t with a positive subscript are points in time ''after t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', in ascending order:

:&lt;math&gt;t_0 \le t_1 \le t_2 \le \cdots \le t_n&lt;/math&gt;

So t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; occurs after t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; occurs after both points. In a similar fashion above, a variable with a positive subscript (unless specifying an index into a vector) also occurs at that point in time:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t_1) = x_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x(t_2) = x_2&lt;/math&gt;

This is valid for all points in time t.

== Additivity ==

A system satisfies the property of '''additivity''', if a sum of inputs results in a sum of outputs. By definition: an input of &lt;math&gt;x_3(t) = x_1(t) + x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; results in an output of  &lt;math&gt;y_3(t) = y_1(t) + y_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;. To determine whether a system is additive, use the following test:

Given a system f that takes an input x and outputs a value y, assume two inputs (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produce two outputs:
:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = f(x_1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2 = f(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, create a composite input that is the sum of the previous inputs:
:&lt;math&gt;x_3 = x_1 + x_2&lt;/math&gt;
Then the system is additive if the following equation is true:

:&lt;math&gt;y_3 = f(x_3) = f(x_1 + x_2) = f(x_1) + f(x_2) = y_1 + y_2&lt;/math&gt;

Systems that satisfy this property are called '''additive'''. Additive systems are useful because a sum of simple inputs can be used to analyze the system response to a more complex input. 

=== Example: Sinusoids ===

{{TextBox|1=Given the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = \sin(3x(t))&lt;/math&gt;

Create a sum of inputs as:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = x_1(t) + x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;

and construct the expected sum of outputs:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = y_1(t) + y_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, substituting these values into our equation, test for equality:

:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) + y_2(t) = \sin(3[x_1(t) + x_2(t)])&lt;/math&gt;

The equality is not satisfied, and therefore the sine operation is not additive.}}

== Homogeneity ==

A system satisfies the condition of '''homogeneity''' if an input scaled by a certain factor produces an output scaled by that same factor. By definition: an input of &lt;math&gt;ax_1&lt;/math&gt; results in an output of &lt;math&gt;ay_1&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, to see if function ''f()'' is '''homogeneous''', perform the following test:

Stimulate the system ''f'' with an arbitrary input ''x'' to produce an output ''y'':
:&lt;math&gt;y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, create a second input ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', scale it by a multiplicative factor ''C'' (''C'' is an arbitrary constant value), and produce a corresponding output ''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = f(Cx_1)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, assign x to be equal to ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'':
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = x&lt;/math&gt;

Then, for the system to be homogeneous, the following equation must be true:
:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = f(Cx) = Cf(x) = Cy&lt;/math&gt;

Systems that are homogeneous are useful in many applications, especially applications with gain or amplification. 

=== Example: Straight-Line ===

{{TextBox|1=Given the equation for a straight line:

:&lt;math&gt;y = f(x) = 2x + 3&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = f(Cx_1) = 2(Cx_1) + 3 = C2x_1 + 3&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = x&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the two results, it is easy to see they are not equal:

:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = C2x + 3 \ne Cy = C(2x + 3) = C2x + C3&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the equation is not homogeneous.}}

== Linearity ==

A system is considered '''linear''' if it satisfies the conditions of Additivity and Homogeneity. In short, a system is linear if the following is true:

Take two arbitrary inputs, and produce two arbitrary outputs:
:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = f(x_1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2 = f(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, a linear combination of the inputs should produce a linear combination of the outputs:
:&lt;math&gt;f(Ax + By) = f(Ax) + f(By) = Af(x) + Bf(y)&lt;/math&gt;

This condition of additivity and homogeneity is called '''superposition'''. A system is linear if it satisfies the condition of superposition.

=== Example: Linear Differential Equations ===

{{TextBox|1=Is the following equation linear:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy(t)}{dt} + y(t) = x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

To determine whether this system is linear, construct a new composite input:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = Ax_1(t) + Bx_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, create the expected composite output:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = Ay_1(t) + By_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the two into our original equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d[Ay_1(t) + By_2(t)]}{dt} + [Ay_1(t) + By_2(t)] = Ax_1(t) + Bx_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Factor out the derivative operator, as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}[Ay_1(t) + By_2(t)] + [Ay_1(t) + By_2(t)] = Ax_1(t) + Bx_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, convert the various composite terms into the respective variables, to prove that this system is linear:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy(t)}{dt} + y(t) = x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

For the record, derivatives and integrals are linear operators, and ordinary differential equations typically are linear equations.}}

== Memory ==

A system is said to have '''memory''' if the output from the system is dependent on past inputs (or future inputs!) to the system. A system is called '''memoryless''' if the output is only dependent on the current input. Memoryless systems are easier to work with, but systems with memory are more common in digital signal processing applications.

Systems that have memory are called '''dynamic''' systems, and systems that do not have memory are '''static''' systems.

== Causality ==

Causality is a property that is very similar to memory. A system is called '''causal''' if it is only dependent on past and/or current inputs. A system is called '''anti-causal''' if the output of the system is dependent only on future inputs.
A system is called '''non-causal''' if the output depends on past and/or current and future inputs.

{{info|A system design that is not causal cannot be physically implemented. If the system can't be built, the design is generally worthless.}}

== Time-Invariance ==

A system is called '''time-invariant''' if the system relationship between the input and output signals is not dependent on the passage of time. If the input signal &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; produces an output &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; then any time shifted input, &lt;math&gt;x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;, results in a time-shifted output &lt;math&gt;y(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt; This property can be satisfied if the transfer function of the system is not a function of time except expressed by the input and output.
If a system is time-invariant then the system block is commutative with an arbitrary delay. This facet of time-invariant systems will be discussed later.

To determine if a system f is time-invariant, perform the following test:

Apply an arbitrary input x to a system and produce an arbitrary output y:
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = f(x(t))&lt;/math&gt;

Apply a second input x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to the system, and produce a second output:
:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = f(x_1(t))&lt;/math&gt;

Now, assign x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to be equal to the first input x, time-shifted by a given constant value &amp;delta;:
:&lt;math&gt;x_1(t) = x(t - \delta)&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, a system is time-invariant if y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to y shifted by the same value &amp;delta;:
:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = y(t - \delta)&lt;/math&gt;

== LTI Systems ==

A system is considered to be a '''Linear Time-Invariant''' (LTI) system if it satisfies the requirements of time-invariance and linearity. LTI systems are one of the most important types of systems, and they will be considered almost exclusively in the beginning chapters of this book.

Systems which are not LTI are more common in practice, but are much more difficult to analyze.

== Lumpedness ==

A system is said to be '''lumped''' if one of the two following conditions are satisfied:
#There are a finite number of states that the system can be in.
#There are a finite number of state variables.

The concept of &quot;states&quot; and &quot;state variables&quot; are relatively advanced, and they will be discussed in more detail in the discussion about '''modern controls'''. 

Systems which are not lumped are called '''distributed'''. A simple example of a distributed system is a system with delay, that is, &lt;math&gt;A(s)y(t)=B(s)u(t-\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, which has an infinite number of state variables (Here we use &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to denote the Laplace variable). However, although distributed systems are quite common, they are very difficult to analyze in practice, and there are few tools available to work with such systems. Fortunately, in most cases, a delay can be sufficiently modeled with the Pade approximation. This book will not discuss distributed systems much.

== Relaxed ==

A system is said to be '''relaxed''' if the system is causal, and at the initial time t&lt;sub&gt;0
&lt;/sub&gt; the output of the system is zero, i.e., there is no stored energy in the system.

:&lt;math&gt;y(t_0) = f(x(t_0)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of differential equations, a relaxed system is said to have &quot;zero initial state&quot;. Systems without an initial state are easier to work with, but systems that are not relaxed can frequently be modified to approximate relaxed systems.

== Stability ==

{{SideBox|Control Systems engineers will frequently say that an unstable system has &quot;exploded&quot;. Some physical systems actually can rupture or explode when they go unstable.}}

'''Stability''' is a very important concept in systems, but it is also one of the hardest function properties to prove. There are several different criteria for system stability, but the most common requirement is that the system must produce a finite output when subjected to a finite input. For instance, if 5 volts is applied to the input terminals of a given circuit, it would be best if the circuit output didn't approach infinity, and the circuit itself didn't melt or explode. This type of stability is often known as &quot;'''Bounded Input, Bounded Output'''&quot; stability, or '''BIBO'''.

There are a number of other types of stability, most of which are based off the concept of BIBO stability. Because stability is such an important and complicated topic, an entire section of this text is devoted to its study.

== Inputs and Outputs ==

Systems can also be categorized by the number of inputs and the number of outputs the system has. Consider a television as a system, for instance. The system has two inputs: the power wire and the signal cable. It has one output: the video display. A system with one input and one output is called '''single-input, single output''', or SISO. a system with multiple inputs and multiple outputs is called '''multi-input, multi-output''', or MIMO.

These systems will be discussed in more detail later.

{{TextBox|1='''Exercise:'''

Based on the definitions of SISO and MIMO, above, determine what the acronyms SIMO and MISO mean.}}

*standard technique is nephroureterectomy with removal of the bladder cuff
==Radiation==
*adjuvant XRT shown to improve locoregional control and disease-free survival but effect on OS not consistently demonstrated (small retrospective series, Cozad 1995)  (NO prospective randomized trials)

Studies:
*'''U.Kansas 1992''' PMID 1429099 -- &quot;Adjuvant radiotherapy in high stage transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter.&quot; (Cozad SC, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1992;24(4):743-5.)
**Retrospective. 26 pts w/ TCC of renal pelvis or ureter, Stage III-IV (M0), treated w/ curative attempt surgery. Adjuvant RT given to 9 pts, median 50 Gy. Treatment volume was the tumor bed only in 6 pts
**Median f/u 13 mo. LR in 10 pts; 9 of 17 (no RT group), 1 of 9 (RT group). 5-yr LC 34% (no RT) vs 88% (RT). On multivariate analysis, only RT was significant for influencing LR. Metastasis: DM in 14 pts (12 as a component of first failure); 10 of 17 (no RT), 4 of 9 (RT). Survival: 20 of 26 have died; 5-yr OS 24% (no RT), 44% (RT). RT did not have a significant effect on survival.
**Conclusion: RT decreases the rate of local failure. Advocate adjuvant RT for pts with high stage or high grade tumors or those with close or positive margins. Ideally, this should be combined with systemic therapy.

==Chemo==
*platinum-based given concurrently with XRT for localled advanced (T3-T4, N+) TCC upper urinary tract
*in adjuvant setting reduces risk of distant mets upper urinary tract (bamias 2004, kwak 2006)
*adjuvant chemoXRT more effective than adjuvant XRT alone based on retrospective study from mass gen for T3,T4,N+ (Czito, et al, 2004)


Studies:
*'''Mass General, 2004''' (1970-1997) PMID 15371822 -- &quot;Adjuvant radiotherapy with and without concurrent chemotherapy for locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter.&quot; (Czito B, J Urol. 2004 Oct;172(4 Pt 1):1271-5.)
**Retrospective. 31 pts (renal pelvis-13, ureter-15, both-3) treated with RT following curative resection. Most (28 of 31) had T3/4 or N+ disease. Median RT dose 46.9 Gy. 9 pts treated with chemotherapy (MTX,cisplatin,vinblastine x 2-4 cycles, followed by concurrent cisplatin with RT).
**Median f/u 2.6 yrs. MS 2.4 yrs. 52% with relapse; 29% with DM alone; 23% had LRF (with DM developing in all but 1 pt). 5-yr OS 39%, DSS 52%, LRC 62%, metastasis-free survival 48%. On univariate analysis, concurrent chemotherapy improved OS (27% vs 67%) and DSS (41% vs 76%). 
**Conclusion: suggests that the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy improves outcomes for resected locally advanced disease</text>

===Without Diacritic and Vowel Marks===
Since Hebrew usually does not have the diacritic and vowel marks, practice reading the following without the marks.  (The first time through the translation is given as a hint.)  Try to read each word aloud.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;עברית &lt;/font&gt;(Hebrew)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;את &lt;/font&gt;(you, feminine)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;לא &lt;/font&gt;(no)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מבין &lt;/font&gt;(understand, masculine)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מדברת &lt;/font&gt;(speak, feminine)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אני &lt;/font&gt;(I)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מדבר &lt;/font&gt;(speak, masculine)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אתה &lt;/font&gt;(you, masculine)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אנגלית &lt;/font&gt;(English)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;כן &lt;/font&gt;(yes)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מבינה &lt;/font&gt;(understand, feminine)&lt;br&gt;

Now without the translation hints... how do you pronounce the word or phrase and what does it mean?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מדברת &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;את &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;   אני לא מדברת אנגלית &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;לא &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מדבר &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אתה &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אנגלית &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מבין &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אני &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;עברית &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;כן &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מבינה &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Time management is the essence of a effectively managed office schedule.  Measuring of the time required for various processes is the first step.  A typical office scheduling program will designate a proscibed interval for a new patient visit and for a return visit.  One trap this practice creates is that a new patient may have a problem which can be dispatched in short order and an established patient may have a litany of complaints or may be coming in at a time when a discussion at length is required as an important decision point has been reached in their treatment course.  As a result the schedule which alots time according to new or established may bear little correlation to the time expended.

This recipe has been improved on over the generations. The reason why this is cooked on the stove top &amp; only browned in the oven is that in Greek villages there was a shared village oven. So dishes like these were popular as they could be browned after the bread had been baked.

==Ingredients==

* 2 Tablespoons stale breadcrumbs to top

===Pasta Mix===
* 250g macaroni pasta.
* 2 eggs whole beaten lightly.
* ¾ cup grated fresh Parmesan or [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|Feta cheese]]

===Meat Sauce===
* 2 tablespoons olive oil.
* 2 medium chopped onions.
* 750g minced meat (or make it yourself in a food processor).
* 400&amp;ndash;450g canned chopped tomatoes.
* ⅓ cup tomato paste.
* ½ cup water.
* ¼ cup dry white wine.
* 1 tablespoon beef stock powder.
* ½ teaspoon cinnamon powder.
* 1 egg beaten lightly.

===Greek style Bechamel sauce===
* 100g butter.
* ½ cup plain flour.
* 3½ cups milk.
* 1 cup grated fresh Parmesan cheese.
* 2 egg yolks.

== Equipment required ==
* 2.5 litre (10 cup) baking dish - metal, glass or ceramic are fine.
* 2 large saucepans for Meat sauce and pasta.
* 1 medium to large saucepan for Bechamel sauce.

To avoid a large clean up at the end just reuse the same saucepan.

== Procedure ==

It is a good idea to start your meat sauce first as this needs to cool before you can begin construction.

=== Meat Sauce ===
# Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
# Sauté 2 chopped onions then,
# Add 750g of minced meat cook until well browned.
# Add 400&amp;ndash;450g of chopped canned tomatoes liquid and all.
# Add ⅓ cup tomato paste.
# Add ½ cup water.
# Add ¼ cup wine.
# Add 1 tablespoon beef stock powder.
# Add ½ teaspoon cinnamon powder. 
# Simmer uncovered, until it becomes thick in consistency.
# Once thick transfer into a mixing bowl to cool.
# Once cool stir in 1 lightly beaten egg.

=== Greek Style Bechamel sauce === 
# Melt 100g butter in pan
# Add ½ cup plain flour
# Stir over heat until bubbling. 
# Remove pan from heat.
# Gradually add 3½ cups milk. The mixture will become thick and will then thin again)
# Return pan to heat until sauce bubbles then thickens. 
# Stir in 1 cup Parmesan cheese.
# Transfer to mixing bowl.
# Cool slightly. 
# Mix in 2 egg yolks.

=== Pasta Mix === 
# Cook 250 g macaroni pasta as per directions on packet until tender.
# Drain pasta.
# Transfer pasta to mixing bowl
# Mix pasta while hot with
# ¾ cup Parmesan cheese and,
# 2 eggs which are lightly beaten.

=== Construction === 
# Grease baking dish.
# Press pasta mix into base of pan.
# Top pasta mix with the Meat sauce.
# Pour over the Greek style Bechamel Sauce over the meat sauce the smooth the top.
# Sprinkle 2 tablespoons stale breadcrumbs over the top.

In a preheated oven, bake at 180 degrees Celsius / 350 degrees Fahrenheit for  1 hour until golden brown.

Stand for at least 10 mins before serving.

Leftovers freeze well so it is a great freezer cooking dish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome Soulaegis!

There is a committee working on finalizing a proposal for the Board to review, approve and activate our final permanent wikispace.  http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikiversity_subcommittee

What kinds of things are you interested in learning, coaching, or discussing?

Do you have any ideas regarding how we might initialize new learning processes?

I am currently leaning towards identifying some seminars of interest to several active editors and then beginning ad hoc discussions at an appropriately placed portal.  Personally I do not have much inclination to develop &quot;training&quot; materials that may or may not ever be used by anybody but I am fairly willing to interact with people one on one,  pursue online information in support of discussion, and eventually help summarize key points to stash along a &quot;learning trail&quot;.

I am interested in seeing if a Wikiversity can be developed that can take an interested motivated student from grade school to high end technical materials effectively and safely.

Hope to see you around! [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 06:47, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

I'd like to add a personal thanks to helping fight blatant vandalism.  Your help is very much appreciated, and thank you for using the proper deletion tags as well.  The pages you marked up earlier are now gone from the project.  It is unfortunate that there exist in this world idiots who would trash something that is a public service, although fortunately with Wikis you can remove the damage almost as easily as they can cause the damage.  Even faster in some cases.

Wikiversity is just about ready to &quot;go live&quot; and I estimate that it will be less than three months before http://en.wikiversity.org/ actually has some real content for you to look at.  I'm not sure why there is a delay at the moment to get this started, but there are some people trying to get this going.  Any help you can offer in the initial startup of Wikiversity would be significantly appreciated.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:07, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

I saw your name on the Wikiversity participant's list, you may be very experienced in mathematics already, but I'm trying out instructing a Calculus course if you're interested, go to Wikiveristy, check out the mathematics department, pure mathematics, and in the course list is included Calculus.

The most basic collection interface is called &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;. This interface gives the user a generic usage of a collection. All collections need to have the same basic operations. Those are:
* Adding element(s) to the collection
* Removing element(s) from the collection
* Obtaining the number of elements in the collection
* Listing the contents of the collection, (Iterating through the collection)

    myCollection.add(&quot;2&quot;);
    myCollection.add(&quot;3&quot;);
    System.out.println(&quot;The collection contains &quot; + myCollection.size() + &quot; item(s).&quot;);

    myCollection.clear();
    if (myCollection.isEmpty()) {
      System.out.println(&quot;The collection is empty.&quot;);
    } else {

When you put an object in a collection, this object is not actually ''in'' the collection. Only its object reference is added to the collection. This means that if an object is changed after it was put in an collection, the object in the collection also changes. The [[#code-listing-2|code listing 5.2]] computes the seven next days from tomorrow and store each date in a list to read it after. See what happens:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-2&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 5.2: SevenNextDays.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;15, 21&quot;&gt;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.GregorianCalendar;

public class SevenNextDays {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
   
    // The calendar is set at the current date: today
    Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar();

    Collection collectionOfDays = new ArrayList();
    Date currentDate = new Date();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 7; ++i) {
      // The calendar is now set to the next day
      calendar.add(Calendar.DATE, 1);
      currentDate.setTime(calendar.getTimeInMillis());

      collectionOfDays.add(currentDate);
    }

    for (Object oneDay : collectionOfDays) {
      System.out.println(&quot;The next day is: &quot; + oneDay);
    }
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Console for Code listing 5.2'''
&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
&lt;code style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;The next day is: {{#time: D M j G:i:s T Y|+ 7 days}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;code style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;The next day is: {{#time: D M j G:i:s T Y|+ 7 days}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;code style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;The next day is: {{#time: D M j G:i:s T Y|+ 7 days}}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;}}
|}

Each collection items were said to be updated to a different date but they all have been updated to the last one. It means that each update has updated all the collection items. And this is the case. The &lt;code&gt;currentDate&lt;/code&gt; has been used to fill all the collection items. The collection didn't keep trace of the added values (one of the seven dates) but the added object references (&lt;code&gt;currentDate&lt;/code&gt;). So the collection contains the same object seven times! To avoid this issue, we should have coded it this way:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-3&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 5.3: ActualSevenNextDays.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;16&quot;&gt;

import java.util.GregorianCalendar;

public class ActualSevenNextDays {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
   
    // The calendar is set at the current date: today
    Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar();

    Collection collectionOfDays = new ArrayList();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 7; ++i) {
      Date currentDate = new Date();
      // The calendar is now set to the next day
      calendar.add(Calendar.DATE, 1);
      currentDate.setTime(calendar.getTimeInMillis());

      collectionOfDays.add(currentDate);
    }

    for (Object oneDay : collectionOfDays) {
      System.out.println(&quot;The next day is: &quot; + oneDay);
    }
  }

&lt;code style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;The next day is: {{#time: D M j G:i:s T Y|+ 6 days}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;The next day is: {{#time: D M j G:i:s T Y|+ 7 days}}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;}}
|}

Now each time we add an item to the collection, it is a different instance. All the items evolve separately. To add an object in a collection and avoid this item to be changed each time the source object is changed, you have to copy or clone the object before you add it to the collection.

== Generics ==
Objects put into a collection are upcasted to {{java:Object}} class.  It means that you need to cast the object reference back when you get an element out from the collection.  It also means that '''you need to know''' the type of the object when you take it out. If a collection contains different types of objects, we will have difficulty finding out the type of the objects obtained from a collection at run time. Let's use a collection with any objects in it:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-1&quot;&gt;'''Code section 5.1: Collection feeding.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2, 3&quot;&gt;
Collection ageList = new ArrayList();
ageList.add(new Integer(46));
ageList.add(&quot;50&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-2&quot;&gt;'''Code section 5.2: Collection reading.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Integer sum = new Integer(0);
for (Object age : ageList) {
    sum = sum.add((Integer) age);
}

if (!ageList.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println(&quot;The average age is &quot; + sum / ageList.size());
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Console for Code section 5.2'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
ClassCastException.
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

This error could have been fixed earlier, at compile time, using generic types.

The [[Java Programming/Generics|Generics]] has been added since JDK version 1.5. It is an enhancement to the type system of the Java language.  All collection implementations since 1.5 now have one ''parameterized type &lt;E&gt;'' added.  The ''E'' refers to an ''Element'' type.  When a collection is created, the actual ''Element type'' will replace the E.  In the collection, the objects are now upcasted to ''E'' class.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-3&quot;&gt;'''Code section 5.3: Collection with generics.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Collection&lt;Integer&gt; ageList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
ageList.add(new Integer(46));     // Integer can be added
ageList.add(&quot;50&quot;);                // Compilation error, ageList can have only Integers inside
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

&lt;code&gt; ageList &lt;/code&gt; is a collection that can contain only Integer objects as elements. No casting is required when we take out an element.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-4&quot;&gt;'''Code section 5.4: Item reading.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Integer age = ageList.get(0);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Generics is not mandatory but it is often used with the collection classes.

== Collection classes ==
There is no direct implementation for the &lt;code&gt;java.util.Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface.  The Collection interface has five sub interfaces.
{{Java/Illustration
|number=1
|caption=The five sub interfaces of the &lt;code&gt;java.util.Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface.
|image=[[File:Java collection interfaces.svg|400px|center]]
}}

=== Set ===
A set collection contains unique elements, so duplicates are not allowed. It is similar to a mathematical Set. When adding a new item to a set, the set calls the method &lt;code&gt;int hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; of the item and compare it to the hash code of all the already inserted items. If the hash code has not been found, the item is added. If it is, the set now call the &lt;code&gt;boolean equals(Object obj);&lt;/code&gt; method with all the set items. If all calls returns false, the item is inserted. If not, the item is not inserted.
{{Java/Illustration
|number=2
|caption=Set class diagram.
|image=[[File:Java collection set implementations.jpg|650px|center]]
}}

; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.&lt;/span&gt;HashSet&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : This is the basic implementation of the &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; interface. Not synchronized. Allows the {{java:null}} elements
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.&lt;/span&gt;TreeSet&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: Elements are sorted, not synchronized. {{java:null}} not allowed
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.&lt;/span&gt;CopyOnWriteArraySet&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : Thread safe, a fresh copy is created during modification operation. Add, update, delete are expensive.
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.&lt;/span&gt;EnumSet&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E extends Enum&lt;E&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : All of the elements in an enum set must come from a single enum type that is specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the set is created. Enum sets are represented internally as bit vectors.
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.&lt;/span&gt;LinkedHashSet&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : Same as HashSet, plus defines the iteration ordering, which is the order in which elements were inserted into the set.

====Detecting duplicate objects in Sets====

&lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; cannot have duplicates in it. You may wonder how duplicates are detected when we are adding an object to the &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt;. We have to see if that object exists in the Set or not. It is not enough to check the object references, the objects' values have to be checked as well.

To do that, fortunately, each java object has the [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.Object#equals() Method|&lt;code&gt;boolean equals(Object obj)&lt;/code&gt;]], method available inherited from {{java:Object}}. You need to override it. That method will be called by the Set implementation to compare the two objects to see if they are equal or not.

There is a problem, though. What if I put two different type of objects to the Set. I put an Apple and an Orange. They can not be compared.  Calling the [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.Object#equals() Method|&lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt;]] method would cause a &lt;code&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/code&gt;. There are two solutions to this:

* '''Solution one''' : Override the [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.Object#hashCode() Method|&lt;code&gt;int hashCode()&lt;/code&gt;]] method and return the same values for the same type of objects and return different values for different type of objects.  The [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.Object#equals() Method|&lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt;]] method is used to compare objects only with the same value of hashCode. So before an object is added, the Set implementation needs to:
** find all the objects in the Set that have the same hashCode as the candidate object hashCode
** and for those, call the [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.Object#equals() Method|&lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt;]] methods passing in the candidate object
** if any of them returns true, the object is not added to the Set.

* '''Solution two''' : Create a super class for the Apple and Orange, let's call it Fruit class. Put Fruits in the Set. You need to do the following:
** Do not override the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; methods in the Apple and Orange classes
** Create &lt;code&gt;appleEquals()&lt;/code&gt; method in the Apple class, and create &lt;code&gt;orangeEquals()&lt;/code&gt; method in the Orange class
** Override the &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; method in the Fruit class and return the same value, so the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; is called by the Set implementation
** Override the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; method in the Fruit class for something like this.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-5&quot;&gt;'''Code section 5.5: &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; method implementation.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    boolean ret = false;
    if (this instanceof Apple &amp;&amp;
          obj instanceof Apple) {
        ret = this.appleEquals(obj);
    } else if (this instanceof Orange &amp;&amp;
              obj  instanceof Orange) {
        ret = this.orangeEquals(obj);  
    } else {
        // Can not compare Orange to Apple
       ret = false;
    }
    return ret;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
'''Note:'''
* Only the objects that have the same hashCode will be compared.
* You are responsible to override the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; methods. The default implementations in Object won't work.
* Only override the [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.Object#hashCode() Method|&lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt;]] method if you want to eliminate value duplicates.
* Do not override the [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.Object#hashCode() Method|&lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt;]] method if you know that the values of your objects are different, or if you only want to prevent adding the exactly same object.
* Beware that the [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.Object#hashCode() Method|&lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt;]] may be used in other collection implementations, like in a Hashtable to find an object fast. Overriding the default &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; method may affect performance there.
* The default hashCodes are unique for each object created, so if you decide not to override the &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; method, there is no point overriding the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; method, as it won't be called.

==== SortedSet ====

The &lt;code&gt;SortedSet&lt;/code&gt; interface is the same as the Set interface plus the elements in the SortedSet are sorted. It extends the Set Interface. All elements in the SortedSet must implement the Comparable Interface, furthermore all elements must be mutually comparable.

Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the Set interface. This is so because the Set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compare method, so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted set, equal.

The SortedSet interface has additional methods due to the sorted nature of the 'Set'.  Those are:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;E first();&lt;/code&gt;
| returns the first element
|-
| &lt;code&gt;E last();&lt;/code&gt;
| returns the last element
|-
| &lt;code&gt;SortedSet headSet(E toElement);&lt;/code&gt;
| returns from the first, to the exclusive toElement
|-
| &lt;code&gt;SortedSet tailSet(E fromElement);&lt;/code&gt;
| returns from the inclusive fromElement to the end
|-
| &lt;code&gt;SortedSet subSet(E fromElement, E toElement);&lt;/code&gt;
| returns elements range from fromElement, inclusive, to toElement, exclusive. (If fromElement and toElement are equal, the returned sorted set is empty.)
|}

=== List ===
In a list collection, the elements are put in a certain order, and can be accessed by an index.  Duplicates are allowed, the same element can be added twice to a list. It has the following implementations:
{{Java/Illustration
|number=3
|caption=List class diagram.
|image=[[File:Java collection list implementations.jpg|650px|center]]
}}

; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.&lt;/span&gt;Vector&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : Synchronized, use in multiple thread access, otherwise use [[Java Programming/ArrayList|ArrayList]].
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.&lt;/span&gt;Stack&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : It extends class Vector with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. It represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects.
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.&lt;/span&gt;ArrayList&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : The basic implementation of the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; interface is the &lt;code&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt;. The ArrayList is not synchronized, not thread safe. &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt; is synchronized, and thread safe. &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt; is slower, because of the extra overhead to make it thread safe.  When only one thread is accessing the list, use the ArrayList. Whenever you insert or remove an element from the list, there are extra overhead to reindex the list. When you have a large list, and you have lots of insert and remove, consider using the &lt;code&gt;LinkedList&lt;/code&gt;.
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.&lt;/span&gt;LinkedList&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : Non-synchronized, update operation is faster than other lists, easy to use for stacks, queues, double-ended queues. The name &lt;code&gt;LinkedList&lt;/code&gt; implies a special data structure where the elements/nodes are connected by pointers.
   
  Head               Node 1                   Node 2                     Node n

Each node is related to an item of the linked list. To remove an element from the linked list the pointers need to be rearranged. After removing Node 2:

; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;javax.management.&lt;/span&gt;AtributeList&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : Represents a list of values for attributes of an MBean. The methods used for the insertion of Attribute objects in the AttributeList overrides the corresponding methods in the superclass ArrayList. This is needed in order to insure that the objects contained in the AttributeList are only Attribute objects.
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;javax.management.relation.&lt;/span&gt;RoleList&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : A RoleList represents a list of roles (Role objects). It is used as parameter when creating a relation, and when trying to set several roles in a relation (via 'setRoles()' method). It is returned as part of a RoleResult, to provide roles successfully retrieved.
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;javax.management.relation.&lt;/span&gt;RoleUnresolvedList&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : A RoleUnresolvedList represents a list of RoleUnresolved objects, representing roles not retrieved from a relation due to a problem encountered when trying to access (read or write to roles).

== Queue ==
The Queue interface provides additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations. There are FIFO (first in, first out) and LIFO (last in, first out) queues. This interface adds the following operations to the Collection interface:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;E element()&lt;/code&gt;
| Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue. This method differs from the peek method only in that it throws an exception if this queue is empty
|-
| &lt;code&gt;boolean offer(E o)&lt;/code&gt;
| Inserts the specified element into this queue, if possible.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;E peek()&lt;/code&gt;
| Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, returning null if this queue is empty
|-
| &lt;code&gt;E poll()&lt;/code&gt;
| Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or null if this queue is empty
|-
| &lt;code&gt;E remove()&lt;/code&gt;
| Retrieves and removes the head of this queue. This method differs from the poll method in that it throws an exception if this queue is empty.

; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.&lt;/span&gt;BlockingQueue&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : waits for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and waits for space to become available in the queue when storing an element. Best used for producer-consumer queues.
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.&lt;/span&gt;PriorityQueue&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : orders elements according to an order/priority  specified at construction time, null element is not allowed.
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.concurrent.&lt;/span&gt;ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : orders elements FIFO; synchronized, thread safe.
; &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;java.util.concurrent.&lt;/span&gt;SynchronousQueue&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : each put must wait for a take, and vice versa, does not have any internal capacity, not even a capacity of one, an element is only present when you try to take it; you cannot add an element (using any method) unless another thread is trying to remove it.

== Complete UML class diagram ==
{{Java/Illustration
|number=5
|caption=UML class diagram of the &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; interfaces and their implementations.
|image=[[File:Java collection implementation.jpg|700px|center]]
}}

== Synchronization ==
Synchronization is important when you are running several threads. Beware, synchronization does not mean that your collection is thread-safe. A thread-safe collection is also called a ''concurrent collection''. Most of the popular collection classes have implementations for both single thread and multiple thread environments. The non-synchronized implementations are always faster. You can use the non-synchronized implementations in multiple thread environments, when you make sure that only one thread updates the collection at any given time.

A new Java JDK package was introduced at Java 1.5, that is &lt;code&gt;java.util.concurrent&lt;/code&gt;.  This package supplies a few Collection implementations designed for use in multi-threaded environments.

The following table lists all the synchronized collection classes:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|-
|
! synchronized
! non-synchronized
|-
| rowspan=4 | List
| java.util.Vector
| java.util.ArrayList
|-
| java.util.Stack
|
|-
|
| java.util.LinkedList
|-
| java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList
|
|-
| rowspan=4 | Set
|
| java.util.TreeSet
|-
|
| java.util.HashSet
|-
|
| java.util.LinkHashSet
|-
| java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArraySet
|
|}

== Custom collection ==
The Java JDK collection implementations are quite powerful and good, so it is unlikely that you will need to write your own. The usage of the different collections are the same but the implementations are different. If the existing collection implementations do not meet your needs, you can write your version of the implementation. Your version of the implementation just needs to implement the same &lt;code&gt;java.util.Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface, then you can switch to using your implementation and the code that is using the collection does not need to be changed.

Use the Collection interface if you need to keep related (usually the same type of) objects together in a collection where you can:
* Search for a particular element
* List the elements
* Maintain and/or change the order of the elements by using the collection basic operations (Add, Remove, Update,..)
* Access the elements by an index number

The advantages of using the &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface are:
* Gives a generic usage, as we talked about above, it is easy to switch implementation
* It makes it easy to convert one type of collection to another.

The &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface defines the following basic operations:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;boolean add(E o);&lt;/code&gt;
| Using Element type E
|-
| &lt;code&gt;boolean addAll(Collection c);&lt;/code&gt;
|
|-
| &lt;code&gt;boolean remove({{java:Object}} o);&lt;/code&gt;
|
|-
| &lt;code&gt;boolean removeAll(Collection c);&lt;/code&gt;
|
|-
| &lt;code&gt;boolean retainAll(Collection c);&lt;/code&gt;
| Return {{java:true}} if the collection has changed due to the operation.
|}
Note that in &lt;code&gt;addAll()&lt;/code&gt; we can add any type of collection.  This is the beauty of using the Collection interface. You can have a &lt;code&gt;LinkedList&lt;/code&gt; and just call the &lt;code&gt;addAll(list)&lt;/code&gt; method, passing in a list.  You can pass in a &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt;, an &lt;code&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;HashSet&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;TreeSet&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;YourImpOfCollection&lt;/code&gt;, ...
All those different types of collection will be '''magically''' converted to a &lt;code&gt;LinkedList&lt;/code&gt;.

Let's have a closer look at this ''magic''.  The conversion is easy because the &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface defines  a standard way of looping through the elements.  The following code is a possible implementation of &lt;code&gt;addAll()&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code&gt;LinkedList&lt;/code&gt;.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-6&quot;&gt;'''Code section 5.6: Collection transfer.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
import java.util.Collection
import java.util.Iterator
...
public boolean addAll(Collection coll) {
   int sizeBefore = this.size();
   Iterator iter = coll.iterator();
   while(iter.hasNext()) {
      this.add(iter.next());
   }
   if (sizeBefore &gt; this.size()) {
      return true;
   } else {
      return false;
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
The above code just iterates through the passed in collection and adds the elements to the linked list. You do not have to do that, since that is already defined. What you might need to code for is to loop through a &lt;code&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; collection:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-7&quot;&gt;'''Code section 5.7: Iteration on a collection.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
import java.util.Collection
import java.util.Iterator
import java.yourcompany.Customer
...
public String printCustomerNames(Collection customerColl) {
   StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer();

   Iterator iter = customerColl.iterator();
   while(iter.hasNext()) {
      Customer cust = (Customer) iter.next();
      buf.append(cust.getName());
      buf.append( &quot;\n&quot; );
   }
  return buf.toString();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Notice two things:
* The above code will work for all type of collections.
* We have to know the type of objects inside the collection, because we call a method on it.

http://www.denit.nl/ - any package with MSSQL option&lt;br&gt;
http://www.nitroserve.nl/ - starter package and up (MSSQL express is on request without additional costs)

=== What type of webhosting do I need? ===

Your hosting package needs to support the following:

* ASP.NET 1.1 or ASP.NET 2.0
* One of the following database servers
** Microsoft SQL Server 2000
** Microsoft SQL Desktop Engine 2000 (MSDE)
** Microsoft SQL Server 2005
** Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition

Your hosting provider must support running code under .NET Full Trust. Medium Trust (the standard shared hosting configuration for ASP.NET) support will be provided with Umbraco 4.1 (currently in beta).

== '''Installation''' ==

=== While the installation process, a 'invalid object name umbracoUser' error occures ===

This error may appear, if the ''web.config''-key &quot;umbracoEnableStat&quot; is changed from ''false'' to ''true'' prior the installation. The key must not be changed to anything else than ''false'' until the installation procedure using the wizard is completed.

It seems it is possible that the installation is ready to continue but for some reason does not do so. Try browsing to http://localhost/install and setup might continue (if your installation is in http://localhost)

This error may also appear when umbraco is installed in a virtual directory. When your virtual directory is named myvirtualdir, change the web.config in a way that the keys umbracoReservedPaths and umbracoPath contain the name of the virtual directory, like 
&lt;code&gt;&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoReservedPaths&quot; value=&quot;/myvirtualdir/umbraco,/myvirtualdir/install/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoPath&quot; value=&quot;/myvirtualdir/umbraco&quot; /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The above is perhaps misleading, Umbraco does not support being installed in a virtual directory.

=== After successful installation a 'No node found' error occures ===
After successful installation the following error occures: &lt;pre&gt;No node found (http://localhost/default.aspx?umbPage=/default.aspx, '/root/node [@urlName = &quot;&quot;] | /root/node')&lt;/pre&gt;
This is because there aren't any pages yet. Go to your administration area (http://foo.bar/umbraco), login and create some content first.

== '''Getting Started''' ==

=== I've installed Umbraco, now what? ===

There are three screencasts [http://old.umbraco.org/frontpage/demos.aspx here] which will introduce you to the Umbraco UI and how to get started creating Document types and templates.

== '''Configuration''' ==

=== Email Configuration ===

==== Where can I configure my SMTP server? ====

The SMTP server is set in the web.config file which is in the root folder of your Umbraco installation.

You need to set the following key:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoSmtpServer&quot; value=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== How can I change the email address that notifications are sent from? ====

The sender of notifications is set in the umbracoSettings.xml which is in the config folder under the root of your Umbraco installation.

You need to modify the following section to contain the e-mail address you wish to use as the sender:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;notifications&gt;
	&lt;!-- the email that should be used as from mail when umbraco sends a notification --&gt;
	&lt;email&gt;darren@xxxx.com&lt;/email&gt;
&lt;/notifications&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You might also need to change the settings in formHandlers.xml located in the same directory

&lt;pre&gt;
	&lt;parameter alias=&quot;sender&quot;&gt;robot@umbraco.dk&lt;/parameter&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== How can I change the text in the Umbraco notifications Email? ====

The notification Email message is set in the appropriate localised xml file for he language that you are using in the directory umbraco\config\lang under your Umbraco installation directory.

You will need to modify the following section:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;area alias=&quot;notifications&quot; version=&quot;2.1&quot;&gt;
	&lt;key alias=&quot;notifications&quot; version=&quot;2.1&quot;&gt;Notifications&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;key alias=&quot;editNotifications&quot; version=&quot;2.1&quot;&gt;Edit your notification for %0%&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;key alias=&quot;mailSubject&quot; version=&quot;2.1&quot;&gt;[%0%] Notification about %1% performed on %2%&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;key alias=&quot;mailBody&quot; version=&quot;2.1&quot;&gt;
Hello %0%

This is an automated mail to inform you that the task '%1%'
has been performed on the page '%2%'
by the user '%3%'
		
Go to http://%4%/umbraco/default.aspx?section=content&amp;amp;id=%5% to edit.
			
	&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;/area&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


=== Umbraco settings ===

==== How could I set a default 404 error page? ====
Open /config/umbracoSettings.xml
Find the line that says &lt;error404&gt;1&lt;/error404&gt; and replace 1 with 
the id of the page you want to show.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;errors&gt;
   &lt;!--  the id of the page that should be shown if the page is not found --&gt; 
   &lt;error404&gt;1&lt;/error404&gt; 
&lt;/errors&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are using IIS7 you have to add the following to web.config;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;system.webServer&gt;
  &lt;httpErrors existingResponse=&quot;PassThrough&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/system.webServer&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== How could I Use DirectoryUrls? ====
Why should you enable this?
This changes the links to the pages from example http://www.mydomain.com/news.aspx to 
http://www.mydomain.com/news

Open /config/umbracoSettings.xml
Find the line that says &lt;umbracoUseDirectoryUrls&gt;false&lt;/umbracoUseDirectoryUrls&gt; and replace false with true.
It should then be like this
&lt;pre&gt;
   &lt;umbracoUseDirectoryUrls&gt;true&lt;/umbracoUseDirectoryUrls&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then you have to let IIS handle all requests.
===== IIS 6.0 2003 server =====
Follow these instructions [http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/library/cd17b80e-56bc-4fd8-be5e-c79c53144e8e1033.mspx?mfr=true]

== '''Templating''' ==

=== How could I display a page with an alternative template? ===
Just set the 'altTemplate' parameter in the query string to the alias of your desired template. For example 
&lt;pre&gt;
http://foo.bar/page.aspx?altTemplate=MyAltTemplateAlias
&lt;/pre&gt;

== '''Rich-Text Editor''' ==

=== How do I change the stylesheet that is used in the built-in editor? ===
You can change the behaviour by adding some editor css to the first
stylesheet in the list.

&lt;pre&gt;
#holderBody {
	background: #fff;
}

#holder {
	border: 1px solid #ccc;
	padding: 10px;
	margin: 5px;
	text-align: left;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== '''Where can I get help?''' ==

__NOTOC__
{{Java Programming/ClassesAndObjectsTopic/Nav}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Before a Java object can be created the class byte code must be loaded from the file system (with &lt;code&gt;.class&lt;/code&gt; extension) to memory. This process of locating the byte code for a given class name and converting that code into a Java [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.Class|class]] instance is known as ''class loading''. There is one class created for each type of Java class.

All objects in Java programs are created on heap memory.  An object is created based on its class.  You can consider a class as a blueprint, template, or a description how to create an object.  When an object is created, memory is allocated to hold the object properties. An object reference pointing to that memory location is also created. To use the object in the future, that object reference has to be stored as a local variable or as an object member variable.

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) keeps track of the usage of object references.  If there are no more reference to the object, the object can not be used any more and becomes garbage.  After a while the heap memory  will be full of  unused objects.  The JVM collects those garbage objects and frees the memory they allocated, so the memory can be reused again when a new object is created.  See below a simple example:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 4.30: Object creation.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
{
  // Create an object
  MyObject obj = new MyObject();

  // Use the object
  obj.printMyValues();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; variable contains the object reference pointing to an object created from the &lt;code&gt;MyObject&lt;/code&gt; class. The &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; object reference is in [[Java Programming/Scope|scope]] inside the &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;.  After the &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; the object becomes garbage.  Object references can be passed in to methods and can be returned from methods.

== Creating object with the {{java:new}} keyword ==
99% of new objects are created using the {{java:new}} keyword.
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-13&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.13: MyProgram.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
public class MyProgram {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create an 'MyObject' for the first time the application started
    MyObject obj = new MyObject();
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

When an object from the &lt;code&gt;MyObject&lt;/code&gt; class is created for the first time, the JVM searches the file system for the definition of the class, that is the Java byte code. The file has the extension of &lt;code&gt;*.class&lt;/code&gt;.  The '''CLASSPATH''' environment variable contains locations where Java classes are stored.  The JVM is looking for the &lt;code&gt;MyObject.class&lt;/code&gt; file. Depending on which package the class belongs to, the package name will be translated to a directory path.

When the &lt;code&gt;MyObject.class&lt;/code&gt; file is found, the JVM's class loader loads the class in memory, and creates a Class object. The JVM stores the code in memory, allocates memory for the {{java:static}} variables, and executes any static initialize block.  Memory is not allocated for the object member variables at this point, memory will be allocated for them when an instance of the class, an object, is created.

There is no limit on how many objects from the same class can be created.  Code and {{java:static}} variables are stored only once, no matter how many objects are created. Memory is allocated for the object member variables when the object is created.  Thus, the size of an object is determined not by its code's size but by the memory it needs for its member variables to be stored.

== Creating object by cloning an object ==

Cloning is not automatically available to classes. There is some help though, as all Java objects inherit the &lt;code&gt;protected Object clone()&lt;/code&gt; method. This base method would allocate the memory and do the bit by bit copying of the object's states.  

You may ask why we need this clone method. Couldn't I create a constructor and just passing in the same object, and do the copying variable by variable? Let's see:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-14&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.14: MyObject.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
public class MyObject {
   private int memberVar;
...
   MyObject(MyObject obj) {
      this.memberVar = obj.memberVar;
    ...
   }
...
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

You might think that accessing the private &lt;code&gt;memberVar&lt;/code&gt; variable of &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; would fail but as this is in the same class this code is legal. The &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; method copies the whole object's memory in one operation. This is much faster than using the new keyword. Object creation with the {{java:new}} keyword is expensive, so if you need to create lots of objects with the same type, performance will be better if you create one object and clone new ones from it. See below a factory method that will return a new object using cloning.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 4.31: Object cloning.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
HashTable cacheTemplate = new HashTable;
...
/** Clone Customer object for performance reason */
public Customer createCustomerObject() {
   // See if a template object exists in our cache
   Customer template = cacheTemplate.get(&quot;Customer&quot;);
   if (template == null) {
      // Create template
      template = new Customer();
      cacheTemplate.put(&quot;Customer&quot;, template);
   }
  return template.clone();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Now, let's see how to make the Customer object cloneable.
# First the &lt;code&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; class needs to implement the &lt;code&gt;Cloneable&lt;/code&gt; Interface.
# Override and make the &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; method {{java:public}}, as that is {{java:protected}} in the Object class.
# Call the &lt;code&gt;super.clone()&lt;/code&gt;method at the beginning of your &lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt; method.
# Override the &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; method in all the subclasses of &lt;code&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt;.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-15&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.15: Customer.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class Customer implements Cloneable {
 ...
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
       Object obj = super.clone();

       return obj;
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
In the [[#code-listing-15|code listing 4.15]] we used cloning for speed up object creation. Another use of cloning could be to take a snapshot of an object that can change in time. Let's say we want to store Customer objects in a collection, but we want to disassociate them from the 'live' objects.  So before adding the object, we clone them, so if the original object changes from that point forward, the added object won't.  Also let's say that the Customer object has a reference to an Activity object that contains the customer activities.  Now we are facing a problem, it is not enough to clone the Customer object, we also need to clone the referenced objects.  The solution:
# Make the Activity class also cloneable
# Make sure that if the Activity class has other 'changeable' object references, those has to be cloned as well, as seen below
# Change the Customer class &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; method as follows:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-16&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.16: Customer.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;8-10&quot;&gt;
public class Customer implements Cloneable {
  Activity activity;
  ...
    public Customer clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
      Customer clonedCustomer = (Customer) super.clone();

      // Clone the object referenced objects
      if (activity != null) {
         clonedCustomer.setActivity((Activity) activity.clone());
      }
      return clonedCustomer;
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Note that only mutable objects needs to be cloned. References to unchangeable objects such as String be used in the cloned object without worry.

== Creating object receiving from a remote source ==
When an object is sent through a network, the object needs to be '''recreated''' at the receiving host.

; Object Serialization : The term ''Object Serialization'' refers to the act of converting the object to a byte stream. The byte stream can be stored on the file system, or can be sent through a network.  
:At the later time the object can be re-created from that stream of bytes. The only requirement is that the same class has to be available at both times, when the object is serialized and also when the object is re-created. If that happens in different servers, then the same class must be available on both servers.  Same class means that exactly the same version of the class must be available, otherwise the object won't be able to be re-created. This is a maintenance problem to those applications where java serialization is used to persist object or sent the object through the network.  
:When a class is modified, there could be a problem re-creating those objects that were serialized using an earlier version of the class.

Java has built-in support for serialization, using the &lt;code&gt;Serializable&lt;/code&gt; interface; however, a class must first implement the &lt;code&gt;Serializable&lt;/code&gt; interface.

By default, a class will have all of its fields serialized when converted into a data stream (with {{Java:transient}} fields being skipped).  If additional handling is required beyond the default of writing all fields, you need to provide an implementation for methods:

:&lt;code&gt;private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException;&lt;/code&gt;

:&lt;code&gt;private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;&lt;/code&gt;

:&lt;code&gt;private void readObjectNoData() throws ObjectStreamException;&lt;/code&gt;

If the object needs to write or provide a replacement object during serialization, it needs to implement the following two methods, with any access specifier:
:&lt;code&gt;Object writeReplace() throws ObjectStreamException;&lt;/code&gt;

:&lt;code&gt;Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException;&lt;/code&gt;

Normally, a minor change to the class can cause the serialization to fail.  You can still allow the class to be loaded by defining the serialization version id:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 4.32: Serialization version id.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private static final long serialVersionUID = 42L;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Destroying objects ==
Unlike in many other object-oriented programming languages, Java performs automatic garbage collection &amp;mdash; any unreferenced objects are automatically erased from memory &amp;mdash; and prohibits the user from manually destroying objects.

=== finalize() ===
When an object is garbage-collected, the programmer may want to manually perform cleanup, such as closing any open input/output streams.  To accomplish this, the &lt;code&gt;finalize()&lt;/code&gt; method is used.  Note that &lt;code&gt;finalize()&lt;/code&gt; should never be manually called, except to call a super class' finalize method from a derived class' finalize method.  Also, we can not rely on when the &lt;code&gt;finalize()&lt;/code&gt; method will be called.  If the java application exits before the object is garbage-collected, the &lt;code&gt;finalize()&lt;/code&gt; method may never be called.
{{XExample|1='''Code section 4.33: Finalization.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
  try {
    doCleanup();        // Perform some cleanup.  If it fails for some reason, it is ignored.
  } finally {
    super.finalize(); // Call finalize on the parent object
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The garbage-collector thread runs in a lower priority than the other threads. If the application creates objects faster than the garbage-collector can claim back memory, the program can run out of memory.

The finalize method is required only if there are resources beyond the direct control of the Java Virtual Machine that needs to be cleaned up.  In particular, there is no need to explicitly close an OutputStream, since the OutputStream will close itself when it gets finalized.  Instead, the finalize method is used to release either native or remote resources controlled by the class.

== Class loading ==
One of the main concerns of a developer writing hot re-deployable applications is to understand how class loading works. Within the internals of the class loading mechanism lies the answer to questions like:

* What happens if I pack a newer version of an utility library with my application, while an older version of the same library lingers somewhere in the server's lib directory?
* How can I use two different versions of the same utility library, simultaneously, within the same instance of the application server?
* What version of an utility class I am currently using?
* Why do I need to mess with all this class loading stuff anyway?

==Epidemiology==
*&lt;5% of breast cancer cases
*Rate 1.3 per 100,000 (black highest at 1.6, Pacific Islanders lowest at 0.7)
*Stage: Regional 70%, Distant 25%
*Risk: premenopausal women, high BMI (&gt;26.6)


*'''CDC, 2004''' (1994-1998) PMID 15090727 -- &quot;Population-based statistics for women diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer (United States).&quot; (Wingo PA, Cancer Causes Control. 2004 Apr;15(3):321-8.)

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical (classic signs of inlflammation): warmth, edema (peau d'orange), erythema
*Pathological: presence of tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics
*Often no palpable mass (~50%)
*Often develops &lt;3 months
*Haagensen's grave signs ([http://radiation-oncologist.blogspot.com/2007/11/haagensen-grave-signs.html more info])
**Skin ulceration
**Fixation of tumor to the chest wall
**Edema of &lt; 1/3rd of the skin of breast
**Axillary nodes &gt; 2.5 cm in diameter
**Presence of fixed axillary nodes
*Haagensen's signs of very poor outcome
**Extensive skin edema ( &gt;50% skin involved)
**Satellite skin nodules
**Inflammatory type of cancer
**Clinically involved SCF and Internal Mammary nodes
**Edema of arms
**Presence of any TWO grave signs given above.

==Histology==
*Most poorly differentiated ductal
*Most ER- / PR-


==Treatment Overview==
*Surgery alone poor results: median OS &lt;20 months, 5-year OS &lt;5%
*Surgery + RT also poor results: median OS ~24 months, 5-year OS 5-10%
*As a result, surgery became contra-indicated in IBC (minimal benefit, more morbidity)
*RT alone resulted in a similarly dismal prognosis: 50% local control, but 5-year OS 10% (MD Anderson). Hyperfractionated RT appeared better in a small pilot study at MDACC, with local control improving 54% to 73%
*Gustave Roussy established by 1985 that chemo + RT (AVM or AVCMF) is superior to RT alone
*Washington University and MD Anderson demonstrated in mid-1990s that addition of mastectomy to CRT improves local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival. CR status was predictive of DFS and OS. However, mastectomy benefit on DFS and OS may be limited only to patients who have complete response after induction CRT
*Some trials suggest that high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant may result in improved outcomes; however, randomized evidence is lacking and interest in stem cell transplant for breast cancer seems to have dissipated
*MD Anderson data suggest superiority of 66 Gy in BID fractionation
*An algorithm for management based on PMID 16154355 and PMID 14580242 (see review section below):
**Clinical diagnosis -&gt; Biopsy proven CA -&gt; Metastatic staging
**Neoadjuvant chemo (anthracycline-based or anthracycline/taxane combination)
**If clinical response, then local therapy with either mastectomy + PMRT or primary RT 
***Benefit of mastectomy after CR is not completely clear due to retrospective nature of most studies 
***If mastectomy, then consider more adjuvant chemo, and then follow with PMRT (standard PMRT or could consider MD Anderson schedule)
***Because of high rates of relapse, consider consolidative chemotherapy with antracycline or taxane
***If ER+/PR+, should give 5 years of tamoxifen or anastrazole
**If no clinical response and operable, mastectomy+ALND; then possibly more adjuvant chemo; followed by PMRT
**If no clinical response and not operable, then RT. If still no response, can consider changing to hyperfractionated MD Anderson regimen (1.5 Gy BID to 66 Gy)

==1. What are the soil requirements for growing bramble berries, strawberries, grapes, and blueberries?==
*'''Bramble Berries:''' These include blackberries and raspberries.  Brambles require loamy soil with a lot of organic matter mixed in with it.  They will not tolerate sandy soil, or heavy soil that leaves moisture standing on the roots.  A heavy layer of mulch will help the soil retain water and keep weeds down.

*'''Strawberries:'''  Strawberries need well-worked soil with good drainage and plenty of organic material mixed in with it.

*'''Grapes:''' Grapes require fertile, well-drained soil.  It should be mixed with plenty of compost, but be careful to not over-fertilize.

*'''Blueberries:''' Blueberries require soil that is well-drained and porous.  It should also have lots of organic material in it, and it should be acidic with a pH between 4.5 and 5.5.  A heavy layer of mulch will help the soil retain water and keep weeds down.

==2. Write a one-page report telling how to grow one of the above fruits. Include the following:==
=== a. Variety selection===
The main thing to consider when selecting a variety is whether it is well-suited to the climate in which it will grow.  Check that the variety will grow in your ''hardiness zone''.  The hardiness zone is a number from 1 to 11, with 1 indicating a cold climate, and 11 indicating a warm one.  Many seed packages and seed catalogs have a map showing the hardiness zones.  Make sure the variety of plant you select is suited for your zone number or higher.  

The next thing to consider is the area you intend to plant the variety.  Some are more suited to shade, and others require lots of sun.  Varieties are also suited to different soil pH (which you can control).  Finally, you should consider other factors, such as fruit size, yield, thornless stems, when the fruit is expected to ripen etc.  It is also a good idea to plant multiple varieties.  This can improve disease resistance and stagger the harvest times.

===b. Soil preparation===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Soil preparation}}

===c. Planting techniques===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Planting}}

===d. Fertilizing===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Fertilizing}}

===e. Pruning (where applicable)===
====Blackberries and Raspberries====
Blackberries and raspberries produces canes that live for two years.  A first year cane is called a ''primocane'' and a second year cane is called a ''florocane''.  In most varieties, only the florocanes produce fruit.  Once they produce fruit, they die.  Florocanes should be pruned to the soil line as soon as they are harvested to eliminate an important path to disease.  Primocanes should be pruned in to a height of 18-20 inches (45-50 cm).  This will cause them to send out branches which will bear more fruit.  The branches should be pruned to a length of about 12 inches (30 cm).

====Blueberries====
Blueberries should not be pruned for the first three years.  After that, you should prune every year during the dormant period, removing any of the lower branches that look weak or are less than six inches (15 cm) long.  Remove any branches longer than two inches (5 cm) in diameter (small branches bear larger fruit), and remove a portion of the branches in the center of the plant to allow sunlight to penetrate.  Ideally, you should have about twelve canes per plant, and these should be of different ages.

====Strawberries====
During the first season, remove all blossoms so that the plant puts its energy into building its root system.  A healthy strawberry plant will send out runners every year, and these will take root if not dealt with.  For large berries, do not let these take root, but prune them off instead.  Allow four or five runners to grow into a matted row no wider than 24 inches (60 cm), and trim off any runners that exceed the row boundaries.  Berries are harvested during the second and third years.  After that, they should be plowed under and new plants should be started.

====Grapes====
Before planting grapes, you should set up a two-wire trellis.  This is simply two wires stretched horizontally, one above the other.  The lower wire should be 30 inches (75 cm) from the ground, and the upper should be 60 inches (150 cm) from the ground.  The grapes are planted below the wires and all except the best looking cane are removed.  The remaining cane should be pruned such that only two buds are left.  Don't be afraid to prune grapes - they are vigorous and very forgiving.

During the late winter of the second year, you should again remove all but the best looking canes.  If this cane is higher than the top wire, cut it at that height and tie it tautly to the wire.  If it is not higher than the top wire, prune it to two buds and tie it to the lower wire.  If it is not higher than the lower wire, prune as if it were a first-year cane.

During the late winter of the third year, you should remove all but two of the best canes.  Shorten the two remaining canes so that only four buds remain.

During the fourth year and beyond, you should have two canes per wire, each trained to go in a different direction.  Remove all other canes, keeping the four that originate close to the trunk, and shortening them to six to eight buds each.  Eliminate all other growth.

===f. Watering===
During the early months of the growing season, the soil should be kept moist, but not soggy.  Once the fruit is harvested, the plants should be watered less frequently, but with a good soaking.  Remove any furrows or low spots before winter so that water is not allowed to stand around the plant and induce rot.

===g. Pest control===
When chemical pesticides were first introduced, they were used to the exclusion of all other types of pest control.  This had the unfortunate effect of poisoning the environment.  In the 1970's this situation was recognized, and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques were introduced.  Pesticides are still used, but they are a last resort.

When most people think of pests, they think of insects.  In small fruit cultivation, this term should be expanded to include weeds, microorganisms, and mites.  Pest control depends on the early and correct identification of the pest.  The grower can use cultural mechanical, biological, or chemical controls to reduce the effect of pests on small fruit.  These methods all rely on constant vigilance by the grower.

'''Cultural Controls''' include the selection of disease and pest-resistant cultivars.  Crop rotation  is another important cultural control, as certain pests feed exclusively on one type of plant.  Eliminating the plant from the environment for a year or two will disrupt that cycle. Another important control mechanism is to mulch, water, prune, and fertilize the plants correctly.  A healthy plant is better able to defend itself from pests.

'''Mechanical Controls''' include covering the plants with netting or setting traps for expected (or observed) pests.  Pests can also be removed with vacuums or by hand.  Hoeing and cultivating around the plants will help control weeds.  It is also important to prune diseased canes or remove infected plants from the crop as soon as possible so that the disease does not spread.

'''Biological Controls''' include the introduction of natural predators.  For instance, ladybug beetles feast on aphids, and poultry feed on a number of insect pests.  Be careful when introducing predators though, that you do not introduce a non-native species which has no natural enemies of its own.  This can - and has caused its own form of environmental damage.  You can also use commercially available pheromones to disrupt the mating cycle of many insects.

'''Chemical Controls''' can be used when all else fails.  Selection of a pesticide will depend on the particular pest being combated (which his why proper identification is so important).  Sprays are generally more effective than dusts, as nearly all pesticides rely on contact with the pest for their effectiveness.  Read the instructions on the chemical containers carefully before using, especially noting whether the chemical is safe to use on food plants.  Many times a pesticide will warn against its use for a period of time before harvesting.

===h. Harvesting===
Taste test a few blueberries and grapes before harvesting.  It is difficult to tell if they are fully ripe by the color alone.  Blackberries should be completely black before they are picked.  Raspberries are ready when the berries separate from the plant easily.  Strawberries should be picked daily until they quit producing.  They are ripe when less than 25% of the berry is pink or white.  Strawberries that are 25% white will be ripe the next day.

Place harvested fruits in small shallow baskets.  Deep buckets will cause the berries to become crushed and unmarketable.

==3. Name three varieties of each fruit that will grow well in your area.==
In North America hardiness zones map can be used as a guideline for categorizing locations suitable for growing a particular annual plant variety.  Consult a nursery catalog to select an appropriate cultivar for your area.  Many catalogs are availabe online:
* [http://www.gurneys.com Gurney's]
* [http://www.noursefarms.com/ Nouse Farms]
* [http://www.wallace-woodstock.com/smallfruitplants.htm Woodstock Nursery]

I interpret the &quot;each fruit&quot; phrase of this requirement to be limited to the types listed in requirement 1, namely, brambles, blueberries, strawberries, and grapes.

==4. Prune two blueberry bushes, two grape vines, or a ten-foot row of bramble berries at the proper time in the family garden or for a friend or neighbor.==
See the section on [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Outdoor Industries/Small Fruit Growing#e. Pruning .28where applicable.29|pruning]] in requirement 2e for instruction.

==5. What is a perishable crop?==
A perishable crop is one that must be harvested and used (or preserved) in a timely manner or the produce will spoil.  All small fruits fall in this category.

By way of counter-example, a non-perishable crop would include cereals, corn, and cotton.

==6. How long can strawberries, bramble berries, blueberries, and grapes be stored?==
Once harvested all small fruit should either be used immediately or refrigerated.  Small fruit will spoil in less than a day without refrigeration.  It is best to refrigerate berries at 30°F (-1°C). Berries will not freeze at that temperature because of the sugars inside.  It is also crucial to refrigerate at a high humidity; 90-95% RH is ideal.  If properly refrigerated, bramble berries will last up to seven days, blueberries up to three weeks, and strawberries up to a month.

==7. Describe a serious insect or disease pest for each fruit. Include when the problem occurs, damage caused, and chemical or cultural treatments. Use as many pictures or drawings as possible.==
===Pests affecting all small fruit===

The '''tarnished plant bug''' (TPB) is one of the most serious pests of small fruits and vegetables in New England. No truly effective or reliable management options currently exist. Growers routinely make 3-5 applications of insecticides each year to control this insect. The cost is $200-$500/acre. Considering the narrow profit margin for today's farmers, these costs are significant. The research being conducted at the Entomology Research Laboratory represents the first step towards developing insect-killing fungi for management of TPB.  These pests are active from April or May until the first heavy frost of the year.  TPB can be controlled by keeping weeds down.

===Bramble Berry Pests===
[[Image:Snodgrass Aphis pomi.jpg|thumb|200px|Aphid life stages]]
'''Aphids''', also known as greenfly/blackfly or plant lice, are minute plant-feeding insects.  Aphids are distributed world-wide, but they are most common in temperate zones. It is possible for aphids to migrate great distances depending on the weather patterns (mainly passive dispersal riding on winds).  Look for aphids in late spring and early summer, especially on the underside of the leaves near the tips of the canes.  If more than two aphids per cane are found, treat with a pesticide.  Aphids overwinter on brambles, so when you prune, be sure to destroy the clippings.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

'''Picnic beetles''' are small (5–12 mm) ovoid, usually dull-coloured beetles, with knobbed antennae. Some have red or yellow spots or bands. They feed mainly on decaying vegetable matter, over-ripe fruit, and sap.  Picnic beetles become active when the temperature rises above 60°F (15°C).  Cultural controls are effective because these pests live near the ground.  Keep berries off the ground and pick them promptly.  You can also trap them by placing overripe fruit in buckets away from the plants.

'''Leafhoppers''' have piercing sucking mouthparts, they feed on plant sap and can transmit plant viruses. Species that are significant agricultural pests include the potato leafhopper, beet leafhopper, white apple leafhopper, two-spotted leafhopper, and glassy-winged sharpshooter.  Leafhoppers migrate into the central and northern US in the spring.  Plants should be checked frequently in early summer and if signs of leafhopper are detected, the use of a pesticide is justified.

===Blueberry Pests===
The '''Plum curculio''' is a beetle native to the regions east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. It is notorious for destroying fruits if left uncontrolled.  The larvae bore into the blueberries causing them to drop off the plant and reduce the yield.  Adults become active in the spring about the time the cultivars begin to bloom.  Plum curculio are attracted to fruit trees, so if possible, do not plant blueberries near fruit trees.  Otherwise, apply insecticide when the blossoms fall off and again ten days later.

[[Image:Lymantria dispar01.jpg|thumb|200px|Gypsy moth]]
The '''gypsy moth''' was introduced into the United States in 1868 by a French scientist, Leopold Trouvelot, living in Medford, Massachusetts, who enjoyed raising many types of caterpillars including silkworms. It is now one of the most notorious pests of hardwood trees in the Eastern United States. The first outbreak there occurred in 1889. By 1987, the gypsy moth had established itself throughout the Northeast USA and southern Quebec and Ontario.  When gypsy moths feed on blueberry plants, they eat the leaves and buds.  Bud loss leads to fruit loss.  The eggs hatch in April or May and the larvae feed on the blueberry plants until early July.  The larvae can be removed by hand in May and June, and the egg masses can be scraped from the bushes in the winter.  
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===Strawberry Pests===
'''Spider mites''' are extremely small, barely visible with the naked eye as reddish or greenish spots on leaves and stems; the adults measure about 0.5 mm.  The red spider mite is extremely versatile; it can feed on hundreds of plants, including most vegetables and food crops (peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, beans, corn, strawberries) and ornamentals: roses, etc. It lays its eggs on the leaves, and it poses a threat to host plants by sucking cell contents from the leaves cell by cell, leaving very tiny, pale spots or scars.  Spider mites are active through the warm months.  The best way to control them is by reducing the use of pesticide which destroys their natural predators.  Lady bugs and lacewings are particularly effective against spider mites, and some mites that prey on spider mites are commercially available.  There is very little in the way of chemical controls available against spider mites.  Spraying with a moderately high-pressure water hose can reduce the populations.

===Grape Pests===
The Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) is a beetle about 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) long and 1 cm (0.4 inches) wide (smaller in Canada). It is not very destructive in Japan, where it is controlled by natural enemies, but in America it is a serious pest to rose bushes, grapes, crape myrtles, and other plants. It is a weak flyer and drops several centimeters when it hits a wall. Japanese beetle traps therefore consist of a pair of crossed walls with a bag underneath, and are baited with floral scent, pheromone, or both.

These insects damage plants by eating the surface material, leaving the veins in place, producing a curious — but alarming to the experienced gardener — sort of &quot;transparent leaf&quot; effect on its victims.  Adults emerge in late June.

==8. Take a soil test from a garden and determine which fruits will grow there. Ask for fertilizer recommendations for one of the crops and determine the cost of fertilizer needed for six 100-foot (30.5 meters) rows.==
Soil testing kits are available at garden centers or over the Internet:
* [http://homeharvest.com/soiltesting.htm Home Harvest]
* [http://www.outsidepride.com/store/catalog/Soil-Test-Kits-p-1-c-268.html Outsidepride.com]
You can also have your soil tested for a small fee by a university or county extension service (see your local phone book white pages under &quot;county government&quot;).

Once you have tested your soil, you'll need to find someone to give a fertilizer recommendation.  The best place to do that would be at a nursery that sells small fruit plants.  If the staff seems clueless, try another nursery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Using .NET controls with umbraco ==

Originally from the PDF at http://www.umbraco.org/media/42a0202c-b0ba-4f84-bcf1-64dfd5230322-usingcontrolswithumbraco.pdf

'''This tutorial is a teaser''' of the coming Umbraco Developer Lounge product. If
you like what you read, you’ll love “the lounge”. It’s a site containing tutorials
like this, best-practices, sample-code and much more. Umbraco Developer
Lounge will be available in the second quarter of 2005, and will be priced at a
yearly fee as low as €300 pr. User (or €30 a month).

You can use .NET controls together with umbraco whether it be Usercontrols (.ascx
files) or CustomControls (.dll) by using macros. You’re even able to communicate
with your control by using Public Properties and macro elements.

This document will tell you how to implement both types of controls and how to
communicate.

=== Copying files ===

First you need to copy your control. Whether it’s a usercontrol or a customcontrol
you’ll need to copy the assembly (dll) into the /bin folder of your umbraco
installation. If it’s a UserControl you’ll need to copy the .ascx file as well. Your install
already contains a /usercontrols folder which we’ll recommend that you use, but
you’re free to place them anywhere in your application.

=== Example ===

We have a usercontrol called HelloWorld written in Visual Basic.NET containing a
Textbox and a button. Let’s have a look at the files in the project folder:

[[Image:UmbDotNetContols1.gif]]

What we need here is the HelloWorld.ascx file at the project root and the
HelloWorld.dll stored in the bin-folder.

We’ll copy &lt;i&gt;HelloWorld.ascx&lt;/i&gt; into &lt;i&gt;/usercontrols/HelloWorld.ascx&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HelloWorld.dll&lt;/i&gt;
will go into &lt;i&gt;/bin/HelloWorld.dll&lt;/i&gt;. Now we’re ready to register the usercontrol into
umbraco using a macro!

=== Register .NET controls using macros ===

To be able to use the .NET controls directly from umbraco, it’s
necessary to register them into a macro. So open up umbraco, go to
the “Developer” section and right click the macro-folder. Select
Create and call it “HelloWorld”.

Now select the HelloWorld macro in the opened macro folder and
type “usercontrols/HelloWorld.ascx” into the field called “Type” as
shown on the following screenshot:

[[Image:UmbDotNetContols3.jpg]]

Hit the save button and you’re ready to use your HelloWorld.ascx usercontrol just
like any other macro. That’s it! If you’re using assemblies the assembly should be the
name of your dll (without the dll-extension) and the type should be the full name
including namespace!

=== Communicating through Elements and Public Properties ===

By creating Public Properties in your control and match them with macro elements,
you’re able to communicate with your control directly from within umbraco.
umbraco will even create the UI when inserting the macro. It’s important that the
Alias of your macro element matches the name of your Public Property and be aware
of case-sensitivity!

==== Example ====

First of – let’s create a Public Property in our HelloWorld usercontrol and call it
“HelloWorld” too. If not posted back – we’ll set the text inside a TextBox to the
contents of the Public Property – here’s a simple way of doing it in Visual Basic.NET
– you can use any .NET supported language you want (like C# or Delphi.NET):

[[Image:UmbDotNetContols4.jpg]]

Compile and copy the files again as described above.

Next we’ll need to create a macro element, so go
back to umbraco and edit the “HelloWorld”
macro. The checkbox (with missing label) is
whether the element should be showed to the
user when the macro is inserted, so check it. The
Alias of the element should be exactly the same
as the name of the Public Property – and watch
out, it’s case sensitive. If you click the “browse
properties” button, you can choose which public
properties you’d like and umbraco will create
them.

[[Image:UmbDotNetContols5.jpg]]

The name of the element is what the user
will see inside umbraco when the macro is
inserted, so type something meaningful like
“Message on postback”. Next decide what type of element you’re creating, when
used together with .NET controls its only about the UI that the user will see
(different from using XSLT macros where the type can influence the XML that the
macro will use). Choose “Text” as we’ll let the user type a message. Click add.

[[Image:UmbDotNetContols6.jpg]]

And that’s all – now umbraco can communicate with your control! Let’s try it!

=== Inserting a macro ===

Umbraco does not by default insert a .NET
serverside form into your content. If you’re
using server-side elements in your controls
(with attribute runat=”server”), then it’s
important that you insert the
&lt;?ASPNET_FORM&gt; umbraco tag into the
top and bottom of your template.

To insert our macro with the .NET control, you’ll need
to go to the Template section inside “Settings” or insert it
directly inside the editor. In this sample will insert it into
the template.

Open up a template – like “Textpage” if you’re using the
sample site. Make a new line before the
“&lt;?UMBRACO_GETITEM/&gt;” tag an hit the insert
macro button ( ) at the toolbar. Choose the
“HelloWorld” macro and you should see this:

[[Image:UmbDotNetContols7.jpg]]

Type whatever you like and click ok. Your template should now look something like
this:

[[Image:UmbDotNetContols8.jpg]]

Hit the save button and go see a page using your macro. It should look something
like this:



Try changing the text in the textbox and hit the button. Umbraco will even take care
of state.

=== Multiple .NET control macros on same page ===

If you’re using more than one instance of the same .NET control macro on a page or
if you just want to be sure of the Id given to the Control, you can add an extra
attribute to the &lt;?UMBRACO_MACRO&gt; tag, called “controlID”. To do so, the tag
above will look as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;?UMBRACO_MACRO macroID=”7” HelloWorld=”It worked!”
controlID=”HelloWorld1”&gt;&lt;/?UMBRACO_MACRO&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can see it’s easy to use .NET controls with umbraco – and you can use
existing controls that aren’t made for umbraco. Enjoy…

=== Important notice for .NET 2.0 developers ===

In order to succesfully compile a user control for Umbraco 2.xx, download [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/asp.net/aa336618.aspx Visual Studio 2005 Web Application Projects]  from MSDN. Once the addon is installed, you can create projects in the same manner as in former Visual Studio.NET versions.

When developing for Umbraco, take special care that you use the old codebehind-directive in your separate codefile instead of the new codefile-directive introduced with .NET 2.0

== Using Dot NET Controls in recursive Macro ==

Using the method umbraco.library.RenderMacroContent you can render a control and create a &quot;''recursive macro''&quot;.

Using Dot NET Controls it doesn't work because the control created in RenderMacroContent are transformed into a String and then is lost: it isn't added to the Page.Controls and so no Handlers of your controls are called.

== Asking the custodian? ==

While I very much encourage people to use their Spanish as regularly as possible, please be considerate of the fact that many English-speaking Hispanics find it somewhat patronizing for someone to just approach them and speak in broken Spanish.  I have heard several people express dismay at the perceived implicit assumption that the Hispanic does not actually speak English.

If there is going to be a few minutes of interaction (as with a waiter), I could recommend tossing out a word or phrase to test the waters.  Usually it will be fairly clear if the person is amenable to conversing in a language you are trying to learn.

Please note the reaction that students of Spanish have when visiting Spain or Latin America and have people try to insist on speaking to them in English (when the purpose of the trip itself may be to practice Spanish).

Many people may be indifferent, but I would just recommend being conscious of how speaking Spanish to a stranger may be.  I have several personal anecdotes I could relate here but will leave the point made as-is.

== Digital and Analog ==

There is a significant distinction between an '''analog system''' and a '''digital system''', in the same way that there is a significant difference between analog and digital data. This book is going to consider both analog and digital topics, so it is worth taking some time to discuss the differences, and to display the different notations that will be used with each.

=== Continuous Time ===

{{MATLAB CMD|isct|Control Systems/MATLAB}}

A signal is called '''continuous-time''' if it is defined at every time t.

A system is a continuous-time system if it takes a continuous-time input signal, and outputs a continuous-time output signal. Here is an example of an analog waveform:

{{-}}

[[Image:Analog Waveform.svg|400px|center]]

=== Discrete Time ===

{{MATLAB CMD|isdt|Control Systems/MATLAB}}

A signal is called '''discrete-time''' if it is only defined for particular points in time. A discrete-time system takes discrete-time input signals, and produces discrete-time output signals. The following image shows the difference between an analog waveform and the sampled discrete time equivalent:
{{-}}

[[Image:Sampled Waveform.svg|400px|center]]

=== Quantized ===

A signal is called '''Quantized''' if it can only be certain values, and cannot be other values. This concept is best illustrated with examples:

#Students with a strong background in physics will recognize this concept as being the root word in &quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot;. In quantum mechanics, it is known that energy comes only in discrete packets. An electron bound to an atom, for example, may occupy one of several discrete energy levels, but not intermediate levels.
#Another common example is population statistics. For instance, a common statistic is that a household in a particular country may have an average of &quot;3.5 children&quot;, or some other fractional number. Actual households may have 3 children, or they may have 4 children, but no household has 3.5 children.
#People with a computer science background will recognize that integer variables are quantized because they can only hold certain integer values, not fractions or decimal points. 

The last example concerning computers is the most relevant, because quantized systems are frequently computer-based. Systems that are implemented with computer software and hardware will typically be quantized.

Here is an example waveform of a quantized signal. Notice how the magnitude of the wave can only take certain values, and that creates a step-like appearance. This image is discrete in magnitude, but is continuous in time:

[[Image:Quantized Waveform.svg|400px|center]]

== Analog ==

By definition:

{{TextBox|1=
;Analog:A signal is considered analog if it is defined for all points in time and if it can take any real magnitude value within its range.}}

An analog system is a system that represents data using a direct conversion from one form to another. In other words, an analog system is a system that is continuous in both time and magnitude. 

=== Example: Motor ===

{{TextBox|1=If we have a given motor, we can show that the output of the motor (rotation in units of radians per second, for instance) is a function of the voltage that is input to the motor. We can show the relationship as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\Theta(v) = f(v)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the output in terms of Rad/sec, and f(v) is the motor's conversion function between the input voltage ('''v''') and the output. For any value of '''v''' we can calculate out specifically what the rotational speed of the motor should be. }}

=== Example: Analog Clock ===

{{TextBox|1=Consider a standard analog clock, which represents the passage of time though the angular position of the clock hands. We can denote the angular position of the hands of the clock with the system of equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_h = f_h(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_m = f_m(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_s = f_s(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is the angular position of the hour hand, &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the angular position of the minute hand, and &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the angular position of the second hand. The positions of all the different hands of the clock are dependent on functions of time.

Different positions on a clock face correspond directly to different times of the day.
}}

== Digital ==

Digital data is represented by discrete number values. By definition:

{{TextBox|1=
;Digital:A signal or system is considered digital if it is both discrete-time and quantized.}}

Digital data always have a certain granularity, and therefore there will almost always be an error associated with using such data, especially if we want to account for all real numbers. The tradeoff, of course, to using a digital system is that our powerful computers with our powerful, Moore's law microprocessor units, can be instructed to operate on digital data only. This benefit more than makes up for the shortcomings of a digital representation system.

Discrete systems will be denoted inside square brackets, as is a common notation in texts that deal with discrete values. For instance, we can denote a discrete data set of ascending numbers, starting at 1, with the following notation:

:x[n] = [1 2 3 4 5 6 ...]

'''n''', or other letters from the central area of the alphabet (m, i, j, k, l, for instance) are commonly used to denote discrete time values. Analog, or &quot;non-discrete&quot; values are denoted in regular expression syntax, using parenthesis. Here is an example of an analog waveform and the digital equivalent. Notice that the digital waveform is discrete in both time and magnitude:

{|
|-
|[[Image:Analog Waveform.svg|400px|center]]
|[[Image:Digital Waveform.svg|400px|center]]
|-
|&lt;center&gt;'''Analog Waveform'''&lt;/center&gt;
|&lt;center&gt;'''Digital Waveform'''&lt;/center&gt;
|}

=== Example: Digital Clock ===

{{TextBox|1=As a common example, let's consider a digital clock: The digital clock represents time with binary electrical data signals of 1 and 0. The 1's are usually represented by a positive voltage, and a 0 is generally represented by zero voltage. Counting in binary, we can show that any given time can be represented by a base-2 numbering system:}}

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Minute !! Binary Representation
|-
|1 || 1
|-
|10 || 1010
|-
|30 || 11110
|-
|59 || 111011
|}

{{TextBox|1=
But what happens if we want to display a fraction of a minute, or a fraction of a second? A typical digital clock has a certain amount of '''precision''', and it cannot express fractional values smaller than that precision.}}

== Hybrid Systems ==

'''Hybrid Systems''' are systems that have both analog and digital components. Devices called '''samplers''' are used to convert analog signals into digital signals, and Devices called '''reconstructors''' are used to convert digital signals into analog signals. Because of the use of samplers, hybrid systems are frequently called '''sampled-data systems'''.

=== Example: Automobile Computer ===

{{TextBox|1=Most modern automobiles today have integrated computer systems that monitor certain aspects of the car, and actually help to control the performance of the car. The speed of the car, and the rotational speed of the transmission are analog values, but a sampler converts them into digital values so the car computer can monitor them. The digital computer will then output control signals to other parts of the car, to alter analog systems such as the engine timing, the suspension, the brakes, and other parts. Because the car has both digital and analog components, it is a '''hybrid system'''.}}

== Continuous and Discrete ==

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;We are not using the word &quot;continuous&quot; here in the sense of ''continuously differentiable'', as is common in math texts. }}

A system is considered '''continuous-time''' if the signal exists for all time. Frequently, the terms &quot;analog&quot; and &quot;continuous&quot; will be used interchangeably, although they are not strictly the same.

Discrete systems can come in three flavors:
#Discrete time (sampled)
#Discrete magnitude (quantized)
#Discrete time and magnitude (digital)

'''Discrete magnitude''' systems are systems where the signal value can only have certain values. '''Discrete time''' systems are systems where signals are only available (or valid) at particular times. Computer systems are discrete in the sense of (3), in that data is only read at specific discrete time intervals, and the data can have only a limited number of discrete values.

A discrete-time system has a '''sampling time''' value associated with it, such that each discrete value occurs at multiples of the given sampling time. We will denote the sampling time of a system as T. We can equate the square-brackets notation of a system with the continuous definition of the system as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;x[n] = x(nT)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the two notations show the same thing, but the first one is typically easier to write, ''and'' it shows that the system in question is a discrete system. This book will use the square brackets to denote discrete systems by the sample number n, and parenthesis to denote continuous time functions.

== Sampling and Reconstruction ==

The process of converting analog information into digital data is called &quot;Sampling&quot;. The process of converting digital data into an analog signal is called &quot;Reconstruction&quot;. We will talk about both processes in a later chapter. For more information on the topic than is available in this book, see the [[Analog and Digital Conversion]] wikibook. Here is an example of a reconstructed waveform. Notice that the reconstructed waveform here is quantized because it is constructed from a digital signal:

== Transforms ==

There are a number of transforms that we will be discussing throughout this book, and the reader is assumed to have at least a small prior knowledge of them. It is not the intention of this book to teach the topic of transforms to an audience that has had no previous exposure to them. However, we will include a brief refresher here to refamiliarize people who maybe cannot remember the topic perfectly. If you do not know what the '''Laplace Transform''' or the '''Fourier Transform''' are yet, it is highly recommended that you use this page as a simple guide, and look the information up on other sources. Specifically, [[w:|Wikipedia]] has lots of information on these subjects.

=== Transform Basics ===

A '''transform''' is a mathematical tool that converts an equation from one variable (or one set of variables) into a new variable (or a new set of variables). To do this, the transform must remove all instances of the first variable, the &quot;Domain Variable&quot;, and add a new &quot;Range Variable&quot;. Integrals are excellent choices for transforms, because the limits of the definite integral will be substituted into the domain variable, and all instances of that variable will be removed from the equation. An integral transform that converts from a domain variable ''a'' to a range variable ''b'' will typically be formatted as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}[f(a)] = F(b) = \int_C f(a)g(a,b)da&lt;/math&gt;

Where the function ''f(a)'' is the function being transformed, and ''g(a,b)'' is known as the '''kernel''' of the transform. Typically, the only difference between the various integral transforms is the kernel.

== Laplace Transform ==

{{Wikipedia|Laplace transform}}
{{MATLAB CMD|laplace|Control Systems/MATLAB}}

The '''Laplace Transform''' converts an equation from the time-domain into the so-called &quot;S-domain&quot;, or the '''Laplace domain''', or even the &quot;Complex domain&quot;. These are all different names for the same mathematical space and they all may be used interchangeably in this book and in other texts on the subject. The Transform can only be applied under the following conditions:
#The system or signal in question is analog.
#The system or signal in question is Linear.
#The system or signal in question is Time-Invariant.
#The system or signal in question is causal.

The transform is defined as such:

{{eqn|Laplace Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F(s) = \mathcal{L}[f(t)] = \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{-st}dt\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Laplace transform results have been tabulated extensively. More information on the Laplace transform, including a transform table can be found in [[Control Systems/Transforms Appendix|'''the Appendix''']].

If we have a linear differential equation in the time domain:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}y(t) = ax(t) + bx'(t) + cx''(t)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

With zero initial conditions, we can take the Laplace transform of the equation as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Y(s) = aX(s) + bsX(s) + cs^2X(s)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

And separating, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Y(s) = X(s)[a + bs + cs^2]\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Inverse Laplace Transform ===

{{MATLAB CMD|ilaplace|Control Systems/MATLAB}}

The '''inverse Laplace Transform''' is defined as such:
{{-}}
{{eqn|Inverse Laplace Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}f(t) 
        = \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{F(s)\right\}
        = {1 \over {2\pi i}}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} e^{st} F(s)\,ds\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse transform converts a function from the Laplace domain back into the time domain.

=== Matrices and Vectors ===

The Laplace Transform can be used on systems of linear equations in an intuitive way. Let's say that we have a system of linear equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}y_1(t) = a_1x_1(t)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}y_2(t) = a_2x_2(t)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We can arrange these equations into matrix form, as shown:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}y_1(t) \\ y_2(t)\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}a_1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; a_2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x_1(t) \\x_2(t)\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

And write this symbolically as:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{y}(t) = A\bold{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

We can take the Laplace transform of both sides:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[\bold{y}(t)] = \bold{Y}(s) = \mathcal{L}[A\bold{x}(t)] = A\mathcal{L}[\bold{x}(t)] = A\bold{X}(s)&lt;/math&gt;

Which is the same as taking the transform of each individual equation in the system of equations.

=== Example: RL Circuit ===

{{SideBox|For more information about electric circuits, see:&lt;br&gt;'''[[Circuit Theory]]'''}}

Here, we are going to show a common example of a first-order system, an '''RL Circuit'''. In an inductor, the relationship between the current (i), and the voltage (v) in the time domain is expressed as a derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = L\frac{di(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Where L is a special quantity called the &quot;Inductance&quot; that is a property of inductors.

{{TextBox|1=

[[Image:Series-RL.png|right|framed|Circuit diagram for the RL circuit example problem. V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage over the inductor, and is the quantity we are trying to find.]]

Let's say that we have a 1st order RL series electric circuit. The resistor has resistance R, the inductor has inductance L, and the voltage source has input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;. The system output of our circuit is the voltage over the inductor, V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;. In the time domain, we have the following first-order differential equations to describe the circuit:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{out}(t) = V_{L}(t) = L\frac{di(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_{in}(t) = Ri(t) + L\frac{di(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

However, since the circuit is essentially acting as a voltage divider, we can put the output in terms of the input as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{out}(t) = \frac{L\frac{di(t)}{dt}}{Ri(t) + L \frac{di(t)}{dt}}V_{in}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

This is a very complicated equation, and will be difficult to solve unless we employ the Laplace transform:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{out}(s) = \frac{Ls}{R + Ls}V_{in}(s)&lt;/math&gt;

We can divide top and bottom by L, and move V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; to the other side:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \frac{s}{\frac{R}{L} + s}&lt;/math&gt;

And using a simple table look-up, we can solve this for the time-domain relationship between the circuit input and the circuit output:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}} = \frac{d}{dt}e^{\left(\frac{-Rt}{L}\right)}u(t)&lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Partial Fraction Expansion ===
{{SideBox|For more information about Partial Fraction Expansion, see:&lt;br&gt;'''[[Calculus]]'''}}
Laplace transform pairs are extensively tabulated, but frequently we have transfer functions and other equations that do not have a tabulated inverse transform. If our equation is a fraction, we can often utilize '''Partial Fraction Expansion''' (PFE) to create a set of simpler terms that will have readily available inverse transforms. This section is going to give a brief reminder about PFE, for those who have already learned the topic. This refresher will be in the form of several examples of the process, as it relates to the Laplace Transform. People who are unfamiliar with PFE are encouraged to read more about it in '''[[Calculus]]'''.

=== Example: Second-Order System ===

{{TextBox|1=If we have a given equation in the S-domain:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \frac{2s + 1}{s^2 + 3s + 2}&lt;/math&gt;

We can expand it into several smaller fractions as such:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \frac{2s + 1}{(s + 1)(s + 2)} = \frac{A}{(s + 1)} + \frac{B}{(s + 2)} = \frac{A(s+2)+B(s+1)}{(s + 1)(s + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

This looks impossible, because we have a single equation with 3 unknowns (''s'', ''A'', ''B''), but in reality ''s'' can take any arbitrary value, and we can &quot;plug in&quot; values for ''s'' to solve for ''A'' and ''B'', without needing other equations. For instance, in the above equation, we can multiply through by the denominator, and cancel terms:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}(2s + 1) = A(s + 2) + B(s + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, when we set ''s &amp;rarr; -2'', the ''A'' term disappears, and we are left with ''B &amp;rarr; 3''. When we set ''s &amp;rarr; -1'', we can solve for ''A &amp;rarr; -1''. Putting these values back into our original equation, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \frac{-1}{(s + 1)} + \frac{3}{(s + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

Remember, since the Laplace transform is a linear operator, the following relationship holds true:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[F(s)] = \mathcal{L}\left[\frac{-1}{(s + 1)} + \frac{3}{(s + 2)}\right] = \mathcal{L}\left[\frac{-1}{s + 1}\right] + \mathcal{L}\left[ \frac{3}{(s + 2)}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Finding the inverse transform of these smaller terms should be an easier process then finding the inverse transform of the whole function. Partial fraction expansion is a useful, and oftentimes necessary tool for finding the inverse of an S-domain equation.}}

=== Example: Fourth-Order System ===

{{TextBox|1=If we have a given equation in the S-domain:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=\frac{79s^2+916s+1000}{s(s+10)^3}&lt;/math&gt;

We can expand it into several smaller fractions as such:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=\frac{A}{s}+\frac{B}{(s+10)^3}+\frac{C}{(s+10)^2}+\frac{D}{s+10}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=\frac{A(s+10)^3+Bs+Cs(s+10)+Ds(s+10)^2}{s(s+10)^3}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}A(s+10)^3+Bs+Cs(s+10)+Ds(s+10)^2=79s^2+916s+1000&lt;/math&gt;

Canceling terms wouldn't be enough here, we will open the brackets &lt;small&gt;(separated onto multiple lines)&lt;/small&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;As^3+30As^2+300As+1000A+Bs+&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Cs^2+10Cs+Ds^3+20Ds^2+100Ds&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=79s^2+916s+1000&lt;/math&gt;

Let's compare coefficients:

:''A + D = 0''
:''30A + C + 20D = 79''
:''300A + B + 10C + 100D = 916''
:''1000A = 1000''

And solving gives us:

:''A = 1''
:''B = 26''
:''C = 69''
:''D = -1''

We know from the Laplace Transform table that the following relation holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(s+\alpha)^{n+1}} \to \frac{t^{n}}{n!}e^{-\alpha t} \cdot u(t) &lt;/math&gt; 

We can plug in our values for ''A'', ''B'', ''C'',  and ''D'' into our expansion, and try to convert it into the form above.

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=\frac{A}{s}+\frac{B}{(s+10)^3}+\frac{C}{(s+10)^2}+\frac{D}{s+10}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=A\frac{1}{s}+B\frac{1}{(s+10)^3}+C\frac{1}{(s+10)^2}+D\frac{1}{s+10}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=1\frac{1}{s}+26\frac{1}{(s+10)^3}+69\frac{1}{(s+10)^2}-1\frac{1}{s+10}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=u(t)+13t^2e^{-10t}+69te^{-10t}-e^{-10t}&lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Example: Complex Roots ===

{{TextBox|1=Given the following transfer function:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=\frac{7s+26}{s^2-80s+1681}=\frac{As+B}{s^2-80s+1681}&lt;/math&gt;

When the solution of the denominator is a complex number, we use a complex representation ''A + iB'', like ''3+i4'' as opposed to the use of a single letter (e.g. ''D'') - which is for real numbers:

:''As + B = 7s + 26''
:''A = 7''
:''B = 26''

We will need to reform it into two fractions that look like this (without changing its value):

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\alpha t}  \sin(\omega t) \cdot u(t) \ &lt;/math&gt;&amp;rarr;&lt;math&gt; { \omega \over (s+\alpha )^2 + \omega^2  } &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\alpha t}  \cos(\omega t) \cdot u(t) \ &lt;/math&gt;&amp;rarr;&lt;math&gt; { s+\alpha \over (s+\alpha )^2 + \omega^2  } &lt;/math&gt;

Let's start with the denominator (for both fractions):

The roots of ''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 80s + 1681'' are ''40 + j9'' and ''40 - j9''.

:&lt;math&gt;(s+a)^2+\omega^2=(s-40)^2+9^2&lt;/math&gt;&amp;rarr;&lt;math&gt;\frac{As+B}{(s-40)^2+9^2}&lt;/math&gt;

And now the numerators:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{As+40A-40A+B}{(s-40)^2+9^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{As-40A}{(s-40)^2+9^2}+\frac{B+40A}{(s-40)^2+9^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A\frac{(s-40)}{(s-40)^2+9^2}+\frac{B+40A}{9}\frac{9}{(s-40)^2+9^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Inverse Laplace Transform:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=7e^{40t}cos(9t)+34e^{40t}sin(9t)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Example: Sixth-Order System ===

{{TextBox|1=Given the following transfer function:
:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=\frac{90s^2-1110}{s(s-3)(s^2-12s+37)}=\frac{A}{s}+\frac{B}{s-3}+\frac{Cs+D}{s^2-12s+37}&lt;/math&gt;

We multiply through by the denominators to make the equation rational:

:&lt;math&gt;A(s-3)(s^2-12s+37)+Bs(s^2-12s+37)+(Cs+D)s(s-3)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=90s^2-1110&lt;/math&gt;

And then we combine terms:

:&lt;math&gt;As^3-15As^2+73As-111A+Bs^3-12Bs^2+37Bs+Cs^3-3Cs^2+Ds^2-3Ds&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=90s^2-1110&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing coefficients:

:''A + B + C = 0''
:''-15A - 12B - 3C + D = 90''
:''73A + 37B - 3D = 0''
:''-111A = -1110''

Now, we can solve for ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'':

:''A = 10''
:''B = -10''
:''C = 0'' 
:''D = 120''

And now for the &quot;fitting&quot;:

The roots of ''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 12s + 37'' are ''6 + j'' and ''6 - j''

:&lt;math&gt;A\frac{1}{s}+B\frac{1}{s-3}+C\frac{s}{(s-6)^2+1^2}+D\frac{1}{(s-6)^2+1^2}&lt;/math&gt;

No need to fit the fraction of ''D'', because it is complete; no need to bother fitting the fraction of ''C'', because ''C'' is equal to zero.

:&lt;math&gt;10\frac{1}{s}-10\frac{1}{s-3}+0\frac{s}{(s-6)^2+1^2}+120\frac{1}{(s-6)^2+1^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}f(t)=10u(t)-10e^{3t}+120e^{6t}sin(t)&lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Final Value Theorem ===

The '''Final Value Theorem''' allows us to determine the value of the time domain equation, as the time approaches infinity, from the S domain equation. In Control Engineering, the Final Value Theorem is used most frequently to determine the steady-state value of a system. The real part of the poles of the function must be &lt;0.

{{eqn|Final Value Theorem (Laplace)}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \to \infty}x(t) = \lim_{s \to 0} s X(s)&lt;/math&gt;

From our chapter on system metrics, you may recognize the value of the system at time infinity as the steady-state time of the system. The difference between the steady state value and the expected output value we remember as being the steady-state error of the system. Using the Final Value Theorem, we can find the steady-state value and the steady-state error of the system in the Complex S domain.

=== Example: Final Value Theorem ===

{{TextBox|1=Find the final value of the following polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = \frac{1 + s}{1 + 2s + s^2}&lt;/math&gt;

We can apply the '''Final Value Theorem''':

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{s \to \ 0} s \frac{1 + s}{1 + 2s + s^2} &lt;/math&gt;

We obtain the value:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{s \to \ 0} s \frac{1 + s}{1 + 2s + s^2} = 0 \cdot \frac{1+0}{1+2\cdot 0+0^2}=0 \cdot 1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Initial Value Theorem ===

Akin to the final value theorem, the '''Initial Value Theorem''' allows us to determine the initial value of the system (the value at time zero) from the S-Domain Equation. The initial value theorem is used most frequently to determine the starting conditions, or the &quot;initial conditions&quot; of a system.

{{eqn|Initial Value Theorem (Laplace)}}
:&lt;math&gt;x(0) = \lim_{s \to \infty} s X(s)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Common Transforms ===

We will now show you the transforms of the three functions we have already learned about: The unit step, the unit ramp, and the unit parabola. The transform of the unit step function is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[u(t)] = \frac{1}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

And since the unit ramp is the integral of the unit step, we can multiply the above result times ''1/s'' to get the transform of the unit ramp:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[r(t)] = \frac{1}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, we can multiply by ''1/s'' to get the transform of the unit parabola:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[p(t)] = \frac{1}{s^3}&lt;/math&gt;

== Fourier Transform ==

{{Wikipedia|Fourier Transform}}

The '''Fourier Transform''' is very similar to the Laplace transform. The fourier transform uses the assumption that any finite time-domain signal can be broken into an infinite sum of sinusoidal (sine and cosine waves) signals. Under this assumption, the Fourier Transform converts a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation, as a function of the radial frequency, &amp;omega;, The Fourier Transform is defined as such:

{{eqn|Fourier Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;F(j\omega) = \mathcal{F}[f(t)] = \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{-j\omega t} dt&lt;/math&gt;

{{MATLAB CMD|fourier|Control Systems/MATLAB}}

We can now show that the Fourier Transform is equivalent to the Laplace transform, when the following condition is true:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s = j\omega\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Because the Laplace and Fourier Transforms are so closely related, it does not make much sense to use both transforms for all problems. This book, therefore, will concentrate on the Laplace transform for nearly all subjects, except those problems that deal directly with frequency values. For frequency problems, it makes life much easier to use the Fourier Transform representation.

Like the Laplace Transform, the Fourier Transform has been extensively tabulated. Properties of the Fourier transform, in addition to a table of common transforms is available in [[Control Systems/Transforms Appendix|'''the Appendix''']].

=== Inverse Fourier Transform ===

{{MATLAB CMD|ifourier|Control Systems/MATLAB}}

The '''inverse Fourier Transform''' is defined as follows:
{{-}}
{{eqn|Inverse Fourier Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;f(t) 
        = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{F(j\omega)\right\}     
        = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty F(j\omega) e^{j\omega t} d\omega&lt;/math&gt;

This transform is nearly identical to the Fourier Transform.

== Complex Plane ==

[[Image:S Plane.svg|right|200px]]

Using the above equivalence, we can show that the Laplace transform is always equal to the Fourier Transform, if the variable ''s'' is an imaginary number. However, the Laplace transform is different if ''s'' is a real or a complex variable. As such, we generally define ''s'' to have both a real part and an imaginary part, as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s = \sigma + j\omega\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

And we can show that ''s = j''&amp;omega; if &amp;sigma;'' = 0''.

Since the variable ''s'' can be broken down into 2 independent values, it is frequently of some value to graph the variable ''s'' on its own special &quot;S-plane&quot;. The S-plane graphs the variable &amp;sigma; on the horizontal axis, and the value of ''j''&amp;omega; on the vertical axis. This axis arrangement is shown at right. 

{{-}}

== Euler's Formula ==

There is an important result from calculus that is known as '''Euler's Formula''', or &quot;Euler's Relation&quot;. This important formula relates the important values of ''e'', ''j'', &amp;pi;, 1 and 0:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}e^{j\pi} + 1 = 0\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

However, this result is derived from the following equation, setting &amp;omega; to &amp;pi;:

{{eqn|Euler's Formula}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}e^{j\omega} = \cos(\omega) + j\sin(\omega)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This formula will be used extensively in some of the chapters of this book, so it is important to become familiar with it now.

== MATLAB ==

The MATLAB symbolic toolbox contains functions to compute the Laplace and Fourier transforms automatically. The function '''laplace''', and the function '''fourier''' can be used to calculate the Laplace and Fourier transforms of the input functions, respectively. For instance, the code:

 t = sym('t');
 fx = 30*t^2 + 20*t;
 laplace(fx)

produces the output:

 ans =
 
 60/s^3+20/s^2

We will discuss these functions more in [[Control Systems/MATLAB|The Appendix]].

== System Metrics ==

When a system is being designed and analyzed, it doesn't make any sense to test the system with all manner of strange input functions, or to measure all sorts of arbitrary performance metrics. Instead, it is in everybody's best interest to test the system with a set of standard, simple reference functions. Once the system is tested with the reference functions, there are a number of different metrics that we can use to determine the system performance.

It is worth noting that the metrics presented in this chapter represent only a small number of possible metrics that can be used to evaluate a given system. This wikibook will present other useful metrics along the way, as their need becomes apparent.

== Standard Inputs ==

{{SideBox|'''Note''':&lt;br&gt; All of the standard inputs are zero before time zero. All the standard inputs are '''causal'''.}}

There are a number of standard inputs that are considered simple enough and universal enough that they are considered when designing a system. These inputs are known as a '''unit step''', a '''ramp''', and a '''parabolic''' input.

{{TextBox|1=
;Unit Step: A unit step function is defined piecewise as such:

{{eqn|Unit Step Function}}
::&lt;math&gt;u(t) = \left\{
\begin{matrix} 
  0, &amp; t &lt; 0
\\ 
  1, &amp; t \ge 0
\end{matrix}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

:The unit step function is a highly important function, not only in control systems engineering, but also in signal processing, systems analysis, and all branches of engineering. If the unit step function is input to a system, the output of the system is known as the '''step response'''. The step response of a system is an important tool, and we will study step responses in detail in later chapters.

[[Image:Unit Step.svg|400px|center]]}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Ramp: A unit ramp is defined in terms of the unit step function, as such:

{{eqn|Unit Ramp Function}}
::&lt;math&gt;r(t) = t u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:It is important to note that the unit step function is simply the differential of the unit ramp function:

::&lt;math&gt;r(t) = \int u(t)dt = tu(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:This definition will come in handy when we learn about the '''Laplace Transform'''.

[[Image:Unit Ramp.svg|400px|center]]}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Parabolic: A unit parabolic input is similar to a ramp input:

{{eqn|Unit Parabolic Function}}
::&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \frac{1}{2}t^2 u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:Notice also that the unit parabolic input is equal to the integral of the ramp function:

::&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \int r(t)dt = \int t u(t)dt = \frac{1}{2}t^2u(t) = \frac{1}{2}t r(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:Again, this result will become important when we learn about the Laplace Transform.

[[Image:Unit Parabola.svg|400px|center]]}}

Also, sinusoidal and exponential functions are considered basic, but they are too difficult to use in initial analysis of a system.

== Steady State ==

{{SideBox|'''Note''':&lt;br&gt;To be more precise, we should have taken the limit as ''t'' approaches infinity. However, as a shorthand notation, we will typically say &quot;''t'' equals infinity&quot;, and assume the reader understands the shortcut that is being used.}}

When a unit-step function is input to a system, the '''steady-state''' value of that system is the output value at time &lt;math&gt;t = \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Since it is impractical (if not completely impossible) to wait till infinity to observe the system, approximations and mathematical calculations are used to determine the steady-state value of the system. Most system responses are '''asymptotic''', that is that the response approaches a particular value. Systems that are asymptotic are typically obvious from viewing the graph of that response.

=== Step Response ===

The step response of a system is most frequently used to analyze systems, and there is a large amount of terminology involved with step responses. When exposed to the step input, the system will initially have an undesirable output period known as the '''transient response'''. The transient response occurs because a system is approaching its final output value. The steady-state response of the system is the response after the transient response has ended. 

The amount of time it takes for the system output to reach the desired value (before the transient response has ended, typically) is known as the '''rise time'''. The amount of time it takes for the transient response to end and the steady-state response to begin is known as the '''settling time'''. 

It is common for a systems engineer to try and improve the step response of a system. In general, it is desired for the transient response to be reduced, the rise and settling times to be shorter, and the steady-state to approach a particular desired &quot;reference&quot; output.

|}
{{-}}

== Target Value ==

The target output value is the value that our system attempts to obtain for a given input. This is not the same as the steady-state value, which is the actual value that the target does obtain. The target value is frequently referred to as the '''reference value''', or the &quot;reference function&quot; of the system. In essence, this is the value that we want the system to produce. When we input a &quot;5&quot; into an elevator, we want the output (the final position of the elevator) to be the fifth floor. Pressing the &quot;5&quot; button is the reference input, and is the expected value that we want to obtain. If we press the &quot;5&quot; button, and the elevator goes to the third floor, then our elevator is poorly designed.

== Rise Time ==

'''Rise time''' is the amount of time that it takes for the system response to reach the target value from an initial state of zero. Many texts on the subject define the rise time as being the time it takes to rise between the initial position and 80% of the target value. This is because some systems never rise to 100% of the expected, target value, and therefore they would have an infinite rise-time. This book will specify which convention to use for each individual problem. Rise time is typically denoted ''t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'', or ''t&lt;sub&gt;rise&lt;/sub&gt;''.

{{info|Rise time is not the amount of time it takes to achieve steady-state, only the amount of time it takes to reach the desired target value for the first time.}}

== Percent Overshoot ==

Underdamped systems frequently overshoot their target value initially. This initial surge is known as the &quot;overshoot value&quot;. The ratio of the amount of overshoot to the target steady-state value of the system is known as the '''percent overshoot'''. Percent overshoot represents an overcompensation of the system, and can output dangerously large output signals that can damage a system. Percent overshoot is typically denoted with the term ''PO''.

{{TextBox|1='''Example: Refrigerator'''

Consider an ordinary household refrigerator. The refrigerator has cycles where it is on and when it is off. When the refrigerator is on, the coolant pump is running, and the temperature inside the refrigerator decreases. The temperature decreases to a much lower level than is required, and then the pump turns off. 

When the pump is off, the temperature slowly increases again as heat is absorbed into the refrigerator. When the temperature gets high enough, the pump turns back on. Because the pump cools down the refrigerator more than it needs to initially, we can say that it &quot;overshoots&quot; the target value by a certain specified amount.}}

{{TextBox|1='''Example: Refrigerator'''

Another example concerning a refrigerator concerns the electrical demand of the heat pump when it first turns on. The pump is an inductive mechanical motor, and when the motor first activates, a special counter-acting force known as &quot;back EMF&quot; resists the motion of the motor, and causes the pump to draw more electricity until the motor reaches its final speed. During the startup time for the pump, lights on the same electrical circuit as the refrigerator may dim slightly, as electricity is drawn away from the lamps, and into the pump. This initial draw of electricity is a good example of overshoot.}}

== Steady-State Error ==
{{SideBox|Usually, the letter ''e'' or ''E'' will be used to denote error values.}}
Sometimes a system might never achieve the desired steady-state value, but instead will settle on an output value that is not desired. The difference between the steady-state output value to the reference input value at steady state is called the '''steady-state error''' of the system. We will use the variable ''e&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;'' to denote the steady-state error of the system.

== Settling Time ==

After the initial rise time of the system, some systems will oscillate and vibrate for an amount of time before the system output settles on the final value. The amount of time it takes to reach steady state after the initial rise time is known as the '''settling time'''. Notice that damped oscillating systems may never settle completely, so we will define settling time as being the amount of time for the system to reach, and stay in, a certain acceptable range. The acceptable range for settling time is typically determined on a per-problem basis, although common values are 20%, 10%, or 5% of the target value. The settling time will be denoted as ''t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''.

== System Order ==

The '''order''' of the system is defined by the number of independent energy storage elements in the system, and intuitively by the highest degree of the linear differential equation that describes the system. In a transfer function representation, the order is the highest exponent in the transfer function. In a '''proper system''', the system order is defined as the degree of the denominator polynomial. In a state-space equation, the system order is the number of state-variables used in the system. The order of a system will frequently be denoted with an ''n'' or ''N'', although these variables are also used for other purposes. This book will make clear distinction on the use of these variables.

=== Proper Systems ===

A '''proper system''' is a system where the degree of the denominator is larger than or equal to the degree of the numerator polynomial. A '''strictly proper system''' is a system where the degree of the denominator polynomial is larger than (but never equal to) the degree of the numerator polynomial.  A '''biproper system''' is a system where the degree of the denominator polynomial equals the degree of the numerator polynomial.

It is important to note that only proper systems can be physically realized. In other words, a system that is not proper cannot be built. It makes no sense to spend a lot of time designing and analyzing imaginary systems.

=== Example: System Order ===

{{TextBox|1=Find the order of this system:

:&lt;math&gt;G(s) = \frac{1 + s}{1 + s + s^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The highest exponent in the denominator is s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so the system is order 2. Also, since the denominator is a higher degree than the numerator, this system is proper.}}

in the above example, G(s) is a second-order transfer function because in the denominator one of the s variables has an exponent of 2. Second-order functions are the easiest to work with.

== System Type ==

Let's say that we have a process transfer function (or combination of functions, such as a controller feeding in to a process), all in the forward branch of a unity feedback loop. Say that the overall forward branch transfer function is in the following generalized form (known as '''pole-zero form'''):

{{eqn|Pole-Zero Form}}
:&lt;math&gt;G(s) = \frac {K \prod_i (s - s_i)}{s^M \prod_j (s - s_j)}&lt;/math&gt;
{{SideBox|Poles at the origin are called '''integrators''', because they have the effect of performing integration on the input signal.}}
we call the parameter ''M'' the '''system type'''. Note that increased system type number correspond to larger numbers of poles at s = 0. More poles at the origin generally have a beneficial effect on the system, but they increase the order of the system, and make it increasingly difficult to implement physically. System type will generally be denoted with a letter like ''N'', ''M'', or ''m''. Because these variables are typically reused for other purposes, this book will make clear distinction when they are employed.

Now, we will define a few terms that are commonly used when discussing system type. These new terms are '''Position Error''', '''Velocity Error''', and ''' Acceleration Error'''. These names are throwbacks to physics terms where acceleration is the derivative of velocity, and velocity is the derivative of position. Note that none of these terms are meant to deal with movement, however.

;Position Error:The position error, denoted by the '''position error constant''' ''&lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt;''. This is the amount of steady-state error of the system when stimulated by a unit step input. We define the position error constant as follows:
{{eqn|Position Error Constant}}
::&lt;math&gt;K_p = \lim_{s \to 0} G(s)&lt;/math&gt;

:Where G(s) is the transfer function of our system.

;Velocity Error:The velocity error is the amount of steady-state error when the system is stimulated with a ramp input. We define the '''velocity error constant''' as such:
{{eqn|Velocity Error Constant}}
::&lt;math&gt;K_v = \lim_{s \to 0} s G(s)&lt;/math&gt;

;Acceleration Error:The acceleration error is the amount of steady-state error when the system is stimulated with a parabolic input. We define the '''acceleration error constant''' to be:
{{eqn|Acceleration Error Constant}}
::&lt;math&gt;K_a = \lim_{s \to 0} s^2 G(s)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, this table will show briefly the relationship between the system type, the kind of input (step, ramp, parabolic), and the steady-state error of the system:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! 
! colspan=3 | Unit System Input
|-
! Type, ''M'' !! ''Au(t)'' !! ''Ar(t)'' !! ''Ap(t)''
|-
|0   || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = \frac{A}{1 + K_p}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;  || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|1   || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = 0&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = \frac{A}{K_v}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|2   || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = 0&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = 0&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = \frac{A}{K_a}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &gt; 2 || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = 0&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = 0&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;e_{ss} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Z-Domain Type ===

Likewise, we can show that the system order can be found from the following generalized transfer function in the ''Z'' domain:

:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \frac {K \prod_i (z - z_i)}{(z - 1)^M \prod_j (z - z_j)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where the constant ''M'' is the order of the digital system. Now, we will show how to find the various error constants in the Z-Domain:

{{eqn|Z-Domain Error Constants}}
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Error Constant !! Equation
|-
| Kp || &lt;math&gt;K_p = \lim_{z \to 1} G(z)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Kv || &lt;math&gt;K_v = \lim_{z \to 1} (z - 1) G(z)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Ka || &lt;math&gt;K_a = \lim_{z \to 1} (z - 1)^2 G(z)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Visually ==

Here is an image of the various system metrics, acting on a system in response to a step input:

[[Image:System Metrics Diagram.svg|500px|center]]

The target value is the value of the input step response. The rise time is the time at which the waveform first reaches the target value. The overshoot is the amount by which the waveform exceeds the target value. The settling time is the time it takes for the system to settle into a particular bounded region. This bounded region is denoted with two short dotted lines above and below the target value.

== Laplace Transform ==

{{wikipedia|Laplace Transform}}

When we talk about the Laplace transform, we are actually talking about the version of the Laplace transform known as the '''unilinear Laplace Transform'''. The other version, the '''Bilinear Laplace Transform''' (not related to the Bilinear Transform, below) is not used in this book.

The Laplace Transform is defined as:

{{eqn|Laplace Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;F(s) 
        = \mathcal{L}[f(t)] 
        = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(t)e^{-st}dt&lt;/math&gt;

And the Inverse Laplace Transform is defined as:

{{eqn|Inverse Laplace Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;f(t) 
        = \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{F(s)\right\}
        = \frac{1}{2\pi j} \int_{\sigma-j\infty}^{\sigma+j\infty} X(s)e^{st}ds&lt;/math&gt;

=== Convergence of the Laplace Integral ===

== Fourier Transform ==

{{Wikipedia|Fourier Transform}}

The Fourier Transform is used to break a time-domain signal into its frequency domain components. The Fourier Transform is very closely related to the Laplace Transform, and is only used in place of the Laplace transform when the system is being analyzed in a frequency context.

The Fourier Transform is defined as:

{{eqn|Fourier Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;F(j\omega) 
        = \mathcal{F}[f(t)] 
        = \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{-j\omega t} dt&lt;/math&gt;

And the Inverse Fourier Transform is defined as:

{{eqn|Inverse Fourier Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;f(t) 
        = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{F(j\omega)\right\}     
        = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty F(j\omega) e^{-j\omega t} d\omega&lt;/math&gt;

== Z-Transform ==

{{Wikipedia|Z-transform}}

The Z-transform is used primarily to convert discrete data sets into a continuous representation. The Z-transform is notationally very similar to the star transform, except that the Z transform does not take explicit account for the sampling period. The Z transform has a number of uses in the field of digital signal processing, and the study of discrete signals in general, and is useful because Z-transform results are extensively tabulated, whereas star-transform results are not.

The Z Transform is defined as:

{{eqn|Z Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;X(z) 
        = \mathcal{Z}[x[n]] 
        = \sum_{i = -\infty}^\infty x[n] z^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Inverse Z Transform ===

The inverse Z Transform is a highly complex transformation, and might be inaccessible to students without enough background in calculus. However, students who are familiar with such integrals are encouraged to perform some inverse Z transform calculations, to verify that the formula produces the tabulated results.

{{eqn|Inverse Z Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;x[n] = \frac{1}{2 \pi j} \oint_C X(z) z^{n-1} dz&lt;/math&gt;

=== Z-Transform Tables ===

{{:Engineering Tables/Z Transform Table}}

== Modified Z-Transform ==

{{Wikipedia|Advanced Z Transform}}

The Modified Z-Transform is similar to the Z-transform, except that the modified version allows for the system to be subjected to any arbitrary delay, by design. The Modified Z-Transform is very useful when talking about digital systems for which the processing time of the system is not negligible. For instance, a slow computer system can be modeled as being an instantaneous system with an output delay.

The modified Z transform is based off the delayed Z transform:

{{eqn|Modified Z Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;X(z, m) 
        = X(z, \Delta)|_{\Delta \to 1 - m} 
        = \mathcal{Z} \left\{ X(s)e^{-\Delta T s} \right\}|_{\Delta \to 1 - m} &lt;/math&gt;

== Star Transform ==

{{wikipedia|Star Transform}}

The Star Transform is a discrete transform that has similarities between the Z transform and the Laplace Transform. In fact, the Star Transform can be said to be nearly analogous to the Z transform, except that the Star transform explicitly accounts for the sampling time of the sampler.

The Star Transform is defined as:

{{eqn|Star Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;F^*(s) 
        = \mathcal{L}^*[f(t)] 
        = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty f(kT)e^{-skT}&lt;/math&gt;

Star transform pairs can be obtained by plugging &lt;math&gt;z = e^{sT}&lt;/math&gt; into the Z-transform pairs, above.

== Bilinear Transform ==

The bilinear transform is used to convert an equation in the Z domain into the arbitrary W domain, with the following properties:

#roots inside the unit circle in the Z-domain will be mapped to roots on the left-half of the W plane.
#roots outside the unit circle in the Z-domain will be mapped to roots on the right-half of the W plane
#roots on the unit circle  in the Z-domain will be mapped onto the vertical axis in the W domain.

The bilinear transform can therefore be used to convert a Z-domain equation into a form that can be analyzed using the Routh-Hurwitz criteria. However, it is important to note that the W-domain is not the same as the complex Laplace S-domain. To make the output of the bilinear transform equal to the S-domain, the signal must be prewarped, to account for the non-linear nature of the bilinear transform.

The Bilinear transform can also be used to convert an S-domain system into the Z domain. Again, the input system must be prewarped prior to applying the bilinear transform, or else the results will not be correct.

The Bilinear transform is governed by the following variable transformations:

{{eqn|Bilinear Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{(T/2) + w}{(T/2) - w},\quad w = \frac{2}{T} \frac{z - 1}{z + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

Where T is the sampling time of the discrete signal. 

Frequencies in the w domain are related to frequencies in the s domain through the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_w = \frac{2}{T} \tan \left( \frac{ \omega_s T}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship is called the '''frequency warping characteristic''' of the bilinear transform. To counter-act the effects of frequency warping, we can '''pre-warp''' the Z-domain equation using the inverse warping characteristic. If the equation is prewarped before it is transformed, the resulting poles of the system will line up more faithfully with those in the s-domain.

{{eqn|Bilinear Frequency Prewarping}}
:&lt;math&gt; \omega = \frac{2}{T} \arctan \left( \omega_a \frac{T}{2} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Applying these transformations before applying the bilinear transform actually enables direct conversions between the S-Domain and the Z-Domain. The act of applying one of these frequency warping characteristics to a function before transforming is called '''prewarping'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a good place for adding tips, tricks, bugs and experiences which would help other owners of players in the SanDisk Sansa c100 series, which consists of:
*Sansa c140 - 1 gig
*Sansa c150 - 2 gig

While both the European and the American models of these players (for either c140 or c150) feature exactly the same hardware, the wireless, some recording functions and extra high volume settings are sadly disabled in the euro-firmware. In order to enable this functionality you may download and install the American firmware (see the links section, use at your own risk).

==Operating systems==
===Windows===
In Windows, the default setting is to use &quot;MTP&quot;. In practice, this means you need to have installed the relevant software (Windows Media Player 10). If you don't want to do this, or are using a different computer which doesn't have the software installed, then you can use it in &quot;MSC&quot; mode, and as described below.

===Other operating systems===
The c100 series can be used as a USB mass storage device. The computer treats it as another hard drive, and you can drag and drop files into the SanDisk player (or copy and paste). This makes it compatible with any standard operating system, including Windows, Mac or Linux. 

To use it in this mode, it should be set to MSC, under Settings&gt;USB&gt;MSC. (Auto-detect should make this unnecessary in theory, but it may not work properly).

==How to transfer playlists==

===A method that involves clearing the player's contents===
Follow these instructions, and it should work for you.

# Delete all the music on the Sansa (which should be located in the &quot;...media/music/&quot; directory). Also, delete the &quot;WMPinfo.xml&quot; file in the &quot;...media/&quot; directory (if there is one).
# Create a playlist or multiple playlists (.m3u) on Winamp, or some other mp3 playing program.
# Start-up Windows Media Player. Since you have deleted all the music on the Sansa, including the &quot;WMPinfo.xml&quot; file, Windows Media Player will &quot;think&quot; that it is the first time you have connected the device
# Press the &quot;Set Up Sync&quot; button at the top of the Windows Media Player window. A prompt should appear, asking you if you want to set up your walkman &quot;automatically&quot; or &quot;manually&quot;. Select &quot;Manually&quot;
and press &quot;Finish&quot;.
# To get your custom playlist(s) (the one(s) you just made) to appear in WMP's list of selectable playlists (you will see this list of selectable playlists in step 7), locate the &quot;.m3u&quot; file(s) you just created. Drag and drop it/them into the main window of Windows Media Player. Press the &quot;Start Sync&quot; button. It will give you the following error: &quot;Error: Windows Media Player cannot synchronize the file. The Player might not support the file type.&quot;

This is okay, since the only reason we were doing this was to get your playlist to appear in WMP's list of playlists.

The following steps (a-d) are optional steps you might wish to take before continuing to step 6: I've noticed that WMP tries to convert some files on its own as it transfers them. Why? I do not know. And sometimes, WMP will say that it cannot transfer a given file because the file is not supported, even if you know for a fact that you are transferring a file that you know is just an mp3. So...to get around this, after completing step 5:

a.) In the top of the Windows Media Player window, there is a bar that says &quot;Windows Media Player&quot; with the Windows logo to the   left of it. Right click it. Go to &quot;Tools-&gt;Options&quot;.

b.) Select the tab that says &quot;Devices&quot;. Your Sansa player should be in the list. Highlight it (by clicking on it), and press the &quot;Properties&quot; button.

c.) Now, there should be two tabs; one that says &quot;Synchronize&quot; and another that says &quot;Quality&quot;. Click the &quot;Quality&quot; tab, and uncheck the box that says &quot;Convert files as required by the device (recommended)&quot;. A warning will appear asking you if you are sure you want to uncheck the box and you &quot;wish to continue&quot;. Click &quot;Yes&quot;.

d.) Then click on the &quot;OK&quot; button on the &quot;Sansa c140 Properties&quot; window, and &quot;OK&quot; on the &quot;Options&quot; window. Now...you can proceed to step 6.

6.) Now, press the &quot;Set up Sync&quot; again. A window will appear that says &quot;Synchronization Settings&quot; at the top. Check the box that says &quot;Synchronize device automatically&quot;.

7.) Once checked, you will have the ability of checking each of the playlists listed in the window that you want to send to your device. Most of them are playlists that are automatically generated by Windows Media Player based upon your listening habits while listening to your music on Windows Media player. The playlist you created earlier will be in the list. Check the box next to it. Make sure there are no other boxes checked...except for the playlist that you want to send. Note: YOU CAN DO THIS FOR AS MANY PLAYLISTS AS YOU WANT.

8.) Press the &quot;OK&quot; button and...voila! Your music starts to transfer to your device, from the playlist you generated.


When the player is done transferring, even though there will not be any playlist(s) file(s) in the &quot;...Media/Playlists&quot; directory (when navigating via Windows Explorer), when you disconnect the player, and you navigate, via the player's on-screen menu, to &quot;Music -&gt; Playlists&quot;, your playlist(s) will appear beneath the &quot;Go List&quot; that is already on the player.

===An easier way than wiping out your player and using WMP===
Use the Rapsody music management software.  On the window to the left that shows devices/drives as well as playlists, you may drag &amp; drop a playlist into the c140.  When you unplug your device and navigate, the list will show up in the Playlist menu beneath the &quot;go list.&quot;

===A way that doesn't require Rhapsody===
If you set your Sansa up as an MSC device (it's in the settings menu under &quot;USB&quot;), there's an even easier way. Copy your music to a folder in the Sansa, then the files to an M3U playlist in Winamp (or another music player which supports M3U- nearly all do) and save the M3U playlist to the same folder on your Sansa.
In other words:
# Drag &amp; drop music to your Sansa.
# Open up Winamp. Drag &amp; drop your music ON THE SANSA into Winamp's playlist.
# Click List Opts (lower right corner of the playlist), then &quot;Save List&quot;.
# Save the list ''in the folder on your Sansa that you drag &amp; dropped the music into''. Make sure you save it as an M3U playlist, not PLS or M3U-8 (Unicode).
# Unhook and enjoy. Your playlist will now be in the &quot;Playlists&quot; menu.

==Troubleshooting==
===Player hangs on startup, no keys work===
Try these in order until you get one that works: ''(when instructions call for RESET, hold down the power button for 20 seconds)''
# RESET
# Remove the battery, RESET, replace the battery
# Remove the battery and replace it in the player BACKWARDS, RESET, put the battery back in correctly
# Use the Recovery Tool to perform a firmware update '''(NOTE: this will clear the contents of your player)''' 
## Download the Firmware Update found at the end of this page
## Unrar the file
## Carefully read and follow the howto.txt file

This is a study guide for the history of the Roman Catholic Church.

== The importance of history ==
1.'''Sources of history'''
:* ''Books'': both by those &quot;participating&quot; in history, and those &quot;observing&quot; history
:* ''Audio and video recordings''
:* ''Newspaper'', ''magazine'', and ''internet news articles''
:* ''Artifacts''
:* ''Oral history''

2.'''Why do we study history?'''
:* ''To make sure that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past''
:* ''To repeat the successes of the past''
:* ''To maintain and use a database of experiences that will allow us to infer courses of action when we encounter new situations''
:* ''To understand that events in the past effect current events; chronologies (timelines) only give us the foundational facts''

3. '''The role of the church in the world has changed over time'''

== Models of church ==

# '''Servant''': Church acts to serve all people
# '''Herald of God's Word''': Church spreading the gospel throughout the world
# '''Institution''': A corporate structure which is organized with particular rules and a hierarchy which then allows it to grow and continue over time
# '''Community of Disciples''': Church acting in such a way so as to show how Jesus wants us to live
# '''Sacrament''': Church, unified, acting to bring God into the world
# '''Body of Christ/People of God''': Church acting to bring Christ into the world

== The earliest church ==

# Paul went on three missionary trips
# Paul got in trouble and said he was a Roman citizen, which he was.
# When he got to Rome, he was persecuted

===Paul's Mission===
Paul acted as a missionary to spread Christianity around the areas of Rome, Israel and North Africa, he made 3 trips and after that he revisited the areas he had visited to preach again and to monitor the conditions of the area.

Paul's primary motivation is always to bring as many as possible to salvation through Christ.  In Rome Paul wanted to also accomplish :
1. Make Christianity larger and more influential.
2. Wants Roman Citizens to send him as missionary into Spain.

In Spain, Paul didn't do well because of the different culture, religious beliefs, and language. In 50 AD, the Council of Jerusalem established that you don't have to follow Kosher laws to be Christian.

=== Persecutions ===
Demand for conformity lead to Persecution lead to Martyrs.

Two major persecutions
:a. Mid 2nd century.
:b. Starts in 303 with clergy, then all Christians in 305; ends in 311

As Paul was persecuted by people by his teachings, newly baptized Christians too faced the same, their persecution in the Roman society led to deaths; these Christians were forced to profess Pagan Religions at that time and Christians too refused to offer offerings to Pagan gods before competitions and wars. In 285, Diocletian rises to power and splits the Roman Empire into East(Constantinople) and West(Rome) and has a leader for each which is called the ''Augustus'' and a ''Caesar'' who is the vice leader.

306 Diocletian abdicates which means a new Caeser needs to be chosen.
The people want Constatine to become Caesar but on the way down to Rome, the other one dies..

The Battle of the Milvian Bridge, October 28, 312

Constantine sees the Greek letters chi and rho, which is the symbol for Christianity.
God told him to put it on everything he could find.
This is the first time someone fought with Christianity.
The Edict of Milan, 313, made Christianity legal in the Roman Empire.

=== Constantine ===

a) He wants the empire to be unified, and he trys Christianity to do that.
    1) He gives them money and land.
    2) He makes church officials government officials too.
The Church endorses the Empire in return for the things that it has given to them.

The Church begins to develop a theology.

Heresies 

Heresy- a teaching that is contrary to the essential teachings of a religion.

Gnosticism- All matter is inherently evil, therefore Jesus cannot be man.
Arianism- Jesus is man, not God.
Monophysitism- Jesus was fully human but then was taken over by a divine nature, and then was fully God.

The Creed

A creed was written to stamp out these heresies, to make it unified.

A creed is a statement of beliefs.

In 324 Constantine called a council in his seaside resort of Nicea. He paid for all the bishops to come. It took six months.

On 14 June 325, they came up with the Nicene Creed.

Arianism continued for another fifty-five years.

A Christian Empire

380 Theodosius made Christianity the only legal religion in the empire.

May 381 the Constantinopolitan Creed was written, it expanded the part about the Holy Sprit, and it used a narrative style for better use in liturgy. It clarified the anti-Arian language of Nicea. Arianism goes away.

Monasticism 
Isolated from society to seek God because monastics want to escape the imperial influence on Christianity.

The first known monk was St. Anthony of Egypt, he spent eighty years in the desert, and started monasteries.

Hermetic Monasticism: Serve God through work and prayer.

Communal Monasticism: community of monastics

Women greatly influenced the great people of the church.
convent- where women are bound together by vows of religious life.

St. Basil came up with a system of monastic life.

St. Basil's Rule
1) Eat only what you need.
2) Own only what you need.
3) Obey the abbot.

Rule of St. Benedict
ORA ET LABORA
A monks life should be a balance of prayer and work.

Basil's rule was generally used in the east, and Benedict's in the west.

PAX ROMANA
Economic stability
Organized society
System of defense
National identity

West
After the fall of the empire Christianity is the only unified thing in the west.
Conglomeration of Barbarian tribes.
Uses: Latin, Basilicae, Benedictine monks.

East
Byzantine Empire
The empire controlled the church in the east
&quot;Patriarchs&quot; and the empire appointed them
Uses&quot;: Greek, Eastern basilicae, Basilian monks.
Justinian was the last strong emperor 527-565

* He establishes the Justinian Code &quot;laws&quot;
* It was the basis of all early European law and the Napoleonic Code.
* It made divorce harder, and you couldn't sell your family.

Reading information from the media library is actually quite simple - It's all implimented in Umbraco. You only need to use a method in the umbraco.library in your XSLT.


To get the filename of a file in media library use the following XSLT:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;umbraco.library:GetMedia(./data [@alias = '&lt;your property&gt;'], 'false')/data [@alias = 'umbracoFile']&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ray Transparency and ZTransparency cannot be turned on in the same time and 'SpecTra' is stricte Ray Transparency tweaker. I would personally add some Ray Mirror for cornea so it shows seen objects when close up.


Wouldn't a simpler (at least to understand) way for making the iris be this:
Create a new mesh &quot;tube&quot; with 8 vertices, then select one end of it and resize it. Then shorten the tube until you have a concave disc with a hole in the middle.



Could someone please put detailed instructions on how to model each piece of the eye (with pictures)? I have no idea what the writer(s) is talking about. Sayibng &quot;I won't go deep into modelling of each element - it uses Blender's subdivision surfaces and it's quite simple as you can see.&quot; really doesn't help noobs at all. I've been struggling wiht this for and 2 hours but I still have nothing but the eye white. ~frustrated noob

-If you haven't read the previous tutorials then you shouldn't really be able to understand it ;)


==Cornea==

This tutorial makes no reference to curving the cornea, or even what shape it is supposed to be of. I assume it is supposed to be a circle, similar to the iris, but this time curving it outward from the eye. Is this correct?

Try creating a new sphere and then delete everything except the tip with triangular faces.[[Special:Contributions/202.153.251.2|202.153.251.2]] ([[User talk:202.153.251.2|talk]]) 12:39, 22 February 2008 (UTC)

== Stability Criteria ==

The Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion provides a simple
algorithm to decide whether or not the zeros of a polynomial 
are all in the left half of the complex plane (such a polynomial is called at times &quot;Hurwitz&quot;). A Hurwitz polynomial is a key
requirement for a linear continuous-time time invariant 
to be stable (all bounded inputs produce bounded outputs).

;Necessary stability conditions: Conditions that must hold for a polynomial to be Hurwitz.
If any of them fails - the polynomial is not stable. However, they may all hold
without implying stability. 
;Sufficient stability conditions: Conditions that if met imply that the polynomial is stable. However, a polynomial may be stable without implying some or any of them.

The Routh criteria provides condition that are both necessary and sufficient
for a polynomial to be Hurwitz.

== Routh-Hurwitz Criteria ==


The Routh-Hurwitz criteria is comprised of three separate tests that must be satisfied. If any single test fails, the system is not stable and further tests need not be performed. For this reason, the tests are arranged in order from the easiest to determine to the hardest.

The Routh Hurwitz test is performed on the denominator of the transfer function, the '''characteristic equation'''. For instance, in a closed-loop transfer function with G(s) in the forward path, and H(s) in the feedback loop, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = \frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

If we simplify this equation, we will have an equation with a numerator N(s), and a denominator D(s):

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

The Routh-Hurwitz criteria will focus on the denominator polynomial D(s).

=== Routh-Hurwitz Tests ===

Here are the three tests of the Routh-Hurwitz Criteria. For convenience, we will use N as the order of the polynomial (the value of the highest exponent of s in D(s)). The equation D(s) can be represented generally as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = a_0 + a_1s + a_2s^2 + \cdots + a_Ns^N&lt;/math&gt;

{{TextBox|1=
;Rule 1:All the coefficients a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; must be present (non-zero)
;Rule 2:All the coefficients a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; must be positive (equivalently all of them must be negative, with no sign change)
;Rule 3:If '''Rule 1''' and '''Rule 2''' are both satisfied, then form a '''Routh array''' from the coefficients a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. There is one pole in the right-hand s-plane for every sign change of the members in the first column of the Routh array (any sign changes, therefore, mean the system is unstable).}}

We will explain the Routh array below.

=== The Routh Array ===

The Routh array is formed by taking all the coefficients a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of D(s), and staggering them in array form. The final columns for each row should contain zeros:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s^N \\ s^{N-1} \end{matrix}
       \begin{vmatrix}a_N &amp; a_{N - 2} &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ a_{N-1} &amp; a_{N-3} &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
 \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, if N is odd, the top row will be all the odd coefficients. If N is even, the top row will be all the even coefficients. We can fill in the remainder of the Routh Array as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s^N \\ s^{N-1} \\  \\  \\ s^0 \end{matrix}
       \begin{vmatrix}a_N &amp; a_{N - 2} &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
                   \\ a_{N-1} &amp; a_{N-3} &amp; \cdots &amp; 0
                   \\ b_{N-1} &amp; b_{N-3} &amp; \cdots
                   \\ c_{N-1} &amp; c_{N-3} &amp; \cdots
                   \\ \cdots
 \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can define all our b, c, and other coefficients, until we reach row s&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. To fill them in, we use the following formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;b_{N-1} = \frac{-1}{a_{N-1}}\begin{vmatrix}a_N &amp; a_{N-2} \\ a_{N-1} &amp; a_{N-3}\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

And

:&lt;math&gt;b_{N-3} = \frac{-1}{a_{N-1}}\begin{vmatrix}a_N &amp; a_{N-4} \\ a_{N-1} &amp; a_{N-5}\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

For each row that we are computing, we call the left-most element in the row directly above it the '''pivot element'''. For instance, in row b, the pivot element is a&lt;sub&gt;N-1&lt;/sub&gt;, and in row c, the pivot element is b&lt;sub&gt;N-1&lt;/sub&gt; and so on and so forth until we reach the bottom of the array.

To obtain any element, we negate the determinant of the following matrix, and divide by the pivot element:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}k &amp; m \\ l &amp; n \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*'''k''' is the left-most element two rows above the current row.
*'''l''' is the pivot element.
*'''m''' is the element two rows up, and one column to the right of the current element.
*'''n''' is the element one row up, and one column to the right of the current element.

In terms of '''k l m n''', our equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{(lm) - (kn)}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: Calculating C&lt;sub&gt;N-3&lt;/sub&gt; ===

{{TextBox|1=
To calculate the value C&lt;sub&gt;N-3&lt;/sub&gt;, we must determine the values for '''k l m''' and '''n''':

*'''k''' is the left-most element two rows up: a&lt;sub&gt;N-1&lt;/sub&gt;
*'''l''' the pivot element, is the left-most element one row up: b&lt;sub&gt;N-1&lt;/sub&gt;
*'''m''' is the element from one-column to the right, and up two rows: a&lt;sub&gt;N-5&lt;/sub&gt;
*'''n''' is the element one column right, and one row up: b&lt;sub&gt;N-5&lt;/sub&gt;

Plugging this into our equation gives us the formula for C&lt;sub&gt;N-3&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{b_{N-1}}\begin{vmatrix}a_{N-1} &amp; a_{N-5} \\ b_{N-1} &amp; b_{N-5} \end{vmatrix} = \frac{a_{N-1}b_{N-5} - b_{N-1}a_{N-5}}{- b_{N-1}}&lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Example: Stable Third Order System ===

{{TextBox|1=
We are given a system with the following characteristic equation:

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) =s^3 + 2s^2 + 4s + 3&lt;/math&gt;

Using the first two requirements, we see that all the coefficients are non-zero, and all of the coefficients are positive. We will proceed then to construct the Routh-Array:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s^3 \\ s^2 \\ s^1 \\ s^0 \end{matrix}
       \begin{vmatrix}1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 
                    \\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 
                    \\ b_{N-1} &amp; b_{N-3} &amp; 0
                    \\ c_{N-1} &amp; c_{N-3} &amp; 0
 \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

And we can calculate out all the coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;b_{N-1} = \frac{(2)(4) - (1)(3)}{2} = \frac{5}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_{N-3} = \frac{(2)(0) - (0)(1)}{2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_{N-1} = \frac{(3)\left(\frac{5}{2}\right) - (2)(0)}{\frac{5}{2}} = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_{N-3} = \frac{(2)(0) - \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)(0)}{\frac{5}{2}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

And filling these values into our Routh Array, we can determine whether the system is stable:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s^3 \\ s^2 \\ s^1 \\ s^0 \end{matrix}
       \begin{vmatrix}1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 
                    \\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 
                    \\ \frac{5}{2} &amp; 0 &amp; 0
                    \\ 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
 \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

From this array, we can clearly see that all of the signs of the first column are positive, there are no sign changes, and therefore there are no poles of the characteristic equation in the RHP.}}

=== Special Case: Row of All Zeros ===

If, while calculating our Routh-Hurwitz, we obtain a row of all zeros, we do not stop, but can actually learn more information about our system. If we obtain a row of all zeros, we can replace the zeros with a value &amp;epsilon;, that we define as being an infinitely small positive number. We can use the value of epsilon in our equations, and when we are done constructing the Routh Array, we can take the limit as epsilon approaches 0 to determine the final format of our Routh array.

If we have a row of all zeros, the row directly above it is known as the '''Auxiliary Polynomial''', and can be very helpful. The roots of the auxiliary polynomial give us the precise locations of complex conjugate roots that lie on the j&amp;omega; axis. However, one important point to notice is that if there are repeated roots on the j&amp;omega; axis, the system is actually '''unstable'''. Therefore, we must use the auxiliary polynomial to determine whether the roots are repeated or not.

=== Special Case: Zero in the First Column ===

In this special case, there is a zero in the first column of the Routh Array, but the other elements of that row are non-zero. Like the above case, we can replace the zero with a small variable epsilon (&amp;epsilon;) and use that variable to continue our calculations. After we have constructed the entire array, we can take the limit as epsilon approaches zero to get our final values.

== Nyquist Stability Criteria ==

The '''Nyquist Stability Criteria''' is a test for system stability, just like the [[Control_Systems/Routh-Hurwitz_Criterion|Routh-Hurwitz]] test, or the [[Control_Systems/Root_Locus|Root-Locus]] Methodology. However, the Nyquist Criteria can also give us additional information about a system. Routh-Hurwitz and Root-Locus can tell us where the poles of the system are for particular values of gain. By altering the gain of the system, we can determine if any of the poles move into the RHP, and therefore become unstable. The Nyquist Criteria, however, can tell us things about the ''frequency characteristics'' of the system. For instance, some systems with constant gain might be stable for low-frequency inputs, but become unstable for high-frequency inputs.

{{TextBox|1=Here is an example of a system responding differently to different frequency input values: Consider an ordinary glass of water. If the water is exposed to ordinary sunlight, it is unlikely to heat up too much. However, if the water is exposed to microwave radiation (from inside your microwave oven, for instance), the water will quickly heat up to a boil.}}

Also, the Nyquist Criteria can tell us things about the phase of the input signals, the time-shift of the system, and other important information.

== Contours ==

A '''contour''' is a complicated mathematical construct, but luckily we only need to worry ourselves with a few points about them. We will denote contours with the Greek letter &amp;Gamma; (gamma). Contours are lines, drawn on a graph, that follow certain rules:

#The contour must close (it must form a complete loop)
#The contour may not cross directly through a pole of the system.
#Contours must have a direction (clockwise or counterclockwise, generally).
#A contour is called &quot;simple&quot; if it has no self-intersections. We only consider simple contours here.

Once we have such a contour, we can develop some important theorems about them, and finally use these theorems to derive the '''Nyquist stability criterion'''.

== Argument Principle ==

{{wikipedia|Argument principle}}

Here is the argument principle, which we will use to derive the stability criterion. Do not worry if you do not understand all the terminology, we will walk through it:

{{TextBox|1=
;The Argument Principle:If we have a contour, &amp;Gamma;, drawn in one plane (say the complex laplace plane, for instance), we can map that contour into another plane, the F(s) plane, by transforming the contour with the function F(s). The resultant contour, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{F(s)}&lt;/math&gt; will circle the origin point of the F(s) plane N times, where N is equal to the difference between Z and P (the number of zeros and poles of the function F(s), respectively).}}

When we have our contour, &amp;Gamma;, we transform it into &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{F(s)}&lt;/math&gt; by plugging every point of the contour into the function F(s), and taking the resultant value to be a point on the transformed contour. 

=== Example: First Order System ===

{{TextBox|1=Let's say, for instance, that &amp;Gamma; is a unit square contour in the complex s plane. The vertices of the square are located at points I,J,K,L, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;I = 1 + j1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J = 1 - j1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K = -1 - j1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L = -1 + j1&lt;/math&gt;

we must also specify the direction of our contour, and we will say (arbitrarily) that it is a clockwise contour (travels from I to J to K to L). We will also define our transform function, F(s), to be the following:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = 2s + 1&lt;/math&gt;

We can factor the denominator of F(s), and we can show that there is one zero at s &amp;rarr; -0.5, and no poles. Plotting this root on the same graph as our contour, we see clearly that it lies within the contour. Since s is a complex variable, defined with real and imaginary parts as:

:&lt;math&gt;s = \sigma + j \omega&lt;/math&gt;

We know that F(s) must also be complex. We will say, for reasons of simplicity, that the axes in the F(s) plane are u and v, and are related as such:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = u + jv = 2(\sigma + j\omega) + 1&lt;/math&gt;

From this relationship, we can define u and v in terms of &amp;sigma; and &amp;omega;:

:&lt;math&gt;u = 2 \sigma + 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v = 2 \omega&lt;/math&gt;

Now, to transform &amp;Gamma;, we will plug every point of the contour into F(s), and the resultant values will be the points of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{F(s)}&lt;/math&gt;. We will solve for complex values u and v, and we will start with the vertices, because they are the simplest examples:

:&lt;math&gt;u + jv = F(I) = 3 + j2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u + jv = F(J) = 3 - j2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u + jv = F(K) = -1 + j2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u + jv = F(L) = -1 - j2&lt;/math&gt;

We can take the lines in between the vertices as a function of s, and plug the entire function into the transform. Luckily, because we are using straight lines, we can simplify very much:

*Line from I to J: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 1, u = 3, v = \omega&lt;/math&gt;
*Line from J to K: &lt;math&gt;\omega = -1, u = 2 \sigma + 1, v = -1&lt;/math&gt;
*Line from K to L: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = -1, u = -1, v = \omega&lt;/math&gt;
*Line from L to I: &lt;math&gt;\omega = 1, u = 2 \sigma + 1, v = 1&lt;/math&gt;

And when we graph these functions, from vertex to vertex, we see that the resultant contour in the F(s) plane is a square, but not centered at the origin, and larger in size. Notice how the contour encircles the origin of the F(s) plane one time. This will be important later on.}}

=== Example:Second-Order System ===

{{TextBox|1=Let's say that we have a slightly more complicated mapping function:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \frac{s + 0.5}{2s^2 + 2s + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

We can see clearly that F(s) has a zero at s &amp;rarr; -0.5, and a complex conjugate set of poles at s &amp;rarr; -0.5 + j0.5 and s &amp;rarr; -0.5 - j0.5. We will use the same unit square contour, &amp;Gamma;, from above:

:&lt;math&gt;I = 1 + j1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J = 1 - j1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K = -1 - j1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L = -1 + j1&lt;/math&gt;

We can see clearly that the poles and the zero of F(s) lie within &amp;Gamma;. Setting F(s) to u + jv and solving, we get the following relationships:

:&lt;math&gt;u + jv = F(\sigma + j \omega) 
              = \frac{(\sigma + 0.5) + j(\omega)}
                     {(2\sigma^2 - 2\omega^2 + 2\sigma + 1) + j(2\sigma\omega + \omega)}&lt;/math&gt;
                     
This is a little difficult now, because we need to simplify this whole expression, and separate it out into real and imaginary parts. There are two methods to doing this, neither of which is short or easy enough to demonstrate here to entirety:

#We convert the numerator and denominator polynomials into a polar representation in terms of r and &amp;theta;, then perform the division, and then convert back into rectangular format. 
#We plug each segment of our contour into this equation, and simplify numerically.

}}

== The Nyquist Contour ==

The Nyquist contour, the contour that makes the entire nyquist criterion work, must encircle the entire unstable region of the complex plane. For analog systems, this is the right half of the complex s plane. For digital systems, this is the entire plane outside the unit circle. Remember that if a pole to the closed-loop transfer function (or equivalently a zero of the characteristic equation) lies in the unstable region of the complex plane, the system is an unstable system. 

;Analog Systems:The Nyquist contour for analog systems is an infinite semi-circle that encircles the entire right-half of the s plane. The semicircle travels up the imaginary axis from negative infinity to positive infinity. From positive infinity, the contour breaks away from the imaginary axis, in the clock-wise direction, and forms a giant semicircle.
;Digital Systems:The Nyquist contour in digital systems is a counter-clockwise encirclement of the unit circle.

== Nyquist Criteria ==

{{wikipedia|Nyquist stability criterion}}

Let us first introduce the most important equation when dealing with the Nyquist criterion:

:&lt;math&gt;N = Z - P&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*N is the number of encirclements of the (-1, 0) point.
*Z is the number of zeros of the characteristic equation.
*P is the number of poles in the of the open-loop characteristic equation.

With this equation stated, we can now state the '''Nyquist Stability Criterion''':
{{TextBox|1=
;Nyquist Stability Criterion:A feedback control system is stable, if and only if the contour &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{F(s)}&lt;/math&gt; in the F(s) plane does not encircle the (-1, 0) point when P is 0.

:A feedback control system is stable, if and only if the contour &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{F(s)}&lt;/math&gt; in the F(s) plane encircles the (-1, 0) point a number of times equal to the number of poles of F(s) enclosed by &amp;Gamma;.}}

{{wikipedia|Nyquist plot}}

In other words, if P is zero then N must equal zero. Otherwise, N must equal P. Essentially, we are saying that Z must always equal zero, because Z is the number of zeros of the characteristic equation (and therefore the number of poles of the closed-loop transfer function) that are in the right-half of the s plane. 

Keep in mind that we don't necessarily know the locations of all the zeros of the characteristic equation. So if we find, using the nyquist criterion, that the number of poles is not equal to N, then we know that there must be a zero in the right-half plane, and that therefore the system is unstable.

== Nyquist &amp;harr; Bode ==

A careful inspection of the Nyquist plot will reveal a surprising relationship to the Bode plots of the system. If we use the Bode phase plot as the angle &amp;theta;, and the Bode magnitude plot as the distance r, then it becomes apparent that the Nyquist plot of a system is simply the polar representation of the Bode plots. 

To obtain the Nyquist plot from the Bode plots, we take the phase angle and the magnitude value at each frequency &amp;omega;. We convert the magnitude value from decibels back into gain ratios. Then, we plot the ordered pairs (r, &amp;theta;) on a polar graph.

== Nyquist in the Z Domain ==

The Nyquist Criteria can be utilized in the digital domain in a similar manner as it is used with analog systems. The primary difference in using the criteria is that the shape of the Nyquist contour must change to encompass the unstable region of the Z plane. Therefore, instead of an infinitesimal semi-circle, the Nyquist contour for digital systems is a counter-clockwise unit circle. By changing the shape of the contour, the same N = Z - P equation holds true, and the resulting Nyquist graph will typically look identical to one from an analog system, and can be interpreted in the same way.

== Transfer Functions ==

{{MATLAB CMD|tf|Control Systems/MATLAB}}

A '''Transfer Function''' is the ratio of the output of a system to the input of a system, in the Laplace domain considering its initial conditions and equilibrium point to be zero. If we have an input function of ''X(s)'', and an output function ''Y(s)'', we define the transfer function ''H(s)'' to be:

{{eqn|Transfer Function}}
:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = {Y(s) \over X(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Readers who have read the [[Circuit Theory]] book will recognize the transfer function as being the impedance, admittance, impedance ratio of a voltage divider or the admittance ratio of a current divider.

[[Image:Laplace Block.svg|400px|center]]

== Impulse Response ==

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br /&gt;Time domain variables are generally written with lower-case letters. Laplace-Domain, and other transform domain variables are generally written using upper-case letters.}}

For comparison, we will consider the time-domain equivalent to the above input/output relationship. In the time domain, we generally denote the input to a system as ''x(t)'', and the output of the system as ''y(t)''. The relationship between the input and the output is denoted as the '''impulse response''', ''h(t)''.

We define the impulse response as being the relationship between the system output to its input. We can use the following equation to define the impulse response:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{y(t)}{x(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Impulse Function ===

It would be handy at this point to define precisely what an &quot;impulse&quot; is. The '''Impulse Function''', denoted with &amp;delta;''(t)'' is a special function defined piece-wise as follows:

{{eqn|Impulse Function}}
:&lt;math&gt;\delta(t) = \left\{
\begin{matrix} 
  0, &amp; t &lt; 0
\\
  \mbox{undefined}, &amp; t = 0
\\
  0, &amp; t &gt; 0
\end{matrix}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

The impulse function is also known as the '''delta function''' because it's denoted with the Greek lower-case letter &amp;delta;. The delta function is typically graphed as an arrow towards infinity, as shown below:

[[Image:Delta Function.svg|center]]

It is drawn as an arrow because it is difficult to show a single point at infinity in any other graphing method. Notice how the arrow only exists at location 0, and does not exist for any other time ''t''. The delta function works with regular time shifts just like any other function. For instance, we can graph the function &amp;delta;''(t - N)'' by shifting the function &amp;delta;''(t)'' to the right, as such:

[[Image:DeltaN Function.svg|center]]

An examination of the impulse function will show that it is related to the unit-step function as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(t) = \frac{du(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = \int \delta(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;

The impulse function is not defined at point ''t = 0'', but the impulse must always satisfy the following condition, or else it is not a true impulse function:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(t)dt = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The response of a system to an impulse input is called the '''impulse response'''. Now, to get the Laplace Transform of the impulse function, we take the derivative of the unit step function, which means we multiply the transform of the unit step function by s:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[u(t)] = U(s) = \frac{1}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[\delta(t)] = sU(s) = \frac{s}{s} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

This result can be verified in the transform tables in '''[[Control_Systems/Transforms_Appendix#Table_of_Laplace_Transforms|The Appendix]]'''.

=== Step Response ===

{{MATLAB CMD|step|Control Systems/MATLAB}}

Similar to the impulse response, the '''step response''' of a system is the output of the system when a unit step function is used as the input. The step response is a common analysis tool used to determine certain metrics about a system. Typically, when a new system is designed, the step response of the system is the first characteristic of the system to be analyzed.

== Convolution ==
{{MATLAB CMD|conv|Control Systems/MATLAB}}
However, the impulse response cannot be used to find the system output from the system input in the same manner as the transfer function. If we have the system input and the impulse response of the system, we can calculate the system output using the '''convolution operation''' as such:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = h(t) * x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

{{SideBox|Remember: an asterisk means '''convolution''', not '''multiplication'''!}}

Where &quot; * &quot; (asterisk) denotes the convolution operation. Convolution is a complicated combination of multiplication, integration and time-shifting. We can define the convolution between two functions, ''a(t)'' and ''b(t)'' as the following:

{{eqn|Convolution}}
:&lt;math&gt;(a*b)(t) = (b*a)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty a(\tau)b(t - \tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

(The variable &amp;tau; (Greek tau) is a dummy variable for integration). This operation can be difficult to perform. Therefore, many people prefer to use the Laplace Transform (or another transform) to convert the convolution operation into a multiplication operation, through the '''Convolution Theorem'''.

=== Time-Invariant System Response ===

If the system in question is time-invariant, then the general description of the system can be replaced by a convolution integral of the system's impulse response and the system input. We can call this the '''convolution description''' of a system, and define it below:

{{eqn|Convolution Description}}
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(\tau)h(t - \tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

== Convolution Theorem ==

This method of solving for the output of a system is quite tedious, and in fact it can waste a large amount of time if you want to solve a system for a variety of input signals. Luckily, the Laplace transform has a special property, called the '''Convolution Theorem''', that makes the operation of convolution easier:
{{TextBox|
;Convolution Theorem:Convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the complex Laplace domain. Multiplication in the time domain becomes convolution in the complex Laplace domain.}}

The Convolution Theorem can be expressed using the following equations:

{{eqn|Convolution Theorem}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[f(t) * g(t)] = F(s)G(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[f(t)g(t)] = F(s) * G(s)&lt;/math&gt;

This also serves as a good example of the property of '''Duality'''.

== Using the Transfer Function ==

The Transfer Function fully describes a control system. The Order, Type and Frequency response can all be taken from this specific function. Nyquist and Bode plots can be drawn from the open loop Transfer Function. These plots show the stability of the system when the loop is closed. Using the denominator of the transfer function, called the characteristic equation, roots of the system can be derived.

For all these reasons and more, the Transfer function is an important aspect of classical control systems. Let's start out with the definition:
{{TextBox|
;Transfer Function:The Transfer function of a system is the relationship of the system's output to its input, represented in the complex Laplace domain.}}

If the complex Laplace variable is ''s'', then we generally denote the transfer function of a system as either ''G(s)'' or ''H(s)''. If the system input is ''X(s)'', and the system output is ''Y(s)'', then the transfer function can be defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

If we know the input to a given system, and we have the transfer function of the system, we can solve for the system output by multiplying:

{{eqn|Transfer Function Description}}
:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = H(s)X(s)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: Impulse Response ===

{{TextBox|1=
From a Laplace transform table, we know that the Laplace transform of the impulse function, &amp;delta;''(t)'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[\delta (t) ] = 1&lt;/math&gt;

So, when we plug this result into our relationship between the input, output, and transfer function, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = X(s)H(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = (1) H(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = H(s)&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the &quot;impulse response&quot; is the output of the system when we input an impulse function.}}

=== Example: Step Response ===

{{TextBox|1=From the Laplace Transform table, we can also see that the transform of the unit step function, ''u(t)'' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[u(t)] = \frac{1}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging that result into our relation for the transfer function gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = X(s)H(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = \frac{1}{s}H(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = \frac{H(s)}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

And we can see that the step response is simply the impulse response divided by ''s''.}}

=== Example: MATLAB Step Response ===

{{TextBox|1=Use MATLAB to find the step response of the following transfer function:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=\frac{79s^2+916s+1000}{s(s+10)^3}&lt;/math&gt;

We can separate out our numerator and denominator polynomials as such:

 num = [79 916 1000];
 den = [1 30 300 1000 0];
 sys = tf(num, den);

Now, we can get our step response from the '''step''' function, and plot it for time from 1 to 10 seconds:

 T = 1:0.001:10;
 step(sys, T);}}

== Frequency Response ==

The '''Frequency Response''' is similar to the Transfer function, except that it is the relationship between the system output and input in the complex Fourier Domain, not the Laplace domain. We can obtain the frequency response from the transfer function, by using the following change of variables:

:&lt;math&gt;s = j\omega&lt;/math&gt;

{{TextBox|
;Frequency Response:The frequency response of a system is the relationship of the system's output to its input, represented in the Fourier Domain.}}

[[Image:Fourier Block.svg|400px|center]]

Because the frequency response and the transfer function are so closely related, typically only one is ever calculated, and the other is gained by simple variable substitution. However, despite the close relationship between the two representations, they are both useful individually, and are each used for different purposes.

[edit]Block Diagram Representation
-----------&gt;
When designing or analyzing a system, often it is useful to model the system graphically. '''Block Diagrams''' are a useful and simple method for analyzing a system graphically. A &quot;block&quot; looks on paper exactly how it sounds:
&lt;!----------another block of unformatted text-------------
If system H has a time-domain impulse response h(t), we can express y(t) as:
y(t) = x(t) * h(t)
Where the asterisk ( * ) denotes convolution. If system H has a Laplace-domain transfer function H(s), we show the relationship between the input and the output as:

Y(s) = X(s)H(s)
[edit]Systems in Series

When two or more systems are in series, they can be combined into a single representative system, with a transfer function that is the sum of the individual systems.

If we have two systems, f(t) and g(t), we can put them in series with one another so that the output of system f(t) is the input to system g(t). Now, we can analyze them depending on whether we are using our classical or modern methods.
If we define the output of the first system as h(t), we can define h(t) as:
h(t) = x(t) * f(t)
Now, we can define the system output y(t) in terms of h(t) as:
y(t) = h(t) * g(t)
We can expand h(t):
y(t) = [x(t) * f(t)] * g(t)
But, since convolution is associative, we can re-write this as:
y(t) = x(t) * [f(t) * g(t)]
Our system can be simplified therefore as such:

[edit]Series Transfer Functions
If two or more systems are in series with one another, the total transfer function of the series is the product of all the individual system transfer functions.

In the time domain we know that:
y(t) = x(t) * [f(t) * g(t)]
But, in the frequency domain we know that convolution becomes multiplication, so we can re-write this as:
Y(s) = X(s)[F(s)G(s)]
We can represent our system in the frequency domain as:

[edit]Series State Space
If we have two systems in series (say system F and system G), where the output of F is the input to system G, we can write out the state-space equations for each individual system.
System 1:
xF' = AFxF + BFu
yF = CFxF + DFu
System 2:
xG' = AGxG + BGyF
yG = CGxG + DGyF
And we can write substitute these equations together form the complete response of system H, that has input u, and output yG:

[edit]Systems in Parallel


Blocks may not be placed in parallel without the use of an adder. Blocks connected by an adder as shown above have a total transfer function of:
Y(s) = X(s)[F(s) + G(s)]
Since the Laplace transform is linear, we can easily transfer this to the time domain by converting the multiplication to convolution:
y(t) = x(t) * [f(t) + g(t)]

[edit]State Space Model

== Systems in Series ==

When two or more systems are in series, they can be combined into a single representative system, with a transfer function that is the product of the individual systems.

[[Image:Time Series Block.svg|center]]

If we have two systems, ''f(t)'' and ''g(t)'', we can put them in series with one another so that the output of system ''f(t)'' is the input to system ''g(t)''. Now, we can analyze them depending on whether we are using our classical or modern methods.

If we define the output of the first system as ''h(t)'', we can define ''h(t)'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = x(t) * f(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can define the system output ''y(t)'' in terms of ''h(t)'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = h(t) * g(t)&lt;/math&gt;

We can expand ''h(t)'':

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = [x(t) * f(t)] * g(t)&lt;/math&gt;

But, since convolution is associative, we can re-write this as:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = x(t) * [f(t) * g(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

Our system can be simplified therefore as such:

[[Image:Time Convolution Block.svg|center]]

=== Series Transfer Functions ===

If two or more systems are in series with one another, the total transfer function of the series is the product of all the individual system transfer functions.

[[Image:S-Domain Series Block.svg|center]]

In the time domain we know that:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = x(t) * [f(t) * g(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

But, in the frequency domain we know that convolution becomes multiplication, so we can re-write this as:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = X(s)[F(s)G(s)]&lt;/math&gt;

We can represent our system in the frequency domain as:

[[Image:S-Domain Multiplication Block.svg|center]]

=== Series State Space ===

If we have two systems in series (say system F and system G), where the output of F is the input to system G, we can write out the state-space equations for each individual system.

System 1:
:&lt;math&gt;x_F' = A_Fx_F + B_Fu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_F = C_Fx_F + D_Fu&lt;/math&gt;

System 2: 
:&lt;math&gt;x_G' = A_Gx_G + B_Gy_F&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_G = C_Gx_G + D_Gy_F&lt;/math&gt;

And we can write substitute these equations together form the complete response of system H, that has input u, and output y&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;:

{{eqn|Series state equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}x_G' \\ x_F'\end{bmatrix} 
     = \begin{bmatrix}A_G &amp; B_GC_F \\ 0 &amp; A_F\end{bmatrix} 
       \begin{bmatrix}x_G \\ x_F\end{bmatrix} +
       \begin{bmatrix}B_GD_F \\ B_F\end{bmatrix}u&lt;/math&gt;
{{eqn|Series output equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}y_G \\ y_F\end{bmatrix} 
     = \begin{bmatrix}C_G &amp; D_GC_F \\ 0 &amp; C_F\end{bmatrix} 
       \begin{bmatrix}x_G \\ x_F\end{bmatrix} +
       \begin{bmatrix}D_GD_F \\ D_F\end{bmatrix}u&lt;/math&gt;

== Systems in Parallel ==

[[Image:S-Domain Parallel Block.svg|center]]

Blocks may not be placed in parallel without the use of an adder. Blocks connected by an adder as shown above have a total transfer function of:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = X(s) [F(s) + G(s)]&lt;/math&gt;

Since the Laplace transform is linear, we can easily transfer this to the time domain by converting the multiplication to convolution:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = x(t) * [f(t) + g(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:S-Domain Addition Block.svg|center]]

== State Space Model ==

The state-space equations, with non-zero A, B, C, and D matrices conceptually model the following system:

[[Image:Typical State Space Model (General).svg|center]]

In this image, the strange-looking block in the center is either an integrator or an ideal delay, and can be represented in the transfer domain as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{s}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{z}&lt;/math&gt; 

Depending on the time characteristics of the system. If we only consider continuous-time systems, we can replace the funny block in the center with an integrator:

[[Image:Typical State Space Model (CT).svg|center]]

=== In the Laplace Domain ===

The state space model of the above system, if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are transfer functions ''A(s)'', ''B(s)'', ''C(s)'' and ''D(s)'' of the individual subsystems, and if ''U(s)'' and ''Y(s)'' represent a single input and output, can be written as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = B(s)\left(\frac{1}{s - A(s)}\right)C(s) + D(s)&lt;/math&gt;

We will explain how we got this result, and how we deal with feedforward and feedback loop structures in the next chapter.

== Feedback ==

A '''feedback loop''' is a common and powerful tool when designing a control system. Feedback loops take the system output into consideration, which enables the system to adjust its performance to meet a desired output response. 

When talking about control systems it is important to keep in mind that engineers typically are given existing systems such as actuators, sensors, motors, and other devices with set parameters, and are asked to adjust the performance of those systems. In many cases, it may not be possible to open the system (the &quot;plant&quot;) and adjust it from the inside: modifications need to be made external to the system to force the system response to act as desired. This is performed by adding controllers, compensators, and feedback structures to the system.

== Basic Feedback Structure ==

[[Image:Simple feedback control loop.png|center|framed]]
{{Wikipedia|Feedback}}
This is a basic feedback structure. Here, we are using the output value of the system to help us prepare the next output value. In this way, we can create systems that correct errors. Here we see a feedback loop with a value of one. We call this a '''unity feedback'''.

Here is a list of some relevant vocabulary, that will be used in the following sections:

;Plant:The term &quot;Plant&quot; is a carry-over term from chemical engineering to refer to the main system process. The plant is the preexisting system that does not (without the aid of a controller or a compensator) meet the given specifications. Plants are usually given &quot;as is&quot;, and are not changeable. In the picture above, the plant is denoted with a P.
;Controller:A controller, or a &quot;compensator&quot; is an additional system that is added to the plant to control the operation of the plant. The system can have multiple compensators, and they can appear anywhere in the system: Before the pick-off node, after the summer, before or after the plant, and in the feedback loop. In the picture above, our compensator is denoted with a C.
{{SideBox|Some texts, or texts in other disciplines may refer to a &quot;summer&quot; as an '''adder'''.}}
;Summer:A summer is a symbol on a system diagram, (denoted above with parenthesis) that conceptually adds two or more input signals, and produces a single sum output signal.
;Pick-off node:A pickoff node is simply a fancy term for a split in a wire. 
;Forward Path:The forward path in the feedback loop is the path after the summer, that travels through the plant and towards the system output.
;Reverse Path:The reverse path is the path after the pick-off node, that loops back to the beginning of the system. This is also known as the &quot;feedback path&quot;.
;Unity feedback:When the multiplicative value of the feedback path is 1.

== Negative vs Positive Feedback ==

It turns out that negative feedback is almost always the most useful type of feedback. When we subtract the value of the output from the value of the input (our desired value), we get a value called the '''error signal'''. The error signal shows us how far off our output is from our desired input.

Positive feedback has the property that signals tend to reinforce themselves, and grow larger. In a positive feedback system, noise from the system is added back to the input, and that in turn produces more noise. As an example of a positive feedback system, consider an audio amplification system with a speaker and a microphone. Placing the microphone near the speaker creates a positive feedback loop, and the result is a sound that grows louder and louder. Because the majority of noise in an electrical system is high-frequency, the sound output of the system becomes high-pitched.

=== Example: State-Space Equation ===

{{TextBox|1=In the previous chapter, we showed you this picture:
[[Image:Typical State Space model.png|center]]

Now, we will derive the I/O relationship into the state-space equations. If we examine the inner-most feedback loop, we can see that the forward path has an integrator system, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{s}&lt;/math&gt;, and the feedback loop has the matrix value A. If we take the transfer function only of this loop, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{inner}(s) = \frac{\frac{1}{s}}{1 - \frac{1}{s}A} = \frac{1}{s - A}&lt;/math&gt;

Pre-multiplying by the factor B, and post-multiplying by C, we get the transfer function of the entire lower-half of the loop:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{lower}(s) = B\left(\frac{1}{s - A}\right)C&lt;/math&gt;

We can see that the upper path (D) and the lower-path T&lt;sub&gt;lower&lt;/sub&gt; are added together to produce the final result:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{total}(s) = B\left(\frac{1}{s - A}\right)C + D&lt;/math&gt;

Now, for an alternate method, we can assume that '''x'''' is the value of the inner-feedback loop, right before the integrator. This makes sense, since the integral of '''x'''' should be '''x''' (which we see from the diagram that it is. Solving for '''x'''', with an input of '''u''', we get:

:&lt;math&gt;x' = Ax + Bu&lt;/math&gt;

This is because the value coming from the feedback branch is equal to the value '''x''' times the feedback loop matrix A, and the value coming from the left of the sumer is the input '''u''' times the matrix B. 

If we keep things in terms of '''x''' and '''u''', we can see that the system output is the sum of '''u''' times the feed-forward value D, and the value of '''x''' times the value C:

:&lt;math&gt;y = Cx + Du&lt;/math&gt;

These last two equations are precisely the state-space equations of our system.}}

== Feedback Loop Transfer Function ==

We can solve for the output of the system by using a series of equations:

:&lt;math&gt;E(s) = X(s) - Y(s)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Y(s) = G(s)E(s)&lt;/math&gt;

and when we solve for Y(s) we get: 

{{eqn|Feedback Transfer Function}}
:&lt;math&gt; Y(s) =  X(s) \frac{Gp(s)}{1 + Gp(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

The reader is encouraged to use the above equations to derive the result by themselves.

The function E(s) is known as the '''error signal'''. The error signal is the difference between the system output (Y(s)), and the system input (X(s)). Notice that the error signal is now the direct input to the system G(s). X(s) is now called the '''reference input'''. The purpose of the negative feedback loop is to make the system output equal to the system input, by identifying large differences between X(s) and Y(s) and correcting for them. 

=== Example: Elevator ===

Here is a simple example of reference inputs and feedback systems:

{{TextBox|1=There is an elevator in a certain building with 5 floors. Pressing button &quot;1&quot; will take you to the first floor, and pressing button &quot;5&quot; will take you to the fifth floor, etc. For reasons of simplicity, only one button can be pressed at a time.

Pressing a particular button is the reference input of the system. Pressing &quot;1&quot; gives the system a reference input of 1, pressing &quot;2&quot; gives the system a reference input of 2, etc. The elevator system then, tries to make the output (the physical floor location of the elevator) match the reference input (the button pressed in the elevator). The error signal, e(t), represents the difference between the reference input x(t), and the physical location of the elevator at time t, y(t).

Let's say that the elevator is on the first floor, and the button &quot;5&quot; is pressed at time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The reference input then becomes a step function:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = 5u(t - t_0)&lt;/math&gt;

Where we are measuring in units of &quot;floors&quot;. At time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the error signal is:

:&lt;math&gt;e(t_0) = x(t_0) - y(t_0) = 5 - 1 = 4&lt;/math&gt;

Which means that the elevator needs to travel upwards 4 more floors. At time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, when the elevator is at the second floor, the error signal is:

:&lt;math&gt;e(t_1) = x(t_1) - y(t_1) = 5 - 2 = 3&lt;/math&gt;

Which means the elevator has 3 more floors to go. Finally, at time t&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, when the elevator reaches the top, the error signal is:

:&lt;math&gt;e(t_4) = x(t_4) - y(t_4) = 5 - 5 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

And when the error signal is zero, the elevator stops moving. In essence, we can define three cases:
*e(t) is positive: In this case, the elevator goes up one floor, and checks again.
*e(t) is zero: The elevator stops.
*e(t) is negative: The elevator goes down one floor, and checks again. }}

=== State-Space Feedback Loops ===

In the state-space representation, the plant is typically defined by the state-space equations:

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The plant is considered to be pre-existing, and the matrices A, B, C, and D are considered to be internal to the plant (and therefore unchangeable). Also, in a typical system, the state variables are either fictional (in the sense of dummy-variables), or are not measurable. For these reasons, we need to add external components, such as a gain element, or a feedback element to the plant to enhance performance.

Consider the addition of a gain matrix K installed at the input of the plant, and a negative feedback element F that is multiplied by the system output ''y'', and is added to the input signal of the plant. There are two cases: 
#The feedback element F is subtracted from the input before multiplication of the K gain matrix.
#The feedback element F is subtracted from the input after multiplication of the K gain matrix.

In case 1, the feedback element F is added to the input before the multiplicative gain is applied to the input. If ''v'' is the input to the entire system, then we can define ''u'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) =  Fv(t) - FKy(t)&lt;/math&gt;

In case 2, the feeback element F is subtracted from the input after the multiplicative gain is applied to the input. If ''v'' is the input to the entire system, then we can define ''u'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = Fv(t) - Ky(t)&lt;/math&gt;

== Open Loop vs Closed Loop ==

[[Image:System 3 KGpGb.png|600px|center]]

Let's say that we have the generalized system shown above. The top part, Gp(s) represents all the systems and all the controllers on the forward path. The bottom part, Gb(s) represents all the feedback processing elements of the system. The letter &quot;K&quot; in the beginning of the system is called the '''Gain'''. We will talk about the gain more in later chapters. We can define the '''Closed-Loop Transfer Function''' as follows:

{{eqn|Closed-Loop Transfer Function}}
:&lt;math&gt; H_{cl}(s) =  \frac{KGp(s)}{1 + Gp(s)Gb(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

If we &quot;open&quot; the loop, and break the feedback node, we can define the '''Open-Loop Transfer Function''', as:
{{eqn|Open-Loop Transfer Function}}
:&lt;math&gt;H_{ol}(s) = KGp(s)&lt;/math&gt;

We can redefine the closed-loop transfer function in terms of this open-loop transfer function:

:&lt;math&gt; H_{cl}(s) = \frac{H_{ol}(s)}{1 +Gp(s)Gb(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

These results are important, and they will be used without further explanation or derivation throughout the rest of the book.


**Changed the original open loop gain from Gp(s)Gb(s) to kGp(s). Rational: open loop gain eliminates the feedback loop, which means Gb(s) should no longer exist leaving the proportional controller, in this case K, and the plant, Gp(s).

== Placement of a Controller ==

There are a number of different places where we could place an additional controller.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|[[Image:System 5 Positions.png|400px|center]]
|-
|
#In front of the system, before the feedback loop.
#Inside the feedback loop, in the forward path, before the plant.
#In the forward path, after the plant.
#In the feedback loop, in the reverse path.
#After the feedback loop.
|}

Each location has certain benefits and problems, and hopefully we will get a chance to talk about all of them.

== Second-Order Systems ==

=== Damping Ratio ===
The damping ratio is defined by way of the sign zeta. The damping ratio gives us an idea about the nature of the transient response detailing the amount of overshoot &amp; oscillation that the system will undergo. This is completely regardless time scaling. If zeta is: 

zero, the system is undamped;
zeta &lt; 1, the system is underdamped;
zeta = 1, the system is critically damped;
zeta &gt; 1, the system is overdamped;

Zeta is used in conjunction with the natural frequency to determine system properties. To find the zeta value you must first find the natural response!

== Poles and Zeros ==

'''Poles''' and '''Zeros''' of a transfer function are the frequencies for which the value of the denominator and numerator of transfer function becomes  zero respectively. The values of the poles and the zeros of a system determine whether the system is stable, and how well the system performs. Control systems, in the most simple sense, can be designed simply by assigning specific values to the poles and zeros of the system.

Physically realizable control systems must have a number of poles greater than or equal to the number of zeros. Systems that satisfy this relationship are called '''proper'''. We will elaborate on this below.

== Time-Domain Relationships ==

Let's say that we have a transfer function with 3 poles:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{a}{(s + l)(s + m)(s + n)}&lt;/math&gt;

The poles are located at s = -'''l''', -'''m''', -'''n'''. Now, we can use partial fraction expansion to separate out the transfer function:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{a}{(s + l)(s + m)(s + n)} = \frac{A}{s+l} + \frac{B}{s+m} + \frac{C}{s+n}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the inverse transform on each of these component fractions (looking up the transforms in our table), we get the following:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = Ae^{-lt}u(t) + Be^{-mt}u(t) + Ce^{-nt}u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

But, since s is a complex variable, '''l''' '''m''' and '''n''' can all potentially be complex numbers, with a real part (&amp;sigma;) and an imaginary part (j&amp;omega;). If we just look at the first term:

:&lt;math&gt;Ae^{-lt}u(t) = Ae^{-(\sigma_l + j\omega_l)t}u(t) = Ae^{-\sigma_l t}e^{-j\omega_l t}u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Using '''[[w:Euler's_identity|Euler's Equation]]''' on the imaginary exponent, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;Ae^{-\sigma_l t}[cos(\omega_l t) - j\sin(\omega_l t)]u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

And taking the real part of this equation, we are left with our final result:

:&lt;math&gt;Ae^{-\sigma_l t}cos(\omega_l t)u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

We can see from this equation that every pole will have an exponential part, and a sinusoidal part to its response. We can also go about constructing some rules:

#if &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, the response of the pole is a perfect sinusoid (an oscillator)
#if &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, the response of the pole is a perfect exponential.
#if &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0, the exponential part of the response will decay towards zero.
#if &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0, the exponential part of the response will rise towards infinity.

From the last two rules, we can see that all poles of the system must have negative real parts, and therefore they must all have the form (s + l) for the system to be stable. We will discuss stability in later chapters.

== What are Poles and Zeros ==

Let's say we have a transfer function defined as a ratio of two polynomials:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = {N(s) \over D(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''N(s)'' and ''D(s)'' are simple polynomials. '''Zeros''' are the roots of ''N(s)'' (the numerator of the transfer function) obtained by setting ''N(s) = 0'' and solving for ''s''. 

{{SideBox|The '''polynomial order''' of a function is the value of the highest exponent in the polynomial.}}

'''Poles''' are the roots of ''D(s)'' (the denominator of the transfer function), obtained by setting ''D(s) = 0'' and solving for ''s''. Because of our restriction above, that a transfer function must not have more zeros than poles, we can state that the polynomial order of ''D(s)'' must be greater than or equal to the polynomial order of ''N(s)''.

{{-}}

=== Example ===

{{TextBox|1=Consider the transfer function:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = {s + 2 \over s^2 + 0.25}&lt;/math&gt;

We define ''N(s)'' and ''D(s)'' to be the numerator and denominator polynomials, as such:

:&lt;math&gt;N(s) = s + 2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = s^2 + 0.25&lt;/math&gt;

We set ''N(s)'' to zero, and solve for ''s'':

:&lt;math&gt;N(s) = s + 2 = 0 \to s = -2&lt;/math&gt;

So we have a zero at ''s &amp;rarr; -2''. Now, we set ''D(s)'' to zero, and solve for ''s'' to obtain the poles of the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = s^2 + 0.25 = 0 \to s = + i\sqrt{0.25}, - i\sqrt{0.25}&lt;/math&gt;

And simplifying this gives us poles at: ''-i/2'' , ''+i/2''. Remember, ''s'' is a complex variable, and it can therefore take imaginary and real values.}}

== Effects of Poles and Zeros ==

As ''s'' approaches a zero, the numerator of the transfer function (and therefore the transfer function itself) approaches the value 0. When ''s'' approaches a pole, the denominator of the transfer function approaches zero, and the value of the transfer function approaches infinity. An output value of infinity should raise an alarm bell for people who are familiar with BIBO stability. We will discuss this later.

As we have seen above, the locations of the poles, and the values of the real and imaginary parts of the pole determine the response of the system. Real parts correspond to exponentials, and imaginary parts correspond to sinusoidal values.
Addition of a pole to a transfer function has the effect of pulling the root locus to the right making the system less stable. addition of zeros to the transfer function has the effect of pulling the root locus to the left ,thus making the system more stable

== Second-Order Systems ==

The canonical form for a second order system is as follows:

{{eqn|Second-order transfer function}}
:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{K\omega^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta\omega s + \omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where K is the '''system gain''', &amp;zeta; is called the '''damping ratio''' of the function, and &amp;omega; is called the '''natural frequency''' of the system. &amp;zeta; and &amp;omega;, if exactly known for a second order system, the time responses can be easily plotted and stability can easily be checked. More information on second order systems can be found [http://wikis.controltheorypro.com/index.php?title=Second_Order_Systems here].

=== Damping Ratio ===

The '''damping ratio''' of a second-order system, denoted with the Greek letter zeta (&amp;zeta;), is a real number that defines the damping properties of the system. More damping has the effect of less percent overshoot, and slower settling time. Damping is the inherent ability of the system to oppose the oscillatory nature of the system's transient response. Larger values of damping coefficient or damping factor produces transient responses with lesser oscillatory nature.

=== Natural Frequency ===

The natural frequency is occasionally written with a subscript:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega \to \omega_n&lt;/math&gt;

We will omit the subscript when it is clear that we are talking about the natural frequency, but we will include the subscript when we are using other values for the variable &amp;omega;. Also, &lt;math&gt;\omega~=~\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\zeta~=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Stability ==

When a system is unstable, the output of the system may be infinite even though the input to the system was finite. This causes a number of practical problems.  For instance, a robot arm controller that is unstable may cause the robot to move dangerously. Also, systems that are unstable often incur a certain amount of physical damage, which can become costly. Nonetheless, many systems are inherently unstable - a fighter jet, for instance, or a rocket at liftoff, are examples of naturally unstable systems.  Although we can design controllers that stabilize the system, it is first important to understand what stability is, how it is determined, and why it matters.

The chapters in this section are heavily mathematical, and many require a background in linear differential equations. Readers without a strong mathematical background might want to review the necessary chapters in the [[Calculus]] and [[Ordinary Differential Equations]] books (or equivalent) before reading this material.

For most of this chapter we will be assuming that the system is linear, and can be represented either by a set of transfer functions or in state space.  Linear systems have an associated characteristic polynomial, and this polynomial tells us a great deal about the stability of the system.  Negativeness of any coefficient of a characteristic polynomial indicates that  the system is either unstable or at most marginally stable. If any coefficient is zero/negative then we can say that the system is unstable.  It is important to note, though, that even if all of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are positive the system may still be unstable.  We will look into this in more detail below.

== BIBO Stability ==

A system is defined to be '''BIBO Stable''' if every bounded input to the system results in a bounded output over the time interval &lt;math&gt;[t_0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;. This must hold for all initial times t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. So long as we don't input infinity to our system, we won't get infinity output.

A system is defined to be '''uniformly BIBO Stable''' if there exists a positive constant ''k'' that is independent of t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that for all t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the following conditions:

:&lt;math&gt;\|u(t)\| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; t \ge t_0&lt;/math&gt;

implies that

:&lt;math&gt;\|y(t)\| \le k&lt;/math&gt;

There are a number of different types of stability, and keywords that are used with the topic of stability. Some of the important words that we are going to be discussing in this chapter, and the next few chapters are: '''BIBO Stable''', '''Marginally Stable''', '''Conditionally Stable''', '''Uniformly Stable''', '''Asymptoticly Stable''', and '''Unstable'''. All of these words mean slightly different things.

== Determining BIBO Stability ==

We can prove mathematically that a system f is BIBO stable if an arbitrary input x is bounded by two finite but large arbitrary constants M and -M:
:&lt;math&gt;-M &lt; x \le M&lt;/math&gt;

We apply the input x, and the arbitrary boundaries M and -M to the system to produce three outputs:

:&lt;math&gt;y_x = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_M = f(M)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_{-M} = f(-M)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, all three outputs should be finite for all possible values of M and x, and they should satisfy the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;y_{-M} \le y_x \le y_M&lt;/math&gt;

If this condition is satisfied, then the system is BIBO stable.

A SISO linear time-invariant (LTI) system is BIBO stable if and only if &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely integrable from [0,∞] or from:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infty} |g(t)| \,dt \leq M &lt; {\infty}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===

{{TextBox|1=Consider the system:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{2}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

We can apply our test, selecting an arbitrarily large finite constant M, and an arbitrary input x such that -M &lt; x &lt; M. 

As M approaches infinity (but does not reach infinity), we can show that:

:&lt;math&gt;y_{-M} = \lim_{M \to \infty} \frac{2}{-M} = 0^-&lt;/math&gt;

And:

:&lt;math&gt;y_M = \lim_{M \to \infty} \frac{2}{M} = 0^+&lt;/math&gt;

So now, we can write out our inequality:

:&lt;math&gt;y_{-M} \le y_x \le y_M&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0^- \le x &lt; 0^+&lt;/math&gt;

And this inequality should be satisfied for all possible values of x. However, we can see that when x is zero, we have the following:

:&lt;math&gt;y_x = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{2}{x} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

Which means that x is between -M and M, but the value y&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is not between y&lt;sub&gt;-M&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, this system is not stable. }}

== Poles and Stability ==

When the poles of the closed-loop transfer function of a given system are located in the right-half of the S-plane (RHP), the system becomes unstable. When the poles of the system are located in the left-half plane (LHP) and the system is not improper, the system is shown to be stable. A number of tests deal with this particular facet of stability: The '''Routh-Hurwitz Criteria''', the '''Root-Locus''', and the '''Nyquist Stability Criteria''' all test whether there are poles of the transfer function in the RHP. We will learn about all these tests in the upcoming chapters.

If the system is a multivariable, or a MIMO system, then the system is stable if and only if ''every pole of every transfer function'' in the transfer function matrix has a negative real part and every transfer function in the transfer function matrix is not improper. For these systems, it is possible to use the Routh-Hurwitz, Root Locus, and Nyquist methods described later, but these methods must be performed once for each individual transfer function in the transfer function matrix.

== Poles and Eigenvalues ==

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;Every pole of G(s) is an eigenvalue of the system matrix A. However, not every eigenvalue of A is a pole of G(s).}}

The   poles of the transfer function, and the eigenvalues of the system matrix A are related. In fact, we can say that the eigenvalues of the system matrix A ''are the poles of the transfer function'' of the system. In this way, if we have the eigenvalues of a system in the state-space domain, we can use the Routh-Hurwitz, and Root Locus methods as if we had our system represented by a transfer function instead.

On a related note, eigenvalues and all methods and mathematical techniques that use eigenvalues to determine system stability ''only work with time-invariant systems''. In systems which are time-variant, the methods using eigenvalues to determine system stability fail.

== Transfer Functions Revisited ==

We are going to have a brief refesher here about transfer functions, because several of the later chapters will use transfer functions for analyzing system stability.

Let us remember our generalized feedback-loop transfer function, with a gain element of K, a forward path Gp(s), and a feedback of Gb(s). We write the transfer function for this system as:

:&lt;math&gt; H_{cl}(s) = \frac{KGp(s)}{1 + H_{ol}(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;H_{cl}&lt;/math&gt; is the closed-loop transfer function, and &lt;math&gt;H_{ol}&lt;/math&gt; is the open-loop transfer function. Again, we define the open-loop transfer function as the product of the forward path and the feedback elements, as such:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{ol}(s) = KGp(s)Gb(s)&lt;/math&gt;     &lt;---Note this definition now contradicts the updated definition in the &quot;Feedback&quot; section.

Now, we can define F(s) to be the '''characteristic equation'''. F(s) is simply the denominator of the closed-loop transfer function, and can be defined as such:

{{eqn|Characteristic Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = 1 + H_{ol} = D(s)&lt;/math&gt;

We can say conclusively that the roots of the characteristic equation are the poles of the transfer function. Now, we know a few simple facts:

#The locations of the poles of the closed-loop transfer function determine if the system is stable or not
#The zeros of the characteristic equation are the poles of the closed-loop transfer function.
#The characteristic equation is always a simpler equation than the closed-loop transfer function.

These functions combined show us that we can focus our attention on the characteristic equation, and find the roots of that equation.

== State-Space and Stability ==

As we have discussed earlier, the system is stable if the eigenvalues of the system matrix A have negative real parts. However, there are other stability issues that we can analyze, such as whether a system is ''uniformly stable'', ''asymptotically stable'', or otherwise. We will discuss all these topics in a later chapter.

== Marginal Stablity ==

When the poles of the system in the complex S-Domain exist on the complex frequency axis (the vertical axis), or when the eigenvalues of the system matrix are imaginary (no real part), the system exhibits oscillatory characteristics, and is said to be marginally stable. A marginally stable system may become unstable under certain circumstances, and may be perfectly stable under other circumstances. It is impossible to tell by inspection whether a marginally stable system will become unstable or not.

We will discuss marginal stability more in the following chapters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cycloalkenes==

A '''cycloalkene''' (also sometimes called a ''cycloolefin'') is a type of '''alkene''' hydrocarbon which contains a closed ring of carbon atoms.  The prefix ''cyclo-'' comes from ancient Greek and in this case means ''round''.  Whenever the ends of a carbon chain are joined together, that molecule is said to be ''cyclic'', and alkenes are no different than other carbon chains in that respect.

Cycloalkenes are perhaps among the most important organic substances for biological and industrial purposes because they are used in the production of molecules essential to a broad spectrum of applications.  Understanding cycloalkenes is a critical part of understanding organic chemistry and its applications to biology, medicine, industry and every other relevant field.


===What They Are===
As stated above, a cycloalkene is merely a chain of carbon molecules containing at least one double bond between two carbon atoms that has joined two ends to form some type of ring structure.  The number of carbons involved and the number of double bonds shared affect molecule stability and other properties, but those factors do not affect the definition of what a cycloalkene is.

If an organic chemist knows the empirical formula of a molecule and also knows that it is a cyclic molecule, she can derive the shape of the molecule from this information.  She does so using the concept of '''sites of unsaturation'''.  As you know from the chapter on alkanes, a ''saturated'' hydrocarbon chain is one that has only single bonds between carbon atoms and enough hydrogens attached to give every single carbon a total of four molecular bonds.  If there are four carbon atoms, then using the saturation formula below we can calculate that there will be ten hydrogen atoms attached.


::&lt;big&gt;'''n&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; * 2 + 2 = n&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

Where '''n&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''' equals the number of carbon atoms and '''n&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;''' equals the number of hydrogen atoms.


But what if the empirical formula we are given does not show ten atoms of hydrogen for every four atoms of carbon?  What if it only shows eight?  You might guess that there was an error, but it is more likely that the molecule features one site of unsaturation where either a double bond has formed (as in an alkene) or the molecule is cyclic (where the two ends have joined together to form a ring).  The formula for calculating the number of double bonds in an alkene, and for accounting for cyclic structures, is below:


::ALKENES:&lt;big&gt; '''(n&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; * 2 + 2) - (2 * n&lt;sub&gt;DBL&lt;/sub&gt;)  = n&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;
::CYCLOALKENES:&lt;big&gt; '''(n&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; * 2 + 2) - (2 * n&lt;sub&gt;DBL&lt;/sub&gt;) - 2 = n&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

Where '''n&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''' equals the number of carbon atoms, '''n&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;''' equals the number of hydrogen atoms, and '''n&lt;sub&gt;DBL&lt;/sub&gt;''' equals the number of double bonds.  For cycloalkenes, the '''- 2''' just before the equal sign signifies the fact that two hydrogen atoms are displaced when a carbon chain joins from head to tail in order to form a ring.


===Physical Properties===
Cycloalkenes have slightly fewer bonds than equivalent straight-chain alkenes, which means that they have less internal energy.  The additional site of unsaturation due to the ring means that there are two fewer hydrogen atoms on the molecule, which is why there are fewer bonds in cycloalkenes than in straight chains.

On the macroscopic scale, cycloalkenes are most often found as liquids at standard temperature and pressure.  This is because a certain number of carbons are needed to make ring structures, which means the molecules are generally too heavy to be gaseous at STP.  Likewise, too many carbon atoms makes for too large a ring, so cycloalkenes are very rarely solid at STP as well.

Depending on which functional groups and side-chains a molecule may possess, some cycloalkenes can polymerize at STP thus forming a solid substance, but this should be considered a reasonable exception to the generalities listed above.

===Chemical Properties===
Alkenes contain double bonds by definition, and cycloalkenes benefit from enhanced stability if the double bonds are conjugated.  Cyclohexene is one such case, where if it contains a total of three double bonds it is no longer called cyclohexene.  A six-carbon ring with three alternating (and therefore conjugated) double bonds is called ''benzene'', and benzene is such a stable molecule that it displays completely different chemistry than other non-aromatic cycloalkenes.

==Star of the Show: Benzene==
Benzene is critical molecule to the study of organic chemistry.  It is a colorless and flammable carcinogenic liquid at STP, with a pleasant, sweet smell.

Benzene presents a special problem in that, to account for all the bonds, there must be alternating double carbon bonds.  Using X-ray diffraction, researchers in the early 20th century discovered that all of the carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are of the same length, but it was well known at the time that a single bond should be longer than a double bond.  In benzene, the distance between the two bonded atoms was greater than the length of a double bond, but shorter than the length of a single bond.  There seemed to be, in effect, a bond and a half between each carbon!

Today this fact can be explained by the concept of ''electron delocalization''.  Essentially, the electrons are not held tightly by one carbon atom or another, but instead they are somewhat &quot;smeared&quot; out, like cream cheese around the edges of a bagel.  The actual physics of the situation are far more complex than breakfast-food analogies could do justice, but the essential concept is the same.  The electrons - and thus, the electronegativity - of a benzene ring are spread evenly around the molecule.

This electron delocalization gives benzene many interesting and useful properties, as you will see in later chapters.  Of course benzene isn't the only molecule in organic chemistry with &quot;smeared&quot; electrons; the delocalization of electron density is also useful in discussing other molecules, which are called ''aromatics''.


===Aromaticity===
Aromaticity is a chemical property in which a conjugated ring of unsaturated bonds, lone electron pairs, or empty electron orbitals exhibit a stabilization stronger than would be expected by other factors alone.  Aromaticity can also be considered a manifestation of resonance, in that multiple possible conformations of the aromatic molecule contribute to its stability.

An aromatic compound contains a set of covalently-bound atoms with very specific characteristics, namely: a delocalized conjugated pi system, a coplanar structure, atoms arranged in one or more rings, and a number of pi delocalized electrons that is even but '''not''' a multiple of four. 

The permissible numbers of pi electrons in an aromatic structure are generally the even numbers not divisible by four, which would include 6, 10, 14, and so on.  Aromaticity is most often estimated using ''Hückel's rule'':

:'''A cyclic ring molecule should be aromatic when the number of &amp;pi; electrons equals 4n + 2, where n is any positive integer or zero.'''

But there have been exceptions found to this rule in more recent decades.

Aromatic molecules display special reactivity in organic reactions -- for example electrophilic aromatic substitution and nucleophilic aromatic substitution -- which can be used distinguish them from other cycloalkenes.


===Uses of Benzene===
Benzene is an important industrial solvent and a precursor in the industrial production of many types of drugs, plastics, synthetic rubbers, and dyes.  It is used in most organic compounds of commercial value because it is so very versatile and has many desirable chemical properties.  It is also used as a solvent in certain organic chemistry laboratory experiments, but great care should be taken when using it due to its carcinogenic properties.


===Sources of Benzene===
Benzene can be found naturally occurring in crude oil, but today it is also often synthesized from other compounds which can be found in unrefined petroleum.  Another source of benzene is benzoic acid and certain other biological compounds, but the first industrial source of benzene was distillation from coal tar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Introduction'''&lt;BR&gt;
When two conductive materials are separated by an insulating material, then it will behave as a ''Capacitor'' with associated ''Capacitance'' in the units of ''Farads'' (Coulombs/Volt).

Intuitively, Capacitance can be interpreted as &quot;How much charge can I shove into a material if I apply a certain voltage?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;Capacitors are useful because it can store energy momentarily and dissipate the energy later, and with combination of a resistor, it is capable of &quot;delaying&quot; a signal.


== Definition of Capacitance/Capacitor ==
A capacitor is usually made from two sheets of metal separated by an insulating material (such as air or ceramics).
If we apply a voltage between the two sheets, there will be an associated electric field generated, and charges will accumulate on each side of the plates.  We define Capacitance (&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) to be &lt;math&gt;C = \frac{Q}{V}&lt;/math&gt; where Q is the charge that accumulates on the plate when voltage V is applied. This can be concluded intuitively. A capacitor of impossibly high quality will be able to accumulate the maximum amount of charge with the least amount of voltage applied. The unit of capacitance is in Farad, or F for short. 

Another definition for capacitance is area of the plates times the permittivity, divided by the distance of the two plates from the insulating material. In other words, &lt;math&gt;C =\frac{\epsilon A}{D}&lt;/math&gt;. This makes intuitive sense - if we make the plates bigger, we can store more charge, and if we bring the plates closer, the tendency for the charges to attract increase, thereby increasing the electric field generated. Further, because of the nature of a capacitor, as the ability for the dielectric (in between the two plates) to restrict electrical fields (permittivity) goes up, so does the capacitance,

Now, it does not mean that capacitance is a property that appears only on two sheets of metallic sheet.  In fact, ''any'' piece of wire or metal would have small but non-zero associated capacitance with it.  Calculating such capacitances and either exploiting them or taking necessary measures to counteract it is a big deal in engineering electric circuits.

== Capacitors connected in Parallel and Series ==
Let's find the ''equivalent capacitance'' of capacitors in series and in parallel.
===Capacitors in parallel===
[[File:Capacitors in parallel.svg|thumb|none|Fig. 3: Capacitors in parallel]]

Capacitance in two capacitors connected in '''parallel''' ''adds up'', i.e.

 &lt;math&gt;C_{equivalent}=C_{1}+C_{2}&lt;/math&gt;

====Not-so-rigorous proof====
When two capacitors are connected in parallel, then the terminals of capacitor will have the same voltage.  So, if we swap the capacitors in parallel with some equivalent capacitor, it should have the same voltage drop as the either one of the parallel capacitors had. If we count the charges accumulated on the capacitors in parallel, they add up (If one capacitor had ''Q1'' charges accumulated and the other ''Q2'' then the equivalent charges accumulated is ''Q1''+''Q2''). That means that the charges in the equivalent capacitor is the ''sum'' of charges accumulated... which means:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{equivalent}=Q_{1}+Q_{2}...&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_{equivalent} = V_{1} = V_{2} &lt;/math&gt; They are all equal, so let's call it &quot;V&quot;.

::So,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{Q_{equivalent}}{V_{equivalent}}=\frac{Q_{1}+Q_{2}}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{Q_{equivalent}}{V_{equivalent}}=\frac{Q_{1}}{V_{1}}+\frac{Q_{2}}{V_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

::Therefore,

 &lt;math&gt;C_{equivalent}=C_{1}+C_{2}&lt;/math&gt;

...We can generalize this for more than 2 capacitors - just keep adding the effective capacitance of each capacitor. So for five capacitors, the total capacitance would be
:&lt;math&gt;C_{equivalent}=C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+C_{4}+C_{5}&lt;/math&gt;

===Capacitors in series===
[[File:Capacitors in series.svg|thumb|none|Fig. 4: Capacitors in series]]

'''Reciprocal''' of Capacitance ''adds up'' for capacitor connected in '''series.''', i.e. 

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{C_{equivalent}}=\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}}...&lt;/math&gt;

====(Once again) Not-So-Rigorous Proof====
It's the exact opposite of parallel circuit.

First, the voltage drop must add up (for example, if two series capacitors C1 and C2 had voltage drop of 3V and 1V, then the equivalent capacitor had better have voltage drop of 4V).

What about the charge, however? The charges must remain the same in the equivalent capacitor.  To illustrate, suppose two capacitors C1 and C2 are connected in series.  Then if charge Q accumulates on one plate of C1, then charge of -Q would accumulate on the ''other'' plate.  Conservation of charge dictates that the '-Q' ''must come from somewhere''.  That 'somewhere' is the top plate of C2.

So, the top plate of C2 loses '-Q' charge, which is essentially saying that C2 accumulates charge of 'Q'.  Then, the other side of C2 will have a charge '-Q'.  ''So'', if we view the system holistically, the magnitude of charge accumulated on top of C1 is the magnitude of charge on bottom of C2)... 

In short,

:&lt;math&gt;V_{equivalent}=V_{1}+V_{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{equivalent} = Q_{1} = Q_{2} &lt;/math&gt; They are all equal, so let's call it &quot;Q&quot;.

::So,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{equivalent}}{Q_{equivalent}}=\frac{V_{1}+V_{2}}{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{equivalent}}{Q_{equivalent}}=\frac{V_{1}}{Q_{1}}+\frac{V_{2}}{Q_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

::Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{C_{equivalent}}=\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Once again, we can generalize this rule for more than 2 capacitors - just add the reciprocals!

== Capacitor as an energy storage element ==
Capacitor, if we will, can be considered as a device that stores energy in the electric field by applying voltage across it.  If we calculate the energy stored a capacitor (E) of capacitance ''C'' when voltage ''V'' is applied, we find that&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{C V^2}{2} (J)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
(By the way, the magnetic analogue of this is called the inductor, and it possesses surprisingly similar characteristic with surprisingly similar equations.)&lt;BR&gt;
=== Not-so-rigorous Proof ===
The power dissipated for an electric component was defined to be P=v i where v=voltage and i=current.  Current is change of charge over time, or dQ/dt.&lt;BR&gt;
We have defined C=Q/V, so Q=CV.  Since C is constant, i = dQ/dt = C dV/dt.&lt;BR&gt;
Plug this into the equation for power, and we get:&lt;BR&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P=C V \frac{dV}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
Because power is rate at which energy is changing, (P=dW/dt), to find work W, we have to integrate with respect to time.  This gives us:&lt;BR&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int P dt=\int C V \frac{dV}{dt} dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Though mathematicians will be infuriated by what I'm about to say now, it usually works for most cases.  If we consider derivatives like a fraction, then we note that the 'dt's will cancel out, giving us:&lt;BR&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int P dt=\int C V dV&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
::which gives us:&lt;BR&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;W=\frac{C V^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
...which is the work required to store charges in a capacitor with voltage V applied, which ''is'' the energy stored in the capacitor when we apply a voltage V.

== Capacitor with a Resistor (RC Circuits) ==
When we have a circuit with resistor and a capacitor, we have what is known as a RC circuit, which appears all the time in any electric system.  It can be used to delay a signal or filter unwanted signals.

=== Derivation ===
Let's consider a case where a resistor with resistance R is connected in series with a capacitor with capacitance C and a voltage source with voltage &lt;math&gt;-V_{source}&lt;/math&gt;.  Assume that the Capacitor at time=0 has potential difference &lt;math&gt;V_{0}&lt;/math&gt;

If we take Kirchoff's Voltage Law for this circuit, what we will get is the following:

&lt;math&gt; -V_{source} + i R + V_{capacitor} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

We know that the current flowing through the resistor is same as the current flowing through the capacitor.  Because Q=CV for capacitor, the current i is &lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ}{dt}=C V_{capacitor}'&lt;/math&gt;.
Replacing i, we get:

&lt;math&gt; -V_{source} + C V_{capacitor}' R + V_{capacitor} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Add &lt;math&gt;V_{source}&lt;/math&gt; and divide by RC to get:

&lt;math&gt; V_{capacitor}' + \frac{V_{capacitor}}{RC} = \frac{V_{source}}{RC}  &lt;/math&gt;

This is a first order [[w:differential equation|differential equation]].  Solving this, we get:

&lt;math&gt; V_{capacitor} = A e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} + B &lt;/math&gt;

If we then differentiate this we get:

&lt;math&gt;V'_{capacitor} = \frac{-A}{RC}e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}&lt;/math&gt;

And limiting t towards infinity gives:

&lt;math&gt;V'_{capacitor} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V_{capacitor} = 0 + B&lt;/math&gt;

If we plug this into the differential equation mentioned above, we will get:

&lt;math&gt; 0 + \frac{B}{RC} = \frac{V_{source}}{RC}  &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, &lt;math&gt;B=V_{source}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, plug in the equation that we've found for V(capacitor) for time=0 to find:

&lt;math&gt; V_{0} = A + V_{source} &lt;/math&gt;

Which gives us &lt;math&gt; V_{0} - V_{source} = A &lt;/math&gt;.  Combined, we get:

 &lt;math&gt; V_{capacitor} = (V_{0}-V_{source}) e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} + V_{source} &lt;/math&gt;

We will call &lt;math&gt;\tau = RC&lt;/math&gt; which gives us:

 &lt;math&gt; V_{capacitor} = (V_{0}-V_{source}) e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} + V_{source};  \tau=RC &lt;/math&gt;

=== Interpretation of the Equation ===
At t=0, we can see that voltage of the capacitor is equal to its initial condition.  We can also notice that as time approaches infinity, the exponential term gets smaller and smaller, which gives us voltage of the source. The nature of the function does not allow discontinuity, so that means that the function is slowly making a transition from V(0) to V(source).  How fast?  Just take the derivative.

With this interpretation, RC circuit is a ''''circuit that makes a smooth transition from one voltage level to another in an exponential fashion.''''

=== Time Constant ===
&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is what is known as the &quot;Time constant&quot; of the RC circuit.  It is a magnitude that indicates how slowly the circuit voltage is decreasing or increasing.  Larger T implies longer transition between the two states.

=== Practical uses for Time Constant ===
RC circuits are mainly used to create delays and filters.

==== Delay ====
Let's say you were making a switch where the user had to press a button for more than three seconds.  Say this device was connected to some other machinery that considered anything higher than 4.5V as &quot;ON.&quot; Also suppose you had a 5V voltage source.  With just these information, you will be able to construct a RC circuit with appropriate time constant to achieve this effect.  If we assume the capacitor is initially discharged (Vc(0)=0V), then it becomes a problem of mere algebraic manipulation.

Remember that high RC meant smoother transition.  If the voltage source was changing (as in signals that comes in from a microphone), then what would happen?

Well, from waves we know that low sounds have low frequency.  Low frequency means that it takes more time to change from one value to another.  The opposite of that is high frequency, which changes its values rapidly.  If our RC term is very high, then the RC circuit won't be able to &quot;catch up&quot; with the rapid transition of the high frequency.  This means that the circuit will pass the low frequency signals better than the higher frequency ones.

Such use of RC circuit is called a ''Low-pass Filter'' and it has important applications in signal processing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An alternative introduction is under the Journals entry.
Books of Prime Entry are a more efficient variation on double-entry accounting.
In basic double entry, a double entry is made in the general journal, which is posted in the general ledger accounts. Originally, the Venetian method also suggested a preceding diary step, which makes sense as no thinking is required in double entry, so it may have been faster.
In a manual system, books of prime entry act as the speed entry step: instead of trying to remember which accounts to debit and which to credit, and writing the names down for each entry for each transaction in the general journal, the general journal is reserved for infrequent
accrual entries; the more frequent cash entries, and the most frequent accrual entries are divided into specialized journals of cash receipts and cash payments; credit sales journal and credit purchases journal ( credit means 'on credit' here) ; and for medium frequency accrual entries , sales returns and purchase returns journal.
Apart from not having to write account names each time, the column layout in these specialized journal help systemize the double entry rules; most of them can be totalled at the end of each month to provide monthly entries into control account ledgers, as well as reconciliation with summary monthly totals when a schedule of subsidiary ledger accounts is created. Cash reconciliation also is a monthly task, which is made easier by tracking with numbered transactions such as numbered cheque books where cheque numbers can be entered in the cash payments journal; for tracking cash receipts, it is recommended banking occurs daily so that end of month bank reconciliation is easier. Bank reconciliation involves looking at outstanding items from the last reconciliation then seeing which of these occurred in this period's bank statement; then a search is made for unpresented cheques , and unrecorded receipts, and then payments and receipits that occurred through the bank and not through the business. This makes the cash receipts and cash payments journal essential for reconciliation.

Books of prime entry OR books of original entry are books where transactions are first recorded. These may or may not be part of the double entry system.

The main books of prime entry are:

*'''Sales day book'''

*'''Purchase day book'''

*'''Sales returns day book'''

*'''Purchases returns day book'''

*'''Bank Book'''

*'''Cash Receipts Book'''

*'''Cash Payments Book'''

*'''Petty Cash Receipts Book'''

*'''Petty Cash Payments Book'''

*'''Journal'''

==Sales Day Book==

This is the book of prime entry for credit sales, where all credit sales of the day are listed and totaled.  The total is then used as a single posting entry to the sales ledger and also posted to a sales control account in a single total to tally with the underlying sales ledger. However, individual debits are posted separately in the respective sales ledger (or debtors or receivables ledger accounts).  An excerpt might look like this:

== Books for prime entry are synonymous with manual accounting system of special journals and subsidiary ledgers ==
Another description for books of prime entry, are a manual accounting system of special journals and subsidiary ledgers .

In a basic accounting system, or one that follows the original Venetian method, is to write a English statement of a transaction at time of occurrence in a diary.
Then , a this entry , which has at least a detail of  a date, an amount, a sentence describing what happened , is then transferred to the general journal as an entry
as soon as possible, the entry will be a first step in accounting classification, naming accounts to debit and amounts to debit, and accounts to credit and amounts to credit, where sum of debits equals sum of credits, and the entry is dated. There may be a further description written in brackets under the debits and credits, which
may describe more information , such as quantities sold, and to whom, or quantities bought, and from whom, and receipt numbers ).

The general journal entry is then latter entered in the appropriate general ledger accounts , with a date and possibly a back reference to the journal page, and forward references in the journal entry to the ledger account ID numbers to indicate posting from the general journal to the general ledger of accounts. 

In a special journal / subsidiary ledger system , or books of prime entry system, several constraints are added:

Instead of making an entry for every transaction in the general journal, there are several journals as named above. 

The posting rules are:

* credit sales are entered in the day sales journals. Likewise, sales returns are entered in the day sales returns journals.
* purchases on credit are entered in the day purchases journal. Likewise, purchase returns are entered in the purchase returns journal.
* cash payments i.e. payments by cheque , or by eftpos, or via direct bank transactions such as bank fees and interest paid, are made to the cash payments journal.
* cash receipts i.e. payments by cheque, direct deposits , visa receipts with reference numbers ,are made in the cash receipts journal. 
* &lt;u&gt;At the end of each day&lt;/u&gt;, any entries into credit sales, sales returns,  credit purchases, purchase returns, cash receipts, and cash payments, are posted to the relevant '''subsidiary''' ledger accounts. There will be subsidiary accounts receivables for each regular customer, and subsidiary accounts payable for each regular supplier.
*In general , credit sales are posted as debits to the relevant subsidiary account receivables, and cash receipts from that customer are posted as credits that account. Credit purchases are credits in the subsidiary accounts payables, and cash payments to the same supplier are debits to that same subsidiary accounts payable.
* &lt;u&gt;At the end of each month&lt;/u&gt;, each column of the credit sales journal, credit purchases journal, cash receipts journal, and cash payments journal, as well as the sales returns and purchase returns journal, is totalled at the bottom of each column, and then posted to the relevant '''control''' ledger account. For instance, a more elaborate  ''credit sales journal'' for gst collections ,  will have a ''debit'' column for'' accounts receivables'', whose end of month total is posted to ''accounts receivables '''control''''', as well as a credit column for sales ledger account, which  is not posted daily but totalled for monthly posting, and a credit column for GST collections, which is also posted as a monthly credit to the'' GST collections account'' (liability).  Likewise,''credit purchase journal'' will have a ''debit'' column for purchases , a debit column for GST paid, and a credit column for accounts payable. The credits for accounts payable are posted daily to subsidiary accounts payable(creditors) , and the monthly total of accounts payable as a credit to accounts payable control. The GST paid debit column is posted as a monthly total to GST paid (a contra-liability account). The purchases are totalled monthly , and posted to the purchases account , which in the periodic inventory system , is , at period's end, added to the ''beginning inventory'' in the ''income statement'' to give ''cost of goods available for sale'', and the stocktake determined ''ending inventory'' subtracted to find the ''cost of goods sold'', which can be subtracted from gross revenue, to get gross profit.
 
* the reason for the daily posting to subsidiary ledger accounts , and the monthly posting to the control ledger accounts, is that a monthly ''cross check'' can be made by doing a monthly '' schedule of accounts receivables'',  and a ''schedule of accounts payable'' : the sum of the ending balances of one type of subsidiary ledger accounts should equal the balance of the control account after the monthly control posting e.g. subsidiary accounts receivable balance sum equals accounts receivable control balance.    
* the cash receipts journal and the cash payments journal have the expected main case of debit and credit columns , but have additional columns for special cases:  
*# '''cash receipts journal''' has a ''debit'' column for ''cash in bank'', and a ''credit'' column for ''accounts receivable'' ( because of cash payments from customers honoring credit terms ) . However , there will be other debit and credit columns for other uses of cash receipts :- 
*#* ''cash sales'' will need a ''credit'' column for ''sales'', and a ''credit'' column for ''gst collections''. 
*#* ''Discounts allowed for credit sales early repayment'' will need a ''debit'' column for ''discount allowed (financial) expense account'', and a ''debit'' column for ''gst collections'' , in order to reverse previously accrued gst collection equal to 10% of the discount allowed.
*#* A sundry ''credit'' column may be needed for cash receipts such as ''loans'' (a credit to a liability account ), or sale of non-current/ non-inventory assets.
*# '''cash payment journal''', for the main function of paying suppliers/creditors,  has a ''debit'' column for ''accounts payable'', a ''debit'' column for ''gst outlays (refundable asset)'',  and a ''credit'' column for ''cash in bank''. Cash in bank is the source account for cash, and each credit to this asset account reduces its balance.  
*#* For the extended supplier case of ''early payment'' within discounted credit terms,  there will be a'' discount received'' &lt;u&gt;credit&lt;/u&gt; column (other income credit), and a ''credit'' for ''gst outlays'' ( a reduction in refund  for 10% of the discount allowed). 
*#* For the secondary cases of payment of bills, insurance, rent , rates ,  and for cash payments for supplies and equipment,  a ''debit'' column for ''other'' or ''sundry'' cash payments ( debits for assets purchased, or debits for expense accounts). 
* The '''general journal''' is for other entries that are not related to cash or credit, such as period-opening, ''reversing entries'';  period-ending , ''adjusting entries'', ; and ''closing entries'' transferring income and expense account balances to the summary profit and loss temporary account . 
* Closing of temporary income and expense accounts can be to a temporary profit and loss summary account , made initially in the general journal, and then posted to the income accounts, expense accounts, and profit and loss summary account.
* '''petty cash payments''' may operate with the interest system, where there is a fixed interest amount for which a petty cash fund is reimbursed to, and on reimbursement, an entry is made in the ''cash payments journal'', with debits for the previously petty cash expenses recorded in the petty cash voucher book, and a credit to cash in bank for the cheque that is used to reimburse the petty cash. (If there are also receipts of petty cash, then reimbursement might consist of the sum of unaccounted petty cash payments vouchers, less the sum of unaccounted petty cash receipt vouchers, with possibly separate voucher books for payments and receipts).

== Example daily posting of example Sales entires , to subsidiary accounts receivable accounts ==
referring to the example above of credit sales journal entry, at the end of the day, the journal entries are posted to the 
subsidiary receivable account ledgers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are three basic types of harmonica; chromatic, diatonic, and the Asian tremolo.

==Chromatic harmonica==
[[Image:Mundharmonika_gfdl.jpg|thumb|right|Hohner Super-Chromatic harmonica.]]
This type of harmonica can play semi-tones easily. In this book's context, it refers to either the traditional version (using a slide), or the Tombo's slideless versions. Horn harmonica is a different category altogether and, as of now, it will not be covered (since it's only popular in East Asia, and for Orchestra purposes only). In general, materials for chromatic harmonicas is lacking, regardless of location, and as such, it is usually recommended to be played after one has learned the basics of the 10-hole diatonic or Tremolo harmonica. However, if one manages to find good materials, chromatic harmonicas are just as easy to learn.

==Diatonic==
[[Image:Gaitas.jpg|right|thumb|Diatonic harmonicas]]
It has ten holes which offer the player 19 notes (10 holes times a draw and a blow for each hole minus one repeated note) in a three octave range. The standard diatonic harmonica is designed to allow a player to play chords and melody in a single key. Because they are only designed to be played in a single key at a time, diatonic harmonicas are available in all keys.

It is most commonly used in North America and Europe and is a main feature of Blues music.
===Variants===
*'''Valved Diatonic''' - one of the most common ways to let a diatonic play chromatic notes is to place windvalves over hole 1-6 draw reeds and hole 7-10 blow reeds. Therefore, one can bend on all blows and on draws to get the chromatic notes.
*'''Suzuki Overdrive''' - the Overdrive can be seen as an overblow trainer, in which precisely placed holes on both covers allow the player to stop appropriate reeds, allowing the harmonica player to overblow easily.
*'''Hohner XB-40''' - the XB-40 is basically a combination between a chromatic harmonica and a valved diatonic. It has 40 reeds; 20 of them activate when playing normally, and 20 others operate when bending occurs. The chromatic scale can be achieved by bending.

==East Asian Tremolo==
[[Image:Suzuki_Humming.png|right|thumb|A tremolo harmonica.]]
This version of a tremolo harmonica is the standard variant of diatonic harmonicas in East Asia and have more materials. As such, for beginners in East Asia, this type of harmonica is the best.

==Other types==
[[Image:Octave harmonica.jpg|thumb|right| An Octave harmonica]]
Other types of harmonica are the European Tremolo, the Octave harmonica, the very rare Chord harmonica and the Bass harmonica. These are designed for ensemble playing. A beginner would not need to worry about learning these types of harmonicas just yet.

==Playing chromatic note on a harmonica — which is better?==
In general, there are five main ways to get chromatic notes: use a chromatic harmonica, overbend on a diatonic, valve diatonics, use the Hohner XB-40, and using two 24-hole tremolo stacked together. As to which is better, here are the following benefits:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-----
|  || '''Octaves''' ||'''Chords'''|| '''Rapid key switching''' || '''Size''' || '''Learning Difficulty'''|| '''Tonal Precision''' || '''Tonal Quality''' || '''Playing range''' || '''Price'''
|-----
| '''Chromatic''' || All blows and draws ||I, ii, vii || Possible || Big || Easy || Spot on for all notes || Quantitized (tonal vary little) || Most common is three octaves; Four octaves is also quite common || Expensive
|-----
| '''Overbend (diatonic)''' || All blows, some draws ||I,ii,V-7(straight harp)&lt;br&gt;I,IV,v (crossharp)|| Possible|| Small || Very difficult to hit the overblow itself (easy if using Suzuki Overdrive), but once the technique is figured out, it's easy to lean onto the note with no more adjustment || Sound different for overbended notes || Very dynamic || Three octaves is very common; Four octaves is available if using a four octave diatonic (which is rare) ||Cheap (but need proper calibration)
|-----
| '''Valved diatonic''' || All blows, some draws ||I,ii,V-7(straight harp)&lt;br&gt;I,IV,v (crossharp)|| Possible || Small || Slightly difficult || Sound &quot;bluesy&quot; for bended notes || Quite dynamic || Three octaves is more common; Four octaves is available if one valved his/her own four octave hamonica (which is rare) ||Cheap if valve it yourself; expensive if buying Suzuki MS-350v
|-----
| '''Hohner XB-40''' || All blows, some draws ||I,ii,V-7(straight harp)&lt;br&gt;I,IV,v (crossharp)|| Possible || Sort of Small || Difficult (Way too easy to bend notes; need precise control in order to get the proper note) || Spot-on for some notes, &quot;bluesy&quot; for others || Most sounds are dyanmic; quantitize for some || Three octaves only || Expensive
|-----
| '''Stacked tremolo''' || All blows and draws ||I,ii|| Not available || Big || Easy || Spot-on || Quantitize || Three octaves only || Relatively cheap
|}

As a beginner, one does not need to worry about playing chromatic notes just yet. However, if you're seeking more in-depth information on which type of harmonica is the best for performing them, see below.

Due to the table, if one wants an instrument that is capable of thickening the sound and playing many tricks and basically &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot;, but incapable of playing chords and performing a &quot;bluesy&quot; wail (a bane of classical music), then a chromatic harmonica, especially a four-octaves version, is the only way to go. This is because the lowest octave actually allows tranposing to lower octaves; additionally it will make the music sound closer to saxophone in lower registers.

However, if one wants to gain that certain feeling in blues and jazz (growling and wailing, for example), it is a good idea to either get the valved harmonica or learn overbends; however, much learning is needed since those methods depend on proper embouchure. 

Alternatively, the XB-40 is quite easy to bend, but perhaps too easy to bend; the player needs precise control of the bending in order to only bend a semi-tone down instead of a whole tone down. However, it has the tonal quality and precision of both diatonics and chromatics if the player is trained properly; adding to the fact is that it is capable to do some true tones and double reed bends because of the additional reeds. Thus, it can be very suited for hands-free playing at the very least, and is a definite must for people interested in playing music that have a bluesy or jazzy feeling; lastly, since there are many ways to play the same note, it is easier to play legato on XB-40.

Still, it is not without problems; the C-key model, for example, often warrants complaints about its third octave, in which bending (blow and draw) is difficult to perform. Also, it requires precise tonal control (not unlike playing trumpet), as it is easy to miss the required note during bending and accidentally bend down a whole tone. Lastly, it is limited to three octaves, making it restricting if players truly want to play in numerous keys. (Of course, Toots use a standard 3 octaves harmonica to play jazz, so maybe it's not much of a problem.)

Stacked tremolos, as common as it is in East Asia, just do not cut it, since switching the notes in a key is very slow. If one must have the tremolo sound, get Suzuki's chromatic tremolo, which plays just like a conventional 16-hole chromatic.

===Conclusion===
All in all, it depends on how a player approaches playing music. Keep in mind that just because a piano is designed to play classical music doesn't mean a jazz player cannot play piano jazz with the proper feeling. Likewise, a chromatic harp can also play jazz harp, as long as the musician is skilled enough.  On the other hand, classical music has such a rigid requirement that some view XB-40 as inappropriate; to those classical musicians, they will simply call it &quot;classical music play in jazz style&quot;, as they will deem the wailing effect not proper. Others, however, believe that it's fine, so long as the player can hit the notes precisely.

There is a strong incentive among North American players to play chromatic-capable harmonica in positions only, and thus treat it as diatonic. This is inappropriate, as it defeats the purpose of a chromatic-capable harmonica. They should instead train themselves so that they can play with only one or two harmonicas (e.g.: chromatic and XB-40)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Marble 1 ====
[[Image:Blender_3d_Marble.JPG|thumb|Marble bowl]]
There are many different marbles out there, here is an OK one found by me.&lt;br&gt;
Color: Red=0 Green=0 Blue=0&lt;br&gt;
Under the &quot;Map To&quot; tab change the color to white(Red=1 Green=1 Blue=1)&lt;br&gt;
Texture Type: Marble&lt;br&gt;
Marble Settings:&lt;br&gt;
Sharper&lt;br&gt;
Harder&lt;br&gt;
Sin&lt;br&gt;

==== Marble / Alabaster ====
[[Image:Mortarpestle.jpg|thumb|Marble or Alabaster Mortar &amp; Pestle]]
Here is a marble I made to use with a project.  This one uses a perlin marble for COL and for NOR which gives both color and bump.  Crucial to realistic marble of course is the subsurface scattering (SSS).  I also added a bit of reflection which you can find on some marble, but usually not alabaster unless it has been very well polished.

The top row are the texture buttons, but bottom two rows are tabs from the material buttons, pulled apart so you can see all of the values.
[[Image:Marble-material.jpg]]

==== Adding more layers ====
One way to make the marble look more realistic is to add more layers of the marble texture with slightly different characteristics. For instance, create another texture:&lt;br&gt;
''Marble Settings''&lt;br&gt;
- Sharper&lt;br&gt;
- Soft Noise&lt;br&gt;
- Tri&lt;br&gt;
(Same settings otherwise, or add your own slight variation) You can try using a different Noise Basis, such as Original Perlin or Voronoi F3.

Huygens' Principle recognizes that each point of an advancing wave front is in fact the center of a fresh disturbance and the source of a new train of waves; additionally, the advancing wave as a whole may be regarded as the sum of all the secondary waves arising from points in the medium already traversed. This view of wave propagation helps better understand a variety of wave phenomena, such as diffraction.

[[{{BOOKNAME}}/Fermat's Principle|Fermat's Principle]], the principle of least time, can be derived from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Potato Latkes==
As for most traditional foods, there are many recipes for Potato Latkes, which can be eaten at any time, but are especially associated with Chanuka.  I give the way I make them, which is probably the simplest.
==Ingedients==
*Potatoes, preferably thin skinned.
*Onions, about 1/3 as much, by bulk, as potatoes.
*Salt to taste
*Flour for thickening
*Oil for frying

==Instructions==
#Finely grate the potatoes and onions, you will get a very watery batter. You can use a food processor.
#Add salt to taste.
#Thicken with flour, so that the batter holds together when frying.
#Heat oil in frying pan.
#Using a large cooking spoon, drop spoonfulls of batter into hot oil, adding more flour to the batter if necessary. The latkes should be about 3 or 4 inches long by 1-1/2 to 2 inches wide.
#Fry on each side until latke is thoroughly brown.

==Serving==
Serve hot, with applesauce or sour cream, to taste.</text>

I speaks Chinese, English, French fluently. Chinese is my mother tongue, and French is the language I used in University.

I live in France, in the city of Paris.

I am here to study Arabic :

Here is my program : 

[[Vocabulary Exercise]] : There are many people who speak Arabic in Paris. I have the chance to have a few colleagues from Arabic countries. Imouna is now exchanging with me : i teach her Chinese and She teaches me Arabic. I am leaning every day a few Arabic words, i jut not them here and try to master them.

Before meeting Imouna, I studied with Leïla and Noura. They are also very kind. That's one of the reasons why I love so much Arabic language. But most importantly, I love calligraphy and Arabic culture in attracting me, I want to read it in it's own language. 

I am aware that all this will take a lot of time.

and I am contributing to :

First of – let’s create a Public Property in our HelloWorld usercontrol and call it
“HelloWorld” too. If not posted back – we’ll set the text inside a TextBox to the
contents of the Public Property – here’s a simple way of doing it in Visual Basic.NET
– you can use any .NET supported language you want (like c# og Delphi.NET):

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Summary ==
Next we’ll need to create a macro element, so go
back to umbraco and edit the “HelloWorld”
macro. The checkbox (with missing label) is
whether the element should be showed to the
user when the macro is inserted, so check it. The
Alias of the element should be exactly the same
as the name of the Public Property – and watch
out, it’s case sensitive. If you click the “browse
properties” button, you can choose which public
properties you’d like and umbraco will create
them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Summary ==
The name of the element is what the user
will see inside umbraco when the macro is
inserted, so type something meaningful like
“Message on postback”. Next decide what type of element you’re creating, when
used together with .NET controls its only about the UI that the user will see
(different from using XSLT macros where the type can influence the XML that the
macro will use). Choose “Text” as we’ll let the user type a message. Click add.

To insert our macro with the .NET control, you’ll need
to go to the Template section inside “Settings” or insert it
directly inside the editor. In this sample will insert it into
the template.
Open up a template – like “Textpage” if you’re using the
sample site. Make a new line before the
“&lt;?UMBRACO_GETITEM/&gt;” tag an hit the insert
macro button ( ) at the toolbar. Choose the
“HelloWorld” macro and you should see this:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Access Umbraco Data with .NET controls ==

This is based on an original article at http://www.umbraco.org/frontpage/documentation/implementingnetcontrols/accessingumbracodata.aspx

=== Getting Started ===

You can access all umbraco content by creating a reference to the umbraco.dll. Use the node factory located at umbraco.presentation.nodeFactory to mainpulate the XML used to store all of Umbracos data.

First include:
&lt;pre&gt;
using umbraco.presentation.nodeFactory;
&lt;/pre&gt;

To get the current node for the page the control is on use the Node.GetCurrent() method:

&lt;pre&gt;
Node curNode = Node.GetCurrent();
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using your newly created node object, you can use work on the current node directly, or use it as a starting point to traverse the entire tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Umbraco XML Format ==

All published content in umbraco are stored in an Xml Document which has the following format: First the Node (which often is a page) is represented by a ”Node” element. This node element has a number of attributes with basic information about the structure, type, name and create/update dates. The data on the page – the generic properties defined in the document type – is then represented as “Data” elements which is children of the “Node” element. The node can also have other nodes as children, and representing the structure of the site.

Confused – don't be; lets have a look:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;node 
	id=&quot;1037&quot; 
	version=&quot;1E7BF0C1-51DA-4740-BCCE-6096A8C3ECD5&quot;

      <comment>/* Gain and Stability */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Control Systems/Page|Realizations|Block Diagrams}}
{{Control Systems/Stub}}
== What is Gain? ==

'''Gain''' is a proportional value that shows the relationship between the magnitude of the input to the magnitude of the output signal at steady state. Many systems contain a method by which the gain can be altered, providing more or less &quot;power&quot; to the system. However, increasing gain or decreasing gain beyond a particular safety zone can cause the system to become unstable.

Consider the given second-order system:
:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = \frac{1}{s^2 + 2s + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

We can include an arbitrary gain term, K in this system that will represent an amplification, or a power increase:

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = K\frac{1}{s^2 + 2s + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

In a state-space system, the gain term ''k'' can be inserted as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = Ax(t) + kBu(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = Cx(t) + kDu(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The gain term can also be inserted into other places in the system, and in those cases the equations will be slightly different.

[[Image:Gain Block.svg|400px|center]]

=== Example: Gain ===

{{TextBox|1=Here are some good examples of arbitrary gain values being used in physical systems:
;Volume Knob:On your stereo there is a volume knob that controls the gain of your amplifier circuit. Higher levels of volume (turning the volume &quot;up&quot;) corresponds to higher amplification of the sound signal.
;Gas Pedal:The gas pedal in your car is an example of gain. Pressing harder on the gas pedal causes the engine to receive more gas, and causes the engine to output higher RPMs.
;Brightness Buttons:Most computer monitors come with brightness buttons that control how bright the screen image is. More brightness causes more power to be outputed to the screen.}}

== Responses to Gain ==

As the gain to a system increases, generally the rise-time decreases, the percent overshoot increases, and the settling time increases. However, these relationships are not always the same. A '''critically damped system''', for example, may decrease in rise time while not experiencing any effects of percent overshoot or settling time.

== Gain and Stability ==

If the gain increases to a high enough extent, some systems can become unstable. We will examine this effect in the chapter on '''Root Locus'''. But it will decrease the steady state error.

=== Conditional Stability ===

Systems that are stable for some gain values, and unstable for other values are called '''conditionally stable''' systems. The stability is conditional upon the value of the gain, and oftentimes the threshold where the system becomes unstable is important to find.

      <comment>/* Extend XSL using Javascript, VB or C# */[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], , Schreibweise:mailling → mailing, knowlegde → knowledge using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Extend XSL using Javascript, VB or C# ==

Originally from http://www.umbraco.org/frontpage/documentation/articles/sampleofthemonth.aspx

When developing using xsl, the language sometimes falls short or its difficult and time consuming to accomplish what is easily done in other programming languages.

Answering a question in the umbraco mailing list, revealed that it wasn't common knowledge that you could extend xsl with inline code of your favorite programming language, but it is in fact very easy to do so.

An example using inline server interpreted Javascript.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
	&lt;xsl:stylesheet 
		version=&quot;1.0&quot;    
		xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; 
   		xmlns:msxml=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt&quot;    
		xmlns:msxsl=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt&quot;    
		xmlns:math=&quot;http://exslt.org/math&quot;    
		xmlns:umbraco.library=&quot;urn:umbraco.library&quot;    
		exclude-result-prefixes=&quot;msxml math umbraco.library&quot;&gt; 
		
		&lt;xsl:output method=&quot;html&quot;/&gt; 
			&lt;xsl:param 
				name=&quot;currentPage&quot;/&gt; 
				
				&lt;msxsl:script 
					language=&quot;JavaScript&quot; 
					implements-prefix=&quot;math&quot;&gt; 
						&lt;![CDATA[ 
						function random(){ 
							return Math.random();
						} 
						]]&gt; 
				&lt;/msxsl:script&gt; 
				&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
					&lt;xsl:variable 
						name=&quot;nodeset&quot; 
						select=&quot;$currentPage/node&quot;/&gt; 
						
						&lt;xsl:value-of 
							select=&quot;$nodeset[floor(math:random() * (last() -1)) + 1]&quot;/&gt; 
				&lt;/xsl:template&gt; 
	&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

This above example shows how to get a random node from a nodeset, using a wrapper to the &quot;Math.random()&quot; function from Javascript, in order to generate a random seed.

The javascript is executed serverside - in fact any defined function is compiled to MSIL (wrapped in a class definition), and thus should have little effect on the general performance - other scenarios could result in performance overheads, but - in the soon to be released Umbraco v. 2.1 - it possible to cache the output of your macroes and therefore it should be possible to maintain high performance and at the same time flexibility in the development.

You can use different programming languages, a complete list and further information can be found at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconXSLTStylesheetScriptingUsingMsxslscript.asp

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hmm, my very own wiki page, huh? If you really feel like it you can go ahead and write all you want here, you can even write something nasty if you want, as long as you don't delete anything I wrote. I won't promise that nasty remarks will stay around, but you can write them anyway :)

== About me ==

===Jacob Clark (thats me!)===

First off, Jacob Clark is mearly a pen name. Not that I feel the need to be secretive or anything, but it is pretty cool to have a pen name. I was born and raised in Minot, ND and I am currently enrolled at North Dakota State University (NDSU) in Fargo, ND (yes, the place the movie 'Fargo' is named after). My major is currently Architecture with a minor in Interior design, however I will probably change to a major in Interior design and a minor in Photography. In my free time I love photography and both visual and performing arts, However durring the cold months (which is most of them for ND) I play plenty of video games. During the summer I work as a lifegaurd and I love to spend my time by the pool or at the lake.

----
I know you have been adding some content on Wikibooks for a little while, but I want to thank you for coming here and participating, and coming back to add more content.

One minor concern I have is over the new Wikibook names [[Fast seduction]].  I found similar content listed here:  http://www.seductionreport.com/bodylanguage.htm

The concern I have is that this is potentially a copyright violation.  While we try to assume good faith, and assume that you have read the warning at the bottom of the edit window that you have not submitted copyrighted works without permission, sad experience in the past suggests that some individuals don't know or understand this concept.  If possible, please add a note somewhere on [[Talk:Fast seduction]] that you are indeed the author and that you have granted permission for this to be added to Wikibooks.  I ask this for all substantial text content additions, just to be safe and not even remotely violate copyright, so we can protect authors who may not even know about Wikibooks.  If there is on-line content hosted elsewhere, that usually is a warning that it may be a copyright violation.

I also have some conern that this page largely duplicates the content here:  [[Guide to Social Activity/Body Language]]

Just to let me and others know what you intend to do here, I'm curious what you intend to do with this new Wikibook that is going to be different from the [[Guide to Social Activity]].  I don't see anything specifically wrong with the content, and even the writing style is just fine for the most part (I havn't run it through a spell checker or a grammar checker, for instance).  It just seems like a waste and duplication of effort when very similar content is found elsewhere, but I would like to give you the benefit of the doubt and see what you might want to do that would make this different.  If this is a disagreement over editorial philosophies with another Wikibooks user, I can understand that as well.

Have fun here, and I hope to be seeing more of what you have written in the future!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:39, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

Most of the material here is from my own website: seductionreport.com. I am bringing new trafic from my own website. Soon more visitors will contribute their own ideas.

If you have time, please do run in through a spell checker.--[[User:Seductionreport.com|Seductionreport.com]] 04:50, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

== improper transwikis ==

You seem to be copying a lot of wikipedia articles and putting them here, which is no problem, but you need to log these on the transwiki log, and you need to provide links back to the wikipedia page for the contribution history (this is required by the GFDL, wich is the copyright covering both wikipedia and wikibooks.

An alternative that will (hopefully) soon be available is the import function, which brings the pages over with the contribution history in one fell swoop (only admins can do it, but there will be a request page). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:54, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Wikipedia is not in the public domain ==

I noticed that you recently moved some contents to Wikibooks from [[Wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted/Game_modes&amp;diff=425696&amp;oldid=415284] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted&amp;diff=48124923&amp;oldid=48086406].

Wikipedia is not in the public domain. The ''only'' way that Wikibooks can use content from Wikipedia is through the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], which in section 4 requires &amp;ndash; I will skip over the details &amp;ndash; '''attribution ([[Comixpedia:Template:Credit|credit]]) to Wikipedia'''. Regardless of what the FDL says, I think that it is useful to know when a Wikibook has Wikipedian authors, in addition to Wikibookian authors. Thus I will be adding such a credit to the [[Need for Speed: Most Wanted]] page.

There is also an arrangement ([[m:Transwiki]]) to move content and leave the attribution on the talk page &amp;ndash; when someone submits a page to the wrong project before someone moves the page. Further, the authors (copyright holders) are free to move their own content around. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:04, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Say, what does it mean to &quot;dewikify&quot; a page? The title of the page is &quot;Modules that need to be Wikified&quot;, not dewikified... so, which is the one we want to do and what is the difference? [[User:Soulaegis|Soulaegis]] 17:33, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

:Perhaps the wording on this page needs to be changed.  The point here is that a highly wikified markup for Wikipedia, when brought to Wikbooks, is going to need a whole bunch of &quot;red links&quot; removed, and possibly the whole link removed as well.  Wikibooks doesn't need all of those link, and it is not typical for content that originates on Wikibooks.  Wikipedia tends to link almost all proper nouns and even dates, which is not a typical practice on Wikibooks at all.

:Essentially, this is a clash of cultures between Wikipedia and Wikibooks, and this page exists to help deal with that difference of linking style.  How you feel that this should be dealt with is a matter of personal taste.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:07, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Signal Flow Diagrams ==

'''Signal Flow Diagrams''' are another method for visually representing a system. Signal Flow Diagrams are especially useful, because they allow for particular methods of analysis, such as '''Mason's Gain Formula'''.

Signal flow diagrams typically use curved lines to represent wires ''and systems'', instead of using lines at right-angles, and boxes, respectively. Every curved line is considered to have a multiplier value, which can be a constant gain value, or an entire transfer function. Signals travel from one end of a line to the other, and lines that are placed in series with one another have their total multiplier values multiplied together (just like in block diagrams).

Signal flow diagrams help us to identify structures called &quot;loops&quot; in a system, which can be analyzed individually to determine the complete response of the system.

[[Image:sig graph.jpg|center|frame|An example of a signal flow diagram.]]

[[Image:Position servo and signal flow graph.png|right|thumb|800px| Angular position servo and signal flow graph.  θ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = desired angle command, θ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = actual load angle, K&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = position loop gain, V&lt;sub&gt;ωC&lt;/sub&gt; = velocity command, V&lt;sub&gt;ωM&lt;/sub&gt; = motor velocity sense voltage, K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; = velocity loop gain, V&lt;sub&gt;IC&lt;/sub&gt; = current command, V&lt;sub&gt;IM&lt;/sub&gt; = current sense voltage, K&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = current loop gain, V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = power amplifier output voltage, L&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor inductance, V&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = voltage across motor inductance, I&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor current, R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor resistance, R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = current sense resistance, K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor torque constant (Nm/amp) , T = torque, M = momment of inertia  of all rotating components α = angular acceleration, ω = angular velocity, β = mechanical damping, G&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor back EMF constant, G&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = tachometer conversion gain constant,.  There is one forward path (shown in  a different color) and six feedback loops.  The drive shaft assumed to be stiff enough to not treat as a spring.  Constants are shown in black and variables in purple.]]

== Mason's Gain Formula ==

'''Mason's rule''' is a rule for determining the gain of a system. Mason's rule can be used with block diagrams, but it is most commonly (and most easily) used with signal flow diagrams.

=== Forward Paths ===

A '''forward path''' is a path in the signal flow diagram that connects the input to the output without touching any single node or path more than once. A single system can have multiple forward paths.

=== Loops ===

A '''loop''' is a structure in a signal flow diagram that leads back to itself. A loop does not contain the beginning and ending points, and the end of the loop is the same node as the beginning of a loop.

Loops are said to touch if they share a node or a line in common. 

The '''Loop gain''' is the total gain of the loop, as you travel from one point, around the loop, back to the starting point.

=== Delta Values ===

The Delta value of a system, denoted with a Greek &amp;Delta; is computed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = 1 - A + B - C + D - E + F......+ \infty&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*A is the sum of all individual loop gains
*B is the sum of the products of all the pairs of non-touching loops
*C is the sum of the products of all the sets of 3 non-touching loops
*D is the sum of the products of all the sets of 4 non-touching loops
*et cetera.

If the given system has no pairs of loops that do not touch, for instance, B and all additional letters after B will be zero.

=== Mason's Rule ===

{{Wikipedia|Mason's rule}}

If we have computed our delta values (above), we can then use '''Mason's Gain Rule''' to find the complete gain of the system:
{{eqn|Mason's Rule}}
:&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{y_{out}}{y_{in}} = \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{M_k \Delta\ _k}{ \Delta\ }&lt;/math&gt;

Where M is the total gain of the system, represented as the ratio of the output gain (y&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;) to the input gain (y&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;) of the system. M&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is the gain of the k&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; forward path, and &amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is the loop gain of the k&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; loop.

== The Problem ==

Consider a system like a radio. The radio has a &quot;volume&quot; knob, that controls the amount of gain of the system. High volume means more power going to the speakers, low volume means less power to the speakers. As the volume value increases, the poles of the transfer function of the radio change, and they might potentially become unstable. We would like to find out ''if'' the radio becomes unstable, and if so, we would like to find out what values of the volume cause it to become unstable. Our current methods would require us to plug in each new value for the volume (gain, &quot;K&quot;), and solve the open-loop transfer function for the roots. This process can be a long one. Luckily, there is a method called the '''root-locus''' method, that allows us to graph the locations of all the poles of the system for all values of gain, K.

== Root-Locus ==

As we change gain, we notice that the system poles and zeros actually move around in the [[S-plane]]. This fact can make life particularly difficult, when we need to solve higher-order equations repeatedly, for each new gain value. The solution to this problem is a technique known as '''Root-Locus''' graphs. Root-Locus allows you to graph the locations of the poles and zeros ''for every value of gain'', by following several simple rules. As we know that a fan switch also can control the speed of the fan.

Let's say we have a closed-loop transfer function for a particular system:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N(s)}{D(s)} = \frac{KG(s)}{1 + KG(s)H(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where N is the numerator polynomial and D is the denominator polynomial of the transfer functions, respectively. Now, we know that to find the poles of the equation, we must set the denominator to 0, and solve the characteristic equation. In other words, the locations of the poles of a specific equation must satisfy the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = 1 + KG(s)H(s) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

from this same equation, we can manipulate the equation as such:

:&lt;math&gt;1 + KG(s)H(s) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;KG(s)H(s) = -1&lt;/math&gt;

And finally by converting to polar coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\angle KG(s)H(s) = 180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

Now we have 2 equations that govern the locations of the poles of a system for all gain values:

{{eqn|The Magnitude Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;1 + KG(s)H(s) = 0&lt;/math&gt; 
{{eqn|The Angle Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;\angle KG(s)H(s) = 180^\circ&lt;/math&gt; 

=== Digital Systems ===

The same basic method can be used for considering digital systems in the Z-domain:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N(z)}{D(z)} = \frac{KG(z)}{1 + K\overline{GH}(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where N is the numerator polynomial in z, D is the denominator polynomial in z, and &lt;math&gt;\overline{GH}(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the open-loop transfer function of the system, in the Z domain.

The denominator D(z), by the definition of the characteristic equation is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;D(z) = 1 + K\overline{GH}(z) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

We can manipulate this as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;1 + K\overline{GH}(z) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K\overline{GH}(z) = -1&lt;/math&gt;

We can now convert this to polar coordinates, and take the angle of the polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt;\angle K\overline{GH}(z) = 180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

We are now left with two important equations:

{{eqn|The Magnitude Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;1 + K\overline{GH}(z) = 0&lt;/math&gt; 
{{eqn|The Angle Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;\angle K\overline{GH}(z) = 180^\circ&lt;/math&gt; 

If you will compare the two, the Z-domain equations are nearly identical to the S-domain equations, and act exactly the same. For the remainder of the chapter, we will only consider the S-domain equations, with the understanding that digital systems operate in nearly the same manner.

== The Root-Locus Procedure ==

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;In this section, the rules for the S-Plane and the Z-plane are the same, so we won't refer to the differences between them.}}

In the transform domain (see note at right), when the gain is small, the poles start at the poles of the open-loop transfer function. When gain becomes infinity, the poles move to overlap the zeros of the system. This means that on a root-locus graph, all the poles move towards a zero. Only one pole may move towards one zero, and this means that there must be the same number of poles as zeros.

If there are fewer zeros than poles in the transfer function, there are a number of implicit zeros located at infinity, that the poles will approach.

First thing, we need to convert the magnitude equation into a slightly more convenient form:

:&lt;math&gt;KG(s)H(s) + 1 = 0 \to G(s)H(s) = \frac{-1}{K}&lt;/math&gt;

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;We generally use capital letters for functions in the frequency domain, but '''a(s)''' and '''b(s)''' are unimportant enough to be lower-case.}}

Now, we can assume that G(s)H(s) is a fraction of some sort, with a numerator and a denominator that are both polynomials. We can express this equation using arbitrary functions a(s) and b(s), as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a(s)}{b(s)} = \frac{-1}{K}&lt;/math&gt;

We will refer to these functions a(s) and b(s) later in the procedure.

We can start drawing the root-locus by first placing the roots of b(s) on the graph with an 'X'. Next, we place the roots of a(s) on the graph, and mark them with an 'O'. 

{{info|poles are marked on the graph with an 'X' and zeros are marked with an 'O' by common convention. These letters have no particular meaning}}

Next, we examine the real-axis. starting from the right-hand side of the graph and traveling to the left, we draw a root-locus line on the real-axis at every point to the left of an odd number of poles or zeros on the real-axis. This may sound tricky at first, but it becomes easier with practice.

{{info|double poles or double zeros count as two.}}

Now, a root-locus line starts at every pole. Therefore, any place that two poles appear to be connected by a root locus line on the real-axis, the two poles actually move towards each other, and then they &quot;break away&quot;, and move off the axis. The point where the poles break off the axis is called the '''breakaway point'''. From here, the root locus lines travel towards the nearest zero.

It is important to note that the s-plane is symmetrical about the real axis, so whatever is drawn on the top-half of the S-plane, must be drawn in mirror-image on the bottom-half plane.

Once a pole breaks away from the real axis, they can either travel out towards infinity (to meet an implicit zero), or they can travel to meet an explicit zero, or they can re-join the real-axis to meet a zero that is located on the real-axis. If a pole is traveling towards infinity, it always follows an asymptote. The number of asymptotes is equal to the number of implicit zeros at infinity.

== Root Locus Rules ==

Here is the complete set of rules for drawing the root-locus graph. We will use p and z to denote the number of poles and the number of zeros of the open-loop transfer function, respectively. We will use P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and Z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to denote the location of the ''i''th pole and the ''i''th zero, respectively. Likewise, we will use &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to denote the angle from a given point to the ''i''th pole and zero, respectively. All angles are given in radians (&amp;pi; denotes &amp;pi; radians).

There are 11 rules that, if followed correctly, will allow you to create a correct root-locus graph.

{{TextBox|1=
;Rule 1:There is one branch of the root-locus for every root of b(s). 
;Rule 2:The roots of b(s) are the '''poles''' of the open-loop transfer function. Mark the roots of b(s) on the graph with an X.
;Rule 3:The roots of a(s) are the '''zeros''' of the open-loop transfer function. Mark the roots of a(s) on the graph with an O. There should be a number of O's less than or equal to the number of X's. There is a number of zeros p - z located at infinity. These zeros at infinity are called &quot;implicit zeros&quot;. All branches of the root-locus will move from a pole to a zero (some branches, therefore, may travel towards infinity).
;Rule 4:A point on the real axis is a part of the root-locus if it is to the left of an odd number of poles and zeros.
;Rule 5:The gain at any point on the root locus can be determined by the inverse of the absolute value of the magnitude equation.
::&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{b(s)}{a(s)}\right| = |K|&lt;/math&gt;
;Rule 6:The root-locus diagram is symmetric about the real-axis. All complex roots are conjugates.
;Rule 7:Two roots that meet on the real-axis will break away from the axis at certain break-away points. If we set s &amp;rarr; &amp;sigma; (no imaginary part), we can use the following equation:
::&lt;math&gt;K = -\frac{b(\sigma)}{a(\sigma)}&lt;/math&gt;
:And differentiate to find the local maximum:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dK}{d\sigma} = \frac{d}{d\sigma}\frac{b(\sigma)}{a(\sigma)}&lt;/math&gt;
;Rule 8:The breakaway lines of the root locus are separated by angles of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where &amp;alpha; is the number of poles intersecting at the breakaway point.
;Rule 9:The breakaway root-loci follow asymptotes that intersect the real axis at angles &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt; given by:
::&lt;math&gt;\phi_\omega = \frac{\pi + 2N\pi}{p - z},\quad N = 0, 1, ... p-z-1&lt;/math&gt;
:The origin of these asymptotes, OA, is given as the sum of the pole locations, minus the sum of the zero locations, divided by the difference between the number of poles and zeros:
::&lt;math&gt;OA = \frac{\sum_pP_i - \sum_zZ_i}{p - z}&lt;/math&gt;
:The OA point should lie on the real axis.
;Rule 10:The branches of the root locus cross the imaginary axis at points where the '''angle equation''' value is &amp;pi; (i.e., 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;).
;Rule 11:The angles that the root locus branch makes with a complex-conjugate pole or zero is determined by analyzing the '''angle equation''' at a point infinitessimally close to the pole or zero. The angle of departure, &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the following equation:
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_p\psi_i + \sum_z\rho_i + \phi_d = \pi&lt;/math&gt;
:The angle of arrival, &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, is given by:
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_z\rho_i + \sum_p\psi_i + \phi_a = \pi&lt;/math&gt;
}}

We will explain these rules in the rest of the chapter.

== Root Locus Equations ==

Here are the two major equations:

{{eqn|Root Locus Equations}}
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! S-Domain Equations !! Z-Domain Equations
|-
|&lt;math&gt;1 + KG(s)H(s) = 0&lt;/math&gt; 
|&lt;math&gt;1 + K\overline{GH}(z) = 0&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\angle KG(s)H(s) = 180^o&lt;/math&gt; 
|&lt;math&gt;\angle K\overline{GH}(z) = 180^o&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Note that the sum of the angles of all the poles and zeros must equal to 180.

=== Number of Asymptotes ===

If the number of explicit zeros of the system is denoted by Z (uppercase z), and the number of poles of the system is given by P, then the number of asymptotes (N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) is given by:

{{eqn|Number of Asymptotes}}
:&lt;math&gt;N_a = P - Z&lt;/math&gt;

The angles of the asymptotes are given by:

{{eqn|Angle of Asymptotes}}
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_k = (2k + 1)\frac{\pi}{P - Z}&lt;/math&gt;

for values of &lt;math&gt;k = [0, 1, ... N_a - 1]&lt;/math&gt;. 

{{info|The angles for the asymptotes are measured from the positive real-axis}}

=== Asymptote Intersection Point ===

The asymptotes intersect the real axis at the point:

{{eqn|Origin of Asymptotes}}
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_0 = \frac{\sum_P - \sum_Z}{P - Z}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\sum_P&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all the locations of the poles, and &lt;math&gt;\sum_Z&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all the locations of the explicit zeros.

=== Breakaway Points ===

The breakaway points are located at the roots of the following equation:

{{eqn|Breakaway Point Locations}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dG(s)H(s)}{ds} = 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\overline{GH}(z)}{dz} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Once you solve for z, the real roots give you the breakaway/reentry points. Complex roots correspond to a lack of breakaway/reentry.

The breakaway point equation can be difficult to solve, so many times the actual location is approximated.

== Root Locus and Stability ==

The root locus procedure should produce a graph of where the poles of the system are for all values of gain K. When any or all of the roots of D are in the unstable region, the system is unstable. When any of the roots are in the marginally stable region, the system is marginally stable (oscillatory). When all of the roots of D are in the stable region, then the system is stable. 

It is important to note that a system that is stable for gain K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may become unstable for a different gain K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Some systems may have poles that cross over from stable to unstable multiple times, giving multiple gain values for which the system is unstable.

Here is a quick refresher:

:{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Region 
! colspan=2 | S-Domain 
! colspan=2 | Z-Domain
|-
! Stable Region 
| Left-Hand S Plane || &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;|| Inside the Unit Circle || &lt;math&gt;|z| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Marginally Stable Region 
| The vertical axis || &lt;math&gt; \sigma = 0&lt;/math&gt; || The Unit Circle || &lt;math&gt;|z| = 1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Unstable Region 
| Right-Hand S Plane || &lt;math&gt; \sigma &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; || Outside the Unit Circle, || &lt;math&gt;|z| &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Examples ==

=== Example 1: First-Order System ===

{{TextBox|1=Find the root-locus of the open-loop system:

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = \frac{1}{1 + 2s}&lt;/math&gt;

If we look at the characteristic equation, we can quickly solve for the single pole of the system:

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = 1 + 2s = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s = -\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

We plot that point on our root-locus graph, and everything on the real axis to the left of that single point is on the root locus (from the rules, above). Therefore, the root locus of our system looks like this:

[[Image:Rlocus 1pole.JPG|center]]

From this image, we can see that for ''all values of gain'' this system is stable. 
}}

=== Example 2: Third Order System ===

{{TextBox|1=We are given a system with three real poles, shown by the transfer function:

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = \frac{1}{(s+1)(s+2)(s+3)}&lt;/math&gt;

Is this system stable?

To answer this question, we can plot the root-locus. First, we draw the poles on the graph at locations -1, -2, and -3. The real-axis between the first and second poles is on the root-locus, as well as the real axis to the left of the third pole. We know also that there is going to be breakaway from the real axis at some point. The origin of asymptotes is located at:

:&lt;math&gt;OA = \frac{-1 + -2 + -3}{3} = -2&lt;/math&gt;,

and the angle of the asymptotes is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \frac{180(2k+1)}{3} \; \mathrm{for} \; k = 0,1,2&lt;/math&gt;

We know that the breakaway occurs between the first and second poles, so we will estimate the exact breakaway point. Drawing the root-locus gives us the graph below.

[[Image:Rlocus 3poles.JPG|center]]

We can see that for low values of gain the system is stable, but for higher values of gain, the system becomes unstable. }}

=== Example: Complex-Conjugate Zeros ===

{{TextBox|1=
Find the root-locus graph for the following system transfer function:

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = K\frac{s^2 + 4.5s + 5.625}{s(s+1)(s+2)}&lt;/math&gt;

If we look at the denominator, we have poles at the origin, -1, and -2. Following '''Rule 4''', we know that the real-axis between the first two poles, and the real axis after the third pole are all on the root-locus. We also know that there is going to be a breakaway point between the first two poles, so that they can approach the complex conjugate zeros. If we use the quadratic equation on the numerator, we can find that the zeros are located at:

:&lt;math&gt;s = (-2.25 + j0.75), (-2.25 - j0.75)&lt;/math&gt;

If we draw our graph, we get the following:

[[Image:RLocus 3poles 2zeros.JPG|center]]

We can see from this graph that the system is stable for all values of K.}}

=== Example: Root-Locus Using MATLAB/Octave ===

{{TextBox|1=Use MATLAB, Octave, or another piece of mathematical simulation software to produce the root-locus graph for the following system:

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = K\frac{s + 2}{(s + 3)(s^2 + 2s + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

First, we must multiply through in the denominator:

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = s^3 + 5s^2 + 8s + 6&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can generate the coefficient vectors from the numerator and denominator:
&lt;pre&gt;
 num = [0 0 1 2];
 den = [1 5 8 6];
&lt;/pre&gt;
Next, we can feed these vectors into the '''rlocus''' command:
&lt;pre&gt;
 rlocus(num, den);
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''Note''':In Octave, we need to create a system structure first, by typing:
&lt;pre&gt;
 sys = tf(num, den);

--[[User:Billymac00|Billymac00]] 18:04, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

:I almost want to say that HMI is outside the scope of this book. There aren't really any good theoretical ways to model the HMI of a particular system. that subject would likely be better covered in a book dedicated to user-interfaces in general, and not have to stretch this book to try and include that kind of information. This book is primarily theoretical, and worries about actual implementation of systems (and the interaction between the systems and the human control engineers) is outside the scope of this book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:22, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

=== Elastic Collisions ===

In an ideal elastic collision, total [[Physics: Calculus-based/Conservation of energy/Kinetic energy|kinetic energy]] is conserved.
An example of ideal elastic collision is the collisions between atoms in a gas.
During the collision, kinetic energy is transferred from one object to the other object.

Like all other collisions, total momentum is conserved in an elastic collision:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
m_a\vec{v}_{a1} + m_b\vec{v}_{b1} = m_a\vec{v}_{a2} + m_b\vec{v}_{b2}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In an ideal elastic collision, total kinetic energy is conserved:
(This is what makes them different from [[Inelastic collisions]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
{1 \over 2}m_a v_{a1}^2 + {1 \over 2}m_b v_{b1}^2 = {1 \over 2}m_a v_{a2}^2 + {1 \over 2}m_b v_{b2}^2
\\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;


Let a head-on elastic collision occur between two bowling balls, one of mass 5kg with an initial velocity of 10 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; and the other of mass 4kg which is initially stationary.

What happens when they collide ?

If we assume the collision is perfectly elastic, we can calculate what we expect to happen:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
m_a &amp;=&amp; 5 kg
\\
m_b &amp;=&amp; 4 kg
\\
\vec{v}_{a1} &amp;=&amp; + 10 ms^{-1}
\\
\vec{v}_{b1} &amp;=&amp; 0
\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then we plug those values into the above equations:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
m_a\vec{v}_{a1} + m_b\vec{v}_{b1} &amp;=&amp; m_a\vec{v}_{a2} + m_b\vec{v}_{b2}
\\
(5 kg)(10 ms^{-1}) + (4 kg)(0) &amp;=&amp; (5 kg)\vec{v}_{a2} + (4 kg)\vec{v}_{b2}
\\
{1 \over 2}m_a v_{a1}^2 + {1 \over 2}m_b v_{b1}^2 &amp;=&amp; {1 \over 2}m_a v_{a2}^2 + {1 \over 2}m_b v_{b2}^2
\\
(5 kg)(10 ms^{-1})^2 + (4 kg)(0)^2 &amp;=&amp; (5 kg) v_{a2}^2 + (4 kg) v_{b2}^2
\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then we solve for the final velocities:

...

Thus it can be seen that a large object colliding with a small object under the rules of elastic collisions will cause the smaller object to move with a velocity greater than the larger object.

[[Physics with Calculus]] : [[Conservation_of_Momentum]]

=== Conservation of Momentum ===

Momentum is a property of an object that we are able to measure by a very simple means.  Momentum is an extension of Newton's First Law in that a body with momentum will conserve that momentum, be it zero or non-zero.  The formula that we use to describe the momentum of an object is the product of the object's mass and its velocity.  Because velocity is a vector (having both magnitude and direction) and mass is a scalar quantity, by definition, a scalar multiplied by a vector is a vector.  As a result, the momentum vector will have the same direction as the velocity vector.

Ergo,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

Conservation of Momentum, therefore, is by definition a zero change in the momentum of a system of objects.  The initial momentum will then be equal to the final momentum.

== single object ==

When a single object does not interact with other objects, we observe that its momentum always stays the same.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\Delta \mathbf{p} &amp; = &amp; \mathbf{p}_{final} - \mathbf{p}_{initial}
\\
         0        &amp; = &amp; \mathbf{p}_{f} - \mathbf{p}_{i}
\\
   \mathbf{p}_f   &amp; = &amp; \mathbf{p}_i\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Because the object does not change mass, it does not change velocity and hence momentum is conserved.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
m_1\mathbf{v}_1 = m_1\mathbf{v}_2
\\
\mathbf{v}_1 = \mathbf{v}_2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== two objects ==

When two objects (call them ''a'' and ''b'') interact with each other, we observe that the total momentum of the entire systems always stays the same.

This is true whether the interactions are [[Elastic Collisions]] or [[Inelastic Collisions]].

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
m_a\mathbf{v}_{a1} + m_b\mathbf{v}_{b1} = m_a\mathbf{v}_{a2} + m_b\mathbf{v}_{b2}
\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== multiple objects ==

No matter how many objects interact with each other, we observe that the total momentum of the entire system always stays the same.

== Possible sections ==

I am removing the optimal and robust control bullets from the main TOC, because we dont have material for those chapters yet. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:20, 18 April 2007 (UTC)

== Math displayed inconsistently ==

The math formulas in this book is displayed inconsistently. Sometimes in Latex-way, sometimes just as ordinary text. Maybe it should be always in Latex-way, when placed on separate rows?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Below are recommendations from various candidates. Remember that your own educational background is crucial to your revision tactics so this is just what worked for them, not an official list...

----

Here are the main books I used to revise the GAMSAT with - my background was Psychology so my knowledge of most of these areas was quite sketchy at best so I was pretty much starting from scratch on the science front.

* '''A self-teaching guide Chemistry (Houk and Post)''' - poor on quite a few parts but a good basic text to establish the base
* '''Chemistry in Context (Hill and Holman)''' - fills in the spaces left by the previous book.
* '''A self-teaching guide Physics (Kuhn)''' - similar to first book but seemed to cover all the physics I needed. Maybe a little too much of a spoon fed approach so if your physics are above minimal, you may want to opt for a more rapidly progressing text book.

----

I am a journalism graduate with an A Level In biology, so was starting from scratch with Chem and Physics. I passed Gamsat science using these books:

* '''Chemistry''': For basic GCSE refresher and a bit more, I started with '''Barron's Review Course Series 'Let's Review: Chemistry The Physical Setting.''' It's an American book aimed at 16-18 year olds and really easy to grasp.

Then I moved to Ramsden's '''A Level Chemistry''' book but found it to be insufferably dry and too full of facts and not enough explanation of concepts behind the facts, so I switched to '''Chemistry: The Central Science''', by Brown, LeMay and Bursten - another US book aimed at 1st year college students - excellent explanation of concepts - particularly in thermochemistry, kinetics, equilibria, acids and bases, which are all key. I also used Ramsden's '''Calculations for A Level Chemistry''', but not a lot.

Because there is so much organic chemistry, I bought (I kid you not) '''Organic Chemistry for Dummies''' and it is brilliant! Does exactly what it says on the tin.

* '''Biology''': I covered all the animal biology from '''Biology 2nd Edition''' by Mike Boyle and Kathryn Senior from the Collins Advanced Science Series. Nice and easy book to understand tho it may not quite be detailed enough for some of the more complex questions at Gamsat.

* '''Physics''': I didn't overdo it, since it is only 20% of the science section. So I used '''Barron's Review Course Series Let's Review: Physics.''' Again, an American book but really gets to grips with forces, vectors and basic electricity and light geometrics that you'll be asked about.

----

Hi there folks, coming from a non-science background. I can see non-classic GAMSAT texts listed above. The ones I went with are only branded for the GAMSAT:
* '''Mr Shum's Classroom''' (e.g. http://mrshum.com/pre-med/organic-chemistry/hydrocarbons/), which was great for succinct and easy-to-understand definitions, particularly if you haven't got a background in science (like me). Downside was that it lacked a question bank, and didn't cover the verbal section
* '''Des O'Neill's''' Gamsatprep Red series, which is considered &quot;the best&quot; question bak around for GAMSAT - both humanities and science. Can be complex to read though, display lacks paragraphs etc...
* Dr. Ferdinanz's '''Gold Standard''' textbook and DVD's, which has a great question bank, but problematically is its American orientation (for the MCAT). Like Des O'Neill's, I wouldn't say its the best way to learn content (it really, like Des O'Neill's book cover states, is for &quot;revision&quot; - not for new learning coming from a non-science background
* '''ExamKrackers''', which like Mr. Shum's Classroom, has nice illustrations. I used this alongside Mr Shum's quite a bit. A great combo. Can't stress how good these are!
* There are also a few others around like Medired and Guru Method, but perhaps someone else can elaborate on these, who has a better background

== Bode Plots ==

A Bode Plot is a useful tool that shows the gain and phase response of a given LTI system for different frequencies. Bode Plots are generally used with the Fourier Transform of a given system.

[[Image:Bode-pt2.png|center|framed|An example of a Bode magnitude and phase plot set. The Magnitude plot is typically on the top, and the Phase plot is typically on the bottom of the set.]]

The frequency of the bode plots are plotted against a logarithmic frequency axis. Every tickmark on the frequency axis represents a power of 10 times the previous value. For instance, on a standard Bode plot, the values of the markers go from (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, ...) Because each tickmark is a power of 10, they are referred to as a '''decade'''. Notice that the &quot;length&quot; of a decade decreases as you move to the right on the graph.

The bode Magnitude plot measures the system Input/Output ratio in special units called '''decibels'''. The Bode phase plot measures the phase shift in degrees (typically, but radians are also used).

=== Decibels ===

A '''Decibel''' is a ratio between two numbers on a logarithmic scale. A Decibel ''is not itself a number, and cannot be treated as such in normal calculations''. To express a ratio between two numbers (A and B) as a decibel we apply the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;dB = 20 \log\left({A \over B}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where dB is the decibel result.

Or, if we just want to take the decibels of a single number C, we could just as easily write:

:&lt;math&gt; dB = 20 \log(C)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Frequency Response Notations ===

If we have a system transfer function T(s), we can separate it into a numerator polynomial N(s) and a denominator polynomial D(s). We can write this as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

To get the magnitude gain plot, we must first transition the transfer function into the frequency response by using the change of variables:

:&lt;math&gt;s = j\omega&lt;/math&gt;

From here, we can say that our frequency response is a composite of two parts, a real part R and an imaginary part X:

:&lt;math&gt;T(j\omega) = R(\omega) + jX(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

We will use these forms below.

=== Straight-Line Approximations ===

The Bode magnitude and phase plots can be quickly and easily approximated by using a series of straight lines. These approximate graphs can be generated by following a few short, simple rules (listed below). Once the straight-line graph is determined, the actual Bode plot is a smooth curve that follows the straight lines, and travels through the '''breakpoints'''.

=== Break Points ===

If the frequency response is in pole-zero form:

:&lt;math&gt;T(j\omega) = \frac{\prod_n|j\omega + z_n|}{\prod_m|j\omega + p_m|}&lt;/math&gt;

We say that the values for all z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; are called '''break points''' of the Bode plot. These are the values where the Bode plots experience the largest change in direction.

Break points are sometimes also called &quot;break frequencies&quot;, &quot;cutoff points&quot;, or &quot;corner points&quot;.

== Bode Gain Plots ==

'''Bode Gain Plots''', or '''Bode Magnitude Plots''' display the ratio of the system gain at each input frequency.  

=== Bode Gain Calculations ===

The magnitude of the transfer function T is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;|T(j\omega)| = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}&lt;/math&gt;

However, it is frequently difficult to transition a function that is in &quot;numerator/denominator&quot; form to &quot;real+imaginary&quot; form. Luckily, our decibel calculation comes in handy. Let's say we have a frequency response defined as a fraction with numerator and denominator polynomials defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;T(j\omega) = \frac{\prod_n|j\omega + z_n|}{\prod_m|j\omega + p_m|}&lt;/math&gt;

If we convert both sides to decibels, the logarithms from the decibel calculations convert multiplication of the arguments into additions, and the divisions into subtractions:

:&lt;math&gt;Gain = \sum_n20\log(j\omega + z_n) - \sum_m20\log(j\omega + p_m)&lt;/math&gt;

And calculating out the gain of each term and adding them together will give the gain of the system at that frequency.

=== Bode Gain Approximations ===

The slope of a straight line on a Bode magnitude plot is measured in units of '''dB/Decade''', because the units on the vertical axis are dB, and the units on the horizontal axis are decades.

The value &amp;omega; = 0 is infinitely far to the left of the bode plot (because a logarithmic scale never reaches zero), so finding the value of the gain at &amp;omega; = 0 essentially sets that value to be the gain for the Bode plot from all the way on the left of the graph up till the first break point. The value of the slope of the line at &amp;omega; = 0 is 0dB/Decade.

From each pole break point, the slope of the line decreases by 20dB/Decade. The line is straight until it reaches the next break point. From each zero break point the slope of the line increases by 20dB/Decade. Double, triple, or higher amounts of repeat poles and zeros affect the gain by multiplicative amounts. Here are some examples:

*2 poles: -40dB/Decade
*10 poles: -200dB/Decade
*5 zeros: +100dB/Decade

== Bode Phase Plots ==

'''Bode phase plots''' are plots of the phase shift to an input waveform dependent on the frequency characteristics of the system input. Again, the Laplace transform does not account for the phase shift characteristics of the system, but the Fourier Transform can. The phase of a complex function, in &quot;real+imaginary&quot; form is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\angle T(j\omega) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{X}{R}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Bode Procedure ==

Given a frequency response in pole-zero form:

:&lt;math&gt;T(j\omega) = A\frac{\prod_n|j\omega + z_n|}{\prod_m|j\omega + p_m|}&lt;/math&gt;

Where A is a non-zero constant (can be negative or positive).

Here are the steps involved in sketching the approximate Bode magnitude plots:

{{TextBox|1='''Bode Magnitude Plots'''
;Step 1: Factor the transfer function into pole-zero form.
;Step 2: Find the frequency response from the Transfer function.
;Step 3: Use logarithms to separate the frequency response into a sum of decibel terms
;Step 4: Use &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt; to find the starting magnitude.
;Step 5: The locations of every pole and every zero are called '''break points'''. At a zero breakpoint, the slope of the line increases by 20dB/Decade. At a pole, the slope of the line decreases by 20dB/Decade.
;Step 6: At a zero breakpoint, the value of the actual graph differs from the value of the straight-line graph by 3dB. A zero is +3dB over the straight line, and a pole is -3dB below the straight line.
;Step 7: Sketch the actual bode plot as a smooth-curve that follows the straight lines of the previous point, and travels through the breakpoints.}}

Here are the steps to drawing the Bode phase plots:

{{TextBox|1='''Bode Phase Plots'''
;Step 1: If A is positive, start your graph (with zero slope) at 0 degrees. If A is negative, start your graph with zero slope at 180 degrees (or -180 degrees, they are the same thing).
;Step 2: For every zero, slope the line '''up''' at 45 degrees per decade when &lt;math&gt; \omega = \frac{z_n}{10} &lt;/math&gt; (1 decade before the break frequency). Multiple zeros means the slope is steeper.
;Step 3: For every pole, slope the line '''down''' at 45 degrees per decade when &lt;math&gt; \omega = \frac{p_m}{10} &lt;/math&gt; (1 decade before the break frequency). Multiple poles means the slope is steeper.
;Step 4: Flatten the slope again when the phase has changed by 90 degrees (for a zero) or -90 degrees (for a pole) (or larger values, for multiple poles or multiple zeros.}}

== Examples ==

=== Example: Constant Gain ===

{{TextBox|1=Draw the bode plot of an amplifier system, with a constant gain increase of 6dB.

Because the gain value is constant, and is not dependent on the frequency, we know that the value of the magnitude graph is constant at all places on the graph. There are no break points, so the slope of the graph never changes. We can draw the graph as a straight, horizontal line at 6dB:

[[Image:Bode-p.png|center]]}}

=== Example: Integrator ===

{{TextBox|1=Draw the bode plot of a perfect integrator system given by the transfer function:

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = \frac{2}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

First, we find the frequency response of the system, by a change of variables:

:&lt;math&gt;T(j\omega) = \frac{2}{j\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

Then we convert our magnitude into logarithms:

:&lt;math&gt;Gain = 20\log(2) - 20\log(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the location of the break point for the pole is located at &amp;omega; &amp;rarr; 0, which is all the way to the left of the graph. Also, we notice that inserting 0 in for &amp;omega; gives us an undefined value (which approaches negative infinity, as the limit). We know, because there is a single pole at zero, that the graph to the right of zero (which is everywhere) has a slope of -20dB/Decade. We can determine from our magnitude calculation by plugging in &amp;omega; &amp;rarr; 1 that the second term drops out, and the magnitude at that point is 6dB. We now have the slope of the line, and a point that it intersects, and we can draw the graph:

[[Image:Bode-i.png|center]]}}

=== Example: Differentiator ===

{{TextBox|1=
:&lt;math&gt;T(j\omega) = 2j\omega&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Bode-d.png|center]]}}

=== Example: 1st Order, Low-pass Filter (1 Break Point) ===

{{TextBox|1=
:&lt;math&gt;T(j\omega) = \frac{2}{j\omega+1}&lt;/math&gt;

==Operation Merlin==
Operation Merlin is an alleged United States covert operation under the Clinton Administration to provide Iran with a flawed design for building a nuclear weapon in order to delay the Iranian nuclear weapons program.

In his book State of War, author and New York Times intelligence correspondent James Risen claims that the CIA chose a defected Russian nuclear scientist to provide deliberately flawed nuclear warhead blueprints to Iranian officials in February 2000. Operation Merlin backfired when the Russian scientist noticed the flaws and pointed them out to the Iranians. Instead, the book alleges, it may have accelerated Iran's nuclear program by providing useful information, once the flaws were identified. Critics' contention Risen's citation of Seymour Hersh as well as anonymous sources make the book's claims somewhat suspicious.
==Modern Crisis==

[[Image:UraniumUSGOV.jpg|thumb]]
On August 14th 2002, Alireza Jafarzadeh revealed the existence of two nuclear sites (Natanz, Arak) previously unknown to the International Atomic Energy Agency. This had many people worried that Iran might, now or later, get the capability to make a nuclear bomb. Since the revelation, the so-called EU-3 (Germany, France and Britain) have tried to pressure Iran to abandoning uranium enrichment. However, Iran has shown no sign of backing down, and after a few &quot;voluntary suspensions&quot;, it began enriching uranium yet again.

Ultimately, the IAEA referred Iran to the UN Security Council, the body that can impose sanctions on Iran, or even authorize military action against the country, if Iran does not comply with its demands. Thus far, the Security Council has only agreed on a presidential statement, the weakest action that the body can take, demanding that Iran halt uranium enrichment. After the 30-days deadline passed without compliance by Iran, talks between Europe, Russia, China and the United States have begun yet again about how to handle the Iranian issue. The chance of getting China and Russia, supporters of Iran, to agree with sanctions was slim, but the Bush administration decided to take a gamble. Breaking with nearly 30 years of policy (not recognizing the Iranian regime), the administration offered bilateral talks with Iran on the nuclear issue, if Iran would halt uranium enrichment. It also offered some Euro-American economic and technological incentives for Iran, and the implicit threat of sanctions, if Iran does not accept the deal. Currently, the Iranians are deciding whether or not to accept the offer. President George W. Bush has said that Iran has weeks, not months to accept or reject the deal.

==Involvement in 9/11==

In July of 2004, the 9/11 Commission unearthed evidence that Iran might have offered safe passage to Al-Qaeda members, who were later involved in the September 11th attacks. However, the CIA had found &quot;no direct connection between Iran and the attacks of Sept. 11.&quot; Ultimately, the 9/11 Commission found that Iran did allow safe passage for Al-Qaeda members, but that it had no part in, and was probably not aware of the plot to strike New York and Washington.

==Announcement of Enriched Uranium==
Then on April 12, 2006, came the news that Iran had completed the enrichment of uranium and sought to increase the enrichment to create industrial grade uranium. What was next? Weapons grade uranium?
Many people in the West feared that the United States was planning military action against Iran, in part because of the resemblance between Bush's diplomatic campaign against Iraq and Iran. Also, the American president's harsh rhetoric against Iran has contributed to that perception. Bush, in a State of the Union message, said that Iraq, Iran and North Korea were part of an &quot;Axis of Evil.&quot; In the 2006 State of the Union speech, he had mentioned that he wanted Iran to become democratic and free, because the current theocratic dictatorship does not reflect the wishes of the people of Iran, according to Bush. However whether or not there was to be a war was yet to be seen. Bush has not ruled out an attack against Iran, but he is apparently trying to downplay it.

==Enriched Uranium Matter==
The matter about possible uranium enrichment in Iran was mentioned after the War in Iraq. Enrichment refers to the percentage of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Uranium to &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;Uranium.

===Definition===
Enriched uranium is a kind of uranium in which the percent composition of uranium-235 has been increased through the process of isotope separation. Natural uranium is 99.284% &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U isotope, with &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U only constituting about 0.711% of its weight. However, &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U is the only isotope existing in nature (in any appreciable amount) that is fissionable by thermal neutrons.

Enriched uranium is a critical component for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency attempts to monitor and control enriched uranium supplies and processes in its efforts to ensure nuclear power generation safety and curb nuclear weapons proliferation.

During the Manhattan Project enriched uranium was given the codename oralloy, a shortened version of Oak Ridge alloy, after the location of the plants where the uranium was enriched. The term oralloy is still occasionally used to refer to enriched uranium. There are about 2,000 metric tons of highly enriched uranium in the world, produced mostly for nuclear weapons, naval propulsion, and smaller quantities for research reactors.

The 238U remaining after enrichment is known as depleted uranium (DU), and is considerably less radioactive than even natural uranium, though still extremely dense. It is useful for armor- penetrating weapons, and other applications requiring very dense metals, though at the present time, only 5% of it is put to any use; the rest remains in storage at the enrichment facilities.

==International View on Crisis==
Russia and China so far are against any use of sanctions to make Iran abandon its enrichment program.
Iran has always condemned U.S hegemony over it. Pakistan is afraid of U.S threats; otherwise it is also very close to Iran.

==Arrest of Ramin Jahanbegloo==
In May 2006, after he came back from India to Iran, he was arrested by the Iranian government, speculated to have a relation to his recent interview with a Spanish newspaper about Ahmadinejad's comments concerning the Holocaust.

On May 3, Iran judiciary branch officials confirmed that he has been arrested and now he is imprisoned in the Evin Prison. Additionally, an unconfirmed source told the Fars News Agency that he was charged with spying.

On May 4, a friend of his told CBC News that he has been transfered to a hospital.

On May 5, Human Rights Watch expressed concern about Ramin Jahanbegloo being detained without charge and stated that he must immediately be released.

On May 6, The Ottawa Citizen published an article containing concerns voiced by friends of Mr. Jahanbegloo that he was being tortured. These concerns become more urgent Friday, when it became known that Jahanbegloo had been examined twice in the medical clinic at Tehran's notorious Evin prison for political prisoners. Boston University Professor Houchang Chehabi, an Iranian friend of Mr. Jahanbegloo, indicated this was a &quot;bad sign&quot; because it &quot;may mean he's been tortured...&quot;

==Kavoshgar-1==
Kavoshgar-1 (Explorer-1) is the name of the first Iranian rocket type that is able to reach space. The first launch was conducted on February 4, 2008, as announced by state-run television (or maybe on February 25, 2007, as it is unknown if the two rockets launched are of the same type). Kavoshgar-1 is not, or not yet, able to carry a satellite, but only instruments to measure the higher atmosphere. The rocket launched on February 4, 2008, was a liquid propellant driven rocket, probably a derivate of the Shahab 3, that reached an orbit in space at an altitude of 200-250 km and successful returned science data according to the Iranian News Agency.

On February 19, 2008, Iran offered new information about the rocket and announced that Kavoshgar-1 is a two staged rocket. The first stage separated after 100 seconds and returned to earth with the help of a parachute. The second stage continued its ascend to the altitude of 200 kilometers. However it was not intended to reach orbital velocity.
==UN Resolution==
The U.N. Security Council imposed another round of sanctions on Iran for refusing to suspend uranium enrichment, but Iran defiantly vowed Monday to continue its nuclear program despite the nearly unanimous censuring vote. 

The resolution authorized a third set of sanctions targeting individuals, companies and equipment that could be used in Iran's nuclear program. It was adopted on a vote of 14-0, with Indonesia abstaining.

Two previous sanctions resolution were adopted unanimously, but diplomats said this vote still sent a strong message to the Tehran government that there is global concern that Iran is trying to produce nuclear weapons. Iran insists the program is aimed only at generating power.

The council imposed limited sanctions in December 2006 and has been ratcheting them up in hopes of pressuring Iran to suspend enrichment and start negotiations on its nuclear program. Iran has repeatedly defied the demand and has stepped up enrichment activities.

Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Khazee said just before Monday's vote that his government would not comply with what he called &quot;unlawful action&quot; against Iran's &quot;peaceful nuclear program.&quot; He said the Security Council was being &quot;downgraded to a mere tool of the national foreign policy of just a few countries.&quot;

&quot;Iran cannot and will not accept a requirement which is legally defective and politically coercive,&quot; Khazee said. &quot;History tells us that no amount of pressure, intimidation and threat will be able to coerce our nation to give up its basic and legal rights.&quot;
==Iran Expelled==
Iran has been kicked out of an international defense show in Malaysia for exhibiting missile equipment in violation of U.N. rules, an official said Thursday. 
 
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak said Iranian companies were ordered out of the Defense Services Asia show Tuesday because their exhibition was deemed &quot;offensive.&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, when we came around to inspecting their stand, they displayed equipment that clearly contravened the U.N. resolution — equipment such as missiles and missile systems and others,&quot; Najib told reporters.

&quot;The moment they crossed the line, we had no option but to terminate them,&quot; Najib added.

Najib said the exhibit was in defiance of U.N. resolutions that ban Iranian arms exports and forbid countries from providing Iran with technical and financial assistance that could contribute to its alleged nuclear weapons program.

Iran is under three sets of U.N. Security Council sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment and meet other council demands designed to ease fears that its civilian nuclear program is a cover for attempts to make atomic weapons.

Tehran has denied ever trying to make nuclear arms.
==Complaint==
Iran has lodged a formal protest at the United Nations about comments by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton that the United States would “totally obliterate” Iran if it attacked Israel with nuclear weapons, the state-run IRNA news agency reported Thursday. 

Iran’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Mehdi Danesh-Yazdi, sent a letter of protest on Wednesday to the United Nations secretary general and the United Nations Security Council denouncing the remarks, according to IRNA. 

Mrs. Clinton made the comments in an interview on ABC last week. “I want the Iranians to know that if I’m the president, we will attack Iran,” she said when she was asked what she would do if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons. “In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them,” she added.

Mr. Danesh-Yazdi wrote in the letter that Mrs. Clinton’s comments were “provocative, unwarranted and irresponsible” and “a flagrant violation” of the United Nations charter, IRNA reported.

“I wish to reiterate my government's position that the Islamic Republic of Iran has no intention to attack any other nation,” the letter said. 

Nonetheless “Iran would not hesitate to act in self-defense to respond to any attack against the Iranian nation and to take appropriate defensive measures to protect itself,” the letter added.
==Secretary Rice==
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice raised fresh doubts Thursday about the nature of Iran's nuclear program, saying if the clerical state really wanted only an avenue to peaceful atomic energy it could quickly have it.
 
Instead, Iran is stonewalling on an attractive deal to trade away only the part of the program that could result in a nuclear weapon, Rice said ahead of a gathering of the U.N. nations that have presented a carrot-or-stick package to Iran.

&quot;I continue to suspect this is not at all about a civil nuclear program,&quot; Rice told reporters traveling with her. Iran's insistence that it be able to enrich uranium on its terms seems at cross-purposes with that goal, Rice said.

&quot;One has to wonder what is going on here.&quot;

U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a report last year that Iran shelved an active weapons-development program years ago, a finding that undercut the Bush administration's claim that Iran was using a public energy development program to hide a secret drive for a bomb. An unclassified summary of the report, known as a National Intelligence Estimate, said Iran could resume a weapons program and might evade detection if it did. Rice did not say whether she thought that had happened and did not directly accuse Iran of lying.

==Problem left to Successor==
The United States and the European Union told Iran on Tuesday they were ready to impose more sanctions over its nuclear enrichment program.

But President George W. Bush acknowledged the limits of U.S. influence over Tehran and, in the twilight of his presidency, appeared resigned to leaving the standoff to his successor.

&quot;I leave behind a multilateral framework to work on this issue,&quot; Bush said after a U.S.-EU summit at a Slovenian castle.

&quot;A group of countries can send a clear message to the Iranians, and that is: We're going to continue to isolate you ... we'll find new sanctions if need be, if you continue to deny the just demands of the free world, which is to give up your enrichment program,&quot; he said.

He stopped short of repeating the U.S. position that all options, including military action, remain open. &quot;Now is the time for there to be strong diplomacy,&quot; Bush said.

==Iranian Responce to Election 2008==
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran told reporters during a trip to New Delhi, the Indian capital, that he believed neither Mrs. Clinton nor Barack Obama , the other Democratic presidential candidate, had a chance of winning the presidential election. 

“Do you think a black candidate would be allowed to be president in the U.S.?” he asked, the semiofficial Mehr News Agency reported. “We don’t think Mr. Obama will be allowed to become the U.S. president,” he said.

Referring to Mrs. Clinton, he said: “Presidency of a woman in a country that boasts its gunmanship is unlikely.”
===According to ''the Iranian''===
Also in ''the Iranian,'' an Iranian newsletter, it was said, &quot;Her ideology has contributed to the nation's moral bankruptcy, the loss of over one million lives, and the depletion of America’s treasury. These neoliberals who have driven us into a quagmire, elaborated it would serve America’s interest to promote the Democratic peace theory. Scholars, university professors, and neoliberal jurists presented the concept that sovereignty, as it stood in international law did not provide immunity from attack to states engaging in systematic human rights abuses or amassing weapons of mass destruction. These would be considered ‘pariah’ states to be attacked by democratic coalitions with a warrant to liberalize them.3 Candidate Hillary comes from this stock. It seems that the only thing which differentiates her from McCain is the conduct of the war in Iraq, not the immoral and illegal war itself.&quot;

==Gordon Brown on Iran and Israel==
Gordon Brown threatened Iran with tougher sanctions as he became the first British prime minister to address the Israeli parliament.

At the conclusion of his first trip to Jerusalem as Premier, Mr Brown vowed that Britain would stand by Israel's side as it faced threats to its existence.

Condemning as &quot;abhorrent&quot; Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's call for Israel to be wiped from the map, he said he would not stand by as Tehran sought to acquire nuclear weapons.

The Prime Minister also urged Israel to seize the opportunity of lasting peace with the Palestinians. He was heckled at one point as he raised again the need for Israelis to withdraw from settlements on Palestinian land - an issue over which he clashed with his opposite number, Ehud Olmert, on Sunday.

Mr Brown, who was greeted at the Knesset with a red carpet and guard of honor, pleased his audience of MPs and visitors with a Hebrew phrase soon into his speech, &quot;Shalom aleichem&quot;, meaning peace be unto you.

He went on to describe his long-standing admiration for Israel, stemming from his churchman father's fascination with, and frequent visits, to the country. He said his premiership would ensure that Britain remained Israel's &quot;true friend&quot;.

==Syria and Iran Blame U.S. in Blast on Iraq Border==
Iran joined Syria on Monday in condemning what they described as an attack by four United States helicopters on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq that they said killed eight people.

=== Reach of War ===
The United States confirmed that a special operations mission took place in the area on Sunday but a senior military official gave no more details for now.

The incident comes at a time when the United States is trying to negotiate a strategic agreement with Iraq that would allow American troops to remain in the country and carry out military operations. The pact faces strenuous opposition from neighboring countries, especially Syria and Iran, because of concerns that the United States might use Iraqi territory to carry out attacks on them.

Syria’s state-run news channel reported that United States helicopters on Sunday attacked an area within Syria near the town of Abu Kamal. The official news agency, SANA, cited an anonymous official as saying four American helicopters had “launched aggression on a civilian building under construction,” killing eight people, giving the details of those it said were killed, and that the Syrian deputy foreign minister had summoned the chargé d’affaires from the American and Iraqi Embassies in protest.

Syria also said that United States soldiers on the ground had stormed a building in the area, Reuters reported.

In Tehran, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hassan Qashqavi, condemned the attack, saying a violation of the territorial integrity of any sovereign state was unacceptable.

“Iran condemns in strongest terms any form of aggression or violation of the states’ territorial integrity which leads to the death of innocent civilians,” he told reporters, according to the official news agency IRNA.

Syria’s state-run media also intensified its criticism of the United States on Monday, with the government newspaper Tishrin accusing American forces of committing “a war crime,” Agence France-Presse said.
==Iran asks India to be more active in gas pipeline plan==
Iran's oil minister called on India to play a more active role in development of a multi-billion dollar gas pipeline from Iran to Pakistan and India, semi-official Mehr news agency reported. &quot;In the light of the many wasted opportunities in the pipeline project because of stalling by India, we asked this country to be more active,&quot; Gholam Hossein Nozari said after meeting Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee. The 7.5 billion dollar project for the 2,600 kilometer (1,600 miles) Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) pipeline was launched in 1994 but has been held up by disagreements between India and Pakistan. Iran and Pakistan agreed last month to go ahead with the pipeline on a bilateral basis. Mukherjee, who was in Tehran for an official visit, said India &quot;has no intention of quitting the project,&quot; Mehr reported. He also raised the possibility of a three-way meeting between Iran, Pakistan and India, though no date has yet been set.

New Delhi has been under pressure from the United States not to do business with Iran, viewed in Washington as a state sponsor of terrorism that is bent on acquiring nuclear weapons.

Iran holds the world's second largest gas reserves after Russia but remains a small-scale exporter because of heavy domestic consumption and the lack of exploitation of some of its gas fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Early Immigration to the Americas as of 1790 ==

The following table is an approximation of the countries of origin for new arrivals to United States up to 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Meyerink, Kory L., and Loretto Dennis Szucs. ''The Source: A Guidebook of American Genealogy.''&lt;/ref&gt; The regions marked * were a part of Great Britain. The Irish in the 1790 census were probably mostly Irish Protestants and the French Huguenots. The total U.S. Catholic population in 1790 was probably less than 5%. &lt;ref&gt;Meyerink and Szucs. The ancestry of the 3.9 million population in 1790 has been estimated by various sources by sampling last names in the 1790 census and assigning them a country of origin. This is an uncertain procedure, particularly in the similarity of some Scot-Irish, Irish, and English last names. None of these numbers are definitive and only &quot;educated&quot; guesses.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Webb, among others, has argued that not enough credit is given to early Scots-Irish for the role they played in early American history. These people formed a full 40% of the American Revolutionary army: their culture is now dominant in the American South, Midwest and Appalachian Region.

== The Constitutional Convention ==

The original constitution as defined in the Articles of Confederation was meant to provide a league, rather than a united government. However, the uniting of these states in the Revolution showed flaws in this legislation. From place to place the same goods and services had a wide variation in price, and a wide variation in the way they were paid for. Should they be paid with trade in kind, as with many rural communities; in tobacco, as in Virginia; in gold and silver ores; or in Spanish Dollars or British Pound Sterling? If the last, how to establish that the states were neither Spanish nor British? The Revolution had been paid for in Continental specie: inflation left these bills &quot;not worth a Continental.&quot; Article Twelve said that War debts would be paid for by the central government, but Article Eight said that these monies would be raised by State legislatures. Without a strong central authority, how could equality of funding be assured? In fact, none of the debts, individual or national, had yet been paid. With all their rich resources, the States were running a trade deficit, buying many of their goods from the British.

In 1787, a Convention was called in Philadelphia with the declared purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation. However many delegates intended to use this convention for the purpose of drafting a new constitution. All states except for Rhode Island sent delegates, though all delegates did not attend.  It was presided over by George Washington.  At the convention, the primary issue was representation of the states. Under the Articles, each state had one vote in Congress. The more populous states wanted representation to be based on population (proportional representation). James Madison of Virginia crafted the Virginia Plan, which guaranteed proportional representation and granted wide powers to the Congress. The small states, on the other hand, supported equal representation through William Paterson's New Jersey Plan. The New Jersey Plan also increased the Congress' power, but it did not go nearly as far as the Virginia Plan. The conflict threatened to end the Convention, but Roger Sherman of Connecticut proposed the &quot;Great Compromise&quot; (or Connecticut Compromise) under which one house of Congress would be based on proportional representation, while the other would be based on equal representation. Eventually, the Compromise was accepted and the Convention saved.

After settling on representation, compromises seemed easy for other issues. The question about the counting of slaves when determining the official population of a state was resolved by the Three-Fifths Compromise, which provided that slaves would count as three-fifths of persons. In another compromise, the Congress was empowered to ban the slave trade, but only after 1808. Similarly, issues relating to the empowerment and election of the President were resolved, leading to the Electoral College method for choosing the Chief Executive of the nation.

The Convention required that the Constitution come into effect only after nine states ratify, or approve, it. The fight for ratification was difficult, but the Constitution eventually came into effect in 1788.

=== The Federalist Papers and Ratification  ===

During 1788 and 1789, there were 85 essays published in several New York State newspapers, designed to convince New York and Virginia voters to ratify the Constitution. The three people who are generally acknowledged for writing these essays are Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay. Since Hamilton, Madison, and Jay were considered Federalists, this series of essays became known as &quot;''The Federalist Papers''.  One of the most famous Federalist Papers is Federalist No. 10, which was written by Madison and argues that the checks and balances in the Constitution prevent the government from falling victim to factions.

Anti-Federalists did not support ratification.  Many individuals, such as Patrick Henry, George Mason, and Richard Henry Lee, were Anti-Federalists.  The Anti-Federalists had several complaints with the constitution.  One of their biggest was that the Constitution did not provide for a Bill of Rights protecting the people.  They also thought the Constitution gave too much power to the federal government and too little to individual states.  A third complaint of the Anti-Federalists was that Senators and the President were not directly elected by the people, and that the House of Representatives was elected every two years instead of annually.

On December 7, 1787, Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution. The vote was unanimous, 30-0. Pennsylvania followed on December 12 and New Jersey on ratified on December 18, also in a unanimous vote. By summer 1788, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia and New York had ratified the Constitution, and it went into effect. On August 2, 1788, North Carolina refused to ratify the Constitution without amendments, but it relented and ratified it a year later.

A number of states that ratified the Constitution also issued statements requesting changes to the constitution, such as a Bill of Rights.  This led to the Bill of Rights being drawn up in the first few years of the federal government.

===The Bill of Rights===

George Washington was inaugurated as the first United States president on April 30, 1789. However, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Vermont had not ratified the Constitution. Although governance was assured, there were no protections of people's religion, speech, or civil liberties. On September 26, 1789, Congress sent a list of twelve amendments to the states for ratification. Ten of the amendments would become the Bill of Rights. North Carolina ratified the Constitution in November of 1789, followed by Rhode Island in May 1790. Vermont became the last state to ratify the Constitution on January 10, 1791, becoming the 14th state in the Union.

The Bill of Rights was enacted on December 15, 1791. Here is a summary of the ten amendments ratified on that day:

# Establishes freedom of religion, speech, the press, assembly, petition.
# Establishes the right to keep and bear arms as part of a well-regulated militia.
# Bans the forced quartering of soldiers.
# Interdiction of unreasonable searches and seizures; a search warrant is required to search persons or property.
# Details the concepts of indictments, due process, self-incrimination, double jeopardy, rules for eminent domain.
# Establishes rights to a fair and speedy public trial, to a notice of accusations, to confront the accuser, to subpoenas, and to counsel.
# Provides for the right to trial by jury in civil cases
# Bans cruel and unusual punishment, and excessive fines or bail
# Lists unrenumerated rights
# Limits the powers of the federal government to only those specifically granted by the constitution.

== Washington Administration ==

[[File:Gilbert Stuart Williamstown Portrait of George Washington.jpg|150px|thumb|right|George Washington, the first President of the United States]]
After George Washington had become the successful Commander in Chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, he became the first President of the United States, holding  office from 1789 to 1797. Yet after leading the American victory, he refused to lead a military regime, though he was encouraged to do so by some of his peers. He returned to civilian life at Mount Vernon.

In 1788, the Electors unanimously chose Washington as president. A short time after he had helped bring the government together, rivalries arose between his closest advisors, particularly between Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. Out of these developments evolved two new political parties: The Federalists, who shared the same name as the earlier pro-ratification party, and the Democratic-Republican Party, also known as the Jeffersonian party, or as the Anti-Federalists. 

Washington's two-term administration set many policies and traditions that survive today.  He was again unanimously elected in 1792. But after his second term expired, Washington again voluntarily relinquished power, thereby establishing an important precedent that was to serve as an example for the United States and also for other future republics. Washington also abjured titles. He didn't want to be called &quot;Your Excellency&quot; or &quot;Your Majesty.&quot; He insisted on being called &quot;Mr. President,&quot; and referred to as &quot;The President of the United States&quot;. Because of his central role in the founding of the United States, Washington is often called the &quot;Father of his Country&quot;. Scholars rank him with Abraham Lincoln among the greatest of United States presidents.

===Domestic Issues: Strong or Weak Central Government?===

The conflict between the Federalist party and the Democratic-Republican party can be seen in the debate on how to pay off Revolutionary War debts. Alexander Hamilton and the Federalists were for a strong central government. They wanted to put state debts and federal debts into one huge national debt. When the new federal government had succeeded in paying off this debt, it would increase confidence in the stability of the central government, encouraging foreign governments to loan money to the U.S. Hamilton also proposed a National Bank to help stabilize the national economy. This private Bank of the United States would serve as a place to put the government's money, increasing central financial power and economic control.

Jefferson did not agree with Hamilton's idea of a national bank. Jefferson's faction envisioned an America more similar to ancient Athens or pre-Imperial Rome, with independent farming households following their own interests and nurturing liberty. Jefferson believed America should teach people to be self-sufficient farmers, and he wanted the federal government to stop interfering in state matters. (However, some evidence suggests Jefferson did  support Hamilton's plan for paying off state debts. He wanted leverage to pressure Hamilton's agreement to locate the government's permanent capital in the South, on the Potomac River in what would become Washington, D.C.)

Both President Washington and Congress agreed to Hamilton's Bank. Jefferson's plan was overruled, and he eventually resigned as Secretary of State.

===Whiskey Rebellion (1794)===
Washington was involved in one controversy during his presidency.  This was the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794.  Hamilton had asked Congress to pass an excise tax on the sale of whiskey, but rural Pennsylvania farmers refused to pay the tax, and a mob of 500 men attacked a tax collector's house.  In response, Washington and Hamilton led an army of 15,000 men to quell the rebellion.  This army was larger than the army Washington commanded during the American Revolution.  When the army showed up, the rebels dispersed.  The whiskey tax was eventually repealed by the Democratic Republicans in 1801.
===Foreign Affairs===

====The French Revolution====

The French Revolution broke out in 1789, a few months after the American Constitution had gone  into effect. At first, as France overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a republic, many Americans supported the revolution. They believed their own revolt against England had spurred France to republicanism. But as the Reign of Terror began, and thousands of French aristocrats went to the guillotine, many Americans were shocked at the revolution's excesses. By the mid-1790s, as France went to war against neighboring monarchies, the revolution polarized American public opinion. Federalists viewed England, France's traditional enemy, as the bastion of stable government against a growing tide of French anarchy.  Members of the emerging Democratic Republican Party, on the other hand, who took their party's name in part from the French Republic, believed the Terror to be a temporary excess and continued to view England as the true enemy of liberty.

President Washington's policy was neutrality. He knew that England, France, or even Spain, would be happy to eat up American resources and territory. The United States in the 1790s was still new and frail. He hoped that America could stay out of European conflicts until it was strong enough to withstand any serious foreign threat. Yet both England and France found opportunities to each use American resources against the other.

Hamilton and Jefferson clashed here as well. The former argued that the mutual defense treaty that the United States had signed with France in 1778 was no longer binding, as the French regime that had made that treaty no longer existed. The latter disagreed. But Washington sided with Hamilton, issuing a formal '''Proclamation of Neutrality''' in 1793. Washington repeated his belief in neutrality and argued against factionalism in his Farewell Address of 1796.

That same year, Citizen Edmund Charles Genêt arrived as the French minister to the United States. He soon began issuing commissions to captains of American ships who were willing to serve as privateers for France. This blatant disregard of American neutrality angered Washington, who demanded and got Genêt's recall.

====English and Spanish Negotiations====

The Royal Navy, meanwhile, began pressing sailors into service, including sailors on American merchant ships. Many English sailors had been lured into the American merchant service by high wages and comparatively good standards of living, and England needed these sailors to man its own fleet, on which England's national security depended. This violation of the American flag, however, infuriated Americans, as did the fact that England had not yet withdrawn its soldiers from posts in the Northwest Territory, as required by the Treaty of Paris of 1783.

In response, President Washington sent Supreme Court Chief Justice John Jay to negotiate a treaty with England. But Jay had little leverage with which to negotiate: the final treaty did require immediate English evacuation of the frontier forts, but it said nothing about the matter of impressments. The &lt;b&gt;Jay Treaty&lt;/b&gt; provoked an outcry among American citizens, and although the Senate ratified it narrowly, the debate it sparked was the final blow which solidified the Federalist and Republican factions into full-scale political parties, Federalists acquiescing in the treaty, and Republicans viewing it as a sell-out to England (and against France).

Spain, meanwhile, viewed the Jay Treaty negotiations with alarm, fearing that America and England might be moving towards an alliance. Without being certain of the treaty provisions, Spain decided to mollify the United States and give ground in the southwest before a future Anglo-American alliance could take New Orleans and Louisiana. Spain thus agreed to abandon all territorial claims north of Florida and east of the Mississippi, with the exception of New Orleans, and to grant the United States both the right to navigate the Mississippi and the right of commercial deposit in New Orleans. This would give westerners greater security and allow them to trade with the outside world. This &lt;b&gt;Treaty of San Lorenzo&lt;/b&gt;, also called &lt;b&gt;Pinckney's Treaty&lt;/b&gt; after American diplomat Charles Pinckney, was signed in 1795 and ratified the following year. Unlike Jay's treaty, it was quite popular.

If Jay's Treaty alarmed Spain, it angered France, which saw it as a violation of the Franco-American mutual defense treaty of 1778. By 1797,  French privateers began attacking American merchant shipping in the Caribbean.

== Election of 1796 ==

The first election where the presidency was not a foregone conclusion produced four candidates: Washington's Federalist Vice President John Adams, Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson, the Federalist Thomas Pinckney, and the Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr. (Burr was in fact hoping to become Vice President if the other Democratic-Republican were to win.) There were no Vice Presidential candidates, for under the original draft of the Constitution, the Vice President would be the candidate with the second-largest number of votes. 

This was also the election testing the Constitution's Electoral College. Voters in each state did not directly elect candidates. Instead, their choices directed the two votes cast by the state's Electors. 

In the election of 1796, John Adams won the required majority, but Thomas Jefferson came in second place. The President and the Vice President were in two different parties. The Constitutional role of the Vice President was defined in relation to the President: there was little else for him to do. Jefferson was isolated from an administration which supported strong government and a central Bank, and his contrary views were not consulted in the Adams administration.

== The XYZ Affair ==

Newly-elected President John Adams sent a delegation to Paris, resolving to negotiate a settlement with France. However, the delegates found it impossible even to secure an appointment with Talleyrand, the French foreign minister. The delegates were approached by three minor functionaries who insisted that the Americans pay a bribe to inaugurate negotiations, warning them of &quot;the power and violence of France&quot; if they refused. The delegates refused. (&quot;The answer is no; no; not a sixpence,&quot; one of them retorted. This was popularly rendered as &quot;Millions for defense, not a penny for tribute.&quot;) When Adams made the correspondence public, after replacing the names of the French functionaries with X, Y, and Z, American sentiment swung strongly against France. Under the control of the Federalists, Congress initiated a military buildup, fielding several excellent warships and calling Washington out of retirement to head the army. (Washington agreed only on condition that he not command until the army actually took the field. The army was never marshaled.)

The result was a Quasi-war, or an undeclared naval war with France. It consisted of combat between individual ships, mostly in the Caribbean, from 1798 to 1800. Eventually the United States and France agreed to end hostilities and to end the mutual defense treaty of 1778. Adams considered this one of his finest achievements.

== Alien and Sedition Acts ==

Under Adams, the Federalist-dominated congress pushed passage of a series of laws under the cover of overcoming dangerous &quot;aliens.&quot; In fact, they four acts were used to silence domestic political opponents.  

# The '''Alien Act''' authorized the president to deport an alien deemed &quot;dangerous.&quot;
# The '''Alien Enemies Act''' authorized the president to deport or imprison any alien from a country that the United States was fighting a declared war with.
# The '''Sedition Act''' made it a crime to criticize government officials and publish &quot;false, scandalous, and malicious writing&quot; against the government or its agents.
# The '''Naturalization Act''' changed the residency requirements for aliens to become citizens from 5 to 14 years.

Although it was openly deemed to be a security act, it provided powerful tools to the ruling Federalist party to quiet opposition from the growing Democratic-Republican Party. By extending the time required to become a citizen, they decreased the number of new voters that might choose to support the minority party.
However, these acts were rarely enacted against political opponents due to the possibility of conflict such actions could create.

==Education==

In well off families both boys and girls went to a form of infant school called a petty school. However only boys went to what you call grammar school. Upper class girls and sometimes boys were taught by tutors. Middle class girls might be taught by their mothers. Moreover during the 17th century boarding schools for girls were founded in many towns. In the boarding schools girls were taught subjects like writing, music and needlework. 
In the grammar schools conditions were hard. Boys started work at 6 or 7 in the morning and worked to 5 or 5.30 pm, with breaks for meals. Corporal punishment was usual. Normally the teacher hit naughty boys on the bare butt with birch twigs. Other boys in the class would hold the naughty boy down. (2)
In the 17th and early 18th centuries women were not encouraged to get an education. Some people believed that if women were well educated it would ruin their marriage prospects and be harmful to their mind. Protestants believed that women as well as men should be able to read the bible. Only the daughters of the wealthy or nobility could get an education. By the mid 17th century young women were allowed to go to school with their brothers. Sometimes if you had the money you would be placed within a household of a friend and within the household and you would be taught various things. Some of the things you would learn would be to read and write, run a household, and practice surgery. (2)
After the signing of the Declaration of Independence, several states had their own constitutions and there were sections in them that had information pertaining to education. But Thomas Jefferson had the thought that education should be left up to the government. He believed that education should not have a religious bias in it and believed that it should be free to all people not matter what their social status was. It was still very hard to make the concept of  public schools easy for people to accept because of the vast number of people who were immigrating, the many different political views, and the different levels of economic difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;A People and a Nation, Eighth Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

In the 1790s certain New England weavers began building large, automated looms, driven by water power. To house them they created the first American factories. Working the looms required less skill and more speed than household laborers could provide. The looms needed people brought to them; and they also required laborers who did not know the origin of the word ''sabotage''. These factories sought out young women.

The factory owners said they wanted to hire these women just for a few years, with the ideal being that they could raise a dowry for their wedding. They were carefully supervised, with their time laid out for them. Some mill owners created evening classes to teach these women how to write and how to organize a household. 

The factories provided a cheaper source of cotton cloth. For the first time some people could afford more than two outfits, work and Sunday best. They also provided an outlet for cotton from the slave states in the South. Cotton was at that time one among many crops. Many slaves had to work to separate cotton from the seeds of the cotton plant, and to ship it to cloth-hungry New England. This was made simpler by Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin in 1793. Cotton became a profitable crop, and many Southern farms now made it their only crop. Growing and picking cotton was long, difficult labor, and the Southern plantation made it the work for slaves. Northern factories became part of the economy of slavery.

This renewed reliance on slavery was going against the trend in other parts of the country. Vermont had prohibited it in its state constitution in 1777. Pennsylvania passed laws for the gradual abolition of the condition in 1780, and New York State in 1799. Education, resources, and economic development created the beginnings of industrialization in many Northern states and plantations and slavery and less development in states in the Deep South.

--[[User:152.163.101.6|152.163.101.6]] 00:56, 4 April 2006 (UTC)=Cognitive Theories=
Cognitive psychology is the basis for organizational learning. According to Hedberg and Wolff(2001),the models were derived from the &quot;stimulus-response mechanism&quot; in which people learn from their interactions with the outside and develop appropriate behaviors based on the feedback which is received.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Position==
One of the main causes for the Civil War was the matter of states' rights. There was always the possibility of the federal and state governments disagreeing on some issue of law. However there was clear procedure in the constitution for settling this disagreement.  The states rights position was that the states had the powers of nullification and secession to check the excesses of the federal government. If nullification was accepted, a state could declare a federal law invalid in its territory.  If secession was accepted, a state could leave the union and become an independent country.

==The Constitution and States Rights ==
The US constitution did not take a firm position either way on states rights.  In fact it contained provisions that could be interpreted either way.

Article VI, clause 2 states:
''This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.''

The Tenth Amendment states:

''The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.''

Because of the 10th amendment combined with no prohibition of secession many held that the states had the power to leave the union at will. Any law to the contrary would violate the constitution. However many believed that the states had no such right because it was not expressly stated and would necessarily void laws passed under the constitution in the seceding states.

==The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions==
The Alien and Sedition Acts passed in 1798 generated a lot of opposition. They were correctly seen as a tool to suppress the political opponents of the ruling Federalist Party. Because of this Thomas Jefferson and James Madison drafted resolutions against them. These resolutions were passed by the legislatures of Kentucky and Virginia.  They argued that the laws were unconstitutional and therefore were nullified.  Other states responded that this was inappropriate and state legislatures could not determine the constitutionality of the laws.  The issue of the Alien and Sedition Acts was resolved when Jefferson was elected president 1800.  When he took office the laws expired and he pardoned those who had been convicted.  However the issue of States Rights was not resolved.

==Nullification Crisis==
In 1828 Congress raised tariffs on imported goods. This made imported goods more expensive than American manufactured goods. Northern factories benefited from this because imported goods were no longer cheaper than what they produced. In addition, much of the money raised was spent on internal improvements in the north. The southern states paid the majority of the tariff because they sold cotton abroad and bought manufactured goods either from the north or other countries. They viewed the tariff as an unfair law made to benefit the north at their expense. South Carolina passed a Nullification Ordinance declaring that the tariffs were null and void within Carolina. President Andrew Jackson threatened to send in government troops and ships to enforce the tariff. In 1832 he signed a law lowering the tariffs. Because the threat of using troops was made but the federal government backed down without carrying it out, the issue of nullification remained unresolved.

==Other Issues==
States rights were also invoked for slavery, against the fugitive slave act, and against the War of 1812.  However at no point were the questions of states rights answered before the civil war.

== Introduction ==

[[Image:Headdrawers.jpg|thumb]]Most human cognitive abilities rely on or interact with what we call knowledge. How do people navigate through the world? How do they solve problems, how do they comprehend their surroundings and on which basis do people make decisions and draw inferences? For all these questions, knowledge, the mental representation of the world is part of the answer.

What is knowledge? According to [http://www.m-w.com/ Merriam-Websters online dictionary], knowledge is “the range of one’s information and understanding” and “the circumstance or condition of apprehending truth or fact through reasoning”. Thus, knowledge is a structured collection of information, that can be acquired through learning, perception or reasoning.

This chapter deals with the structures both in human brains and in computational models that represent knowledge about the world. First, the idea of concepts and categories as a model for storing and sorting information is introduced, then the concept of semantic networks and, closely related to these ideas, an attempt to explain the way humans store and handle information is made. Apart from the biological aspect, we are also going to talk about knowledge representation in artificial systems which can be helpful tools to store and access knowledge and to draw quick inferences.

After looking at how knowledge is stored and made available in the human brain and in artificial systems, we will take a closer look at the human brain with regard to hemispheric specialisation. This topic is not only connected to knowledge representation, since the two hemispheres differ in which type of knowledge is stored in each of them, but also to many other chapters of this book. Where, for example, is memory located, and which parts of the brain are relevant for emotions and motivation? In this chapter we focus on the general differences between the right and the left hemisphere. We consider the question whether they differ in what and how they process information and give an overview about experiments that contributed to the scientific progress in this field.

==Knowledge Representation in the Brain==

===Concepts and Categories===

For many cognitive functions, concepts are essential. Concepts are mental representations, 
including memory, reasoning and using/understanding language. One function of concepts is 
the categorisation of knowledge which has been studied intensely. In the course of this chapter, we will focus on this function of concepts.

Imagine you wake up every single morning and start wondering about all the things you have 
never seen before. Think about how you would feel if an unknown car parked in front of your 
house. You have seen thousands of cars but since you have never seen this specific car in this 
particular position, you would not be able to provide yourself with any explanation. Since 
we are able to find an explanation, the questions we need to ask ourselves are: How are we 
able to abstract from prior knowledge and why do we not start all over again if we are 
confronted with a slightly new situation? The answer is easy: We categorise knowledge.  
Categorisation is the process by which things are placed into groups called categories. 
 
Categories are so called “pointers of knowledge”. You can imagine a category as a box, in 
which similar objects are grouped and which is labeled with common properties and other 
general information about the category. Our brain does not only memorise specific examples 
of members of a category, but also stores general information that all members have in 
common and which therefore defines the category. Coming back to the car-example, this 
means that our brain does not only store how your car, your neighbors’ and your friends’ car 
look like, but it also provides us with the general information that most cars have four wheels, 
need to be fueled and so on. Because categorisation immediately allows us to get a general 
picture of a scene by allowing us to recognise new objects as members of a category, it saves 
us much time and energy that we otherwise would have to spend in investigating new objects. 
It helps us to focus on the important details in our environment, and enables us to draw the 
correct inferences. To make this obvious, imagine yourself standing at the side of a road, 
wanting to traverse it. A car approaches from the left. Now, the only thing you need to know 
about this car is the general information provided by the category, that it will run you over if 
you don't wait until it has passed. You don't need to care about the car's color, number of 
doors and so on. If you were not able to immediately assign the car to the category &quot;car&quot;, and 
infer the necessity to step back, you would get hit because you would still be busy with examining 
the details of that specific and unknown car. Therefore categorisation has proved itself as 
being very helpful for surviving during evolution and allows us to quickly and efficiently 
navigate through our environment.  

[[Image:Car_concept.png | center | Categories provide a lot of information about their members]]

====Definitional Approach====

Take a look at the following picture! You will see four different kinds of cars. They differ in 
shape, color and other features, nonetheless you are probably sure that they are all cars. 

[[Image:Autos.jpg |center| Four different objects but all are cars]]

What makes us so convinced about the identity of these objects? Maybe we can try to find a 
definition which describes all these cars. Have all of them four wheels? No, There are some 
which have only three. Do all cars drive with petrol? No, That’s not true for all cars either. 
Apparently we will fail to come up with a definition. The reason for this failure is that we 
have to generalise to make a definition. That would work perhaps for geometrical objects, but 
obviously not for natural things. They do not share completely identical features in one 
category for that it is problematic to find an appropriate definition. There are however
similarities between members of one category, so what about this familiarity? The famous 
philosopher and linguist Ludwig Wittgenstein asked himself this question and claimed to have 
found a solution. He developed the idea of family resemblance. That means that members of a 
category resemble each other in several ways. For example cars differ in shape, color and 
many other properties but every car resembles somehow other cars. The following two 
approaches determines categories by similarity.

====Prototype Approach====

The prototype approach was proposed by Rosch in 1973. A prototype is an average case of all 
members in a particular category, but it is not an actual, really existent member of the 
category. Even extreme various features of members within one category can be explained by 
this approach. Different degrees of prototypicality represent differences among category- 
members. Members which resemble the prototype very strongly are high-prototypical. 
Members which differ in a lot of ways from the prototype are therefore low-prototypical. 
There seem to be connections to the idea of family resemblance and indeed some experiments 
showed that high prototypicality and high family resemblance are strongly connected. 
The typicality effect describes the fact that high-prototypical members are faster recognised 
as a member of a category. For example participants had to decide whether statements like “A 
penguin is a bird.” or “A sparrow is bird.” are true. Their decisions were much faster 
concerning the “sparrow” as a high-prototypical member of the category “bird” than for an 
atypical member as “penguin”. Participants also tend to prefer prototypical members of a 
category when asked to list objects of a category. Concerning the birds-example, they rather 
list “sparrow” than “penguin”, which is a quite intuitive result. In addition high-prototypical 
objects are strongly affected by priming.

====Exemplar Approach====

The typicality effect can also be explained by a third approach which is concerned with 
exemplars. Similar to a prototype, an exemplar is a very typical member of the category. The 
difference between exemplars and prototypes is that exemplars are actually existent members 
of a category that a person has encountered in the past. Nevertheless, it involves also the 
similarity of an object to a standard object. Only that the standard here involves many 
examples and not the average, each one called an exemplar.  

Again we can show the typicality effect: Objects that are similar to many examples we have 
encountered are classified faster to objects which are similar to few examples. You have seen 
a sparrow more often in your life than a penguin, so you should recognise the sparrow faster. 
		
For both prototype and exemplar approach there are experiments whose results support either 
one approach. Some people claim that the exemplar approach has less problems with variable 
categories and with atypical cases within categories. E.g. the category “games” is quite 
difficult to realise with the prototype approach. How do you want to find an average case for 
all games, like football, golf, chess. The reason for that could be that “real” category- 
members are used and all information of the individual exemplars, which can be useful when 
encountering other members later, are stored. Another point where the approaches can be 
compared is how well they work for differently sized categories. The exemplar approach seems 
to work better for smaller categories and prototypes do better for larger categories. 

Some researchers concluded that people may use both approaches: When we initially learn 
something about a category we average seen exemplars into a prototype. It would be very bad 
in early learning, if we already take into account what exceptions a category has. In getting to know some of these exemplars more in detail the information becomes strengthened.  
 
“We know generally what cats are (the prototype), but we know specifically our own cat the 
best (an exemplar).” (Minda &amp; Smith, 2001)

====Hierarchical Organisation of Categories====

Now that we know about the different approaches of how we go about forming categories, let 
us look at the structure of a category and the relationship between categories.  The basic idea is that larger categories can be split up into more specific and smaller ones. 

Rosch stated that by this process three levels of categorisation are created:  

[[Image:Levels.jpg | none ]]

It is interesting that the decrease of information from basic to superordinate is really high but 
that the increase of information from basic down to subordinate is rather low. Scientists 
wanted to find out if among these levels one is preferred over the others. They asked 
participants to name presented objects as quickly as possible. The result was that the subjects 
tended to use the basic-level name, which includes the optimal amount of stored information. 
Therefore a picture of a retriever would be named “dog” rather than “animal” or “retriever”. It is important to note that the levels are different for each person depending on factors such 
as expertise and culture.   

One factor which influences our categorisation is knowledge itself. Experts pay more 
attention to specific features of objects in their area than non-experts would do. For example 
after presenting some pictures of birds experts of birds tend to say the subordinate name 
(blackbird, sparrow) while non-experts just say &quot;bird&quot;. The basic level in the area of interest 
of an expert is lower than the basic level of a layperson. Therefore knowledge and experience 
of people affect categorisation. 

Another factor is culture. Imagine a people living for instance in close contact with their 
natural environment, and have therefore a greater knowledge about plants etc. than, for example, 
students in Germany. If you ask the latter what they see in nature, they use the basic level 
‘tree’ and if you do the same task for the people closer to nature they will tend to answer in terms of 
lower level concepts such as ‘oak tree’.

====Representation of Categories in the Brain====

There is evidence that some areas in the brain are selective for different categories, but it is 
not very probable that there is a corresponding brain area for each category. Results of
neurophysiological research point to a kind of double dissociation for living and non-living things. It has been proven by fMRI studies that they are indeed 
represented in different brain areas. It is important to denote that nevertheless there is much 
overlap between the activation of different brain areas by categories. Moreover when going 
one step closer into the physical area there is a connection to mental categories, too. There 
seem to exist neurons which respond better to objects of a particular category, namely so 
called “category-specific neurons”. These neurons fire not only as a response to one object but 
to many objects within one category. This leads to the idea that probably many neurons fire if 
a person recognises a particular object and that maybe these combined patterns of the firing 
neurons represent the object.

===Semantic Networks===

The &quot;Semantic Network approach&quot; proposes that concepts of the mind are arranged in
networks, in other words, in a functional storage-system for the `meanings' of words. Of 
course, the concept of a semantic net is very flexible. In a graphical illustration of such a 
semantic net, concepts of our mental dictionary are represented by nodes, which in this way 
represent a piece of knowledge about our world. 

The properties of a concept could be placed, or &quot;stored&quot;, next to a node representing that 
concept. Links between the nodes indicate the relationship between the objects. The links 
can not only show that there is a relationship, they can also indicate the kind of relation by their 
length, for example. 

Every concept in the net is in a dynamical correlation with other concepts, which may have 
protoypically similar characteristics or functions. 

====Collins and Quillian's Model====

[[Image:Net21.jpg |right|thumb|300px|Semantic Network according to Collins and Quillian with nodes, links, concept names and properties.]]

One of the first scientists who thought about structural models of human memory that could 
be run on a computer was Ross Quillian (1967). Together with Allan Collins, he developed 
the Semantic Network with related categories and with a hierarchical organisation. 

In the picture on the right hand side, Collins and Quillians network with added properties at 
each node is shown. As already mentioned, the skeleton-nodes are interconnected by links. At 
the nodes, concept names are added. Like in paragraph &quot;Hierarchical Organisation of 
Categories&quot;, general concepts are on the top and more particular ones at the bottom. By 
looking at the concept &quot;car&quot;, one gets the information that a car has 4 wheels, has an engine, 
has windows, and furthermore moves around, needs fuel, is manmade. 

These pieces of information must be stored somewhere. It would take too much space, if every 
detail must be stored at every level. So the information of a car is stored at the basis level and 
further information about specific cars, e.g. BMW, is stored at the lower level, where you do not 
need the fact that the BMW also has four wheels, if you already know that it is a car. This way 
of storing shared properties at a higher-level node is called Cognitive Economy.  

In order not to produce redundancies, Collins and Quillian thought of this as an information 
inheritance principle. Information, that is shared by several concepts, is stored in the highest 
parent node, containing the information. So all son-nodes, that are below the information 
bearer , also can access the information about the properties. However, there are exceptions. Sometimes a special car has not four wheels, but three. This specific 
property is stored in the son-node. 

The logic structure of the network is convincing, since it can show that the time of retrieving 
a concept and the distances in the network correlate. The correlation is proven by the 
sentence-verification technique. In experiments probands had to answer statements about 
concepts with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. It took actually longer to say &quot;yes&quot;, if the concept bearing nodes 
were further apart.  

The phenomenon that adjacent concepts are activated is called Spreading activation. These 
concepts are far more easily accessed by memory, they are &quot;primed&quot;.  This was studied and backed by David Meyer and Roger Schaneveldt (1971) with a lexical-decision task. Probands had to decide if word pairs were words or non-words. They were 
faster at finding real word pairs if the concepts of the two words were close-by in the 
intended network. 

While having the ability to explain many questions, the model has some flaws. 

The Typicality Effect is one of them. It is known that &quot;reaction times for more typical 
members of a category are faster than for less typical members&quot;. (MITECS) This contradicts 
the assumptions of Collins' and Quillian's Model, that the distance in the net is 
responsible for reaction time.  It was experimentally determined that some properties are stored at specific nodes, therefore the cognitive economy stands in question. Furthermore, there are examples of faster concept retrieval although the distances in the 
network are longer. 

These points led to another version of the Semantic Network approach: Collins and Loftus Model.

====Collins and Loftus Model====

[[Image:Net7.jpg|thumb|right|170px]]

Collins and Loftus (1975) tried to abandon these problems by using shorter or longer links 
depending on the relatedness and interconnections between formerly not directly linked 
concepts. Also the former hierarchic structure was substituted by a more individual structure 
of a person. Only to name a few of the extensions. As shown in the picture on the right, the 
new model represents interpersonal differences, such as acquired during a humans lifespan. 
They manifest themselves in the layout and the various lengths of the links of the same 
concepts. 

An example: The concept &quot;vehicle&quot; is connected to car, truck or bus by short links, and to fire 
engine or ambulance with longer links.   

After these enhancements, the model is so omnipotent that some researchers scarced it 
for being too flexible. In their opinion, the model is no longer a scientific theory, because it is 
not disprovable. Furthermore, we do not know how long these links are in us. How should 
they be measurable and could they actually?

===Connectionist Approach===

Every concept in a semantic net is in a dynamical correlation with other concepts which can have prototypically similar characteristics or functions. The neural networks in the brain are organised similarly.  Furthermore, it is useful to include the features of ”spreading activation” 
and ”parallel distributed activity” in a concept of such a semantic net to 
explain the complexity of the very sophisticated environment. 

====Basic Principles of Connectionism====

The connectionists did this by modeling their networks after neural networks 
in the nervous system. Every node of the diagram represents a neuron-like 
processing unit. These units can be divided into three subgroups: '''Input units''', which become activated by a stimulation of the environment, '''hidden units''', which receive signals from an input-unit and pass them to an output unit and output units, which show a pattern of activation that represents the initial stimulus. Excitatory and inhibitory connections between units just like synapses in the brain allow ’input’ to be analyzed and evaluated. For computing the outcome 
of such systems, it is useful to attach a certain ’weight’ to the input of the 
connectionists system, that mimics the strength of a stimulus of the human 
nervous system. 
		
It needs to be emphasized that connectionist networks are not models of how the 
nervous system works. The approach of connectionist networks is a hypothetical approach to represent categories 
in network patterns. Another name for the connectionist approach is Parallel 
Distributed Processing approach, for short PDP, since processing takes place 
in parallel lines and the output is distributed across many units.

====Operation of Connectionist Networks====

First a stimulus is presented to the input units. 
Then the links pass on the signal to the hidden units, that distribute the 
signal to the output units via further links. 
In the first trial, the output units shows a wrong pattern. After many repetitions, the pattern finally is 
correct. This is achieved by back propagation. The error signals are send back 
to the hidden units and the signals are reprocessed. During these repetitive 
trials, the ”weights” of the signal are gradually calibrated on behalf of the 
error signals in order to get a right output pattern at last. 
After having achieved a correct pattern for one stimulus, the system is ready 
to learn a new concept.

====Evaluating Connectionism====

The PDP approach is important for knowledge representation studies. It is far from perfect, but 
on the move to get there.  The process of learning enables the system to make generalizations, because similar concepts create 
similar patterns. After knowing one car, the system can recognize similar 
patterns as other cars, or may even predict how other cars look like. Furthermore, the system is protected against total wreckage. A damage to single 
units will not cause the system’s total breakdown, but will delete only some 
patterns, which use those units. This is called graceful degradation and is 
often found in patients with brain lesions. These two arguments lead to the 
third. The PDP is organized similarly to the human brain. And some effective computer programs have been developed on this basis, that were able 
to predict the consequences of human brain damage.

On the other hand, the connectionist approach is not without problems. Formerly 
learned concepts can be superposed by new concepts. In addition, PDP can 
not explain more complex processes than learning concepts. Neither can it 
explain the phenomenon of rapid learning, which does not require extensive 
learning. It is assumed that rapid learning takes place in the hippocampus, 
and that conceptual and gradual learning is located in the cortex. 

In conclusion, the PDP approach can explain some features of knowledge representation
very well but fails for some complex processes.

===Mental Representation===

There are different theories on how living beings, especially humans encode 
information to knowledge. We may think of diverse mental representations of 
the same object. When reading the written word &quot;car&quot;, we call this a discrete 
symbol. It matches with all imaginable cars and is therefore not bound to 
a special vehicle. It is an abstract, or amodal, representation. This is different if 
instead we see a picture of a car. It might be a red sports car. Now we speak of a 
non-discrete symbol, an imaginable picture that appears in front of our inner 
eye and that fits only to certain cars of sufficiently similar appearance. 

====Propositional Approach====

The Propositional Approach is one possible way to model mental representations in the human brain. It works with discrete symbols which are strongly 
connected among each other. The usage of discrete symbols necessitates clear 
definitions of each symbol, as well as information about the syntactic rules 
and the context dependencies in which the symbols may be used. The symbol 
&quot;car&quot; is only comprehensible for people who do understand English and have 
seen a car before and therefore know what a car is about. The Propositional 
Approach is an explicit way to explain mental representation. 

Definitions of propositions differ in the different fields of research and are 
still under discussion. One possibility is the following: 
”Traditionally in philosophy a distinction is made between sentences and the 
ideas underlying those sentences, called propositions. A single proposition may be expressed by an almost unlimited number of sentences. Propositions 
are not atomic, however; they may be broken down into atomic concepts 
called ”Concepts”. 

In addition, mental propositions deal with the storage, retrieval and interconnection of information as knowledge in the human brain.  There is a big discussion, if the brain really works with propositions or if 
the brain processes its information to and from knowledge in another way or 
perhaps in more than one way. 

====Imagery Approach====

One possible alternative to the Propositional Approach, is the Imagery Approach. Since here the representation of knowledge is understood as the 
storage of images as we see them, it is also called analogical or perceptual approach. In contrast to the Propositional Approach it works with non-discrete 
symbols and is modality specific. It is an implicit approach to mental representation. The picture of the sports car includes implicitly seats of any 
kind. If additionally mentioned that they are off-white, the image changes 
to a more specific one. How two non-discrete symbols are combined is not 
as predetermined as it is for discrete symbols. The picture of the off-white 
seats may exist without the red car around, as well as the red car did before 
without the off-white seats. 
The Imagery and the Propositional Approaches are also discussed in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Imagery#Propositional_Representation/ chapter 8].

==Computational Knowledge Representation==

Computational knowledge representation is concerned with how knowledge can be represented symbolically and how it can be manipulated in automated ways. Almost all of the theories mentioned above evolved in symbiosis with computer science. On the one hand, computer science uses the human brain as an inspiration for computational systems, on the other hand, artificial models are used to further our understanding of the biological basis of knowledge representation.

Knowledge representation is connected to many other fields related to information processing, e.g. logic, linguistics, reasoning, and the philosophical aspects of these fields. In particular, it is one of the crucial topics of Artificial Intelligence, as it deals with '''information encoding, storing and usage''' for computational models of cognition.

There are three main points that need to be addressed with regard to computational knowledge representation: The process, the formalisms and the applications of knowledge engineering.

===Knowledge Engineering===

The process of developing computational knowledge-based systems is called knowledge engineering. This process involves assessing the problem, developing a structure for the knowledge base and implementing actual knowledge into the knowledge base. The main task for knowledge engineers is to identify an appropriate conceptual vocabulary.

There are different kinds of knowledge, for instance rules of games, attributes of objects and temporal relations, and each type is expressed best by its own specific vocabulary. Related conceptual vocabularies that are able to describe objects and their relationships are called '''ontologies'''. These conceptual vocabularies are highly formal and each is able to express meaning in specific fields of knowledge. They are used for queries and assertions to knowledge bases and make sharing knowledge possible. In order to represent different kinds of knowledge in one framework, Jerry Hobbs (1985) proposed the principle of '''ontological promiscuity'''. Thereby several ontologies are mixed together to cover a range of different knowledge types.

A query to a system that represents knowledge about a world made of everyday items and that can perform actions in this world may look like this: “Take the cube from the table!”. This query could be processed as follows: First, since we live in a temporal world, the action needs to be a processed in a way that can be broken down into successive steps. Secondly, we make general statements about the rules for our system, for example that gravitational forces have a certain effect. Finally, we try out the chain of tasks that have to be done to take the cube from the table. 1) Reach out for the cube with the hand, 2) grab it, 3) raise the hand with the cube, etc. Logical Reasoning is the perfect tool for this task, because a logical system can also recognise if the task is possible at all.

There is a problem with the procedure described above. It is called the '''frame problem'''. The system in the example deals with changing states. The actions that take place change the environment. That is, the cube changes its place. Yet, the system does not make any propositions about the table so far. We need to make sure, that after picking up the cube from the table, the table does not change its state. It should not disappear or break down. This could happen, since the table is no longer needed. The systems tells that the cube is in the hand and omits any information about the table. In order to tackle the Frame Problem there have to be stated some special axioms or similar things. The Frame Problem has not been solved completely. There are different approaches to a resolution. Some add object spatial and temporal boundaries to the system/world (Hayes 1985). Others try more direct modeling. They do transformations on state descriptions. For example: Before the transformation the cube is on the table, after transformation , the table still exists, but independent from the cube.

===Knowledge Representation Formalisms===

The type of knowledge representation formalism determines how information is stored. Most knowledge representation applications are developed for a specific purpose, for example  a digital map for robot navigation or a graph like account of events for visualizing stories.

Each knowledge representation formalisms needs a strict syntax, semantics and inference procedure in order to be clear and computable. Most formalisms have the following attributes to be able to express information more clearly: The Semantic Network Approach, hierarchies of concepts (e.g. vehicle -&gt; car -&gt; truck) and property inheritance (e.g. red cars have four wheels since cars have four wheels). There are attributes that provide the possibility to add new information to the system without creating any inconsistencies, and the possibility to create a &quot;closed-world&quot; assumption. For example if the information that we have gravitation on earth is omitted, the closed-world assumption must be false for our earth/world.

A problem for knowledge representation formalisms is that expressive power and deductive reasoning are mutually exclusive. If a formalism has a big expressive power, it is able to describe a wide range of (different) information, but is not able to do brilliant inferring from (given) data. Propositional logic is restricted to Horn clauses. A Horn clause is a disjunction of literals with at most one positive literal. It has a very good decision procedure(inferring), but can not express generalisations. An example is given in the logical programming language Prolog. If a formalism has a big deductive complexity, it is able to do brilliant inferring, i.e. make conclusions, but has a poor range of what it can describe. An example is second-order logic. So, the formalism has to be tailored to the application of the KR system. This is reached by compromises between expressiveness and deductive complexity. In order to get a greater deductive power, expressiveness is sacrificed and vice versa.

With the growth of the field of knowledge bases, many different standards have been developed. They all have different syntactic restrictions. To allow intertranslation, different &quot;interchange&quot; formalisms have been created. One example is the Knowledge Interchange Format which is basically first-order set theory plus LISP (Genesereth et al. 1992).

===Applications of Knowledge Representation===

Computational knowledge representation is mostly not used as a model of cognition but to make pools of information accessible, i.e. as an extension of database technology. In these cases general rules and models are not needed. With growing storage media, one is capable of creating simple knowledge bases stating all specific facts. The information is stored in the form of sentential knowledge, that is knowledge saved in form of sentences comparable to propositions and program code. Knowledge is seen as a reservoir of useful information rather than as supporting a model of cognitive activity. More recently, increased available memory size has made it feasible to use &quot;compute-intensive&quot; representations that simply list all the particular facts rather than stating general rules. These allow the use of statistical techniques such as Markov simulation, but seem to abandon any claim to psychological plausibility.

===Artificial Intelligence===

Researchers are still far from being able to formalise all kinds of human knowledge. Especially intuitive, temporal and spatial knowledge defy themselves from control and can not be formalised today. Also the understanding of physical coherences and story comprehension is not framed properly whereas the strategies of playing chess are already formalised. In 1997, the chess computer Deep Blue beat the world chess champion Kasparow.

Knowledge representation is key to processing unsystematic information of the external world in order to get intelligible knowledge. Artificial intelligence research tries to develop systems that are able to act and react properly in the real world, task that can only succeed if the problem of representating knowledge about the real world is solved.

==Hemispheric Distribution==

After having dealt with how knowledge is stored in the brain, we now turn to the question of whether the 
brain is specialised and, if it is specialised, which functions are located where and which knowledge
is present in which hemisphere. These questions can be subsumed under the topic “hemispheric specialisation” or “lateralisation of processing” which looks at the differences in processing between the two hemispheres of the human 
brain. 

Differences between the hemispheres can be traced back to as long as 3.5 million years ago. Evidence 
for this are fossils of australopithecines (which is an ancient ancestor of homo sapiens). 
Because differences have been present for so long and survived the selective pressure they must be 
useful in some way for our cognitive processes. 

=== Differences in Anatomy and Chemistry ===

Although at first glance the two hemispheres look identically, they differ in in various 
ways. 

Concerning the anatomy, some areas are larger and the tissue contains more dendritic spines in one 
hemisphere than in the other.  An example of this is what used to be called “Broca’s area” in the left 
hemisphere. This area which is –among other things- important for speech production shows greater 
branching in the left hemisphere than in the respective right hemisphere area. Because of the left 
hemisphere’s importance for language, with which we will deal later, one can conclude that anatomical 
differences have consequences for lateralisation in function. 

Neurochemistry is another domain the hemispheres differ in: The left hemisphere is dominated by the 
neurotransmitter dopamine, whereas the right hemisphere shows higher concentrations of 
norepinephrine.  Theories suggest that modules specialised on cognitive processes are distributed over 
the brain according to the neurotransmitter needed. Thus, a cognitive function relying on dopamine 
would be located in the left hemisphere. 

===The Corpus Callosum===

The two hemispheres are interconnected via the corpus callosum, the major cortical connection. With its 
250 million nerve fibres it is like an Autobahn for neural data connecting the two hemispheres. There 
are in fact smaller connections between the hemispheres but these are little paths in comparison. All 
detailed higher order information must pass through the corpus callosum when being transferred from 
one hemisphere to the other. The transfer time, which can be measured with ERP, lies between 5 to 20 
ms.

===Historic Approaches===
	
Hemispheric specialisation has been of interest since the days of Paul Broca and Karl Wernicke, who 
discovered the importance of the left hemisphere for speech in the 1860s. Broca examined a number of 
patients who could not produce speech but whose understanding of language was not severed, whereas 
Wernicke examined patients who suffered the opposite symptoms (i.e. who could produce speech but 
did not understand anything). Both Broca and Wernicke found that their patients’ brains had damage to 
distinct areas of the left hemisphere. 

Because in these days language was seen as the cognitive process superior to all other processes, the 
left hemisphere was believed to be superior to the right which was expressed in the “cerebral 
dominance theory” developed by J.H. Jackson. The right hemisphere was seen as a “spare tire [...] 
having few functions of its own” (Banich, S.94). 
This view was not challenged until the 1930s. In this decade and the following, research dramatically 
changed this picture. Of special importance for showing the role of the right hemisphere was Sperry, 
who conducted several experiments in 1974 for which he won the Nobel Prize in Medicine and 
Physiology in 1981. 

===Experiments with Split-Brain Patients===
	
Sperry’s experiments took place with people who suffered a condition called “split brain syndrome” 
because they underwent a ''commissurotomy''. In a commissurotomy the ''corpus callosum'' is 
sectioned so that communication between the hemispheres becomes severed in these patients. With his 
pioneering experiments, Sperry wanted to find out whether the left hemisphere really plays such an 
important role in speech processing as suggested by Broca and Wernicke. 

Sperry used different experimental designs in his studies, but the basic assumption behind all 
experiments of this type was that perceptual information received at one side of the body is processed 
in the contra-lateral hemisphere of the brain. In one of the experiments the subjects had to recognise 
objects by touching it with merely one hand, while being blindfolded. He then asked the patients to 
name the object they felt and found that people could not name it when touching it with the left hand 
(which is linked to the right hemisphere). The question that arose was whether this inability was due to 
a possible function of the right hemisphere as “spare tire” or due to something else. Sperry now 
changed the design of his experiment so that patients now had to show that they recognised the 
objects  by ''using'' it the right way. For example, if they recognised a pencil they would use it to write. 
With this changed design, no difference in performance between both hands were found. 

In a different experiment conducted by Sperry et al. the patients were shown the word ''sky'' to one 
visual field and ''scraper'' to the other. They now had to draw the whole word they had seen with one 
hand. The patients were not able to synthesise this to ''skyscraper'', instead they draw a scraper 
overlapped by some cloud. Thus it was concluded that each hemisphere took control of the hand to draw 
what it had seen. 

===Experiments with Patients with other Brain-Lesions===
	
There have been other experiments conducted to gain more knowledge about hemispheric specialisation. They were
conducted with epileptic individuals who were about to receive surgery where parts of one of their 
hemispheres was going to be removed. Before the surgery started it was important to find out which 
hemisphere is responsible for speech in this individual. This was done using the ''Wada-technique', 
where barbiturate is injected into one of the arteries supplying the brain with blood. Shortly after the 
injection, the contra-lateral side of the body is paralysed. If the person is now still able to speak, the 
doped hemisphere of the brain is not responsible for speech production in this individual. With the 
results of this technique it could be estimated that 95\% of all adult right-handers use their left 
hemisphere for speech. 

Research with people who suffer brain lesions or even have a commissurotomy has some major draw 
backs: The reason why they had to undergo such surgery is usually epileptic seizures. Because of this, 
it is possible that their brains are not typical or have received damage to other areas during the 
surgery. Also, these studies have been performed with very limited numbers of subjects, so the 
statistical reliability might not be high. 

===Experiments with Neurologically Intact Individuals===
	
In addition to experiments with brain-severed patients, studies with neurologically intact individuals 
have been conducted to measure perceptual asymmetries. These are usually performed with one of 
three methods: Namely the “divided visual field technique”, “dichaptic presentation” and “dichotic 
presentation”. Each of them again has as basic assumption the fact that perceptual information received 
at one side of the body is processed in the contra-lateral hemisphere. 

[[Image:Visualfield.jpg |right|thumb|Highly simplified picture of the visual pathway.]]

The ''divided visual field technique'' is based on the fact that the visual field can be divided into the right 
(RVF) and left visual field (LVF). Each visual field is processed independently from the other in the 
contra-lateral hemisphere. The divided visual field technique includes two different experimental 
designs: The experimenter can present one picture in just one of the visual fields and then let the 
subject respond to this stimulus.  The other possibility involves showing two different pictures in each 
visual field. 

A problem that can occur using the visual field technique is that the stimulus must be presented for less 
than 200 ms because this is how long the eyes can look at one point without shifting of the visual field.

In the ''dichaptic presentation technique'' the subject is presented two objects at the same time in each 
hand. (c.f. Sperry’s experiments) 

The dichotic presentation technique enables researchers to study the processing of auditory 
information. Here, different information is presented simultaneously to each ear. 
Experiments with these techniques found that a sensory stimulus is processed 20 to 100 ms faster 
when it is initially directed to the specialised hemisphere for that task and the response is 10% more 
accurate. 

Explanations for this include three hypotheses, namely the ''direct access theory'', the ''callosal relay 
model'' and the ''activating-orienting model''. 
The direct access theory assumes that information is processed in that hemisphere to which it is initially 
directed. This may result in less accurate responses, if the initial hemisphere is the unspecialised 
hemisphere. 
The Callosal relay model states that information if initially directed to the wrong hemisphere is 
transferred to the specialised hemisphere over the corpus callosum. This transfer is time-consuming 
and is the reason for loss of information during transfer. 
The activating-orienting model assumes that a given input activates the specialised hemisphere. This 
activation then places additional attention on the contra-lateral side of the activated hemisphere, 
“making perceptual information on that side even more salient”. (Banich) 

===Common Results===
	
All the experiments mentioned above have some basic findings in common: The left hemisphere is superior at verbal tasks 
such as the processing of speech, speech production and recognition of letters whereas the right 
hemisphere excels at non-verbal tasks such as face recognition or tasks that involve spatial skills such 
as line orientation, or distinguishing different pitches of sound. This is evidence against the cerebral 
dominance theory which appointed the right hemisphere to be a spare tire! In fact both hemispheres 
are distinct and outclass at different tasks, and neither one can be omitted without this having high 
impact on cognitive performance. 

Although the hemispheres are so distinct and  are experts at their assigned functions, they also have 
limited abilities in performing the tasks for which the other hemisphere is specialised. In the picture 
above is an overview which hemisphere gives raise to what ability. 

===Differences in Processing===
	
[[Image:Localandglobalprocessing.jpg|right|thumb| Experiment on local and global processing with 
patients with left- or right-hemisphere damage]] 

There are two sets of approaches to the question of hemispheric specialisation. One set of 
theories is about the topic by asking the question “What tasks is each hemisphere specialised for?”. 
Theories that belong to this set, assign the different levels of ability to process sensory information to 
the different levels of abilities for higher cognitive skills.  One theory that belongs to this set is the 
“spatial frequency hypothesis”.  This hypothesis states that the left hemisphere is important for fine 
detail analysis and high spatial frequency in visual images whereas the right hemisphere is important 
for low spatial frequency. 
We have pursued this approach above. 

The other approach does not focus on what type of information is processed by each hemisphere but 
rather on ''how'' each hemisphere processes information. This set of theories assumes that the left 
hemisphere processes information in an analytic, detail- and function-focused way and that it places 
more importance on temporal relations between information, whereas the right hemisphere is believed  
to go about the processing of information in a holistic way, focusing on spatial relations and on 
appearance rather than on function. 

The picture above shows an exemplary response to different target stimuli in an experiment on global 
and local processing with patients who suffer right- or left-hemisphere damage. Patients with damage 
to the right hemisphere often suffer a lack of attention to the global form, but recognise details with no 
problem. For patients with left-hemisphere-damage this is true the other way around. 
This experiment supports the assumption that the hemispheres differ in the way they process information.

===Interaction of the Hemispheres===
	
Why is the transfer between the hemispheres needed at all if the hemispheres are so distinct concerning functioning, anatomy, 
chemistry and the transfer results in degrading of quality of information and takes time? The reason is 
that the hemispheres, although so different, do interact. This interaction has important advantages  
because as studies by Banich and Belger have shown it may “enhance the overall processing capacity 
under high demand conditions” (Banich). (Under low demand conditions the transfer does not make as 
much sense because the cost  of transferring the information to the other hemisphere are higher than 
the advantages of parallel processing.) 

The two hemispheres can interact over the corpus callosum in different ways. This is measured by first 
computing performance of each hemisphere individually and then measuring the overall performance of 
the whole brain. In some tasks one hemisphere may dominate the other in the overall performance, so 
the overall performance is as good or bad as the performance of one of the single hemispheres. What’s 
surprising is that the dominating hemisphere may very well be the one that is less specialised, so here 
is another example of a situation where parallel processing is less effective than processing in just one 
half of the brain. 

Another way of how the hemispheres interact is that overall processing is an average of performance of 
the two individual hemispheres. 

The third, most surprising way the hemispheres can interact is that when performing a task together 
the hemispheres behave totally different than when performing the same task individually. This can be 
compared to social behavior of people: Individuals behave different in groups than they would when 
being by themselves. 

===Individual Factors Influencing Lateralisation===
	
After having looked at hemispheric specialisation from a general point of view, we now want to focus on 
differences between individuals concerning hemispheric specialisation. Aspects that may have an impact on lateralisation might be age, gender or handed-ness. 

'''Age''' could be one factor which decides in how far each hemisphere is used at specific tasks. 
Researchers have suggested that lateralisation develops with age until puberty. Thus infants should not 
have functionally-lateralised brains. Here are four pieces of evidence that speak against this hypothesis: 

Infants already show the same brain anatomy as adults. This means the brain of a new born is already 
lateralised. Following the hypothesis that anatomy is linked to function this means that lateralisation is 
not developed at a later period in life. 

Differences in perceptual asymmetries that means superior performance at processing verbal vs. non- 
verbal material in the different hemispheres cannot be observed in children aged 5 to 13, i.e. children 
aged 5 process the material the same way 13 year olds do. 

Experiments with 1-week-old infants showed that they responded with increased interest to verbal 
material when this was presented to the right ear than when presented to the left ear and increased 
interest to non-verbal material when presented to the left ear. The infants’ interest was hereby 
measured by the frequency of soother sucking. 

Although children who underwent hemispherectomy (the surgical removal of one hemisphere) do 
develop the cognitive skills of the missing hemisphere (in contrast to adults or adolescents who can 
only partly compensate for missing brain parts), they do not develop these skills to the same extent as 
a child with hemispherectomy of the other hemisphere. For example: A child whose right hemisphere 
has been removed will develop spatial skills but not to the extent that a  child whose left hemisphere 
has been removed, and thus still possesses the right hemisphere. 

'''Handedness''' is another factor that might influence brain lateralisation. There is statistical evidence 
that left-handers have a different brain organisation than right-handers. 10% of the population is left-handed. Whereas 95% of the right-handed people process verbal material in a superior manner in the 
left-hemisphere, there is no such a high figure for verbal superiority of one hemisphere in left-handers: 
70% of the left-handers process verbal material in the left-hemisphere, 15% process verbal material in 
the right hemisphere (the functions of the hemispheres are simply switched around), and the 
remaining 15% are not lateralised, meaning that they process language in both hemispheres. 
Thus as a group, left-handers seem to be less lateralised. However a single left-handed-individual can 
be just as lateralised as the average right-hander. 

'''Gender''' is also an aspect that is believed to have impact on the hemispheric specialisation.  In 
animal studies, it was found that hormones create brain differences between the genders that are 
related to reproductional functions. In humans it is hard to determine to which extent it is really 
hormones that cause differences and to which extent it is culture and schooling that are responsible. 

One brain area for which a difference between the genders was observed is the corpus callosum. 
Although one study found that the c.c. is larger in women than in men these results could not be 
replicated. Instead it was found that the posterior part of the c.c. is more bulbous in women than in 
men. This might however be related to the fact that the average woman has a smaller brain than the 
average man and thus the bulbousness of the posterior section of the c.c. might be related to brain size 
and not to gender. 

In experiments that measure performance in various tasks between the genders the cultural aspect is 
of great importance because men and women might use different problem solving strategies due to 
schooling.

===Summary===

Although the two hemispheres look like each other’s mirror images at first glance, this impression is 
misleading. Taking a closer look, the hemispheres not only differ in their conformation and chemistry, but 
most importantly in their function. Although both hemispheres can perform all basic cognitive tasks, 
there exists a specialisation for specific cognitive demands. In most people, the left hemisphere is an 
expert at verbal tasks, whereas the right hemisphere has superior abilities in non-verbal tasks. 
Despite the functional distinctness the hemispheres communicate with each other via the corpus 
callosum. 

This fact has been utilised by Sperry’s experiments with split-brain-patients. These are outstanding 
among other experiments measuring perceptual asymmetries because they were the first experiments 
to refute the hemispheric dominance theory and received recognition through the Nobel Prize for 
Medicine and Physiology. 

Individual factors such as age, gender or handed-ness have no or very little impact on  hemispheric 
functioning.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: tremelo → tremolo (2) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to be able to utilize self-accompaniment feature of Harmonica, one should learn the tongue block embrochure; all self accompaniment techniques, whether it was by chord (European tremolo and 10-holes) or merely enriching (Asian tremolo and chromatic) is conducted with the movement of the tongue.


&lt;!-- Rear accompaniment: Sounding the accompaniment after the melodic sound occur; help push the song forward.
forward accompaniment: Sounding the accompaniment at the same time as the melodic note; create a sombre mood
Mid-point accompaniment: Sounding the accompaniment right between the note; provide an active, joyous feeling; good for Taiwanese folksong
--&gt;

==Open Chord Accompaniment==
The concept of open chord is simple:
#Your mouth will stretch over three to four holes (five to seven holes for tremolo), with the right most hole being the melodic note. the reason for stretching over this much is that, by definition, chord is made up of two or more notes.
#Make sure that your tongue is hovering above the left most holes, so that some small amount of air can flow into those holes. Play the chord and melodic note together.
Yes, it is simple. However, do keep in mind that this method is more musically accurate if playing on diatonic tunings (European tremolo and blues harp). However, this is a common technique employed over at Asia, where their tremolo is scale tune. Thus, if Solo/scale tuning is used, one should use it where the effect is constructive, or least destructive., to the entire piece.

==Slap== &lt;!---- Forth accompaniment----&gt;
During normal tongue block, your lips should cover four holes, with your tongue blocking the three holes on the left. If you blow or draw first, then quickly slap the tongue over the 3 holes. If done softly, this can serve well as accompaniment, but done quickly, it will have a percussive effect.

The result is basically sounding the accompaniment before or at the same time as the melodic note.

==Vamp==
Vamp can be seen as an opposite of slap: during playing of a single note, pull the tongue back, which will sound the chord, then follow by placing the tongue back on the mouthpiece '''softly'''. If not done softly, this will become a hammer. This is also known as the pull.

Sounding the accompaniment after the melodic sound occur; help push the song forward.

==Hammer==
If the pull slap is used rapidly, it becomes a hammer. The tonal property makes it very highly percussive.

==Octave self-accompaniment==
{{chapter stub}}

==Drone==
Drones are sustained notes that forms the main harmonica-structure of the melody; usually, but not always, played in notes lower than the melody's note. 

To be musically correct, the drone note usually consists of notes of the tonic of the piece, especially the root and the fifth. Sometimes they are even played together. However, it is quite often to merely use ANY notes for drones. 

On a harmonica, this can be done by combining techniques of octave and embrochure-variation techniques such that one note stay as drone while the other is played as the melodic note.

Since there are blow and draw in harmonica, the best notes to use are the notes they appeared in both blow and draw. On a '''Blues harp''', the note is the fifth note of the harmonica's key, which is in draw-2 and blow-3; this is because the note exist in both the second-hole draw and third-hole blow, allowing the drone exist for the entire duration.

For chromatic, there's a few options:
*'''Standard chromatic''', by treating the B# as being the same note as C, and the E# as F, one can play the following:
**C
:'''Blow (slide out)''': C(same octave), E, G, C (octave higher)
:'''Draw (slide in)''': Eb, Gb, Bb, C(octave higher)
**F
:'''Blow (slide in)''': Ab, Db(x2), F(octave higher)
:'''Draw (slide out)''': A, B, D, F(octave higher)
This more or less give a C-keyed Blues scale in drone of C, and A-keyed blues scale in drone of F.
*'''Classical-tuned''', it still have the drone of F. With the drone of C, one can play musics in the key of C major.
*'''Bebop tuned''', the drone in the key of F, in now blow(slide in), will accompany Ab, B, Db, and F. Drone of C will involve shifting to the next register during blow and thus no more accompanying of the same C note, but other wise identical.
*'''Irish tuned''': By treating Cb as B and Fb as E, one can accompany the following:
**B
:'''Blow (Slide in)''':B(same octave), Eb, Gb, B (octave higher)
:'''Draw (Slide out)''': D, F, A, B (octave higher)
**E
:'''Blow (slide out)''': G, C(x2), E (octave higher)
:'''Draw (slide in)''': Ab, Bb, Db, E (octave higher)

Additionally, since with tongue block, one can bend one note while keeping the other note straight, opening up even more possibilities.

== Where to get my unicycle ==
Unicycles may be purchased or ordered from your local bicycle store, 
although this is usually hit or miss. 
They may also be purchased online at

== What kind of Unicycle? ==
There are hundreds of unicycles to choose from. Consider what you want to do. The best way in my opinion is to get a beginner unicycle that is cheap or a used one on ebay. Learn the basics(forward, backwards, idle etc.) then decide what you really want to do. Freestyle, Muni, Trials, long distance, racing, B.C. wheel, or Ultimate wheel and go from there.

;Freestyle
:For freestyle the wheel should be 20&quot; and the tire 2 - 2.25 inches thick. 24 inch is OK but not the best for the serious freestyle unicyclist. Freestyle is often done indoors so you may want a tire that does not mark floors easily. Square forks are preferred since it makes it easy to prop your foot on for 1-foot skills. Nimbus is now making frames that the seat adjustment is right below the seat. This is nice when doing tricks where your legs are close to your seat post although it is not a must. A fairly thin saddle with a handle on the front is preferred.

;Muni
:For muni a 24/26 inch wheel set with around a 2.3-3 inches wide tire. The cranks should be fairly long for more leverage.

;Trials
:Trials unicycles normally have a big 20x2.5&quot; tire (this is often referred to as a 19&quot; tire as it doesn't fit a standard 20&quot; rim) for absorbing drops and to give plenty of bounce for jumping. Trials unicycles need strong hub and cranks to cope with the abuse they get, splined cranks are good. Then it is a trade off between price versus weight versus strength. There are several manufacturers making trials unicycles, Kris Holm are agreed to be the best, there is also Torker (heavy but cheap), Qu-Ax (not as heavy as Torker but reasonably priced), Koxx (lots of street cred. and choice of colours), Onza and Nimbus. There are Taiwanese unicycles that look like trials unicycles with Luna tires and DX rims - don't buy these as they have really weak hubs that aren't suitable for trials unicycling. Most trials unicycles have saddles with a handle at the front.

;Long Distance
:For long distance you want a big wheel i.e. 28&quot;, 29&quot; or 36&quot; and a comfortable saddle. Sun 28&quot; are very cheap but not very strong, Torker 29 are reasonably priced, Nimbus 29 are pretty good . The Coker 36 and QU-AX 36 are ok but you will need to upgrade the saddle ad probably more, the Nimbus 36 is best 36&quot; available especially with the T7 handle and Aluminum rim.

;Racing
:If you intend to race you will need to check the [http://unicycling.org/iuf/ IUF Rules] for the current wheel size and crank length allowed. Depending what race you are entering, you will probably want the lightest unicycle possible.

;B.C. Wheel
:A B.C. wheel (also known as an impossible wheel) is one where you balance on an extended axle of the wheel, for learning purposes people often first learn to balance on plates hung below the axle. It is best to use a wheel with a strong axle (at least 14mm). The two most popular B.C. wheel makes are the Bedford Impossible Wheel and the Nimbus Impossible Wheel.

;Ultimate Wheel
:For an ultimate wheel get at least a 24 inch or larger wheel. You can make your own ultimate wheel by fitting a sheet of wood into a bicycle wheel and attaching pedals to it. You can buy steel spoked ultimate wheels made by Semcycle or Aluminium Spoked ultimate wheels made by Nimbus Unicycles.

== Which brands are best ==
In USA Torker makes good strong cheap unicycles. If you live in Canada you should check out Bedford Unicycles. If you live in Europe you should check out the local unicycle.com shops in UK, Germany, Denmark (unisalg.dk) and Sweden.

Good beginner unicycles are cheap and should have 20&quot; or 24&quot; tires. QU-AX, Torker and Sun are best known for their beginner unicycles. 

Good freestyle unicycles have short cranks, 20&quot; tires that are thin and smooth, and long necks. Miyata, Nimbus and Semcycle make the best freestyle unicycles.

The bigger the wheel, the faster your unicycle will go. For unicycles with very big wheels meant for long distance riding, you should check out Coker, Nimbus and Qu-Ax.

For trials, street and Muni , a strong unicycle is needed. These unicycles should have shorter necks and longer cranks, and should have strong parts such as splined hubs. Splined are special types of cranks and hubs which are hooked together with a bunch of notches rather than a square taper, which is not as strong. Splined setups are much more expensive than square taper, but will last much longer. Examples of splined cranks and hubs are Kris Holm/Onza, Kris Holm ISIS, Onza ISIS, Profile, Nimbus ISIS and Koxx-One. For trials and street most people use a 20&quot; rear trials wheel setup, but for Muni you will need a wheel size of 24&quot; or larger.

Another important thing to consider when buying a unicycle is the seat. Many seats that come with cheap unicycles are uncomfortable. Consider a Koxx-One, Nimbus, Kris Holm or Miyata seat.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)/Level 17]] ==

I noticed your new book at [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)]]. I hope that you make it into a useful instructional resource.

There are two things that you should be aware:
* There is a '''[[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]'''. Because Wikibooks has so many books, we require new books, in the wiki page names, to use the book name followed by a slash: &quot;Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)/&quot;. This provides an automatic link from each subpage to the main page of the book. I decided to move your &quot;Lolo 2J-L17&quot; module to [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)/Level 17]], then deleted the redirect; the link on your [[User:Sivak]] page is now broken.
* Other users need to be able to find your book, otherwise its useless. For new books, you should advertise then on the &quot;New Wikibooks&quot; section of the [[Main Page]]. I have already done this for the [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)]] book. However, I suggest you also put the book on the '''[[Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf]]''' &amp;ndash; you can go there now and add it.

Thanks for contributing to Wikibooks, --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:47, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

== Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese) ==

I think that's a great idea...That's what WikiBooks is about- providing detailed information. People do put walkthroughs on here, and the Lolo series definitely deserves to have some. The Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japan) and The Adventures of Lolo 3 (Western) were really difficult games. You are working on writing the walkthrough for the Japanese version, correct? This game is actually quite different, and aside from having the same story/worldmap, the game has many different mazes. I look forward to watching its progress! --[[User:Yahweh divine|Brahman]] 01:24, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

== Re: Templates vs. screenshots ==

Upon [[User talk:Kernigh]], you asked about whether templates-tiles or screenshots were better for [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)]]. Personally, I prefer the template and tiles, though those are apparently more work to set up. There might be other users who like the screenshots better.

Meanwhile, I should warn you that several Wikibooks users decided to move the video game guides off of Wikibooks (which is more a collection of textbooks than a gaming wiki). For example, the [[NetHack]] book that I used to work on is now http://strategywiki.net/wiki/NetHack instead. The moves seem to be mostly going well, though there seems to be some confusion over the [[RuneScape]] guide. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:21, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

=== Getting trace data from umbraco ===

You can get a complete stack trace from umbraco, by appending 
&quot;?umbDebugShowTrace=true&quot; to the querystring. This include data on all actions inside umbraco from the initial request to the final response, including what page data has been loaded and what data has been sent to macro parameters.

=== Getting data sent to macro elements ===

You can get see a list of macro elements sent to an XSLT macro by appending 
&quot;?umbDebug=true&quot; to the querystring

=== Production systems ===

This feature can be turned off for production systems by setting umbracoDebugMode to false in web.config.

The following example is from ISAPI rewrite's http.ini:

&lt;pre&gt;
RewriteRule  /.*umbDebugShowTrace.*$ /default.aspx
RewriteRule  /.*umbDebug.*$ /default.aspx

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rewrite ==
I have completely rewritten this policy because I think it was outdated and unpractical. The main difference is that I suggest not to name pages like: ''Book'' (cover) and ''Book/TOC'' but: ''Book/Cover'' and ''Book'' (TOC). Why? It's because of our current naming policy. Every backlink from book chapter is pointing to ''Book''. If this would be cover page, reader would have to click one more time to see the TOC (which was his or her intention when clicking this backlink). One more unneccesary click, one more page load (and we should remember that cover pages contain large images and are not small most of times).

I put pressure on categories and interwikis issues which were not covered in the old version. I think it's logical to put those things on cover page, not TOC.

Another thing is that old version was enfocing every book to have cover page. I don't think it is neccessary, there are lots of books that are very small and does often not contain table of contents and separate chapters. I think that it should be if choice of book authors whether to create a cover page, but pattern of such page should be enforced, so that interwikis were not put on TOC etc.

Last this is this policy name - I suggest changing it from ''Title pages'' to ''Cover pages'', as it would be more appropriate in current shape of the policy. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:47, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

:Good work. Unfortunately the examples are not as exemplary as we might like. Is there any chance of you &quot;mocking up&quot; a book called &quot;Title Example&quot; so that the structure is clear? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:31, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

I'm not sure I like the idea of this as a policy, but keeping it as a good idea - maybe somewhere in the help namespace, would be useful, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
: Agreed. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:47, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

:I also agree. No sense trying to make this into an official policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:45, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

== Guideline proposal ==

=== Broadening the scope ===
Should the scope of this guideline be made a bit broader to encompass the general structure of book pages (even be integrated into [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]])?

I think other topics that could be made official (some of these would be mere suggestions) are navigation, contents or page lists, linking to bookshelves, print and PDF versions, etc.

It might end up at someplace like [[Wikibooks:Book structure]] or even go in the Manual of Style. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:18, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

:The idea to merge this into the Manual of style is, i think, a good one. There is no particular need to create a policy or a guideline for this material, when it can be better suited in the manual instead. If we move this one to '''rejected''', then I will personally handle the merger, if needed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:59, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

:: OK, sounds good. Won't the added content to the MoS need some discussion, though? Actually, the whole thing could use a rewrite! Oh, dear... --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:40, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

:::MoS is just a guideline, and I think that if we get consensus here, that should be enough to add material to that guideline, so long as we don't remove or change any existing material from there. There are lots of things on wikibooks that need to be rewritten, the MoS is a good example, and I see that you have already started on [[WB:PAG]] as well. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:28, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

:::: Good enough for me. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 00:20, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

===Comments/votes on guideline===
'''Oppose'''. I saw Whiteknight's link to this at the Staff Lounge, so I gather we're voting on this...? Personally I don't like cover pages - they seem like a waste of time, when I really want to see the content. Someone else has expressed the same view at [[Help:How To Build An Excellent Wikibook Teaching Any Language#Splash/Intro Screen]]. So my preferred policy would be &quot;Don't use title pages&quot; (though I won't jump up and down about it). Your work is appreciated, though, Whiteknight - good to discuss and resolve these things. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 15:08, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

: Well, according to the schedule given, this policy/guideline is up for discussion this week, ending on Sunday. In the previous section, it was suggested that it actually belongs well as part of the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] and Whiteknight offered to merge it. The Manual will be reviewed at some point in the future.
: As for the splash intro (such as in [[William Shakespeare's Works]]), I agree with you that they are disruptive. Cover pages (such as in [[Circuit Theory]], an all-round well set up book) are, however, good for inclusion in the [[Circuit Theory/All Chapters|print version]]. I didn't understand the proposal as advocating the former, but certainly the latter. (given that Whiteknight is the most prominent contributor to Circuit Theory, I think we can count on him to include the good parts of this proposal in merging with the Manual of style &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt;) --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 17:20, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
::Your comments about [[Circuit Theory]] warm my heart, thanks Swift! I personally think that title pages are absolutely useless outside of a print version. However, if books are going to be printed, it certainly makes good sense to include a cover for the book (or else let people use whatever cover they want). I also agree that splash images are a big waste. They are a drain on server resources, and actually make it more difficult to navigate around a book. If we merge this into the MoS, then it becomes less like a guideline, and more like a &quot;suggestion&quot;, and people can ignore it if they can think of a better way to do things. I think everybody would be happy to have that kind of freedom. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:45, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

== Bookshelves point to Cover??? ==

This guide says that the bookshelf listings should point to the cover of the book, but every bookshelf listing I've seen points to the table of contents or the main page.  I edited this article to reflect this but the change was reverted as &quot;arbitrary.&quot; [[User:Unixxx|Unixxx]] 07:41, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
: Well, it should not be this way. The cover page main purpose is to be seen before the table of contents, as an introduction. And there are examples of correctly linked books: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=How_To_Assemble_A_Desktop_PC%2FCover]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:23, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
::The purpose of accepting this guideline is to say &quot;this is the way things should be done&quot;, which is not necessarily the way things currently ''are done''. Also, saying that something ''should'' be done, does not necessarily mean that it ''will be done'' correctly. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:51, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;Rejected&quot; guideline ==

Should this page be descripted as a &quot;rejected guideline&quot;? In fact it is not, because it has been accepted and merged into an official guideline. I suggest removing this page if it is no longer needed. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 07:48, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

:I marked it that way because the text of this guideline is no longer needed, and future changes to the guideline should be made at the manual of style, not here. In essence, this ''form'' of the guideline was rejected. If you feel that this page is redundant, you can definately delete it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 11:29, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

&lt;s&gt; The Unreal ED pages that you created are not linked from any book. See [[Special:Prefixindex/Unreal_ED]] for all the pages. I suggest that you create a book or add the pages to an existing book. &lt;/s&gt; I see that the book was deleted over a month ago. Apparently the admin didn't delete subpages yet.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

If your application becomes quite big, you may have lots of classes. Although you can browse them in their alphabetic order, it becomes confusing. So your application classes can be sorted into ''packages''.

A package is a name space that mainly contains classes and interfaces. For instance, the standard class &lt;code&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt; is in the package &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt;. For this class, &lt;code&gt;java.util.ArrayList&lt;/code&gt; is called its ''fully qualified name'' because this syntax has no ambiguity. Classes in different packages can have the same name. For example, you have the two classes &lt;code&gt;java.util.Date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Date&lt;/code&gt; which are not the same. If no package is declared in a class, its package is the default package.

== Package declaration ==
In a class, a package is declared at the top of the source code using the keyword {{java:package}}:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-14&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.14: BusinessClass.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
package business;

public class BusinessClass {
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

If your class is declared in a package, say &lt;code&gt;business&lt;/code&gt;, your class must be placed in a subfolder called &lt;code&gt;business&lt;/code&gt; from the root of your application folder. This is how the compiler and the class loader find the Java files on the file system. You can declare your class in a subpackage, say &lt;code&gt;engine&lt;/code&gt;. So the full package is &lt;code&gt;business.engine&lt;/code&gt; and the class must be placed in a subsubfolder called &lt;code&gt;engine&lt;/code&gt; in the subfolder &lt;code&gt;business&lt;/code&gt; (not in a folder called &lt;code&gt;business.engine&lt;/code&gt;).

== Import and class usage ==
The simpliest way to use a class declared in a package is to prefix the class name with its package:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.88: Package declaration.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
business.BusinessClass myBusinessClass = new business.BusinessClass();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

If you are using the class from a class in the same package, you don't have to specify the package. If another class with the same name exists in another package, it will use the local class.

The syntax above is a bit verbose. You can import the class by using the {{java:import}} Java keyword at the top of the file and then only specify its name:

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-15&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.15: MyClass.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
import business.BusinessClass;

public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    BusinessClass myBusinessClass = new BusinessClass();
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Note that you can't import two classes with the same name in two different packages.

The classes &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; belongs to the package &lt;code&gt;java.lang&lt;/code&gt; but they don't need to be imported as the &lt;code&gt;java.lang&lt;/code&gt; package is implicitly imported in all classes.

== Wildcard imports ==

It is possible to import an entire package, using an asterisk:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.89: Wildcard imports.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
import javax.swing.*;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

While it may seem convenient, it may cause problems if you make a typographical error.  For example, if you use the above import to use JFrame, but then type &lt;code&gt;JFraim frame = new JFraim();&lt;/code&gt;, the Java compiler will report an error similar to &quot;Cannot find symbol: JFraim&quot;.  Even though it seems as if it was imported,  the compiler is giving the error report at the first mention of JFraim, which is half-way through your code, instead of the point where you imported JFrame along with everything else in javax.swing.

If you change this to &lt;code&gt;import javax.swing.JFraim;&lt;/code&gt; the error will be at the import instead of within your code.

Furthermore, if you &lt;code&gt;import javax.swing.*;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;import java.util.*;&lt;/code&gt;, and javax.swing.Queue is later added in a future version of Java, your code that uses Queue (java.util) will fail to compile.  This particular example is fairly unlikely, but if you are working with non-Oracle libraries, it may be more likely to happen.

== Package convention ==
A package name should start with a lower character. This eases to distinguish a package from a class name. In some operating systems, the directory names are not case sensitive. So package names should be lowercase.

The Java package needs to be unique across Vendors to avoid name collisions. For that reason Vendors usually use their domain name in reverse order. That is guaranteed to be unique.  For example a company called ''Your Company Inc.'', would use a package name something like this: &lt;code&gt;com.yourcompany.yourapplicationname.yourmodule.YourClass&lt;/code&gt;.

== Importing packages from .jar files ==
If you are importing library packages or classes that reside in a &lt;code&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; file, you must ensure that the file is in the current classpath (both at compile- and execution-time).  Apart from this requirement, importing these packages and classes is the same as if they were in their full, expanded, directory structure.

For example, to compile and run a class from a project's top directory (that contains the two directories &lt;code&gt;/source&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/libraries&lt;/code&gt;) you could use the following command:

{{XCode|1='''Compilation'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ javac -classpath libraries/lib.jar source/MainClass.java
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

And then to run it, similarly:

{{XCode|1='''Execution'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java -classpath libraries/lib.jar source/MainClass
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

The above is simplified, and demands that &lt;code&gt;MainClass&lt;/code&gt; be in the default package, or a package called &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt;, which isn't very desirable.

== Class loading/package ==
The runtime identity of a class in Java is defined by the fully qualified class name and its defining class loader. This means that the same class, loaded by two different class loaders, is seen by the Virtual Machine as two completely different types.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== CS function definintion and usage ==

After reading this article I was a little confused. If the top examples of EnterCS and ExitCS disable and enable the scheduler respectively, then their usage in the preemptive critical example indicates and a second task could not successfully call malloc since the EnterCS and ExitCS will disbale the scheduler ? Am I missing something ?

--imwhitey 11:46, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

Yes, you are missing the fact that ExitCS *enables* the scheduler.
After that, then (eventually) the scheduler will get around to run the second task, and it will successfully call malloc.
Does it make sense now?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Proposal for policy overhaul ==

As an interested user in the direction of Wikibooks over the [[Biography of Nikola Tesla]] debacle, you might be interested to know that I've started to think about changes to existing policy and project scope so that policies are more clearly defined (as suggested by [[User:Aya]], who claims existing policies to be ambiguous) and more open (as you suggested).  I've made a post on textbook-l ([http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-July/002415.html]) as a result, please reply to my talk page for feedback.

== Thanks ==

Thanks for helping out with fixing the recent vandalism. BTW, I moved your alert to the top of the list where it's supposed to be.;) It's a bit confusing, because the link spam section has its newest entries added to the bottom (that's to save space), and the ass puss section is only really a summary. If you want to get the administrators' attention, then it's best to do it by the book.

Oh yeah, thanks for supporting my nomination for adminship.:) I thought that I only needed at least four votes for to one against to succeed. But, it looks like it needs to be at least 8 for to 1 against and one abstaining.

I'm responding here even though you wrote me at Wikipedia. Hope that's okay.

Anyway, believe me, no harm done, especially personally, on all our discussion. I'm not despising you or anything. We just disagreed on how to implement things. I see no problem in being friendly. Personally, I'd rather work over at Wikibooks and may shift here for the bulk of my editing. Wikipedia has millions of people doing millions of little things and a lot of stuff turns to garbage. I welcome your instruction on how to restructure the book. I'd like to get some quality work going and not just have a jumbled mess of articles (with only a WikiProject for organization) like on Wikipedia. Please explain over on my Talk page if you can about how you see the structure of a Wikibook. Uncle_G is who designed the structure to begin and I just went with it. I see how it can become a Macropedia and that's no good. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 13:25, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

== Re: [[Wikiversity]] ==

I was just re-reading your post on my talk page, and noticed a bit which I must have missed before:

''Wikiversity has been an integral part of Wikibooks from the beginning and was one of the parts of the original proposal for Wikibooks. Indeed, Wikibooks was supposed to be the adjunct auxiallary &quot;library&quot; for Wikiversity, essentially Wikibooks was a sub-project to Wikiversity, not the other way around. Wikibooks, on the other hand, was easier to implement in the beginning.''

I can't find anything which would suggest that this is the case. Perhaps you could point me to the right place? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:13, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

== Muggles Guide true home ==

Hi, thanks for getting back. Why do I feel I am drowning in politics when all I wanted to do was find out what had happened to the larger part of the content of the articles about HP? I do not know what is going on at ‘pedia. I was not particularly concerned about HP to begin with, just read the book, looked elsewhere to see what other people thought about it, and then looked to see what wiki had got. Noticed some factual details which I suspect are important to the overall plot were incorrect. Noticed that the long plot descriptions had disappeared. What the fuck? People were being asked to remove details, certainly details that were not absolutely cast-iron, and were not interested in complex discussions.  So then what? Zap! A VFD on the stuff which was dumped here.

Before my few posts I knew nothing about wikibooks, not that I know the rules of ‘pedia either, though I am beginning to get a feel of the politics. So I don’t really know whether ‘books considers something HPish to be appropriate. The situation would seem to completely contravene the rather short rules you have. Any book is either going to have to reproduce what is already on ‘pedia, or operate in partnership with it. To the extent that it reproduces ‘pedia, it will certainly be an encyclopedia itself. It may even be a better encyclopedia if it gets organized and cross referenced properly. Or it might become the appendix/speculative part of the HP articles on ‘pedia. Neither of these seems to fall within your rules.

Against this, I have looked at a few of the books about fiction you already have. They are not very impressive. If this worked at all, it would be massively bigger. Any logical extension of one of these smaller articles would inevitably drive it towards becoming  what I understand by the use here of ‘macropedic’. It seems to describe a book which has detailed articles on every facet of something. Which is what such a commentary must logically become. You would have to start by defining the realities of the book (such a character appears here, does this…) and only then can realistically go on to discuss why he might have done that, how it fits with other characters, and so on. So I think you realistically have to create a macropedia structure first. And ultimately would still end up with one. Where is my understanding of macropedia incorrect?

So despite the VFD and this book still existing, I am a little bemused at working on something which strikes me too as being outside your apparent rules. (yes, ok, I mean you plural). It seems I agree with you (singular) on this. I noted some other posts about altering rules, so maybe someone is thinking about this? But it still feels like the entire thing could disappear in a month or two, when the nice encyclopedic content from ‘pedia has been integrated. 

Parallels with witchcraft, and sources which JKR may have drawn on might be interesting, but I think it would be very much harder to find editors competent to talk about that, than those with excellent knowledge of every page of the books. [[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] 22:29, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

== Wikiversity project proposal ==

I've been trying to find the objections/problems people had with wikiversity that you mentioned-  are they all on http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wikiversity on meta?  Meta is a bit of a mess to find anything, I'm afraid.  I don't think many of them are too bad, many of them are 2 years old.  But to allay them anyway, I wrote a Wikiversity about similar to wikibooks about, and put it up on the wikibooks talk page.  If there's no objections to it, I plan on referncing it in a few days on meta.  The about page can be found at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity:About  

I'm a little lost at whats going on and who needs to be convinced at Meta, and I'm unfortunately time limited for a few weeks as well.  Is there anything I can do or anyone I can talk to to help out?

== Printable wikibooks ==

Hello, I'm interested in making wikibooks printable and I noticed that you made a PDF version for wikijunior solar system. That's really good and I'm glad to see that sometone is making an effort towards that direction. I would like to automate the process and I think I will right a program to do it. Did you convert the wikibook manually, or idi you use some software to achieve it? Thanks,

== Serial Data Communications ==

Thanks for your comments on my editing style.  I ''am'' new to the Wiki tools and the Wiki community.  I was thinking of sort of scrawling in the margins without messing up the &quot;reading&quot; view.  But questions go in discussion. I'll pick up more on standard practice, and on preferences of projects' progeniters and core groups.

Anyway, I like your response to one of my questions -- simple, direct.  &quot;Educational Environment&quot; = &quot;University Course&quot; (not in-house training or a [http://www.onlc.com/netpro.htm course from a vender], etc).  If the books out there don't cover the subject &quot;soup to nuts&quot;, or are poorly written, it sounds like this is a thouroughly needed book.  Or three, to judge from the contributed content.

I am not an expert in Serial Data Communications.  I '''think''' I can help improve readability.  What I did to your book was a little bit of &quot;drive-by editing&quot;.  Which was only a bunch of questions since I didn't know the answers.  I'm sure that can be annoying.  Please let me know if you think I am not helping to move this book toward your vision for it.

Umm, I don't know if this is the best place to ask for help, but you're one of the authors of the 'wikijunior ancient civilization' book, so I thought i'd ask you. I just wrote some stuff for the egyptian section titled 'what did they eat?', but the font sizing is all wrong and I was wondering if you could please fix it. It's 3 in the morning right now and I can't seem too figure out how to do it myself. Time to hit the sack, I guess :) (Also, I got all the info from 2 websites. I didn't copy and paste, but I also did not know all these things beforehand. I just researched the info and wrote on it, like I would do for a school report. Is that ok? Or do I have to cite my sources??) Thanx.  --[[User:EnaamA|EnaamA]] 07:19, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

== NeoRandom Chess ==

Robert thank you for your positive response. I don't have any intend to fight as you might think. With [[NeoRandom Chess]] addition I just wanted to point it out that there are some flaws in your(?) [[User:Robert Horning/New Policies|NeoPolicies]] :). I see problems in paragraphs nr. 1., 2., and 9. I think such additions mentioned there just needs to be marked with the proper Category and later moved as mentioned in paragraph nr. 4. It's funny to read discussions about articles like [[The Manual of Crime]] where I break more rules with ''my'' chess variant. I will not rename or move NeoRandom Chess ''WikiBook'', but I will use NeoRandom name for this chess variant now and in the future. You want to try NeoRandom Chess? Well, now you can, even in new [http://wikisophia.org/wiki/User:Igor/NeoRandom_Chess MediaWiki]! Think about this! With respect. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:00, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

Please go to [[m:Wikijunior project name]] and vote for a name in the Wikimedia children's project.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

==Wikiversity vote==

Well, its Nov 1, the wikiversity vote should be closing.  Are you in charge of counting the votes?  Ignoring the link in you user page rule, we have an easy 75.5%.  Including that rule, we're actually a close call at 68.9% (111 valid ayes to 50 valid nays).  I did not actually look at everyone's user page, I just subtracted those with red user name links.  Anything I can do so far as publishing the information or next steps go?

:Bleh, both months have a ber in them, whats the difference? :)  Besides, I use the Julian calendar, I don't cotton to that August thingy you guys use.  

:Sorry, write it off as anticipation.  I can think of one thing I can do(and will do later this week when I have time).  Chances are that the Ayes without names use the same user name at either wikipedia, wikibooks, wikinews, or wiktionary.  I can leave messages for them there telling them their vote won't count unless they fix it, and how to do so.  If we can pick up 10-20% of the striken votes like that it would be a nice padding. Although I am sure the board will take into account the striken votes at any rate, it wouldn't hurt to have it. Hmm, maybe I can write a perl script to do the messaging for me.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 22:54, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

== &quot;About gravity, mass, and weight&quot; module in Wikijunior Solar System book ==

Thank you for your response to my request for comment on this module and the contributions you've made since.   Would you mind if I proposed on the talk page that you or someone other than myself or Metric1000 use it as the basis for the module? I see you've already made contributions to the wikibook and may not have the time to do so yourself at present, so I don't want to assume you will or put you in the position of having to say &quot;no&quot; unnecessarily.

I realise my suggestion might be in vain as it appears Metric1000's additions to the talk page continue to be unconstructive in both content and manner. I would at least like, however, to indicate that your approach may be a way forward.

Thanks,&lt;/br&gt;
[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 13:05, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
----

Thanks for your response, Rob. I tried to acknowledge Metric1000's point about usage, history and law in more than one of my replies on the talk page, but this seems not to've worked - or, at least, I did not do this sufficiently strongly. Given the manner of his posts, however, I decided especially calm and circumspect reponses were needed.

In the module itself, I hope I only removed his preaching that there's no difference between 'mass' and 'weight' rather than engage in reversion. If it appears to be outright reversion I apologise and take note. As regards my contributions not being technically accurate, I am aware of this but at the same am aware this is meant to be a module in a book for children. I just wanted to point out that science has distinct uses for the terms 'mass' and 'weight' and that their weight according to a bathroom scale would change from planet to planet or the like. I'd say that as most of us aren't practising scientists we don't use the word 'mass' that much in our everyday life on Earth, so all the more reason to confirm that what we think of here on Earth as 'weight' changes if we're on other planets etc or moving in certain ways, such as the example of orbiting. I don't believe being comprehensive or especially accurate matters here; just making the point that something - 'weight' - changes.

This is why I'd like to propose your approach as a solution. Yes, perhaps I may've been more creative in my attempts to point out to Metric1000 that changes in weight occur from place to place in the universe. I certainly hope, however, that I haven't been engaged in - and, most of all, haven't appeared willing or happy to engage in - an edit fight.

Thanks again for your involvement,&lt;/br&gt;

== Wikicurrency ==


Hi Robert. I really appeciate your posts on the wikicurrency debate page. I've been out of it all for a little while due to illness and of course it has all fallen due to that absence. Its also been removed from pump and the proposed projects section! Anyways you said &quot;Each alterantive currency system can have its own Wikipedia article, with a common portal to tie everything together as a coherant package. If you need help to set this up, I would be willing to work with you on that.&quot; so if you're still keen we can start something. I still need to contact various alternate currency users and then it can start but in the meantime I'd like to setup a template that they can copy for their currency for when they start their own page. Any other thoughts on the idea would be appreciated. Thanks [[User:Cyclotronwiki|Cyclotronwiki]]

== Thanks for responding on my Costa Rica question. ==

I did put that material on Wikitravel. You deleted nothing. Thank you for responding.  

I do have a question I am trying to put into the discussion section on a wikibook user friendly instructions on how another person might use a template to add information in a parallel form to some I have added.  In order to do this, I need to know how to set off my entry into the discussion page as a remark in programming. Otherwise, where I use an example of code to enter, the discussion page calls the template at that point rather than allowing me to show the code.  

I am aware of the &quot;&lt;!--&quot; symbol, but it does not seem to work in this case. I'd appreciate any help you can give me. &lt;br&gt;Tom Croke aka  [[User:Frog One|Frog One]] 02:16, 31 October 2005 (UTC)--&gt;

Can you verify the internet eras I've delineated? They look right but I probably missed something and I get the impression you were there.

And if you know some book or even a measly article that I can cite on the issue of eras so that my divisions no longer qualify as &quot;original research&quot; (bloody statements of the obvious if you ask me), then I'd be grateful for that too.

== I'm watching you closely ==

In what way was my VfD for [[Social Postulates]] out of line?  I'm mostly familiar with Wikipedia, where articles with &quot;patent nonsense&quot; or &quot;original research&quot; are fair game for deletion.  Does Wikibooks have a different policy?  --[[User:D'Arby|D'Arby]] 17:20, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

== Future of Wikibooks ==

Initially I was strong supporter of strict textbook-only policy introduced by Jimbo. This was because I'm sometimes fed up with lots of materials with very low quality and not much sense we can see at Wikibooks. I was also scared by some suggestions that Wikibooks should be closed (it made me even fall into cleanup fever ;-). But when I realised that large, interesting books with relatively huge community of contributors will be deleted (like [[Unicyclopedia]], [[America's Army: Special Forces]] - it was even BOTM candidate) I began to think. Making Wikibooks home for only &quot;real&quot; textbooks will IMO create &quot;Wikiversity II&quot; and I'm afraid that we would loose many of our contributors and visitors.

On the other hand, I would never accept [[Cookbook:Human]] and I don't think [[Jokebook]] should stay here. All in all, I'm very confused now and don't know which option should I support.

BTW, can you use {{tl|User admin}} on your user page? It may be useful for other users. [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 09:07, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

== Future of Wikibooks... ==

Okay, I really ''did'' get here at the wrong time. When Jimbo comes in to say something like he did, I assume he speaks for the entire Board. Unless another member of the Board comes in to refute Jimbo, I will continue to assume that this is the way the Wikimedia Foundation wants Wikibooks to go. I will not fight for something that I cannot see a good point fighting for. There is just so much ''crap'' here. Even the mailing list couldn't provoke a Board member's opinion on the matter. I am just so fed up with all this crap. I ''do'' think that you fail to assume good faith on Jimbo's part by saying it may be financially motivated. I just hate all this infighting and can't really keep it up. But until there is a definite ruling, I can't completely give it up either. I am so torn on this issue. And I am not sure that the community at-large can &quot;overrule&quot; Jimbo on this matter either. If we overrule him, why wouldn't he just say, &quot;Okay, there is no more Wikibooks. Sorry. Shoulda played by the rules.&quot; and then just shut it off? Who knows. I'll be back later I guess. This whole thing stinks on ice. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:04, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

You guys (Horning and friends) appear to be about as close to the center of decision making as we peons can access.  I have't figured out how to contact Mr. Wales.  At this point I almost don't care what the decision is about what is allowed and what is not, but I think in fairness to everyone, we need a decision and a clear definition of where lines will be drawn '''''and enforcement from day one.'''''

From the context I have a general idea, but I'd like to know exactly what policy is in effect right now.  I do now see how to get in touch with J.

== Personal apology ==

Robert,

I would like to personally apologize to you for any wrong that I may have done to you or anyone else.  I believe that you and I have the same interests in the future of Wikibooks and that, perhaps because you don't know me well, you are making some assumptions about my intentions and actions that you would see in a different light if you would stick around for another week or so (at minimum) to work with me for a positive resolution of these issues.

It is your right to leave, of course.  But please know that I take your concerns very deeply to heart, despite you calling me such names as &quot;fascist&quot;, because I care deeply about the importance of quality people in the community.

This is just a heads up about this Wikibook and a contribution that you made there.  I posted a [[VfD]] discussion about aquiring ROMs for different game consoles, and the overwhelming concensus was to delete this content from Wikibooks.  I want to thank you for your contributions, but I hope you understand that we can't condone illegal activity here on Wikibooks, even indirectly.  The unauthorized distribution of copyrighted content is illegal and could potentially shut this whole project down if we didn't act swiftly on things of this nature.  I hope you understand and don't take this as a personal insult.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:44, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

Thats too bad, but I understand your decision. I don't really think emulation is illegal, just the same as it is perfectly legal to rip cds and into mp3s play them on your computer. There are plenty of legal ways to buy roms today and run them on your platform of choice.

In it he states clearly that there are such things that should be whitelisted fair use, and that includes publicity photos.

:::::Sorry, but I found that neither useful nor informative. It was just Jimbo ranting about how much he hates non-commercial-use-only images and how we have &quot;tolerated&quot; them for too long. He never gives a reason for why a non-commercial web site can't use non-commercial-use-only images. The examples he gives are images where it would be easy to get a free alternative, but what about for non-commercial-use-only images that would be impossible to replace, like images of dead people? For those, why does Jimbo want us to fall back on a fair use justification when we are aloud to use them as much as we want according to the copyright holders? --[[User:Arctic.gnome|Arctic Gnome]] 02:35, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

What it seems to basically signify is, because WP content is licenced under the GFDL, we're warranting that it can be used by anyone, for any (non-defamatory) purpose. if we host material that's subject to copyright restrictions, then we can't make that assurance on our content, which limits what Wikipedia material can be used for in an arbitrary way that's hard to police internally, and will invariably lead to conflict externally from time to time. So where possible, material licenced for non-commercial use is to be replaced by material that is licenced for all use; when this isn't possible then questions get asked around &quot;do we really need it&quot;, &quot;can it be shown some other way&quot;, &quot;is there a fair-use justification&quot; and so on. Hope that helps.

:Simply put, I disagree with what you say. First off, Images are almost never licensed under GFDL. Most of the time, if an image is freely licensed, its creative commons. Images and Text are wholly separate. Secondly, I disagree with your rationale for why Wikipedia can't host copyrighted images because it's dismissive and I think you're just wrong about what it will lead to. It's very easy to establish straightforward, simple policy on the subject that is clear cut and easy to police.--[[User:Jeffness|Jeff]] 02:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

::I would like to point out that while images don't have to be licensed under the GFDL, they do need to be licensed somehow that is ''compatable'' with the GFDL. If they can't be used that way, they really can't be hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. There is the exceptional rule of fair-use images, but that is something very exceptional and not justification for using non-commercial use only images freely within Wikipedia. Text and images are not seperate issues here, BTW, as they are both covered under the same part of law. I will admit, however, that the issues with images seem to be much more problematic. --[[User:Robert Horning|Robert Horning]] 10:57, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks, FT2, that explains a lot. Nevertheless, in the back of my mind Jimbo's rant against non-commercial-use-only images makes me think that he's planing to make Wikimedia commercial one day and get rich off of our work. --[[User:Arctic.gnome|Arctic Gnome]] 02:58, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
::The cool thing about &quot;making Wikimedia commercial&quot; is that he can't have a monopoly on the content if he does that. There are people such as [[Gracenote]], who used a community donation system to build up a free music album and track list database called [[CDDB]]. That they went &quot;commercial&quot; and then closed off their database to people who had contributed to building this database in the first place. If there are worries about what Mr. Wales might do in the future, it is certainly tainted with this experience and others like it. Fortunately, the [[GFDL]] protects against that, together with copies of the content database that are free to download, giving the opportunity for 3rd parties to come in and set up a fork of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects that would remain available in essentially the same form that Wikipedia can be accessed today.
::BTW, there is nothing stoping you from &quot;making a profit&quot; off of Wikipedia right now, if you wanted to go through the effort. But making the effort to &quot;publish&quot; Wikipedia, put it on CD-ROMs, and other similar projects is exactly what it would take. What is important here is that nobody has exclusive arrangements for the usage of Wikimedia content. --[[User:Robert Horning|Robert Horning]] 17:33, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
::Also, while I can't speak for Jimbo, I'm strongly opposed to a more relaxed fair use policy and use of non-commercial images. This has nothing to do with wanting to make wikipedia commercial in the future, but more to do with wanting to keep wikipedia 'free' content. Non-commercial use (&amp; no derivatives) and fair use is not free content. There may very well be just cause to print or make available wikipedia e.g. to poor people in Africa. Non-free content complicates this matter given the great project itself is non-commercial, it's likely to be a mess). While non-commercial use may seem better then fair use, it's still not free. We greatly restrict fair use and by banning non-commercial, we ensure these restrictions apply to non-commercial as well. By having these restrictions, many people including me believe we encourage people to find replacaments and discourage people who have the content from licensing their content restrictively and thinking that's enough. It's your content and you can do what you want with it, but we don't your restrictive content unless we it fulfills our fair use criteria. If people still choose to restrictively license their content, that's sad but in the end we haven't really lost that much, but when people see the light, that's good!

==Thanks for Support==

I just wanted to drop by and say thanks for supporting me on my RFA. Thank you for your encouragement.--[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 06:11, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

== Thanks (with tentative apologies...) ==

Thanks so much Rob for your quick and thoughtful replies to my many posts in the staff lounge. I hope I'm not stepping on too many toes (or at least not stepping on toes with too much force.

My personal project is to get some good how-to books about gardening. I'm just at the beginning of it, and am trying to recruit friends to help from various web forums I visit... essentially we are writing FAQs about particular gardening topics, but a bit more than just the FAQs, if you get my meaning (I'll put more details about it on my user page). I guess I'm just feeling a touch of paranoia about the stubby nature of the things I'm writing. There is a lot of deep, practical knowledge shared by web forum communities, and I think getting it into wikibooks will be a good way to preserve it! [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 17:26, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

:Wow, thanks for the quick and thoughtful reply to my query here, too! I didn't think you were shooting me down, just worry about the possibility of confrontations with more &quot;conservative&quot; editors... I've bumped into them on the 'pedia, which is part of why I want to work here, more than there, because I want to write more on how to do things than what things are. 

:As for moving images around, I really don't know how to do that. In fact, I don't even know about how to upload images onto the commons... I have 1,000s of botanical and gardening photos I'd like to upload, but so far I've been more motivated to get the text information out than to figure out images. Part of the problem for me is that I have a very nice camera (5mpx), and don't have the time to cut them down to size (nor do I know what size I should cut them down to). [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 17:54, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

==Thanks==
I'm going to call on a [http://www.merrimackforum.org local political forum] to see if they can stop their trolling and collaborate with myself to make the module you saved. If it's not in full bloom by late April or so, i'd say it's been a failure and would likely ever be further developed, so then feel free to get rid of it.

Thanks again, [[User:Karmafist|Karmafist]] 20:26, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
===A Quick Opinion From You===
Thanks again for your welcome, the book you helped saved is coming along, I have been able to get one other person, but I have a few questions that i'd like your opinion on.

#What's the standards on templates around here? There are alot of thugs over on Wikipedia de-templatizing everything. 
#On another book i'm doing, I thought of changing the title from &quot;Being a Real Estate Agent&quot; to &quot;Gimme Shelter! A Career In Real Estate&quot;. I'm not sure if I should use either, and the subpages have screwed things up. What do you think for a title? It's ultimately a guide i'm writing on how to be a Real Estate Agent from all the trials and tribulations that i'm going through trying to learn this business.
#And speaking of which, subpages or sections? I might go to subpages later when the sections get large enough. [[User:Karmafist|Karmafist]] 14:19, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
===Cool, I Think I'm All Set===
Although the Real Estate book is quite a mess right now. Once i'm done with the old redirects, i'll slap the equivalent of whatever CSD is over here on them. [[User:Karmafist|Karmafist]] 18:48, 6 March 2006 (UTC)
===One More Favor===
I'm not sure about the redirect rules you have here, but I made a simpler one for a smaller web address [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/mtmsvg http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/mtmsvg], to get some more traffic and edits onto the page, currently it's mostly just me editing there. I hope this can become a great resource for our town's voters, but I don't think people will use it if the web address name is too long and they're unfamiliar with Wikis. [[User:Karmafist|Karmafist]] 12:14, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
===No Edit Wars===
Not a problem, I hope to avoid edit wars as well. If that does occur, do you mind backing me up in trying to reason with the other admin? Hopefully, such a redirect can bring many new users to Wikibooks, one of the main efforts along with educating fellow residents about the election is to also get them hooked on Wikis, I find them to be an astoundingly good information resource. Heh, at this rate, give me a few months and i'll be an admin on here too. Oh, that's a long story in regards to Wikipedia...[[User:Karmafist|Karmafist]] 12:36, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
===Question on potential broadening===
My work has been put up on vfd before being completed again, i'm wondering if I should broaden it into a guide of all Merrimack politics(a more textured and nuanced thing that would seem, reaching back for 200 years), which I could make into a featured module if I could just get my fellow townspeople to work on it rather than bickering with each other...Let me know what you think. Regardless of the vfd, i'm going to find a way to salvage this thing. [[User:Karmafist|Karmafist]] 16:45, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

== Comments about Main Page ==

Hey Robert, I left you some comments there on the [[Talk:Main Page]] at the bottom. Thanks and have a great evening! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 01:38, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

== A Couple of Questions ==
Hey Robert, I was going to start importing information from Wikipedia into [[Organic Chemistry]] to flush out some of the content. Is that OK to start right now or should I wait until your work on print version prep is finished?

Also, was there a threat a while ago that WikiBooks would be shut down? And you were threatening to leave because of a difference with Jimmy?

Where did the Jokebook content go to? I actually saw that the content had been moved to a &quot;Delete&quot; page but thought that it was there on a permanent basis, as sort of a joke or something, but I saw it was eliminated. I'm kind of sorry about that because there were some great jokes there that I found.

I totally appreciate your work here and would like to support you in any way I can. Have a great day! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 20:57, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

== Wikiversity course 'ownership' ==

Hi Robert,

This is just a heads up - this guy, [[User:Gh0st]] is, I think, trying to stake ownership of two Wikiversity courses in Political Science, [[Pos 1000]] and [[Pos 1001]]. I appreciate his interest and enthusiasm, but what he's asking and doing is too much and not in the current spirit of Wikiversity. I said as much on [[User_talk:Gh0st|his talk page]] and he simply deleted my question - he had also deleted a similar question previously, and reverts anyone who says he is not the sole 'professor' of the course. He's pretty new, so it's best to be patient and explain, but he's advertising his course to begin in a few days time, involving timetables, mandatory attendance and pass/fail rates. I think that, in the long run, if he continues like this, it might make for a few bewildered and/or disgruntled students, and might turn some people away. What's your take on this? (You can reply here - I'm checking Wikibooks regularly now, and I'll add your page to my watchlist.) Thanks. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 01:07, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

== Help with German Wikibook ==

Hello I was wondering if you like to help with the development of the [[German|German Wikibook]], it need much help and more activity, and since you a good at German, would you like to help?

--[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 17:49, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

:I would like to brush up a little bit more and help out there, given some time.  I've been doing some housecleaning for Wikibooks in general, so I'm kinda stretched thin at the moment.  Yes, I do speak a more or less advanced beginner level of German, or just enough to find my way around Germany if I didn't meet any English speakers there.  Or more importantly I can navigate my way around the German Wikimedia projects without looking like a total fool.  That I why I listed myself as having a level &quot;2&quot; of German knowledge, and I certainly can do a somewhat reasonable translation from German into English (at least on the written level).

:So, yeah, I'll try to stop by and offer a little bit of assistance.  Just don't count on me becomming a major contributor for the next little while.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:56, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

Thank very much, I was kinda of worried about asking admins, becuase of how busy they are, but thanks a lot, just leave a message at my talk page if you have any ouestion about the german wikibook.

== It's good to see that this site isnt ran by a computer ==

Hey Rob;

Finally,a site that isn't ran by an admin that just does nothing but delete things! Now, on my talk board, you said, at one point or another, something like this would be like pouring gasoline on Wikibooks. My page(s) are not intended to promote vandalism or graffiti. Although you dais I should keep a neutral point of view, take a look at graffiti this way: What if, instead of on a wall, the artist did it on a large canvas and sold it to millions of people? What if graffiti were an art form? Well, to most artists, it is an art form. My two purposes for writing the book is to promote the art form and discourage vandalism.

However, if you still feel the book is suggestive in anyway, tell me and delete it.

Thanks for your concern,
C.A.ONE

== Wikilanguages, etc. ==

Rob

Thank you for your comment on my talk page. On the specific point on Wikilanguages, I have now restored the book - but please note that the vfd had gone on for 11 days with all the votes being to delete when I removed it. I appreciate you take a different view from me as to whether the vote should have been acted on this early, which is why I am happy to restore it following your comment, although I will note that you yourself have deleted something that's been on VFD for only four days where you have seen a clear consensus to delete. I suppose my point here is that it is clear that we are both here to improve wikibooks - whilst we may disagree on some points, I trust that this overriding aim will help us work together in maintaining wikibooks as a useful resource.

On the more general issue, when I came to wikibooks, it was clear that it had an identity crisis, which had seen a number of splits - the cookbook, wikijunior and wikiversity in particular had all been split off in some way. There was no standard naming convention, so each book looked separate rather being as part of a whole. There were many remnants of former days as a multilingual site, a lot of latent vandalism (eg a number of pages still needing ass pus or still having been damonized), and serious difficulties navigating to find what books are actually worth reading. This, through the efforts of a number of editors, is improving (although I'm sure not as fast as we'd all like). 

There is still some way to go - personally I very much do see wikijunior and wikiversity as being part of the remit to host and develop textbooks, and I would love the rifts to disappear. The Cookbook namespace should disappear too. Hopefully making wikibooks look like something to be proud of will bring them into the fold. For me, we also need to resolve textbooks such as [[Knowing Knoppix]] and [[Gardening]], which have already been published, but which are clearly textbooks that would not be out of place here had they originally been started here. To my mind wikibooks is the wikimedia project you look at for textbooks (and if it isn't, it bloody well should be). They are not appropriate for wikisource (which does not appear to cover things even remotely looking like textbooks), yet provide a welcome addition to wikibooks.

Other issues to resolve are to make things more user-friendly. I have already changed the [[Wikibooks portal]] (along the lines of what is done for other wikimedia projects), though this probably deserves more work as it is the first thing many first-time visitors see. I have started to redraft the Help namespace content using modified wikipedia content - this too needs to be completed. The main page, no doubt, can be improved further.

In summary, there is much to be done to make wikibooks look like a good place to develop new textbooks - but that is the noble aim. If we can succeed, we can help bring down the cost of textbooks generally, which will greatly help education throughout the English-speaking world. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:18, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

:Thank you so very much.  I was just expressing a level of concern is all, and I hope that I did that.  I was actually from a school of thought that believed Wikibooks can and ought to be more for &quot;any non-fiction topics and content that can maintain a NPOV and be verifyed&quot;, aka no original research, but some other minor restrictions as well.  Jimbo really stirred up the pot here by jumping into the mess and and pushing for a stronger emphasis on textbooks, which has given way to a strong &quot;textbook only&quot; philosophy here as well. [[Wikibooks talk:What is Wikibooks|As can be seen by my comment on this page]] (see archived discussion about '''Wikibooks hosts instructional resources''' if you can't find it), the whole issue over what other sorts of non-fiction material besides textbooks still hasn't been completely resolved.

:I would like to point out that if you think Wikibooks is a mess now, it was in horrible shape before I became an administrator.  I'm not saying that I am personally responsible for all of the changes that have been made, as there have been many other very good editors.  There was a problem where new administrators simply weren't being made for many reasons, which unfortunately seem to be happening again right now with much higher standards being put into place for who becomes an administrator.  We elected a bureaucrat to help clean up that roadblock and give us some access to even clean out the deletion bit, which hadn't been emptied for a several months.  With only one real active admin, and a great many tasks left undone.  I've been slowly trying to resolve those issues, but it has been a problem to even try and find where the problems are at.

:My book organization scheme is of importance as it can help to identify the content which really belongs on Wikibooks instead of being pure cruft.  As I'm going through the process of examining each book, I also do a quick test to see if it fits Wikibooks policies and I don't hesitate to throw a VfD on it... especially for older content.  There are a great many areas to work on with Wikibooks, and this is but one of those areas.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:30, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

== Natural Taoist ==

Thank you for the comment. I agree completely with it. Wikibooks is more for text books that are no longer under copywrite protection. Wikireason is ok for the time being but what we really need is a wikipub for publishers and writer like myself. I love writing on wiki because I can cross reference material which helps the reader to understand it better.

== Re: Thank you for fighting vandalism ==

And a thanks to you too. I don't do too much with vandals, hardly track Recent changes, but sometimes they just mess with the wrong space. Have to confess, I'm mostly concerned with the content side of the equation and getting [[Chinese]] into up to a gold standard of quality, but maybe I'll have a look around [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks maintenance|Wikibooks maintenance]] from now on. 

I've seen you around. Thanks to you for helping create the environment for progress, even with the relative lawlessness inherent out here on the Wiki frontier.

&amp;mdash; [[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 06:35, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

&lt;small&gt;ps - Perhaps you should look into archiving these discussions. After all, &quot;some browsers may have problems editing pages approaching or longer than 32kb&quot; and you're twice that.&lt;/small&gt;

:You are welcome.  I've been thinking of what sorts of guidelines I'm going to use for archiving this page, as well as a couple of different methods that have been proposed for doing so as well.  The Archive subpage system is just one of those methods, but not the only solution.  Since this is &quot;my&quot; page, I'm giving this a little more through before I'll act.  Section editing should avoid the 32kb limit for most users.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:54, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

== Deleted module from Wikibooks ==

I have been a regular user of Wikibooks.Being a professor of science,I regularly referred to TOP 1000 SCIENTISTRS FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME TO 2000 AD by Barker(which appears on Wikipedia as well).To my surprise I find it deleted and cannot see the deletion log.I am keen to find out the reasons for deletion.([[User:Vr|Vr]] 05:19, 12 April 2006 (UTC))

:Note that this was deleted because it is a fork of Wikipedia content, and is being maintained on Wikipedia while it was falling behind on Wikibooks.  Also, Wikibooks is not a project to place original source materials that have been written by somebody else, that you don't want to see modified.  The Wikipedia article can be found here:  [[w:Top 1000 Scientists: From the Beginning of Time to 2000 AD]]

:Please note that we deleted this content because Wikipedia and Wikibooks in this sense are really just one and the same project.  There is no need to duplicate the content on Wikipedia again on Wikibooks.  In addition, the Wikipedia article has links to biographies on almost all of these scientists, something that would take quite a bit of time to research and come up with on Wikibooks.  And this forking is against Wikibooks policy.  See [[WB:WIN]] for some more details.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:39, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

== Help with Business Writing ==

Rob, you suggested that I add my book &quot;Business Writing&quot; to the bookshelves.  I'm afraid I've failed at the process, and I would be grateful if you could direct me to a page that provides guidance on how to do this.

I tried adding the book to the Business - Management sub-category.  However, I succeeded only in creating a new sub-category of Management with no content.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to delete that empty sub-category.

I later found that someone had added the book to the How-To section.  It's fine there.  However, is there a rule that would prevent it from being listed under Business - Management as well?

Any guidance that you can offer would be most welcome.

[[User:Rob Parkinson|Rob Parkinson]]

:I know that you deleted this message, so you aren't anticipating an answer.  I'd like to point out that the bookshelves are currently in a bit of shambles, and some policy changes need to happen, including allowing you to list books multiple times.  Indeed this may be something that we are going to have to do in the future.  Some books already are listed on multiple bookshelves, and I think this is a good idea, but not widely encouraged.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:24, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

== Your untagged images ==

Recently I copied some code from [[Commons:MediaWiki:Extra-tabs.js]] to [[User:Kernigh/monobook.js]] and started experimenting with the examination of Wikibookians' file uploads.

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:34, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

:I am going to add that for myself, my primary dispute in the past has been with [[User:Jimbo Wales]], and as such is beyond the scope of this policy.  Wheel warring (where administrators fight each other with repeated reversions of delete/undelete options and other admin functions) is perhaps a bit worse.  I've done that with one other user, including adding information to talk pages demanding a rationale to why a page was deleted when I strongly disagreed, only to get the talk page deleted.

:Still, I appreciate any effort to try and put some sanity into a process of resolving significant disputes.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:50, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

::Rob, I saw your response on the staff lounge to implementing policies.

[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:02, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

:::It looks like this is going to be a very significant problem.  I am not at all pleased with what [[User:Jguk]] has done with Wikibooks, and IMHO has done far more damage to Wikibooks than anybody can possibly imagine.  I will be the first to admit there was a bunch of cruft that had to be deleted, but this user has gone in and done much more than that.  Significant content has been deleted without even a VfD (it appears as though he finally is admitting there is a VfD page) and as you have pointed out he is wheel warring now on an even higher level.  Remember that your opinion on things is just as valid as his, so the only real way to fight him is to not back down.  I guess you and I have done just that and conceeded Wikibooks to Jguk.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:28, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

== Video Game guides ==

I see you're still fighting for Video Game guides to stay at Wikibooks as can be seen from [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Staff_lounge&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=461863 this]. 

:&quot;''I would like to prove both Jimbo and the rest of the anti-gaming guide people that they are not only wrong but flat out wrong about the removal of content simply because of the topic, not because of the content.''&quot;

My user page is full of video game links so I am not one of the &quot;anti-gaming guide people&quot;, however I ''have'' been active in moving video game content off the site. I started my own wiki shortly before this command from Jimbo after [[w:Wikipedia:Censorship]] failed to pass. I was sick of fighting silly Censorsip debates again and again. I took the news of the video game ban as just ''another'' reason to leave and go it alone. I have since moved most of the guides I wrote myself over but because of licensing I cant move the others to my site (so much for ''free'' content!). It's pointless to try and reason with Jimbo, as he simply issues his commands (sometimes in the form of &quot;I wonder&quot; &lt;small&gt;[http://www.wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Jimbo_Wales#I_wonder... http://www.wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Jimbo_Wales#I_wonder...]&lt;/small&gt;) and then [[Special:Contributions/Jimbo_Wales|leaves]]. Just letting you know there ''are'' other sits available. [http://www.gmcfoley.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page My wiki] aims to include every thing Wikipedia and Wikibooks have, plus the other WikiMedia projects. IMO there is simply no need to divide every thing up. If like me you don't wish to continue the fight then you are welcome to have a look at [http://www.gmcfoley.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page my wiki]. It's not held back by any encyclopedic/educational goals. Thanks, [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 04:22, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

:The one thing that the alternate sites don't have is affiliation with Wikipedia, which IMHO is something valuable.  Also, I believe that eventually Jimbo will either grow tired of this whole business of trying to randomly and indiscriminately on whims censor content, or actually get a clue as to what long-time regulars have been saying about Wikibooks.  This was an exciting website, and some neat things that have happened and are happening right now.  New users do come in from other Wikimedia projects, and I also think collaborations with the other Wikimedia projects are very fruitful.

:The damage has been done, but I don't think it is irrepairable.  Eventually some of most of this content will come back in one form or another, and the mission of Wikimedia will change... or a successor organization built along similar lines.  By tightening his grip, Jimbo is just going to loose more followers and eventually lead to the demise of Wikimedia, or adapt and change to acknowledge that problems are happening.

:I was involved heavily with the Open Directory Project, and I rather enjoyed it (to cite another free content project).  It is still available, but the &quot;management&quot; of that project became incredibly overbearing and expected far too much from its volunteers... and shows.  The ODP is falling apart now and they barely keep up with a consistant number of active users participating, even though it seemingly is still fairly strong.  Due to some wheel warring there, I quietly left on hiatus and when I tried to come back I had to deal with so much red tape to get my account back that I felt it wasn't worth the effort even.

:I see similar problems with Wikimedia projects, and I do feel for Jimbo in the sense that he is having to answer to a whole bunch of people over a whole bunch of issues.  Jimbo, however, openly admits that he hates the talk pages on MediaWiki and prefers e-mail conversations, or even telephone conversations.  Unfortunately for Wikibooks, most of the community discussion is on talk pages, and I believe that it was through e-mail discussions by anti-video game guide people that got the game books removed.  The same thing is now happening to the How-to books, which have been specifically mentioned as not only useful but a kind of content '''''wanted''''' on Wikibooks for most of its lifetime.  I fail to see how it is now considered unacceptable.

:I've gone into a limited hiatus right now (aka Wikibreak) and I simply want to wait my time to see where the chips are going to fall for the current run of the admins who like to delete everything.  Eventually they will leave or get burned out, and then I can try my own hand again at what is going on.  Unfortunately the negative aspects of Wikipedia have also begun to infect Wikibooks, and that is too bad as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:09, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

:: I'm not willing to give up on Wikibooks yet either :-p (Sorry, I got this page on my watchlist btw... dunno why). Honestly, I think we need to make a true policy decision before we go ahead and delete a vast majority of content here. There truely is a balancing act that has to go on here; but there are some issues that I feel that have no rhyme or reason behind them... Fortunatly, I think here, in wikibooks, we are small enough a community to be able to actually correct this issue. There are few admins who are doing the work here, and I'm sure talking it over will eventually make us come to a concensus. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:25, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

== Say it ain't so ==

I understand your frustration with Wikibooks but hope you will stick around.  I tend toward deletionism, and I find your voice most valuable&amp;mdash;indeed it is precisely because you are an inclusionist that I, as a deletionist, find your voice particularly valuable.  I see a VfD, I vote, and am confident I haven't done too much damage through shortsightedness.  My confidence results from knowing that others will vote too and that some of those will disagree with me.  If I've been short-sighted, I'll likely be called on it.  It is the confidence of knowing that I am just one vote.  I need to hear from the inclusionists (and others) to help keep me from going goofy.

I, like you, have seen the sharp turn toward deletionism in recent months, and I am not completely comfortable with it.  That is in spite of my own tendency toward deletionism.  The new deletionism seems to have occured for two reasons.  One, newer admins are more familiar with the letter of the policy and less familiar with the de facto standards.  They know that the deletion policy says this or that, but they don't know where we've been tending to look the other way.  Second, ther newer admins seem more eager to honor Jimbo's fiats than older ones&amp;mdash;and Jimbo has been issuing some deletionist fiats lately.  It is especially important on both counts to see older admins with significant institutional memory.  Further (and this is the source of my discomfort), this has happened very little policy discussion.  Whether we are to host gaming guides and how-tos is very much a who-we-are issue.  What our relation with Jimbo is to be is very much a who-we-are issue&amp;mdash;or rather many such issues.  As such, they needed more discussion than they got.  I consider myself a non-supporter of gaming guides and wishy-washy about how-tos.  However, policy changes, even in de facto standards need discussion.

Wikimedia is sometimes conceived of as a sort of utopian community effort.  Power to the People; Peace, Love, Tie-Dye; etc.  I'm sorry, but that's all balderdash.  The reason why Wikimedia (usually) works well is the same reason that democracies (sometimes) work well:  checks and balances.  Any one can edit; that is a source of trouble but also a source of correction.  We have multiple administrators that can do damage or keep things from going too haywire&amp;mdash;and that can undo each other's administrative actions.  This ''can'' be a recipe for disastrous anarchy.  But it can also serve as one large self-correcting mechanism.  Fortunately, the latter predominates.  But for all this to work, we need participants and administrators with varying points of view.  Too much groupthink, and the the self-correcting mechanism falters.  Indeed, it is especially important that we not lose those whose take on Wikibooks is not in fashion at the moment.

Your passion for and hard work on behalf of Wikibooks has been highly valuable.  I very much hope you will stick around.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JMRyan|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/JMRyan|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:38, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

== wikimedia clarification ==

Hi Rob; Jimbo obviously takes one view of the purpose of wikibooks which doesn't always jive with what wikibooks contributors want. The only way to settle this matter finally seems to me to be to request an explicit clarification from the whole wikimedia board. I strongly suspect they'll return the same view as Jimbo, but it would clear up any remaining abiguity and allow us to get on with actually writing books here. What do you think about doing this?

== &quot;Manuals without courses&quot; bookshelf ==

A textbook is a manual for a course of study. This gives us a headache. Can we host manuals that have no courses?

Having searched the net I could find courses on zen tango, homeopathic aromatherapy, mind altering drugs and mysticism. So textbooks on these subjects are acceptable according to our charter.

I could not find clear courses on gameplay in individual video games, on the maintenance and servicing of quantum computers, on running an Iter series fusion reactor, on using heat pumps with domestic thermal reservoirs etc. etc. However, these subjects may well deserve a course in the future

People have been getting quite exercised about the problem of manuals without courses. '''If this is really so problematical''' then my suggestion is that if authors cannot provide evidence of a course for their manual/guide it is placed in a &quot;Manuals without courses&quot; bookshelf. There are still problems however, for instance, &quot;Servicing the Triumph Bonneville&quot; classic motorcycle might end up in this section whilst &quot;Servicing the Honda Shadow&quot; modern motorcycle would go in the main library. So, would a &quot;manuals without courses&quot; section need an entire replica of the cataloging system?  Or should we just let manuals without courses into the main library? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:54, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:I have covered this in numerous places and several times, that it is making my head ache.  Not only are there game course, but there are degrees that are granted for video game design and playing (yes, playing).  And by very reputable schools, not just fly-by-night psuedo schools either.  In addition, there are indeed courses given on individual gameplay that are outside of a formal teaching environment.

:I don't see what the real problem is here.  The whole point was discouraging video game walk-throughs, which I whole heartedly agree don't belong on Wikibooks.  The problem is that it never got to that issue, and instead the entire Video Game bookshelf was eliminated because of a perception that video games couldn't be used in instructional learning in any form what-so-ever.  This very ''topic'' has been forbidden, and I think unjustifiably.

:In this regard, the whole debate over video games missed the point entirely, and that instead of trying to eliminate these books, that the standards over what was in the '''''content''''' of the books about video games should have been raised.  They should not have been driven from Wikibooks at all.

:More to the point, when &quot;Jimbo says...&quot; was invoked, a knee jerk reaction to simply elminate all Wikibooks on this very topic were deleted, without even the possibility that perhaps Jimbo was speaking about a certain narrow topic (video game walkthroughs) instead of the broader implications that perhaps other solutions could be worked out.  No community discussion was done, nor was any previous discussion on the topic considered either.  This is not the way that administrators should act, and IMHO the election of some of these admins was both too hasty, and damaging to Wikibooks.  Certainly a few admins have taken over (I won't name names here, but you know who I'm opposed to here if you've followed my comments) that don't make community concensus before huge policy changes.  Certainly no community concensus was achieved on the decision of removing video game Wikibooks.

:I will admit that when I joined Wikibooks, that it was about trying to write textbooks, and perhaps some of that emphasis was lost.  And as Jimbo pointed out (without really helping Wikibooks, unfortunately), Wikipedia has been dumping content on Wikibooks simply because they couldn't find a better place to put the content and they didn't want it on Wikipedia.  This is the source of some of the trouble, but unfortunately it didn't really solve the problem because it damaged Wikibooks far more than it really addressed the issue of dealing with Wikipedia.  If the problem was with Wikipedia, the solution should involve decision makers on Wikipedia as well so no new content will be dumped on Wikibooks in the future.  That sort of policy making has not been done.

:Other content such as Wikijunior, and the Wikimania proceedings have even further dilluted Wikibooks to emphasis more the books rather than textbooks angle of Wikibooks.  This was done with the full compliance and knowledge of Jimbo, even though efforts have been made to remove both of them.  I have been a critic of how Wikijunior was started, and even though it is a good draw of people into Wikibooks, it never really should have been here in the first place.  It is a seperate project, and should reflect that view with its own domain as well.  So long as new projects like these are started on Wikibooks, the view that Wikibooks is only for textbooks is incredibly short-sighted and hippocritcal as well.  Wikiversity is another example of not only non-textbook view of Wikibooks, but even a non-book view of Wikibooks as well.

:It is this view, together with the fact that although Jimbo is forcing policy, but not really a major participant on Wikibooks, that really taints my attitude toward this whole mess.  Consistant and fair policies should be discussed, and the anti-video game book policy is far from consistant.  This excludes content strictly on the basis of its topical nature, and there are many other topics that I would rather consider much more important to exclude if you are going to mention topics explicitly.   Notably Pornography (currently not explicitly excluded on Wikibooks) and planning somebody's murder.  Discussion about these topics has taken place, and it was felt that other existing policies dealt with these topics in a sufficient manner that there was no need to be more explict that these were forbidden topics.  For example most porn has copyright exclusions that would not permit their inclusion on Wikibooks for copyright reasons alone.  Why should video games, something much more benign, be considered a sudden exception?  And yes, video games are being excluded explictly because of the topic, not the substance or nature of the content.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:04, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:: I grow tired of debate now. The issue at hand is that current &quot;defacto&quot; policy, whatever it is (for it is obviously not written into [[WB:WIW]] yet) is, IMO, paradoxical, confusing, ambiguous, and almost based on opinion alone. There is no concencus on [[WB:WIW]] anymore; this project has been blasted back into the Wiki-stone age. This kind of policy debating should not be occuring this late in the Wikibooks project, and puts a bad rap on the Wikibooks name.

:: I just wonder why Jimbo thinks this is for the betterment of Wikibooks, when all I've seen so far are respectable contributors with great textbook or textbook-like content grow tired of all this deletionist crap that has been going on.

:: This is definitly not good for the long term reputation of Wikibooks. But I just can't stand another debate on the issue :-/. I'll ride it out for a while; maybe I'm wrong and Wikibooks will become better, But I just don't have enough trust in the Wikibooks policy to stay here and contribute. It feels that even when I'm working '''on''' policy, it doesn't count at all either. ([[Wikibooks:Game_manual_guidelines]]). --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 17:17, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Dewey Decimal Classification]] ==

Are links supposed to be listed on this page or on subpages (such as the page for 000-099)? I noticed that you changed the subpage listing to headings in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Dewey_Decimal_Classification&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=407524 this revision]. I also ran into problems when I tried clicking &quot;edit&quot; links within classification pages. Sometimes I see a blank page when I click &quot;edit&quot; and sometimes I see the following section. I think this is due to HTML being used instead of MediaWiki formatting. Would you mind if I change &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h5&gt; Title &lt;/h5&gt; to ===== Title ===== &lt;/nowiki&gt;. By the way, are categories such as [[:Category:Dewey:537]] being used? I would like [[Infobox]]es to automatically categorize the title pages of books into Dewey and Library of Congress categories, but I'm not sure how deep into the classification hierarhcy each category should be. Thank you for your work on this project, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 23:27, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:This whole thing was in a flux, and I was going to try and set up some standards until [[User:Jguk]] decided unilaterially that this page simply didn't belong on Wikibooks and shouldn't be maintained.  As a result, I have abandoned it, and largely Wikibooks as well for the most part except hoping against hope that some people with real sanity might come in and try to take back this project.

:Point fingers aside, there are some issues that need to be addressed with the DCC (Dewey Classification Codes), including a very vague issue of copyright status on the numbers.  The original classification codes were copyrighted, but that copyright has expired due to the amount of time that has passed since Mr. Dewey established the codes.  I also think that if push came to shove, that the codes would be declared in the public domain due to substantial amount of government assistance in the generation of the classification codes (it is done at the Library of Congress in an office inside the library itself).  The Wikimedia Foundation though should not be pushing this legal envelope, however.

:Related to this is that getting anything beyond the basic 3 digit major category level of classification.  For our purposes on Wikibooks, however, I think this would be more than sufficient in terms of broad general categories for grouping books.

:I was trying to depreciate and potentially even delete most of the sub-pages for the Dewey classification pages.  The list of all Wikibooks seems to load just fine, and I don't see any real reason to put the subsequent sub-pages into this mess at the moment.  It is also easier to do quick searches if you can do a glance at related categories all at once.  I've tried a few experiments for different ways to try and get at categories of books, and I'm still not sure which way is going to work out best.  Feel free to do more experimentation as well.

:As far as the HTML formatting is concerned, this is a very old page and predates some of the Wiki-markup syntax that is used now with MediaWiki software.  Feel free to cull this old cruft out as much as you can and bring the syntax more up to date with current page formatting techniques.  It is easier to read and easier to maintain via the Wiki interface.  Anything I did using that HTML code was mainly for consistancy, not really because it was needed.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:11, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

Rob, that's somewhat unfair to me - I opened up a discussion on VfD about whether the CCO was worth maintaining. Listing it for discussion (as with any VfD nomination) is unilateral. Doing this also seems to me to have sparked an improvement of the CCO. I still think the Dewey and LOC bits are not suitable for wikibooks (although I do appreciate you have put much work into them), the rest of the CCO looks good, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:40, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

:The Unilaterial actions were to remove it completely from the navigation sidebar and to make it effectively invisible from any other links within Wikibooks, making it essentially a deleteable page anyway and something that is not obvious to any new Wikibooks users that it even exists.  I'm not openly wheel warring on this point, in part because I want to take the time to substantially improve the CCO page even more than it is... if my heart can even get back into serious editing on Wikibooks.  I do believe this is something that should belong on the sidebar, in part because it is to be the focus point to begin a search of Wikibooks to find a book through means other than a word search.  It is also to be a place to recruit new users to help with classifying books and organizing the content of Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:21, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

:: One of the nice things about DDC is that it's the system in use in most middle school libraries in the US, which means that there are a lot of potential users and contributors who are familiar with the work.  It makes sense for places with hundreds of thousands of books to use LOC references, but DDC is good for thousands of books and tens of thousands of books.  I'm going to devote some of my time to classifying books in DDC, since I'm semi-familiar with the system.  However, we have a LOT of technical books, which means some sections are going to wind up looking overstuffed. -[[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 03:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:I have been arguing that very point, and am very confused myself, even though I've been a participant on Wikibooks for a fairly long time and have been elected as an &quot;administrator&quot; with the privilege of removing unwelcome content.  Right now I'm fighting the current top admins (by their actions, not necessarily any ranking) to get this clairified, and have suggested that far too much has been deleted than should have been.

:There is no reason to remove How-to books from Wikibooks at all, and the decision to do that has not really even been discussed within the Wikibooks community.  Consider that only a threat at the moment and something not to really worry about.

== Wikiversity Proposal Tasks and Schedule ==

Hi Roberth,

I have asked Cormaggio specifically when the Wikiversity proposal is going to be submitted to the Board for authorization to proceed with permanent dedicated URLs and wiki space.  I get nothing back but vague generalities.  Mr. Wales has indicated on the public Foundation mailing list in response to queries that to the best of his knowledge Wikiversity (within some appropriate initial scope) has overwhelming support from every single Board Member.  The only holdup on its approval and activation is the complete lack of any information from the Wikiversity community/proponents in response to the Board's fairly minor inquiries.   In view of this information do you have a feel for what specific tasks need to be completed and when they be finished?  Is this a manpower issue or coordination issue between the appointed members of the activation committee?  Is it a matter of final technical editing of wording such that a majority of the five acting committee members agree it is ready to go?  I, and possibly others, would appreciate some specific information if it is available on how we can proceed immediately as there has been no visible action for months in the public space.  Thanks.  [[user:lazyquasar]]

ps:Nice status or end of the year report you are drafting.  I suppose I should get a little more professional or polished if you are going to be hanging around Wikiversity much. `8-/

== Algebra to SEWikibooks ==

I think moving it over would be a great idea, but the contributors would have to move with it, we have a very small group of editors. Someone on Meta has already nominated SEWikibooks for closure (in fact, it was an SEWikipedia editor) but the vote's going great and it looks like it'll stay. I'm not sure how an SE bookshelf would go down over here, I think there may be considerable opposition. [[simple:User:Archer7]] 13:49, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

== Categories ==

A number of reasons:

:#It should be possible to drill down to every page using the category system;
:#The category system, by allowing pages to be listed under numerous categories, would make it easier to see linkages between books - and also books on similar subjects;
:#By categorising every page in a book, every page in a book can easily be found - along with related book pages (admittedly the prefix function can do this in part already);
:#By using the &quot;related changes&quot; toolbox item, you can easily see all recent changes made to pages listed within a single category, thereby allowing for easy monitoring of all pages in a book, including new ones;
:#By seeking to categorise every page methodically, it is also possible to weed out pages that don't belong - an anon who has created a page with the content &quot;ddddddddddddd&quot; is unlikely to categorise it;
:#Categorisation may also help identify which book pages do not belong on wikibooks;
:#Finally, and this is a side benefit, not the purpose of the exercise, we do end up with a more realistic module count (although the Cookbook does not even count as one module, so this will still not be accurate even when complete)

[[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:26, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

:I guess I consider this to be non-essential, but if you want to go through the effort, I guess it &quot;keeps you off the street&quot;.  I don't think you really need to &quot;drill down&quot; to every page using the category system.  

:Every book can be found through alternative approaches anyway, which is why we have the bookshelf system.  The categories were invented to help organize Wikipedia.

:As far as monitoring new pages in a book, I disagree that it would help out.  That means a contientious new user would have to add the category as a part of the first edit.  I don't think that should be manditory and would be very difficult to keep up in all cases.  Yes, Wikipedia does a good job of categorizing pages, but like I said, I don't think it is strictly that necessary and there are bigger fish to fry here on Wikibooks than to keep up the full category system.

:I do advocate and support category pages ''within'' a Wikibook that supports grouping items together, such as is done with the Cookbook.  That should be something that is optional and a part of the debate and discussion regarding the development of an individual Wikibook.  It should not be something forced upon a Wikibook by outside participants.

As with you and everyone else here on Wikibooks, I strongly believe in the project's goals and want to do what I can to help make those goals a reality. I look forward to reading your reply so I can learn more about the project. 

By the way, I would like to hear your opinion on the [[Water Resources Directory]] VFD. (Just for clarification: The author of the book intends to make it a listing of water resources by region.) Should I instead ask on the staff lounge whether directories are to be included on Wikibooks (or has that already been decided)? Thank you for all the work you have done on Wikibooks. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 18:58, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

I would also like to add that almost everything transwikied from Wikipedia can be added to existing books. You only need a user willing to perform the merger. Since transwikied pages are essentially forgotten without that action, I want to get pages out of transwiki limbo, so they can be usable and read (rather than stay forgotten in transwiki limbo indefinately). I have tried to add as many transwikied pages to existing books as I could. Pages I did not feel comfortable merging myself I listed on the Staff Lounge to encourage others to do so. There were only a few pages that I couldn't think of any book which they could be part of, which I have listed on VFD. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 00:17, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

: I want to make this perfectly clear: ''These are not stubs.'' I think stubs are great. Wikibooks would not have gotten very far if we had always deleted stubs, and we should definately keep them. These are complete guides, at least that's what I think. The VFD was supposed to decide whether I was wrong in thinking these are complete guides and if we can turn these pages into books. I thought I made that clear. Did you read my two responses on VFD? Thanks for your response, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 16:19, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

I want to remind you that I would like a reply (an answer to my question and whether you agree with me or not) to my responses on VFD. I want to make sure that these things don't go into long off-topic discussions again. I understand if you're busy and can't reply at the moment. Thanks in advance, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 03:14, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

If at all possible, can you reply sometime this week? I have also asked a question on [[Wikibooks talk:How-to textbook guidelines]], and await your reply. 

By the way, can you offer some advice regarding [[Water Resources Directory]]? I've added a clarification to {{tl|spam}} so others don't make my mistake, since the template is no big deal. Can I add that into the enforced [[WB:WIW]]? I don't want the same discussion to happen again and again, so would it be acceptable to codify something that is generally accepted?

One more thing - since you have more knowledge of legal matters than I do, could you take a quick look at my recent PDFs to make sure they are GFDL compliant? 

Sorry for asking so much out of you at once! If you have some time, I would really appreciate your help and advice. Thanks! --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 23:12, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

== A technical question ==

Hi, 

I do not want to get you involved in any way in this Moldovan Wikipedia conflict, which tires almost everyone around here. As you seem to know the way things work around the Wikimedia Foundation and the Board of Trustees, I would like to ask you two questions.

As far as I am aware, the position of a lot of Wikipedians (Romanian and Moldovan mostly) that Moldovan Wikipedia ought to be closed arose a problem that wasn't seriously touched before: closing an existing project. Even currently there is no extensive policy on this point.

This discussion flamed all over Wikipedia and the Wikipedia-I mailing list till, after a vote [1], steward Anthere provided the community with a decision [2] that supported the closure of the Moldovan Wikipedia. This decision was backed up by stewards Angela and Jimbo. It was supposed that steward Brion implement the given decision in the briefest delays. For reasons unknown to me, this didn't happen.

As the decision wasn't implemented, here are the few technical questions that arise for me:

1. Was this decision made by those who have the authority to do this? That is, does this decision mean anything for Wikipedia?

2. Is this decision still valid? That is, is it still implementable (taking into consideration that the main reasons for closing down this project didn't change and the voting results of the potential contributors didn't change either, *and* considering that the current vote on Meta develops in the same way as the previous one)?

I am not for the closure of this project. However, the reticence of the decision makers to accept any compromise solution ([3], for example) that would modify the status quo - the existence of the Moldovan Wikipedia *and* on the mo.wikipedia.org domain -, leaves the closure as the only alternative to somehow dissipate the confusion that planes over the mo.wiki domain.

So, before making any more attempts on the mailing list, I would like to have a clear view on this given decision. 

Thanks in advance, --[[User:Landroni|Landroni]] 18:02, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

:I would like to point out that if Angela, Anthere, and Jimbo have agreed on a course of action, that is by defalt a majority of the board of trustees, and that they were acting in that capacity, not as simply stewards.  So to &quot;freeze&quot; the Moldovian Wikipedia, yeah, they had the authority.  And there is no body of appeal shy of taking this to U.S. Federal District Court and causing a lawsuit against the WMF Foundation (IMHO something that a person would lose as well, BTW).
:As far as is this something valid?  I guess that depends on how you view this whole issue.  Brion created the Moldovian Wikipedia simply as an experiment to create a bunch of Wikipedias and other Wikimedia projects in a bunch of langauges simply because they were viewed (from some notes he had) as legitimate languages and likely to be approved almost automatically if a request for those projects were made.  The wisdom of that action has proven to be fairly accurate, as native speakers of many of those languages (beyond just Moldovian) have indeed become involved with the development of these more obscure languages and indeed have given a good name to Wikipedia as the most linguistically diverse set of written content anywhere in the world.  Besides translations of the Christian Bible, I don't think you can point to anything that has been translated into more languages than the front page of Wikipedia.
:So Modovian was created simply because according to some list Brion had, it was considered a language.  Apparently one user in particular, [[meta:User:Node ue]], who has also added content to other relatively obsure Wikipedia language projects and is also clearly not a native speaker of Romanian or &quot;Modovian&quot;, added considerable content to the Moldovian Wikipedia.  That a few additional people viewed this added content as a legitimate Wikipedia is really where the current status of it is at.  No formal voting process was done to create the Modovian Wikipedia, and it is unfortunately viewed by many Wikimedia users (based on the Meta poll alone) as a major mistake and should never have been created in the first place.  Because this voting process never took place, the same authority to create it (none other than simply having root developer access to the Wikimedia server farm) can also be used to remove it.
:For myself, I think the mere act of creating this language version of Wikipedia is making a political statement that the WMF should stay out of and away from.  I don't know how you can create a NPOV Wikipedia in a language whose very existance is expressing a political point of view.  Explictly, that the Moldovian people were somehow a distinctly different people from Romanians before WWII and were liberated from Romania by the USSR.  Now in terms of what happened after that war and the fact that people in this region treated this as not just a dialectical varient of Romanian but rather a distinct language unto itself is something that should have some weight on if this language edition is to be allowed.  Of course you have to explain why American English vs. British English Wikipedias are not set up either (there are some cultural issues there), as well as other similar project proposals like European Portuguese vs. Brazilian Portuguese.  I would assert that there is more difference between those two dialects of Portuguese than between Moldovian vs. Romanian, but that is something best left up to native speakers.  The whole Latin script vs. Cyrilic script just adds more fuel to the fire and more reasons for contention.  Of course this was by design by the Russians when the whole thing was created in the first place, and unfortunately why this is a protracted political fight dating back to just before WWII.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:39, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
::First of all, in my previous message, I failed to provide you with the appropriate links: here are the [http://mo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Rezultat_alegeri vote summary], the [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2006-March/043897.html decision] and the [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4409 example of a compromise solution] or [http://mcworld.org/McChirilic/?pagina=Limba_moldoveneasc%C4%83 an already working still under construction coversion script]. If there are any other links you would need, please let me know. 

::Now, finally some good news. Basically, we have a decision on the closure of the Moldovan Wikipedia taken by the majority of the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation. It is valid with respect to the similar way this Wikipedia was created (no formal voting involved). 

::Here is the next question that arises: 
::What could be done for this decision to actually get implemented? Apart for Brion to modify the permissions on the Wikimedia server. 

::I would like to know this because, for the Wikipedia-l list the mere sight of a Moldovan-linked thread provokes some kind of an allergy. It is quite normal a reaction, in my opinion: everyone got saturated with the subject. This decision was metioned at least twice in the latest June-July discussion. Still, no one seemed to give any suit to it. Thus, in my understanding of the situation, the Wikipedia-l mailing list is not so suitable a way to solve this issue. At least not at this moment. 

::In your opinion, would it be appropriate - for me, for example - to contact Brion, Anthere, Angela or Jimbo directly? The decision is already ready, and the current Meta poll gives it only more legitimacy. 

::What concerns your personal thoughts, I couldn't have put it clearer than you did, although I have tried several times on the mailing list. Appart from the lacking Neutral Point of View of the Moldovan Wikipedia, it brings about a serious confusion over the language/script currently used in public life in the Republic of Moldova. In my opinion this is the main reason why there are so many dissatisfied persons; Wikipedians and non-Wikipedians alike. 

::I had the curious opportunity to get my hands on a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit_Larousse &quot;Le Larousse pour tous&quot;] that was published somewhere between 1906 and the end of the First World War (my guess would be closer to 1906). I quote: &quot;Moldavie, ancienne principauté danubienne, qui forme actuellement avec la Valachie le royaume de Roumanie.&quot; I am not sure about your proficiency in French, so this would mean &quot;Moldavia, ancient Danubian principality, which currently constitutes together with Wallachia the Kingdom of Romania.&quot; In other words, this states that at that time, in the Western world, Moldavia was considered an ancient Romanian province, with all the logical consequences: history, culture, language, and probably others. (It is worth noting that at that same time Bessarabia was part of the Tsarist Empire.)

::Presently, treating Moldovan as a distinct language is a very courageous approach. There is one contemporary &quot;scientist&quot; promoting it. In this manner, he attracted for himself public disgrace (both in Moldova - I can consider myself an eye-witness - and in Romania). He even published a Moldovan-Romanian dictionary, that no one understands in what circumstances to use, other than writing an article on it in the newspaper or just having a great time amusing yourself finding out what other words you - as a native Moldovan, hence Moldovan speaker - have never ever heard or seen in your life. By the way, even this ''chef d'oeuvre'' promotes Moldovan written in Latin script. As a native Moldovan, I can say that the Moldovan ''spoken'' in Moldova is a bit quite different from the Romanian in vocabulary, pronounciation and lack of proper style, all of this making it a dialect of the Romanian language. The spoken dialect is not writeable. The ''formal, written'' &quot;Moldovan language&quot; (with respect to the Constitution and with some ''minor'' differences) is the Romanian language. Let me just mention that for creating official Governmental documents the &quot;Romanian Explanatory Dictionary (DEX)&quot; is used (again, eye-witness). While the content of mo.wikipedia.org is written in a ''script'' that represents a reality of the past, roughly from 1930 when it was invented for MASSR till 1990 when Moldovans demanded for the script to be reverted to Latin (except certain schools in Transnistria, which are forced to). So here is where the confusion is evident: people get on mo.wikipedia.org and cannot understand what Cyrillic Moldovan has to do with Moldova's (present time Moldova) domain and on the Moldovan Wikipedia. They do not understand what is the point of having a Moldovan Wikipedia ''and'' written in Cyrillic. They thought they got rid of Cyrillic once and for good. They just stand and stare. Like I did, once, one or two years ago. So that under these circumstances, I believe that the current content is not as legitimate as it could have been. 

::As a Moldovan I can difficultly accept that my country be so incorrectly represented on Wikipedia. This is why I would accept any alternative solution: moving content to a certain mo-cyr.wikipedia.org or installing a conversion script on a same certain mo-cyr.wikipedia.org. User mboverlord (if not mistaking anything) told on the list that the existence of mo-cyr would offend to existing conventions, and thus this solution not be viable. Would it be possible for you to explain me whether his reasoning is correct? He didn't find it necessary to explain how would it offend and to what conventions. If it is the naming conventions he was talking about, I believe that such conventions could suffer a bit in order for the confusion over an entire Wikipedia section be dissipated. And for the political statement of the mo.wiki would disappear. The Cyrillic Moldovan language would be treated as an artificial language that once existed, and not as a language inherent to Moldavia/The Republic of Moldova/Moldovans. 

::In my opinion, the domain mo.wikipedia.org ought to disappear, so that no other meaningless confusion be made in the future. Any content present on this domain would be a political statement. Furthermore, if mo.wikipedia.org would contain content written in Latin script, the obvious question about the need of the existence of two separate Romanian language Wikipedias would arise. It would probably be incorrect to install the conversion script on ro.wikipedia.org, as even though - according to Wikipedia policy - the Romanian Wikipedia represents the Romanian language, it also represents the country Romania. And Romania, as a country, had never had to deal with this Cyrillic Moldovan script. If it were a conversion script of the historical [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Cyrillic_alphabet Romanian Cyrillic] to be installed on ro.wikipedia.org, my position would be different. 

::However, as I said the previous time, I wouldn't want to involve you in all this Moldovan debate, so that please feel free to ignore everything that goes beyound my questions. Otherwise, I would be pleased to know what you would have to say regarding my arguments. --[[User:Landroni|Landroni]] 09:54, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
:::I will suggest that if you plan on trying to involve the WMF board in this matter, it would be wise to try and get this issue put onto the agenda of the next board meeting.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to do that directly and easily, as the suggested approach was to [[meta:Wikimedia meeting agendas|add some items onto a page on Meta]], but that page hasn't been updated for more than a year.  I suppose that e-mailing a member of the board directly might be a good idea, as at least the issue can be brought up.  Between all of the votes that you pointed out and the community sentiment from within Modovia itself and Moldovian speakers, I think this is something that does deserve at least a discussion between board members.
:::As for Moldovian being considered a distinct language independent of Romanian, I will have to defer here to linguists and the people who live there themselves.  Pre-WWII Moldovia was a part of Romania, and was taken by Russia in a clear act of hostile agression and imperial expansion.
:::Europeans all speak local dialects (or have spoken) simply because people didn't move around that much in the past and major national languages really are something that is a more modern construction.  You can find this even in Germany, France, and England, where many local languages used to exist but are being pushed aside with the national languages instead.  In a few cases locals are fighting back such as in Wales and Cornwall (for England) trying to push for their local dialect to be recognized, but the national language still is what is used for legal proceedings, daily commerce, and religion.  That Moldovia became an independent country allowing this local dialect to grow and develop on its own, even with Russian support and influence, should be something of note.
:::As I said, this whole thing is really a relic of Cold War politics, and unfortunately that taints all of the discussions here as well.  It would be nice to be able to group the native Modovians together to see what they think, and try to remove the sock puppets and imposters trying to push a political agenda.  That both Romanians and Russians are getting into the argument shows just how political this whole thing has become.  I wish it were just a matter of simply saying that yes, Moldovian is an established and independent language without all of this other BS coming into the picture.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:37, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
::::Roberth, honestly, I am feeling quite pleased to have found someone that has a cool view on this entire matter, and someone who can actually indicate me what can reasonably be done. Next week, I will most probably e-mail Anthere to ask him to put the Moldovan Wikipedia onto the meeting agenda. He was the only one who got out the shadow. I will allow myself to refer to this current discussion. 

::::What concerns the dialect/language argument... As I said earlier, it is currently a very courageous approach for any scientist to treat Moldovan as a language. I will [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects#What_decision_makers_need_to_know quote] user AdiJapan: &quot;The so-called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldovan_language Moldovan language] is the Romanian language. Even the loudest defender of the Moldovan language concept, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasile_Stati Vasile Stati], has [http://www.vremea.net/news/2005-01-13/18:45:35.html agreed] that Moldovan and Romanian are identical in their literary forms.&quot; Present day Moldova (or Bessarabia) is - historically speaking - part of a Romanian region, Moldavia. And as all Romanian regions, it has its own specific dialect. It would be ''incorrect'' to believe that independent Moldova allowed the local dialect to become a full-blown language used in public life. The situation is quite different from Welsh, for example. The Moldovan dialect, rudely put, is a poorly spoken Romanian with the random use of regionalisms, russisms (I want to designate the words of Russian origin that became in public/mass belief Moldovan/Romanian words) and, sometimes, Russian words. This dialect [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldovan-Romanian_dictionary cannot subsist as a language]. It would be reasonably idiotic to push the Moldovan dialect on the television, in the newspapers or in the law making process. On any formal occasion, like a public debate, television appearance or newspaper article, people strive to speak/write a correct Romanian language. It is especially true about the written part. Presently, ''the formal language used in Moldova is the Romanian language''. The State official propaganda can only push for the ''name'' of &quot;Moldovan language&quot; to be used instead of &quot;Romanian language&quot;. Nothing else. And they do it quite poorly, I would say, as even if the Constitution pleads for a &quot;Moldovan language&quot;, my public school always taught Romanian and I received my Baccalaureat diploma describing my proficiency in &quot;Romanian Language and Literatture&quot;. In order to look at this matter from a Western point of view, one could probably take a look at [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects#What_reliable_sources_say_about_Moldovan_Language this material collected from western academic, neutral sources].

::::It wouldn't be so difficult to see what native Moldovans think on this issue. [http://mo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Main_Page The talk page of the Moldovan Wikipedia Main Page] shows clear consternation of users and organisations that have seen this content for the first time (knowledge of Romanian would most probably be necessary). Speaking about organizations, [http://www.timpul.md/Rubric.asp?idIssue=231&amp;idRubric=2708 this newspaper article] criticizes the Moldovan Wikipedia. This should take care of the position of non-Wikipedians. 

::::There are reasonably quite few - in absolute numbers - Moldovan Wikipedians who took a clear position on this matter: on mo.wiki talks, en.wiki talks, Wikimedia talks, Wikipedia-l mailing list, and on the previous vote and the Wikimedia poll. For clarity sake, I will try to decypher the votes only. 

::::The previous vote contained six Moldovan's votes supporting the closure: Moldovan Wikipedia users Pavel, Furculita, AndersoN, landroni, Argos and TS01D. Oleg Alexandrov abstained. Although indifferent to the project's future existence, the latter is for a move of mo.wiki content to a certain mo-cyr.wiki. 

::::The current Wikimedia poll... I do not have the time and possibility to make a complete research. I can say that users TS01D, Pavel, Landroni maintained their vote. Wikimedians Greier, Dmitriid, Basarab, Dacodava, kalatorul (the latter two-three are possible puppets, in my eyes) are also Moldovans. I believe there may be more Moldovans who took part in the vote, but I currently have no means to check it. All of these voted for the closure of the Moldovan Wikipedia. I cannot say much about the votes against the closure, apart from the [http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-Moldovan-wikipedia%3A-hands-waiving-is-not-proof-p5092841.html Moldovanest of Moldovans], aka Mark Williamson. Anyway, except Dmitriid who during time was balancing between the supporting/opposing, he finally set for supporting the closure (under the condition that a conversion script be implemented), I do not recall any Moldovan being for the existence of the Moldovan Wikipedia. Moreover, as it was noted before, Moldovan native speakers never asked for the creation of mo.wiki and neither did they appear around before doubtful content was added by user Node_ue, aka Mark Williamson. And when these appeared, they mainly asked for the deletion of mo.wiki. And as time passes and people find out about mo.wiki, more and more Moldovans are asking for its closure. 

::::So that, generally speaking, Moldovan non-Wikipedians, Wikipedians and Wikimedians are against the existence of the Moldovan Wikipedia. On the mailing list, there was not one Moldovan to plead for its existence. As you suggested, would there be any mean to actually group the mentioned Moldovans (and others I am not very aware of) on a special talk page and see what they have to say about this? By the way, there was one interesting Russian vote supporting the closure: &quot;Support, because no moldavanian opposes this. And I see many russian nationalists voting in oppose, so they only want to subdue moldavanians. --Yaroslav Zolotaryov 09:39, 18 July 2006 (UTC)&quot;. 

::::You also expressed your regret towards the fact that Romanians and Russians get into the debate: while Russian intervention is clearly politically driven, as in its origins Moldavia has ''very little'' to do with Slavic influence, Romanians have some kind of legitimacy. They are directly concerned with the Moldovan Wikipedia, as part of the historic Moldavia is part of Romania and as mo.wiki is written in the Romanian language using another script. However, I would agree that for clarity sake and for keeping out of political agendas, Moldovans only ought to be consulted on the matter. 

::::It should be noted that closure alone is not sufficient to get rid of the confusion over the domain and of the political statement mo.wiki makes. IMO, mo.wiki ought to disappear. Content should either get moved or deleted. A conversion script may get installed somewhere around. 

::::At this moment, I just hope that the Board accept to put this issue onto their agenda and that it take a decision with respect to common sense arguments and the position of Moldovans. --[[User:Landroni|Landroni]] 19:52, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I am planning on calling an actual vote on this policy sometime within the week, and I would like to ask all active wikibookians (or at least the few that I can name off the top of my head) to come in and give some last-minute comments on it. I know that you still have some outstanding criticisms, and I would like to try and address them here:
#I don't think this needs to be a guideline, because it is intentionally vague. It does, however, specificy that votes are determined by concensus, and not by majority rule. The methodology of concensus-driven decisions is one that should be written into official policy.
#You mentioned that 6 weeks is an ideal waiting time to get everybody involved. I think that 6 weeks might be even a bit too long, but to rectify the situation, I altered the policy a little bit to say that the voting should &quot;last long enough to get everybody involved&quot;, and that concensus must remain uncontested for at least 1 week before the vote can be declared. I think these two guidelines will work together to draw out votes to an appropriate length of time (and if we find they dont work in this manner, we can vote to alter the text of the policy to include a set timeframe).
It's no particular secret that I am pushing hard recently to formalize some policy discussions, and I see this policy (in any form) as being a requisite cornerstone to our policy foundation. Any help/comments/suggestions from you would be much appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

Do you genuinely believe what you said on the en.wikiversity IRC channel regarding Wikibooks and deletion? Please don't just mark this off as some unpatriotic anti-Wikibooks attack; I'm truly puzzled as to how someone could possibly have such a view on what has and will transpire on Wikibooks. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 23:37, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

:Actually, yes I do consider much of what has happened on Wikibooks over the past year to be massive culling of content on this project.  To the point of extreme behavior, of which I did fight back against it.  And I believe that in time even more of this type of behavior will manifest itself on Wikibooks until several users get together and draw a line in the sand saying &quot;to here and no more!&quot;  Wikibooks used to be a much more open place for content development over what it has become, particularly with those that strongly insist that Wikibooks is for textbooks only and no more, with the definition being a textbook for an accredited university-level course that goes in depth for a particular topic.  Wikibooks wasn't always this way, and those who are only occasional visitors to Wikibooks are shocked and dismayed at the current tone of this project, especially if they were early contributors to Wikibooks.
:While this is lamenting perhaps, I also am very much disappointed in an apparent anti-new user philosohpy that has also prevailed lately.  I know this is something that takes patience and effort, but it is an attitude that is not common at the moment.  My above comments about this matter pretty much speak for themselves.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:56, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

:: I just don't see that ever happening, and believe it's largely imagined. If I did, I'm sure I would be as upset as you are. Would you mind going into detail on each point? Here's the way I see it:

::; Extreme bahavior
::: Could you please provide an example?
::: Video games in particular - To the best of my knowledge (please correct me if I'm wrong), you believe that video game design/development/programming books are fine on Wikibooks, but video game walkthroughs and manuals are not. I believe you have also said that some users have tried to delete video game design books, and I agree that that would qualify as extreme behavior. But I don't think that anyone other than yourself has even brought up video game design books or considered deleting them. Am I wrong?

::; &quot;massive culling of content&quot;/&quot;the best efforts to delete everything in sight&quot;
::: Most/soon to be all video game walkthroughs and manuals have been culled, yes. But that didn't extend anywhere else. Agreed?
::::No.  It extended well beyond just the video game walk throughs, as even [[Chess]] was strongly suggested to be culled as well as other Wikibooks, including the How-to guides.  Only when I started to challenge the reasoning behind that did anybody stop and wonder what was going on.  I could list many, many other things that have been removed from Wikibooks as well over the past year, including some stuff that I will openly admit needed to be removed.  And much of this was done without VfDs.

::; &quot;those that strongly insist that Wikibooks is for textbooks only and no more, with the definition being a textbook for an accredited university-level course that goes in depth for a particular topic&quot; 
::: Who has such a stringent view on Wikibooks' scope? I can't think of anyone. I believe the concensus is that all educational books are acceptable, including how-to books. Even Jimbo has said that the &quot;books must be on subjects taught at accredited institutions&quot; policy should be treated as liberally as possible. That would include much more than &quot;university-level&quot; books or what is considered traditional school textbooks.
::::I am demonstrating absurdity here by being absurd.  The point I'm making here is that Wikibooks being defined as only textbooks is a slippery slope when there is no clear definition, and to delete content under the rationale that &quot;it is not a textbook&quot; (this has been done via speedy delete BTW, and I can cite individual cases) allows admins to delete just about anything they don't agree with from a strong POV on the part of the admin.  I believe this to be abusive admins who do this, which is why I explictly have demanded that deletion of content on the grounds of not being a textbook must be offered as a VfD instead.  Even then, my votes on the VfD page speak for themselves.

::; &quot;Wikibooks used to be a much more open place for content development over what it has become&quot; 
::: On foundation-l one year ago, you said, &quot;Certainly Wikibooks is drifting away from the &quot;pure textbook&quot; philosophy that it started out as, and is becoming more of an original non-fiction book repository.&quot; Would you agree that it has gone a tad too far? To the best of my knowledge, everyone related to this issue believes that Wikibooks should include much more than traditional &quot;pure textbooks&quot; but not all non-fiction works. Do you not think that we are headed towards that middle-ground?
::::No.  Jimbo deliberately set up some sort of very obscure and fuzzy definitions for what should be and should not be on Wikibooks.  This fuzziness is exactly what is causing the problems here, as no two people can possibly agree on that definition, and Jimbo doesn't want to referee the issue either.  I am attacking that fuzzy definition itself, even though there are many individuals who are not willing to stand up against Jimbo but instead are capitulating and then using the name of &quot;Jimbo says...&quot; acting and enforcing ideas that aren't even policy.  Some of this is also a huge reluctance on the part of the WMF to setting up alternative projects like Wikiversity, even for very well thought out ideas that have a clear scope to them.  Wikibooks in the past has been used repeatedly as a sort of &quot;seed wiki&quot; for testing new ideas on how to use a wiki, and that attitude was encouraged for some time.  The experience with [[Wikijunior]] and [[Wikimania]] prove that even &quot;people who should know better&quot; (read board members here) are willing to use Wikibooks as a seed wiki and ignore the textbook-only idea as well.  With the [[incubator:|Incubator Wiki]] now up as a seperate project, I think that will be more a thing of the past, but we still have remenants of that philosohpy here.

::; &quot;an apparent anti-new user philosohpy that has also prevailed lately&quot;
::: Really? I'm especially surprised by this statement. Where did you get that idea? I personnally have done everything I could think of to encourage new users to contribute (and I'm planning on soon proposing a new books page/resources center with less confusing explanations similar to [[fr:Wikilivres:Nouveaux livres|this page]], btw), and I don't think anyone else has cared about or done anything relating to new users recently, positive or negative.

:: Again, if all of this were true, I would be as upset as you are. Thanka in advance for responding to all my questions. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 01:50, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

[[User:Hagindaz]] has suggested that [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]] should be merged with [[VB6 Command Reference]]?  I think that a better course would be for the contributor to [[VB6 Command Reference]] to add to [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]].  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 13:56, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

:I meant that [[VB6 Command Reference]] should either be added as an appendix to [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]], or have any useful content added to [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]], then redirected. I found [[VB6 Command Reference]] as an orphaned module. Since both books are on the same subject, so I don't think there is any reason to have them both exist as separate books. I'm sorry I wasn't clear, you can't add notes to {{tl|merge}}. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 17:27, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

To make sure there are no other conflicts. For example, two mysql jdbc drivers in the tomcat/lib makes this exception, too.

== Server Issues ==
=== Web Servers that don't support JSP 2.0 ===
==== ZK 3.0 or later ====
ZK allows developers to use EL expressions, but it doesn't require the Web server to support JSP 2.0. 
ZK actually doesn't depend on JSP any more.

==== ZK 2.4 or earlier ====
For those who use older version of ZK (before 3.0), it is possible to configure an old Web server to support JSP 2.0 as described [http://wiki.apache.org/myfaces/Installation_and_Configuration MyFaces's Installation].

The basic idea is to copy jsp-api.jar to the proper directory, which depends on the Web server. For example, the directory is common/lib if Tomcat 4.1.x is used.

If you find a way to enable ZK on an old Web server, don't hesitate to share the information with us by adding them the proper section above.

The jsp-api.jar file can be found in Tomcat's download, or [http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/zk1/trunk/dist/lib/ext ZK Subversion].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a spot to help with the development of various tools that can help make Wikibooks a better place.

For now, see also [[w:Wikipedia:Tools]] for some ideas, but there are some other projects that should be strongly considered.

== Proposed Projects ==

=== [[Wikibooks:Top active]] replacement ===

This is a useful page that was even listed on the [[Main Page]] until it was no longer maintained.  As can be seen the last update was on March, 2005 (over a year ago).

=== [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]] tools ===

This is a generation of cataloging pages under multiple schema that can be automatically generated as new books are added.

=== List of contributors ===

Trying to identify all of the contributors to a whole Wikibook is currently a very tedious process of scanning the edit histories of all of the modules.  A very useful tool to conform to the requirements of the GFDL for republication would be to automate this process, perhaps with edit counts of all of the users on all of the pages in a Wikibook, or even scanning page histories to see what the quantity of added text is for each user, to determine how significant of a contributor each user has been.  Culling blocked users from this list (i.e. vandalism) might also be a feature.

=== General Wikibooks stats ===

Ranking Wikibooks by size, number of pages, number of contributors, number of edits, and other criteria might be useful in terms of what is a significant Wikibook and what might be useful to include in the Hot Picks list on the main page.  Some people are just stat junkies as well, so they might just have some fun with this sort of information.</text>

==The Examples==

===Example 1 - Basic arithmetic operators===
This example makes use of the five basic '''operators''' used in mathematical expressions.  These are the foundation of all mathematical and string operations performed in PHP.
{|style=&quot;text-align:center; width:60em&quot;
|-style=&quot;font-size:larger&quot;
| &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| add            || subtract       || multiply       || divide         || assign 
|}
The five mathematical operators all function identically to those found in [[Subject:C++ programming language|C++]] and [[Subject:Java programming language|Java]]

{{Code:PHPHTML
|Examine this example.  Each mathematical expression to the right of the ''assign'' operator is evaluated, using the normal order of operations.  When the expression has been evaluated, the resultant value is assigned to the variable named to the left of the ''assign'' operator.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $x = 25;
  $y = 10;
  $z = $x + $y;
  echo $z;

  echo &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
  $z = $x / $y;
  echo $z;

  echo &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
  $z = $y * $y * $x;
  echo $z - 1250;
  echo &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;35&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;2.5&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;1250&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;
35
2.5
1250
&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}


{{Code:Tip
|'''Note''': If you are not familiar with (X)HTML, you may not know the purpose of this part of the above code:
|&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;&lt;/pre&gt;
|Its purpose is to insert an HTML &quot;line break&quot; between the results, causing the browser to display each result on a new line when rendering the page. In the absence of this line, the above code would instead print:

&lt;pre&gt;352.51250&lt;/pre&gt;

This is of course not the desired result.
}}


There are two code options which perform the opposite of the assign (=) operator.  The keyword '''null''' should be used for variable nullification, which is actually used &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; the assign (=) operator in place of a value. If you want to destroy a variable, the '''unset()''' language construct is available.


{{Code:Alt
|Examples:
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$variable = null;&lt;/source&gt;
|or
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;unset($variable);&lt;/source&gt;
|
}}

=== Example 2 - String concatenation ===
This example demonstrates the ''concatenation'' operator (&lt;code&gt;'''.'''&lt;/code&gt;), which joins together two strings, producing one string consisting of both parts.  It is analogous to the plus (&lt;code&gt;'''+'''&lt;/code&gt;) operator commonly found in C++ [[C++ Programming/Code/IO/Streams/string|string class]] (''see [[C++ Programming/STL|STL]]''), Python, Java, JavaScript implementations.

{{Code:Basic
|The statement
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$string = $string . &quot; &quot; . &quot;All the cool kids are doing it.&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;
|prepends the current value of &lt;code&gt;$string&lt;/code&gt; (which is &quot;PHP is wonderful and great.&quot;) to the literal string &quot; All the cool kids are doing it.&quot; and assigns this new string to &lt;code&gt;$string&lt;/code&gt;.
}}

{{Code:Output
|
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $string = &quot;PHP is wonderful and great.&quot;;
  $string = $string . &quot; &quot; . &quot;All the cool kids are doing it.&quot;;
  echo $string;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;PHP is wonderful and great. All the cool kids are doing it.&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}

As we all know, or for those new to programming will soon find it, programmers are always searching for &quot;tighter code&quot;.  Simply put, we pride ourselves in doing the most work with the fewest keystrokes. With that in mind, here's a trick that can save those precious keystrokes: concatenate and assign at the same time. It's easy. Let's take the same example as above.

{{Code:Output
|
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $string = &quot;PHP is wonderful and great.&quot;;
  $string .= &quot; &quot; . &quot;All the cool kids are doing it.&quot;;
  echo $string;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;PHP is wonderful and great. All the cool kids are doing it.&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}

You just saved 8 keystrokes with the exact same output. Big deal? Imagine having to do that with 100 lines of template code like I did recently. Yes, it's a big deal. By the way, if you change the implementation without changing the output, that's known as refactoring. Get comfy with that term. You'll be using it a lot. See more examples of compound assignments below.

===Example 3 - Shortcut operators ===
This snippet demonstrates self-referential shortcut operators.  The first such operator is the ++ operator, which increments $x (using the postfix form) by 1 giving it the value 2.  After incrementing $x, $y is defined and assigned the value 5.  

The second shortcut operator is *=, which takes $y and assigns it the value $y * $x, or 10.  

After initializing $z to 180, the subsequent line performs two shortcut operations.  Going by order of operations (see manual page below), $y is decremented (using the prefix form) and divided into $z.  $z is assigned to the resulting value, 20.


{{Code:Output
|
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $x = 1;
  $x++;
  echo $x . &quot; &quot;;
  $y = 5;
  $y *= $x;
  echo $y . &quot; &quot;;
  $z = 180;
  $z /= --$y;
  echo $z;
?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;2 10 20&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}

{{Code:Tip
|Note: The expanded version of the above code (without the shortcut operators) looks like this:
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $x = 1;
  $x = $x + 1;
  echo $x . &quot; &quot;;
  $y = 5;
  $y = $y * $x;
  echo $y . &quot; &quot;;
  $z = 180;
  $y = $y - 1;
  $z = $z / $y;
  echo $z;
?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
|The output is the same as seen in the above example.
}}

==New Concepts==

===Operators===

An operator is any symbol used in an expression used to manipulate data.  The seven basic PHP operators are:

* &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; (assignment)
* &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; (addition)
* &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; (subtraction)
* &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; (multiplication)
* &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; (division)
* &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; (modulus)
* &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; (concatenation)

In addition, each of the above operators can be combined with an assignment operation, creating the operators below: 

* &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; (addition assignment)
* &lt;code&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt; (subtraction assignment)
* &lt;code&gt;*=&lt;/code&gt; (multiplication assignment)
* &lt;code&gt;/=&lt;/code&gt; (division assignment)
* &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt; (modulus assignment)
* &lt;code&gt;.=&lt;/code&gt; (concatenation assignment)

These operators are used when a variable is added, subtracted, multiplied or divided by a second value and subsequently assigned to itself.

{{Code:Alt
|In other words, the statements
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$var = $var + 5;&lt;/source&gt;
|and
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$var += 5;&lt;/source&gt;
|are equivalent.
}}

There are also increment and decrement operators in PHP.

* &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; (increment)
* &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; (decrement)

These are a special case of the addition and subtraction assignment operators.

{{Code:Output
|This code uses the addition assignment operator to increment and decrement a variable.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$var = 0;

$var += 1;
echo &quot;The incremented value is $var.\n&quot;;

$var -= 1;
echo &quot;The decremented value is $var.\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;
The incremented value is 1.
The decremented value is 0.
&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}
While this is perfectly legal in PHP, it is somewhat lengthy for an operation as common as this.  It can easily be replaced by the increment operator, shortening the statement.
{{Code:Output
|This code snippet uses the increment and decrement operators to increase and decrease a variable's value by one.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$var = 3;

$var++;
echo &quot;The incremented value is $var.\n&quot;;

$var--;
echo &quot;The decremented value is $var.\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;
The incremented value is 4.
The decremented value is 3.
&lt;/pre&gt;
|Using the increment operator makes your code slightly easier to read and understand.
}}

For a more in-depth overview of PHP's operators, including an explanation of bitwise operators, refer to the manual link below.

====Precedence====
Precedence determines the priority given to certain operators to be performed earlier in a statement. If an operator has higher precedence, it doesn't mean that it is of greater importance; the opposite can often be true.

;Associativity
When multiple operators occur that have the same precedence (whether multiple instances of the same operator or just different operators with the same precedence), it becomes important to consider the associativity: whether right (to left), left (to right), or non-associative.

;Examples where associativity is irrelevant

In certain cases (as in the example below), especially where the same operator is present, the associativity may make no difference to the result. 

The following...
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$a = 5*2*3*4; // Equals 120&lt;/source&gt;

...with its left associativity is equivalent to:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$a = (((5*2)*3)*4); // Equals 120&lt;/source&gt;

However, in this case, right associativity would have produced the same result:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$a = (5*(2*(3*4))); // Would also equal 120&lt;/source&gt;

;Examples where associativity is relevant in PHP (but not mathematically)

In mathematics, it may be considered irrelevant in which direction a calculation is performed for operators with the same precedence.

For example, the following...
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$a = 5+3-2+8; // Equals 14&lt;/source&gt;

...is equivalent to this (left associative) statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$a = (((5+3)-2)+8); // Equals 14&lt;/source&gt;

And, if this were considered according to human conventions in mathematical calculations, the following equivalent right associative expression would produce the same result:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$a = (5+(3+(-2+8))); // Would also equal 14&lt;/source&gt;

However, since we are dealing with a linear computer language which doesn't know to convert the &quot;2&quot; into a negative number and group it with the &quot;8&quot; before adding it to the &quot;3&quot; (and then the &quot;5&quot;), if PHP were to perform the following expression in a strict right associative manner, the following (mistaken) outcome would occur:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$a = (5+(3-(2+8))); // Would equal -2&lt;/source&gt;

Thus, the associativity is relevant and should be memorized (though it is generally good practice to make one's groupings explicit anyhow&amp;mdash;both to avoid mistakes and to improve readability for others looking at the code).

Similar problems occur with multiplication and division. Although with human convention, all adjacent multiplication and division groups would have the multiplication performed at the numerator level and the division at the denominator level, the PHP interpreter does not know to do this, so it is bound to set the left(-to-right) convention when explicit groupings (via parentheses&amp;mdash;which have highest precedence) have not been made:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$a = 5 * 4 / 2 * 3; // Equals 30&lt;/source&gt;

This is equivalent to the left associative:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$a = (((5 * 4) / 2) * 3); // Also equals 30&lt;/source&gt;

However, as with the addition/subtraction example above, performing this by right associativity (in a strictly reverse linear fashion) does not produce the same (intended) result:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$a = (5 * (4 / (2 * 3))); // Equals 3.33333&lt;/source&gt;

==Newline and Other Special Characters==

Both of the below examples make use of the '''newline''' character ('''\n, \r\n or \r''', basing on the OS) to signify the end of the current line and the beginning of a new one.


{{Code:Output
|The newline is used as follows:
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;echo &quot;PHP is cool,\nawesome,\nand great.&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;PHP is cool,
awesome,
and great.&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}

'''Notice:''' the line break occurs in the output wherever the '''\n''' occurs in the string in the echo statement. However, a '''\n''' does not produce a newline when the HTML document is displayed in a web browser. This is because the PHP engine does not render the script.  Instead, the PHP engine outputs HTML code, which is subsequently rendered by the web browser.  The linebreak &lt;b&gt;\n&lt;/b&gt; in the PHP script becomes HTML whitespace, which is skipped when the web browser renders it (much like the whitespace in a PHP script is skipped when the PHP engine generates HTML).  This does not mean that the '''\n''' operator is useless; it can be used to add whitespace to your HTML, so if someone views the HTML generated by your PHP script they'll have an easier time reading it.

In order to insert a line-break that will be rendered by a web browser, you must instead use the &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; tag to break a line.

'''Notice:''' The newline is \n for Linux/Unix-based systems, \r\n for Windows and \r for Mac's.
{{Code:Basic
|Therefore the statement above would be altered like so:
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;echo 'PHP is cool,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;awesome&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;and great.';&lt;/source&gt;
|
}}

The function '''nl2br()''' is available to automatically convert newlines in a string to &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; tags.  

{{Code:PHPHTML
|The string must be passed through the function, and then reassigned:
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$string = &quot;This\ntext\nbreaks\nlines.&quot;;
$string = nl2br($string);
print $string;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;
This&lt;br /&gt;
text&lt;br /&gt;
breaks&lt;br /&gt;
lines.
&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;
This
text
breaks
lines.
&lt;/pre&gt;
|Additionally, the PHP output (HTML source code) generated by the above example includes linebreaks.
}}

Other special characters include the ASCII '''NUL''' ('''\0''') - used for padding binary files, '''tab''' ('''\t''') - used to display a standard tab, and '''return''' ('''\r''') - signifying a carriage return. Again, these characters do not change the rendering of your HTML since they add whitespace to the HTML source. In order to have tabs and carriage returns rendered in the final web page, &amp;amp;tab; should be used for tabs and &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; should be used for a carriage return.

== Input to PHP ==

PHP has a set of functions that retrieve input.  If you are using standard input (such as that from a command-line), it is retrieved using the basic input functions:
{{Code:Alt
|Reading from standard input:
| &lt;pre&gt;
$mystring = fgets($stdin);
&lt;/pre&gt;
|Or: 
| &lt;pre&gt;
$stdin = fopen('php://stdin', 'r'); // opens standard input
$line = fgets($stdin); // reads until user presses ENTER
&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}

=== Web servers ===
On web servers, information sent to a PHP app may either be a GET operation or a POST operation. 

For a GET operation, the parameters are sent through the address bar. Parameters within the bar may be retrieved by using accessing &lt;code&gt;$_GET['parameter']&lt;/code&gt;.  On a POST operation, submitted input is accessed by &lt;code&gt;$_POST['parameter']&lt;/code&gt;.

A more generic array, &lt;code&gt;$_REQUEST['parameter']&lt;/code&gt; contains the contents of &lt;code&gt;$_GET&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$_POST&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;$_COOKIE&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Control Systems/Page|System Specifications|Compensators}}

== Controllers ==

There are a number of different standard types of control systems that have been studied extensively. These controllers, specifically the P, PD, PI, and PID controllers are very common in the production of physical systems, but as we will see they each carry several drawbacks.

== Proportional Controllers ==

[[Image:P-controller-symbol-2.svg|center|framed|A Proportional controller block diagram]]

Proportional controllers are simply gain values. These are essentially multiplicative coefficients, usually denoted with a ''K''. A P controller can only force the system poles to a spot on the system's root locus. A P controller cannot be used for arbitrary pole placement.

We refer to this kind of controller by a number of different names: proportional controller, gain, and zeroth-order controller.

== Derivative Controllers ==

[[Image:D-controller-symbol-2.svg|center|framed|A Proportional-Derivative controller block diagram]]

In the Laplace domain, we can show the derivative of a signal using the following notation:

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = \mathcal{L} \left\{ f'(t) \right\} = sF(s) - f(0)&lt;/math&gt;

Since most systems that we are considering have zero initial condition, this simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = \mathcal{L} \left\{ f'(t) \right\} = sF(s)&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative controllers are implemented to account for future values, by taking the derivative, and controlling based on where the signal is going to be in the future. Derivative controllers should be used with care, because even small amount of high-frequency noise can cause very large derivatives, which appear like amplified noise. Also, derivative controllers are difficult to implement perfectly in hardware or software, so frequently solutions involving only integral controllers or proportional controllers are preferred over using derivative controllers.

Notice that derivative controllers are not proper systems, in that the order of the numerator of the system is greater than the order of the denominator of the system. This quality of being a non-proper system also makes certain mathematical analysis of these systems difficult. 

=== Z-Domain Derivatives ===

We won't derive this equation here, but suffice it to say that the following equation in the Z-domain performs the same function as the Laplace-domain derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;D(z) = \frac{z - 1}{Tz}&lt;/math&gt;

Where T is the sampling time of the signal.

== Integral Controllers ==

[[Image:I-controller-symbol-2.svg|center|framed|A Proportional-Integral Controller block diagram]]

To implemenent an Integral in a Laplace domain transfer function, we use the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left\{ \int_0^t f(t)\, dt \right\} = {1 \over s}F(s)&lt;/math&gt;

Integral controllers of this type add up the area under the curve for past time. In this manner, a PI controller (and eventually a PID) can take account of the past performance of the controller, and correct based on past errors.

=== Z-Domain Integral ===

The integral controller can be implemented in the Z domain using the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;D(z) = \frac{z + 1}{z - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

== PID Controllers ==

[[Image:PID.png|thumb|right|A block diagram of a PID controller]]

PID controllers are combinations of the proportional, derivative, and integral controllers. Because of this, PID controllers have large amounts of flexibility. We will see below that there are definite limites on PID control.

{{-}}

=== PID Transfer Function ===

The transfer function for a standard PID controller is an addition of the Proportional, the Integral, and the Differential controller transfer functions (hence the name, PID). Also, we give each term a gain constant, to control the weight that each factor has on the final output:

{{eqn|PID}}
:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = K_p + {K_i \over s} + K_d s&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that we can write the transfer function of a PID controller in a slightly different way:

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = \frac{A_0 + A_1s}{B_0 + B_1s}&lt;/math&gt;

This form of the equation will be especially useful to us when we look at polynomial design.

=== PID Signal flow diagram ===

[[Image:pid.jpg|center|Signal flow diagram for a PID controller]]

=== PID Tuning ===

The process of selecting the various coefficient values to make a PID controller perform correctly is called '''PID Tuning'''. There are a number of different methods for determining these values:&lt;ref&gt;Seborg, Dale E.; Edgar, Thomas F.; Mellichamp, Duncan A. (2003). Process Dynamics and Control, Second Edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons,Inc. ISBN 0471000779&lt;/ref&gt;


1) Direct Synthesis (DS) method

2) Internal Model Control (IMC) method

3) Controller tuning relations

4) Frequency response techniques

5) Computer simulation

6) On-line tuning after the control system is installed

7)Trial and error


'''Notes:'''

&lt;references /&gt;

=== Digital PID ===

In the Z domain, the PID controller has the following transfer function:

{{eqn|Digital PID}}
:&lt;math&gt;D(z) = K_p + K_i \frac{T}{2} \left[ \frac{z + 1}{z - 1} \right] + K_d \left[ \frac{z - 1}{Tz} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

And we can convert this into a canonical equation by manipulating the above equation to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;D(z) = \frac{a_0 + a_1 z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2}}{1 + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = K_p + \frac{K_i T}{2} + \frac{K_d}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a_1 = -K_p + \frac{K_i T}{2} + \frac{-2 K_d}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a_2 = \frac{K_d}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b_1 = -1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Once we have the Z-domain transfer function of the PID controller, we can convert it into the digital time domain:

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = x[n]a_0 + x[n-1]a_1 + x[n-2]a_2 - y[n-1]b_1 - y[n-2]b_2&lt;/math&gt;

And finally, from this difference equation, we can create a digital filter structure to implement the PID.

== Bang-Bang Controllers ==

Despite the low-brow sounding name of the Bang-Bang controller, it is a very useful tool that is only really available using digital methods. A better name perhaps for a bang-bang controller is an on/off controller, where a digital system makes decisions based on target and threshold values, and decides whether to turn the controller on and off. Bang-bang controllers are a non-linear style of control that this book might consider in more detail in future chapters.

Consider the example of a household furnace. The oil in a furnace burns at a specific temperature -- it can't burn hotter or cooler. To control the temperature in your house then, the thermostat control unit decides when to turn the furnace on, and when to turn the furnace off. This on/off control scheme is a bang-bang controller.

== Compensation ==

There are a number of different compensation units that can be employed to help fix certain system metrics that are outside of a proper operating range. Most commonly, the phase characteristics are in need of compensation, especially if the magnitude response is to remain constant.

== Phase Compensation ==

Occasionally, it is necessary to alter the phase characteristics of a given system, without altering the magnitude characteristics. To do this, we need to alter the frequency response in such a way that the phase response is altered, but the magnitude response is not altered. To do this, we implement a special variety of controllers known as '''phase compensators'''. They are called compensators because they help to improve the phase response of the system.

There are two general types of compensators: '''Lead Compensators''', and '''Lag Compensators'''. If we combine the two types, we can get a special '''Lead-Lag Compensator''' system.

When designing and implementing a phase compensator, it is important to analyze the effects on the gain and phase margins of the system, to ensure that compensation doesn't cause the system to become unstable.
phase lead compensation:-
1 it is same as addition of zero to open loop TF since from pole zero point of view zero is nearer to origin than pole hence effect of zero dominant.

== Phase Lead ==

The transfer function for a lead-compensator is as follows:
{{eqn|Lead Compensator}}
:&lt;math&gt;T_{lead}(s) = \frac{s-z}{s-p} &lt;/math&gt;

To make the compensator work correctly, the following property must be satisfied:

:&lt;math&gt;| z | &lt; | p |&lt;/math&gt;

And both the pole and zero location should be close to the origin, in the LHP. Because there is only one pole and one zero, they both should be located on the real axis.

Phase lead compensators help to shift the poles of the transfer function to the left, which is beneficial for stability purposes.

== Phase Lag ==

The transfer function for a lag compensator is the same as the lead-compensator, and is as follows:

{{eqn|Lag Compensator}}
:&lt;math&gt;T_{lag}(s) = \frac{s-z}{s-p} &lt;/math&gt;

However, in the lag compensator, the location of the pole and zero should be swapped:

:&lt;math&gt;| p | &lt; | z |&lt;/math&gt;

Both the pole and the zero should be close to the origin, on the real axis.

The Phase lag compensator helps to improve the steady-state error of the system. The poles of the lag compensator should be very close together to help prevent the poles of the system from shifting right, and therefore reducing system stability.

== Phase Lead-Lag ==

{{Wikipedia|Lead-lag compensator}}

The transfer function of a '''lead-lag compensator''' is simply a multiplication of the lead and lag compensator transfer functions, and is given as:

{{eqn|Lead-Lag Compensator}}
:&lt;math&gt; T_{lead-lag}(s) = \frac{(s-z_1)(s-z_2)}{(s-p_1)(s-p_2)}. &lt;/math&gt;

Where typically the following relationship must hold true:

:&lt;math&gt;| p_1 | &gt; | z_1 | &gt; | z_2 | &gt; | p_2 | &lt;/math&gt;

==Selecting a design==
The design (layout) involved for this project might just be the most difficult part of the whole process.  

Your first boatbuilding project should be simple and inexpensive, yet the boat needs to be useful when it is finished. The balance between these criteria is an individual decision. The Internet is a great place to start when looking for a design. A site I found useful for free design information was [http://home.clara.net/gmatkin/design.htm http://home.clara.net/gmatkin/design.htm]. 

In my case I chose the &quot;Dug&quot;, designed by Hannu Vartiala. Free plans are available on the web at Hannu's Boatyard: [http://koti.kapsi.fi/hvartial http://koti.kapsi.fi/hvartial].

[[Image:Dug canoe.JPG]]

I chose the Dug because I wanted something simple and inexpensive as my first boatbuilding project. It is made from a single sheet of plywood so it doesn’t get any cheaper, and the design on the website looked easy to follow.

I modified the design to use 3mm plywood rather than 6mm. Not only was the thinner ply cheaper, but it was much lighter. It also gave me the opportunity to experiment with fitting gunwales.
The finished product was a one person canoe. I can pick up and carry this boat easily by myself and it practically floats on wet grass. It is perfect for fishing in the shallow rivers around the headwaters of the Murray Darling system in Queensland, Australia.

The Dug was '''my''' choice, though. Your own choice of design for your first boatbuilding project may well be different.

==Plywood==

Plywood is a man made construction material. It usually consists of an odd number of layers of thin timber veneer glued together with the grain of alternate layers running at 90° to each other. The outermost layers are termed the ''faces''. Since these are the only visible layers, the appearance of each face is subject to standard specification. In Australia each face of a plywood sheet is described by a code letter:

* '''A''' — a high quality appearance grade veneer suitable for clear finishing.
 
* '''S''' — an appearance grade veneer which permits natural characteristics such as knots as a decorative feature subject to agreement. 

* '''B''' — an appearance grade suitable for high quality paint finishing. 

* '''C''' — a non-appearance grade with a solid surface. All open defects such as knot holes or splits are filled. 

* '''D''' — a non-appearance grade with permitted open imperfections. Limited numbers of knots and knot holes up to 75 mm wide are permitted.

Marine plywood that meets the AS/NZS 2272 standard has two A grade faces and an A or B grade core. 

In the USA some manufacturers use a letter code for the &quot;front&quot; face and a corresponding number for the &quot;back&quot; face, i.e. a code of AB in Australia may be specified as A3 in the USA.

Typical applications using this grading standard are AA for marine plywood, AD for a wall cladding where only the front face of the plywood is visible, CD for structural plywood flooring and DD for structural bracing. 

The adhesive used to bond together the laminations in the ply is of paramount importance to boatbuilders. There are four standard glue ratings:

* '''Type A''' bond is produced from a phenol-formaldehyde resin [PF] which sets permanently under controlled heat and pressure. It forms a permanent bond that will not deteriorate under wet conditions, heat or cold. It is readily recognisable by its black colour. Type A bond is specified in AS/NZS 2272 for marine plywood. 

* '''Type B''' bond is produced from melamine fortified urea-formaldehyde resin [MF] which sets under controlled heat and pressure. 

* '''Type C''' and '''Type D''' bonds are interior use bonds produced from urea-formaldehyde resin [UF] and should not be used in boatbuilding.

Plywood for boatbuilding is traditionally purchased in 8 foot x 4 foot sheets. In metric this rounds out to 2400mm x 1200mm. 

It is apparent from these dimensions that it is necessary to join plywood sheets together to build even the simplest of boats.


===Exterior grade ply===

'''Exterior ply''' is manufactured in accordance with AS/NZS2271 from a variety of materials including hardwoods and decorative veneer facings such as Sapele, White Ash, Teak, or inlaid Teak and Beech.

It is not manufactured to the same engineering standards as marine ply but is often quite suitable for a first boatbuilding project. The glues used between the layers are the same as those used in marine ply so delamination should not be a problem

Exterior grade ply may have one &quot;good&quot; face and the other of lesser grade, for example AB.
The &quot;Dug&quot;, my first boat, was constructed using exterior grade ply in pacific maple.

===Marine ply===

Marine ply is an engineering product that must comply with published standards. In Australia the relevant standard is AS/NZS2272. In the USA, the UK and other parts of the world the BS1088 standard may be used to specify marine ply. These standards detail practically every aspect of the composition and performance of marine ply. If you are going to build a seaworthy boat, or a boat that must meet survey standards, use of a certified marine ply is essential.

In the Australian/ New Zealand Standards system for veneers and bonds marine plywood has a grading of '''AA - A bond''' and should have the 'PAA Tested marine' stamp applied to the sheet. If it is not stamped then it is likely to be material which has not passed final inspection.

Some examples of marine ply available in Australia are:

* Hoop Pine: AS 2272 Standard, Australian made premium plywood. 
* Gaboon: BS1088 and BS3655 Standards, light weight plywood having Lloyds Register certification. 
* Mahogany: BS1088 Standard, premium plywood 
* Pacific Maple: BS1088 Standard, the most economical but slightly heavier plywood.
* Cortech: Balsa-cored plywood, has a very high stiffness to weight and strength to weight ratio. For use in boat hulls, decks etc.
* Veneered Plywood:  Waterproof plywood with teak, ash and sapelli decorative veneer. Also teak/ash striped plywood for boat soles and decks.

===Joining Plywood sheets===

Plywood for boatbuilding is traditionally purchased in 8 foot x 4 foot sheets. In metric this rounds out to 2400mm x 1200mm. It is apparent from these dimensions that it is necessary to join plywood sheets together to build even the simplest of boats.

Two methods are commonly used to join plywood sheets together:

* The butt joint
* The scarf joint

The butt joint is by far the easiest to make. It is formed by applying liquid epoxy to the edges of the sheets to be joined, pushing them together and gluing a strip of ply to one or both sides of the seam. 

[[Image:Buttjoint.jpg]]

A variation is to use fibreglass tape instead of the strip of ply. Once the epoxy has cured the join is stronger than the plywood sheets themselves and the wood will fail under stress before the epoxy of the joint.

'''Hint''': Epoxy does not stick to polyethylene. Laying down a sheet of polyethylene film, such as a disposable painters drop sheet, can save the embarrassment of gluing your work to the floor when joining sheets.You can also use baking paper for this purpose if polyethylene is not available.

==Lofting==

Lofting is the process of taking the dimensions from a plan and drawing full size components on the construction materials.[[Image:Lofting.jpg|framed|Using the lofting batten]]

Sometimes the designer provides the necessary measurements in the form of a table, but sometimes it is necessary to take the measurements directly from the drawing and scale them up to life size.

First a ''centre line'' is marked, then series of ''station lines'' are drawn on the ply at regular intervals 90° to the centre line using a set square. Station lines may be drawn every 10cm for example. The distances either side of the centre line at each station line are determined from the plans and marked on the ply as reference marks. Finally smooth ''lofting lines'' are drawn through the reference marks. A straight edge such as a steel ruler may be used for straight lines and the lofting batten is used for smooth curves. It is helpful to temporarily drive panel pins into some of the reference marks to ensure the lofting batten follows the correct curve. 

Once the lofting process is complete the lofting lines are used as cutting guides when the components are cut from the sheet.

==Epoxy==
Epoxy is the material that makes wooden boatbuilding possible for the average person. It is used as an adhesive, a structural component, and to seal the wood to stop it absorbing water.

Wikipedia has an article about epoxy at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy].

===The WEST System===

The ''Wood Epoxy Saturation Technique'', or WEST system, is a technique for sealing a wooden boat against the ingress of moisture. A thin layer of liquid epoxy is applied to the wood like paint. Some of the epoxy is absorbed into the grain and the pore structure of the wood while the epoxy is a liquid and when it hardens the wood is effectively protected by a moisture proof barrier.

The WEST System is a generic boatbuilding technique, but also a registered trade name for a brand of epoxy products manufactured under license from [http://www.gougeon.com Gougeon Brothers, Inc. USA]. The Gougeon Brothers developed the epoxy coating of the original WEST system in conjunction with DOW Chemicals in the late 1960s. Since that time epoxy systems, including the WEST System brand, have undergone significant development. Today there is a wide range of manufacturers offering epoxy systems for wooden boatbuilding. A web search using the term ''boat building epoxy'' will return thousands of references, tailoring the search for your own location should return more than enough local epoxy manufacturers to choose from.

A word of warning however. Not all epoxy formulations are suitable for sealing a wooden boat against moisture. Marine coating epoxies generally do not include organic solvents or thinners. They may be described as ''high solids'' epoxies. The reason is that organic molecules are much larger than water molecules. When organic solvents evaporate from the liquid epoxy during curing the departing molecules may leave microscopic tunnels that allow much smaller water molecules to enter. This reduces their effectiveness as a moisture barrier and makes them unsuitable for use as a marine coating.

When building my first wooden boat I chose [http://www.boatcraft.com.au/botecote.html Bote Cote], a high solids epoxy produced by a company in Brisbane, the closest major city to my residence. My choice was mostly influenced by convenience, reputation for quality, and the desire to support a local business. Your choice of an epoxy system may be influenced by similar considerations but so long as you choose a high quality epoxy suitable as a marine coating, the choice is yours.

===Mixing Epoxy===

The most critical part of the epoxy process is mixing the correct amount of hardener with the epoxy resin. 

Stored separately the hardener and the resin will stay in liquid form. When mixed together the hardener acts as a catalyst and induces the resin to polymerise, or form cross linkages between its molecules. As these bonds between the molecules form the viscosity of the mixture increases and eventually, after a few hours, it solidifies. The reaction continues for several days afterward so it is important not to apply excessive stress to the material for at least 24 hours after application.

The rate at which the polymer bonds form is dependent on the chemical properties of the hardener used and the ambient temperature. The reaction that forms the bonds is ''exothermic'' which means heat is generated each time a new bond is formed. The hotter it is, the faster the bonds form and the hotter it gets, so new bonds form even faster. The heat usually escapes to the surrounding air by conduction so it is important to spread the epoxy out in a tray rather than keep it in a pot after mixing. The greater surface area of the tray allows more heat to escape and increases the ''pot life'', the time when the mixture is still thin enough to apply effectively. 

{{Warning |'''Warning''' in extreme situations, such as mixing and leaving a large quantity of epoxy in an insulated container like a polystyrene cup, the mixture may become hot enough to ignite. If your mixture rapidly increases in temperature spread it out in a tray immediately or take it outside and put it where it can burn safely.}}


The pot life of a batch of epoxy is generally about 45 minutes. Once a batch has reached the end of its pot life it is no longer possible to apply it, so it must be discarded. It makes sense to mix up small quantities of epoxy at a time. Only mix up as much as you can comfortably apply during the pot life or you will waste a lot of expensive epoxy.

Polyethylene containers such as those used by some takeaway food outlets are excellent mixing pots for epoxy. Epoxy will not stick to polyethylene so it is easy to peel out the thin layer of hardened epoxy next day and re-use the container.

It is important to follow the manufacturers directions about mixing ratios exactly. Adding more or less hardener to the mixture will not affect curing time or pot life, but it will reduce the strength of the bond.

It is also important to use the type of hardener the manufacturer recommends for the ambient temperature of your workshop. Bote Cote recommend the following hardeners for use with their epoxy system:

:'''Fast Hardener''':  For use in southern Australian climates and in winters, has a pot life of 45 minutes and a thin film set time of 5-6 hours at 14-16 deg.C.  Can be used at temperatures as low as 8 deg.C.

:'''Standard Hardener''':  Suitable for warmer conditions and southern summers, has a pot life of 45 minutes and a thin film set time of 5-6 hours at 20-22 deg.C.

:'''Tropical Hardener''':  For hot climates such as northern Australia where temperatures rarely fall below 30 deg.C. and there is consistently high humidity.  Has a pot life of 45 minutes and a thin film set time of 4-5 hours at 30 deg.C.


'''Metric conversion hint''': go to google.com and type &quot;20C in F&quot; in the search box.&lt;br&gt;This neat trick works in converting many other units too. (you can try out the example [http://google.com/search?q=20C+in+F here])

Some manufacturers also supply a hardener accelerator. For Bote Cote the addition of 2% accelerator doubles the reactivity (half the pot life) while 4% makes it react 4 times as fast. The accelerator is not a replacement for hardener, it just speeds the process. This can be useful when you have a supply of tropical type hardener but want to use it with epoxy on a cold day in winter.

Whatever epoxy system you choose it is important to follow the manufacturers directions ''exactly'' when mixing.

In my case the mix ratio was two parts of epoxy resin to one part hardener. While it is possible to mix epoxy to the correct ratio using measuring cups, or by weight, I decided to purchase measuring pumps when I bought my epoxy. [[Image:Epoxy and tape.JPG|frame|Epoxy system and fibreglass tape]]Two hand operated pumps were required, one for the epoxy resin and one for the hardener. The pumps were inexpensive (around AUD$10 each), fit directly on to the bottles, and I have never regretted the decision. Mixing was simply one squirt of hardener to every two squirts of epoxy resin. I highly recommend measuring pumps to anyone intending to build a wooden boat.

Once the epoxy and hardener has been dispensed in the correct ratio it is essential to make sure it is thoroughly mixed. Stir the mixture carefully for several minutes with a flat, disposable stirrer. Some thin plywood offcuts trimmed to size are ideal.

When the epoxy is thoroughly mixed many people transfer it to another container before application, even if the quantity is too small to worry about it exotherming in the mixing pot. The reason for this is no matter how careful you are with mixing, there will always be some unmixed epoxy resin or hardener adhering to the sides of the pot, or right down in the corners. If a single drop of this unmixed resin finds its way on to your work it will result in a sticky spot that will never cure properly. Murphy's law dictates the sticky spot will occur in the worst possible part of your surface. Pouring the mix into a clean container and giving it a final stir with a clean stirrer is cheap insurance against unwanted sticky spots in the epoxy.

===Thickening Epoxy===

Properly mixed epoxy is a very runny liquid. It is ideal for painting on to wooden surfaces, but sometimes its low viscosity can present a problem. Building up a fillet in the join between a horizontal and a vertical surface is impossible without the addition of a thickening agent.

Epoxy manufacturers sell a variety of thickening agents. Bote Cote supplies the following fillers that can be used to thicken epoxy in various situations:

:'''High Strength Filler''':  A high density glass fibre and particle filler for maximum strength gluing applications such as catamaran beams, mast bulkheads, load carrying transoms, etc.

:'''Glue Filler''':  A low cost blended filler used for most gluing applications and also for making all fillets.

:'''Fairing Filler''':  A low density, easily sanded microsphere based filler, which spreads like cream to a perfect feather edge. Used for filling and fairing.

Most manufacturers supply their own versions of these filler products.

Some manufacturers also supply ''wood flour'' for thickening epoxy. Hannu's Boatyard, the site where I sourced the plans for my first boat, suggested plain old '''wheat flour''' as an effective epoxy thickener. That is what I used when building the &quot;Dug&quot; and it worked just fine.

Once the epoxy has been thoroughly mixed, simply add your chosen thickener a little at a time, stirring continuously, until the mixture reaches the desired consistency. It makes sense to use as little thickener as possible consistent with the application. Every particle of thickener in the mix is a particle that does not form polymer bonds with the surrounding epoxy. The less thickener in the mix, the stronger the material will be when it hardens.

I added sufficient plain wheat flour to bring the epoxy mixture to the consistency of peanut butter in order to form the fillets needed on the &quot;Dug&quot;.

==Tools==

Tools useful in constructing the boat included

* Power drill
* Power jigsaw
* Power plane
* Random orbit sander

* Handsaw
* Hand plane
* Hand sanding block
* Clamps (lots of them)
* Lofting batten (a long, straight, flexible strip of wood to aid in drawing even curves)
* Set square
* Steel ruler
* Tape measure

==Protective equipment==

* Particle mask
* Safety glasses
* Disposable plastic gloves
* Close weave work clothing

A '''particle mask''' is essential. There is a lot of sanding in boatbuilding and the dust it generates is not good for your health. Wood dust itself is bad enough, but when you add epoxy dust and fibreglass dust you will definitely want to keep it out of your lungs. You can buy disposable paper particle masks quite cheaply at hardware stores.

'''Safety glasses''' are highly recommended. Personally I wear prescription glasses so I don’t have to worry about special safety glasses. People fortunate enough not to need spectacles should consider purchasing a pair of safety glasses before using chemicals like epoxy and hardener.

'''Disposable plastic gloves''' are also a good idea when you are mixing or applying epoxy resin. Some people rapidly become sensitised to epoxy and develop dermatitis. Disposable plastic gloves prevent skin contact from occurring in the first place and avoid potential health problems.  Disposable plastic gloves are available cheaply at major supermarket chains.

'''Close weave work clothing''' with long sleeves and long trousers is highly recommended. If you are considering more than just one boatbuilding project it might be wise to invest in light cotton overalls. I made the mistake of sanding fibreglass reinforced joints wearing only a pair of shorts. This was very comfortable at the time in the hot Queensland summer, but very uncomfortable for over a week afterwards when the glass fibres in the dust made their presence felt. Ever since I have worn cotton drill work clothes with sleeves down regardless of the temperature!

==Stitch and Glue==

Stitch and glue is a technique for constructing complex three dimensional objects using plywood and epoxy resin.

The stitch and glue method was developed by the first television &quot;do it yourself&quot; (DIY) expert, Barry Bucknell, in about 1964. Wikipedia has an article about stitch and glue at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stitch_and_glue http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stitch_and_glue].

[[Image:Stitchandglue.jpg|frame|The stitch and glue technique]]First a row of small holes about 10cm apart is drilled close to the edge of one of the mating pieces of plywood. A matching hole is drilled in the other piece adjacent to each of these holes as construction proceeds and the two pieces are ''stitched'' together using either copper wire or plastic cable ties. 

Once the mating pieces have been stitched together a fillet of epoxy is applied to the joint, ''gluing'' the pieces together. In the photo on the right a piece of waste plywood with a radius sanded on to one corner is being used to spread thickened epoxy into an even fillet.

If you look closely at the photograph you will notice the edges of the mating plywood pieces are darkened. This is because the edges were ''wetted out'' with a light coat of liquid epoxy before the thickened epoxy of the fillet was applied. The unthickened epoxy wicks into the grain of the plywood allowing greater adhesion. Since both the thickened and unthickened epoxy cure together they form a single polymerised structure of great strength. In fact the joint formed is stronger than the plywood itself. Once cured the wood will break before the epoxy of the joint if sufficient force is applied.

When the epoxy fillet has cured the stitches are removed. The holes filled and the addition of fibreglass tape and more epoxy provides the required level of structural strength to the joint.

==Painting==

Painting a wooden boat is more than just a cosmetic effect. The paint forms an essential part of the boat's structure.

If a wooden boat is not sealed against moisture it will absorb water, the wood will swell up and severe damage can occur.

Most wooden boats today are sealed against water using a thin coat of epoxy. Epoxy does a terrific job sealing out moisture but is susceptible to damage from ultraviolet light (UV). Unprotected epoxy will be damaged by the UV rays in sunlight and start to deteriorate in a single season.

Fortunately most exterior grade paints offer good protection against UV light as well as added protection against moisture ingress.

===Selecting a paint===

Selecting a surface finish for your boat is a complex task. If you go down to your local hardware store and ask for a paint that is good over epoxy you will most likely be greeted with a blank look. Very few paints specifically state they can be applied to epoxy. The good news is that most paints will stick well to epoxy despite the lack of formal specification. Success depends on surface preparation however.

People often change their minds about surface finish during the construction of the boat. They start out with a vision of the boat painted in solid covers, but during the construction process the beauty of the timber is revealed, especially in the areas where unthickened epoxy has been used. Epoxy forms a smooth, clear, shiny surface that enhances the grain of timber. Its too bad it can't just be left as-is but unfortunately it breaks down quickly when exposed to UV light. Epoxy ''must'' be protected by a coat of UV stabilised paint or varnish if it will be exposed to sunlight.

Some surface finishes that have been suggested for marine use are:

* standard-type marine enamels 
* silicon/alkyd types 
* epoxy paints
* one or two-part urethanes
* Linear polyurethane

Each of these surface finishes has its own advantages and disadvantages. For my first project I selected a latex type exterior acrylic house paint. It was relatively inexpensive, formed a smooth medium gloss finish and adhered well to the WEST treated plywood of the boat.

Some manufacturers recommend the use of etching primer before the application of their product. This ignores the fact that cured epoxy is chemically inert. Etching primers, which rely on a chemical etching action, have no effect whatsoever on cured epoxy.

The only way to achieve good paint adhesion on cured epoxy is to lightly sand the surface prior to application, making millions of microscopic scratches on the surface. This facilitates mechanical keying of the paint to the surface, reducing the chance of peeling.

===Preparation===

Before doing any finishing work or applying finishes, allow the last coat of epoxy to cure 5 to 7 days if the ambient temperature is above 20°C, even longer at colder temperatures. (There is a lot of waiting in all aspects of boatbuilding)
 
Some epoxy systems suffer from amine blush, a greasy substance that forms on the surface during curing. If your chosen epoxy system suffers from this problem, wipe down the work with a water/ammonia dampened rag or sponge prior to sanding. This will eliminate the greasy amine blush, make sanding easier and minimize clogging of the abrasive paper.

===Application===

==[[/Introduction| Chapter 1: Introduction]]==

Why is nanotechnology such a 'hot' subject - and is it more hype than substance? This part gives a brief introduction to the visions of nanotechnology and why so many people are working on it around the world. To help set a perspective there are overview tables with timelines, length scales and information resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Is it really?==

I could cut to the chase and say in many ways that it is not worth your time. However, college and universities are academic institutions that have been around since the late 1700s in the United States. These places were once a place people sent their children to obtain an &quot;education,&quot; which was to help them be successful for the future. Yet this education was mediocre at best and didn't help prepare students of early-America. However, colleges have impacted the way of America and continues to impact its future.

Yet you have colleges of today that are built to guide students, or so they say. In reality, however, college is an academic 'institution' that has been around enough to have an impact on society. Some members of society hold college educated people in high regard. Although this somewhat conflicts with egalitarian views along with other views, the &quot;reality&quot; remains that a college education affects the way people perceive the degree-holder.

Some people believe a college education gives a person a background, a track record if you will. These could also lead to a person having credentials and credibility. In other words, college gives a person experience which can be shown to the world on a resume. It is the realization that people hold this background in high regard that creates a situation for college students. Those who don't have a background may encounter scrutiny from employers, and college gives a person a background. College builds someone a status and a background. Most people are not allowed into an institution (business or other) without a background. Some people would call this &quot;institution conflict.&quot; If you don't have recognition from one, you won't be recognized by the other. 

Many people wish to destroy this institution conflict by destroying the institutions. However, some people believe the best way to do that is through espionage or becoming one of the collective. You've got various things that have changed since the 1700s. Most of all, you have the Internet. Yet the Internet has many people who were college educated. It is these people who are guiding others to knowledge. As time goes on, the amount of accurate information will present itself to people; and the possibility of a truly free education may become a reality. However, experience is the thing that colleges offer that the Internet does not. Unless a person does experiments, keeps logs, and gets certification through exams and testing, proving you've got experience is a very difficult task.

----

Interestingly, however, is that experience can be gained in many different ways:

----
=== The Artist ===
Some people say artists ought learn in college. College gives an artist a knowledge background as to methods, materials, art history, aesthetics, and other aspects of art. Some people would call this a 'formal' education in art. However, some artists don't need to go to college. These people are artists. They create art, and their ability to create art comes from talent and so forth. Whether or not these people are considered artists is up to aesthetics and debate, but a person doesn't need a college degree to be considered an artist. Artists draw, paint, sculpt, and do many other things with resources and mediums. Some artists graduate college and don't find a job right away. In other words, the ability to create art is more about experience, less about formal knowledge. Although, formal knowledge allows the artist to understand techniques, but such things can be learned out of various art books.

Artists show experience through a portfolio. However, the artist may want to take into consideration a type of formal education. This formal education may come from a freelance art teacher or through various art books.

=== The Scientist ===

On the other end of a spectrum you've got the scientist. This is the kind of person that finds graduating from college a necessity. The reason college is a necessity for this kind of person is for various reasons. One would be ethics, which discuss how science is to act in the future according to society. Another is a formal education in lab work, which often a group of persons doing experimentation. In whole, the scientist often goes to college in order to receive a formal education and work with a group of persons toward a common goal.

=== 'Yes' and 'No' Summary ===
Yes and no. This all depends on a few factors. One of the factors is what you want to accomplish in the long run.

Want to be a computer scientist/mathematician/physicist/linguist/translator? 
: Go to college and make the best grades you can.

Want to be a biologist/chemist?
: Go to college, because ethical concerns exist when employing people without proper training.

Want to be a scientist/doctor/neuroscientist?
: Same as above.

Want to be an artist/actor?
: You probably don't need to go. Most artists only need a portfolio to prove to others they are the cream of the crop. Colleges and universities don't really help these type of people. Many artists from earlier days rejected the schools and became famous. Salvador Dali was an artist who saw himself better than the teachers and later worked with Picasso.

Want to be a graphic designer/businessman or -woman?
:You need training.  Who is going to hire an interior decorator with no experience?  The easiest place to get experience is college.  And to get a job in the business world, unless you want to stay in an entry-level position, a degree is required.

In all reality, if someone holds a four-year-degree, he or she should be able to find a job somewhere.  So college is your best bet for job security!

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt; Previous chapter - &lt;/b&gt; [[../]]
===Introduction===
A good introduction is [[Wikipedia:molecular mechanics]].

In molecular  mechanics we treat a group of molecules as a  ''classical'' collection of balls and springs rather than a ''quantum'' collection of electrons and nuclei. This means we can readily make physical models and have these physical models turned into computer programs. 
 
There is a hierarchy of models, the minimal  being  atoms as hard spheres of radius  equal to the covalent radius and using VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Repulsion) for the lonepairs.  Angles are approximately determined by best mutual avoidance in the hierarchy lone pairs &gt; bond pairs.  The electronegativities of atoms &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; can be used to increase the flexibility of the model.  Substituents with greater electronegativity decrease  the size and repulsiveness of bond pairs.  The model is incomplete because of  neglect of bonding overlap and there is no description  of any &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; bonds the molecule may have.  Also we are making invalid additivity assumptions illustrated as follows.  

The longest bondlengths are adjacent to electron pairs as in the classic example of F-F. ( HF is 91.7 pico-metres, FF 141.7 (covalent radii H 37.0 pm, F 71.0pm).) HF is quite clearly shorter than  average and FF longer.  The  Fluorine covalent radius F value determined as 1/2 F-F, will be  longer than the value determined from fluoro-alkanes.  Once you move to using a computer it is usual to go straight to a full molecular mechanics model with a ''force field'' such as MMx, Merck or AMBER.

The data which describes how the balls and springs behave is known as the ''force field''.  The earliest force fields were only for the atoms C, H, O and N and gradually added extra atoms, atom types and functional groups.  Rappe and coworkers at CalTec, Los Angeles have produced a deductive paradigm for producing a whole periodic table force field.  Everything necessary to code it is in the literature.  Recent versions of CHARMM also have a whole periodic table force field.  The Merck Forcefield which is currently thought to be  the most accurate, has  more metal elements than the older forcefields.

===Force fields===
A formal description of a typical force field follows.

harmonic force constant.

&lt;math&gt;
V_{s} = \sum_{l} \frac {1} {2} k_{l} {( l - l_{0} )}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

optional anharmonic force constant.

&lt;math&gt;
- \sum_{l} \frac {1} {3!} k_{l}^{anh} {( l - l_{0} )}^3
&lt;/math&gt;


angle bending constants.

&lt;math&gt;
 + \sum_{\theta} \frac {1} {2} k_{\theta} \left\{ {( \theta - \theta_{0} )}^2
 -
  k_{\theta}^{'} {( \theta - \theta_{0} )}^3 \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;


Fourier representation of torsional potential.


&lt;math&gt;
+ \sum_{n}  \frac {1} {2^{n}} k_{\omega} ( 1 + s \cos (n\omega) ) 
+ \sum_{\omega}  \frac {1} {2} k_{\omega} ( 1 + s \cos (\omega) )
&lt;/math&gt;


Out of plane bending for trigonal groups.


&lt;math&gt;
 + \sum_{\Gamma} \frac {1} {2} k_{\Gamma} {( \Gamma - \pi )}^2
&lt;/math&gt;



Van der Waals terms.


&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i&lt;j} \left\{ \frac {A_{ij}} {r_{ij}^{12}}
-  \frac {B_{ij}} {r_{ij}^{6}} \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;



electrostatic interactions.



&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i&lt;j}  \frac {q_{i} q_{j}} {r_{ij}^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

====What do the force field components mean?====
Let us first consider bond lengths. The most important number is &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt;
the average bondlength. Then we have the harmonic force constant, which is the rigidity of the bond, obtainable
from either IR spectroscopy or an energy derivative electronic structure calculation.
The anharmonic constants are always negative corresponding to a steeper slope
on the repulsive, compressive side and a shallowing out on moving towards disociation.
Bending constants are complicated and not so subject to simple rules of thumb.
Four body dihedral functions are of course periodic and can be almost any shape
with a number of minima related to valency and lonepair content of the four entities.

===Pair potentials===
The pair potential term is always clearly divided into a repulsive and an attractive
part.
In van der Waals complexes it is this repulsive function which
ultimately prevents the molecules locking together usually giving
the peculiarity of a ''positive'' van der Waals energy
which seems counterintuitive. (Perhaps it should be relabelled, Lennard-Jones
energy, or pair energy.)

For some purposes the &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {r^{12}} &lt;/math&gt; term in the pair energy is too steep and
a softer repulsive potential the Buckingham potential is used:

====The Buckingham potential ====

&lt;math&gt;
E_{vdw} = \sum { A e ^{- B r} - C r ^{-6} }
&lt;/math&gt;

Another modification to the pair potential is the addition of an inverse
&lt;math&gt;r^{10}&lt;/math&gt; term, used in some programs to simulate the extra attractive
energy of the hydrogen bond.

====The Lennard-Jones potential====

&lt;math&gt;
E(r)  =  4 \epsilon
\left( { { \left( \frac \sigma r \right) } ^ {12} -
{ \left( \frac \sigma r \right) } ^ 6 } \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the energy at the pair minimum.
The location of the pair minimum is at &lt;math&gt;r = 2 ^{1/6} \sigma&lt;/math&gt; ''i.e.''
&lt;math&gt;1.122462048 \sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

MOLWEB, the software written by MG to do interfacing and MM style
property calculations,  internally uses either the MM2 atom types or an atom type formed
from the atomic number multiplied by 100, giving the possibility of
100 different atom types. This is not a ludicrous requirement if one thinks
of transitional metal complexes where differentiation between
half a dozen oxidation states, several coordination numbers  and high and
low spin environments might be required.


The &lt;math&gt;\frac {A} {r^{12}} -  \frac {B} {r^{6}}&lt;/math&gt; is
often expressed using the
2 parameters of an energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and a distance &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice the absence of metals from this table. Rappé and coworkers at CalTec, Los Angeles have produced a deductive
''paradigm'' for producing a whole periodic table force field (Rappé and Casewit, 1997).

If you do not have access to a code with this in it everything
necessary to code it is in the literature.
It is believed recent versions of CHARMM also have a whole periodic table force
field.
The new Merck Forcefield (Halgren,1996)), which is currently thought by
some to be
the most accurate, has  more metal elements
than the older forcefields.

===Practical Problems===

i) Conformations of cyclohexanes

Check that the available force fields predict the correct energy differences
between chair and skew-boat forms of cyclohexane.
Confirm that the boat is impossible to make as it is not a
minimum on the potential surface.
Trial boat forms of cyclohexane are rather difficult to make. One possible route is to start with benzene, put the carbons into the right
place after removing the double bonds.
After that it is necessary to add hydrogens to resaturate valency with
H-ADD.
Another way is to pull the chair form down from the menu and delete the 2
hydrogens at the foot of the chair. Move the carbon with 'MXY', and then
replace the hydrogens.

Establish whether 1-chlorocyclohexane prefers the axial or equatorial
positions.
(Make the first conformer and optimise for energy. Then
invert at the 1 centre to get the other conformer and check the energy).
Try this for both MM2 and AMBER force fields.

2) Geometry of cis-Chlordane

Use your bibliographic skills
to get a model of cis-Chlordane, (whatever that is).
Minimize it with MM2. Calculate its energy when solvated in water and chloroform,
using continuum models, (if available).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Spanish Civil War (July 18, 1936–April 1, 1939) was a conflict in which the incumbent Second Spanish Republic and political left-wing groups fought against a right-wing nationalist insurrection led by General Francisco Franco, who eventually succeeded in ousting the Republican government and establishing a personal dictatorship. It was the result of the complex political, economic and even cultural divisions between what Spanish writer Antonio Machado characterized as the two Spains. The Republicans ranged from centrists who supported capitalist liberal democracy to communists or anarchist revolutionaries; their power base was primarily secular and urban (though it also included landless peasants) and was particularly strong in industrial regions like Asturias and Catalonia. The conservative Basque Country also sided with the Republic, largely because it, along with nearby Cataluña sought autonomy from the central government which would later be suppressed by the centralizing nationalists. The ultimately successful Nationalists had a primarily rural, wealthier, and more conservative base of support, were mostly Roman Catholic, and favored the centralization of power. Some of the military tactics of the war -- including the use of terror tactics against civilians -- foreshadowed World War II, although both the nationalists and the republicans relied overwhelmingly on infantry rather than modern use of blitzkrieg tactics with tanks and airplanes.
The number of persons killed in the Spanish Civil War can be only roughly estimated. Nationalist forces put the figure at 1,000,000, including not only those killed in battle but also the victims of bombardment, execution, and assassination. More recent estimates have been closer to 500,000 or less. This does not include all those who died from malnutrition, starvation, and war-engendered disease. 


==Abraham Lincoln Brigade==
The Abraham Lincoln Brigade was an organization of United States volunteers supporting or fighting for the anti-fascist Spanish Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War as part of the International Brigade.

The name &quot;brigade&quot; is something of a misnomer, as there were several American battalions organized under the Fifteenth International Brigade of the Spanish Republican army. This brigade was loosely organized by the Comintern and was made up of volunteers from nations around the globe. The George Washington Battalion, Abraham Lincoln Battalion, John Brown Anti-Aircraft Battery were part of the American contingent. Other U.S. volunteers served with the MacKenzie-Papineau battalion (Canadian), the Regiment de Tren (transport) and in various medical groups. The name Abraham Lincoln Brigade was used to include all the U.S. volunteers, regardless of which unit they served with.

Most of the people making up the Abraham Lincoln Brigade were official members of the Communist Party USA or affiliated with other socialist organizations. The IWW, or &quot;Wobblies&quot;, were lightly represented. However, the brigade was made up of volunteers from all walks of American life, and from all socio-economic classes. It was the first unit of soldiers made up of Americans to have an African-American officer, Oliver Law, lead white soldiers.

American volunteers began organizing and arriving in Spain in 1936. Centered in the town of Figueras, near the French border, the brigade was organized in 1937 and trained by Robert Merriman. By early 1937, its numbers had swelled from an initial 96 volunteers to around 450 members. In February 1937 the League of Nations Non-Intervention Committee banned foreign national volunteers.

Self-motivated and ideological, the Lincolns attempted to create an egalitarian &quot;people's army&quot;; officers were distinguished only by small bars on their berets and in some cases rank-and-file soldiers elected their own officers. Traditional military protocol was shunned, although not always successfully. A political commissar explained the politics of the war to the volunteers and tended to their needs and morale. The Lincoln Brigade helped ease the pressure on Madrid, giving the Republic time to train and organize its own popular army. The subject of respectful news reports by such writers as Ernest Hemingway, Herbert Matthews, Martha Gellhorn, and Lillian Hellman, the brigade helped strengthen anti-fascist opinion in the United States. Yet the Lincolns and the Republican military, fighting with inadequate weaponry, could not withstand the forces allied against them. By the end, the Lincolns had lost nearly 750 men and sustained a casualty rate higher than that suffered by Americans in World War II. Few escaped injury. In November 1938, as a last attempt to pressure Hitler and Mussolini into repatriating their troops, Spanish prime minister Juan Negrin ordered the withdrawal of the International Brigades. The Axis coalition refused to follow suit and Madrid fell in March 1939.

The Lincolns returned home as heroes of the anti-fascist cause but enjoyed no official recognition of their deed. Many Lincolns soon aroused bitterness within sectors of the Left when, with the signing of the Hitler-Stalin nonaggression pact in 1939, they supported the CP's call for the United States to stay out of WWII. Once the United States and the Soviet Union entered the war, however, many of the veterans enlisted in the armed forces or served with the merchant marine. In a foreshadowing of the McCarthy period, the armed forces designated the Lincolns &quot;premature antifascists&quot; and confined them to their bases. Many successfully protested and were allowed to see action. Among the core agents of the Office of Strategic Services were Lincoln veterans whose contacts with the European partisans, forged in Spain, were key to OSS missions.



The International Brigade was used by the Loyalist army for several battles in Spain. They unsuccessfully defended the supply road between Valencia and Madrid in the Jarama Valley from February 1937 until June 1937. They were also present at the battles of Brunete, Zaragoza, Belchite, and Teruel.

The Brigade was a cause celebre in the United States, however. Liberal and socialist groups organized fund-raising activities and supply drives to keep the Brigade afloat. News of the Brigade's high casualty rate and bravery in battle made them romantic figures to an America concerned about the rise of Fascism around the world.

The war dragged on and the Fascist forces gained victory after victory over the Spanish Republic. The International Brigade was withdrawn from battle by the Spanish prime minister in spring of 1938. Most of the surviving Lincolns were repatriated promptly afterward, and were welcomed home as heroes.

In the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, members of the Brigade were castigated as supporters of the Soviet Union. Following World War II, at the height of the &quot;Red Scare&quot;, former members of the Brigade were considered security risks, and branded &quot;premature anti-fascists&quot;.

The US volunteers of the International Brigades adopted the song &quot;Jarama Valley&quot; as their anthem, which was the older song &quot;Red River Valley&quot; with new lyrics. The song was also translated into Catalan.
===Specific Cases===
After World War I, U.S. Blacks confronted once again the forces of white supremacy and a revitalized Ku Klux Klan. Yet the appearance of a Communist government in Russia in 1917 opened new vistas for African American militancy. After Lenin's Communist party came to power in the Soviet Union and boldly proclaimed &quot;the wretched of the earth&quot; should rule the world, African American resistance took on new meaning. In Chicago, an African Blood Brotherhood led by Cyril Briggs talked of arming Black men for self-defense and called for unity with white workers to overthrow capitalism and imperialism. In 1924 Briggs led his followers into the U.S. Communist party.

Other African Americans also turned to the Communist party for inspiration and organizational support. The most significant African American Communist of this early era was World War I veteran Harry Haywood. During the 1920s Haywood headed for the Soviet Union. In 1928 at a Comintern conference he embraced a proposal that Blacks who lived in the sixty contiguous southern U.S. counties (where they accounted for a majority of the population) be entitled to self-determination including the right to secede from the United States. Such ideas became the basis of the Communist party's organizing among southern Blacks during the 1930s. Haywood later served briefly as a commissar in the Lincoln Brigade.

= Violence During the Spanish Civil War =
The opening weeks of the Spanish Civil War were characterized by horrendous atrocities, most of them inflicted by an inflamed working class upon conservatives in general and Catholic clergy in particular. Ultimately, 12 bishops and hundreds of priests and nuns and seminarians were slaughtered. The reprisals taken by the nationalists were as brutal, though usually less picturesque in their cruelty.
Europe looked on in horror as a country once recognized as the center of Western Civilization descended into bloodshed on a scale not seen since the ghastly events of WWI. The new tank warfare tactics and the terror bombing of cities from the air were features of the Spanish Civil War which later was a significant part in the general European War. The Spanish Civil War had cost the nation somewhere between 600,000 - 800,000 lives, counting deaths in battle and executions, as well as civilians killed by bombing, starvation, and disease. Under the new regime thousands more would be condemned to death, imprisoned, or forced into exile. The war ended with the victory of the rebels, who called themselves the Nationalists, the overthrow of the Republican government, and the exile of thousands of Spanish Republicans, many of whom ended up in refugee camps in Southern France. Apart from the combatants, many civilians were killed for their political or religious views by both sides. &lt;ref&gt;Meditz, Sandra W., Solsten, Eric, ed. Spain A Country Sturdy.

==''For Whom the Bell Tolls''==
Ernest Hemingway wrote a novel after the Spanish American War, a historic fiction, titled ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''. He borrowed the title from a line of a John Donne poem. The novel tells the story of Robert Jordan, a guerrilla warrior from the United States, during the Spanish Civil War. As an expert in the use of explosives, Jordan is given an assignment to blow up a bridge to accompany a simultaneous attack on the city of Segovia. Though successful in that sense, like most Hemingway novels, ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' is tragic.

Hello, I noticed that you are working on the [[US History]] book. Let me give you a few hints about editing:

* There is a '''Show preview''' button, so you can check your work without saving each time. When you show preview, you get back the edit box on the page, which saves you from clicking &quot;Edit this page&quot; again.
* There is a '''Summary''' box below the main edit box but above the buttons. You can type a summary of what you did. For example, when you removed part of [[US History/Contents/Civil War]] to make [[US History/Contents/Secession]], you could have provided a summary explaining that you were doing a move. I actually suspected that you were a bad user deleting from [[US History/Contents/Civil War]], until I found [[US History/Contents/Secession]].

The use of &quot;Show preview&quot; and &quot;Summary&quot; is '''optional''' - but you might find them useful. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:51, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[US History]] pages ==
Subjects such as [[US History:Marcos Pontes|Marcos Pontes]] are not notable enough to be included in a survey course of US history. You should not just copy encyclopedic entries from Wikipedia, but write a ''textbook'' on US history. Things like the  Internet, which had a great cultural and societal impact, and the Space Race, which had important political ramifications would gladly be accepted. --[[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 14:34, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

== [[Modern History]] pages ==

According to [[w:Modern Times (history)|Wikipedia]], modern history begins at the end of the 18th century. The [[w:Early Modern Times]] generally refers to the events in Europe, so for the 15th through early 18th centuries, please contribute to the [[European History]] book, unless of course you plan to write about the entire world during this period, which I don't think would be a very good organization, but can be done nontheless. (If you wish to do that, start an [[Early Modern Times]] book. Currently you only have European events, so please move your work to [[European History]]). 

Secondly, please write in textbook, not encyclopedic, format. Both &quot;Martin Luther&quot; and &quot;John Calvin&quot; would go in a &quot;[[European History/Challenges to Spiritual Authority|Reformation]]&quot; chapter. The [[Modern History/Beaconsfield mine collapse|Beaconsfield mine collapse]] refers to one news event. Please move it to [[n:|Wikinews]]. Thanks, [[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 16:18, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Humanities bookshelf]] ==

Please note that some of the books and sections you have added to [[Wikibooks:Humanities bookshelf]] are actually social sciences, and as such would go on [[Wikibooks:Social sciences bookshelf]]. For the difference between the two, please see [[w:social sciences]] and [[w:humanities]]. Thanks and regards, [[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 22:41, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

== [[Soviet Realism]] ==

I removed your [[Soviet Realism]] suggestion from [[Wikibooks:Humanities_bookshelf#Literature]] because it is an art style. Do you want the book to record the [[History of Russian Art Movements]]? If so, I suggest you make it a chapter of a larger book, and add it to [[Wikibooks:Art_bookshelf#History_of_the_Arts]]. Or do you want a book that explains how to draw in this art style? If so, list it on [[Wikibooks:Art_bookshelf#Visual_arts]]. I also recommend that you focus on one book at a time, because textbooks aren't useful until they are close to completion (&quot;quality over quantity&quot;). Feel free to respond with any questions you may have. Thanks, [[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 22:57, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

This opening discussion is very good for a start. I submit that further progress isn't possible until someone agrees to contribute graphics to the article. Contributors could then begin the business actually of illustrating how species counterpoint works. (This topic is dear to my heart as it is the first thing I learned at university!)

Lankes, R. David. “The Foundations of Digital Reference.” In Digital Reference Service in the New Millennium: Planning, Management, and Evaluation, edited by R. David Lankes, John W. Collins, III, and Abby S. Kasowitz.  New York: Neal-Schuman, 2000.
	
This is actually the introduction of Digital Reference Service in the New Millennium: Planning, Management, and Evaluation. In it, Lankes examines the emerging field of digital reference, how it affects the traditional reference staff and service, and addresses two key issues, “scalability” and “ambiguity”.

Lankes makes the argument that the availability and use of digital resources are fundamentally changing the definition of what defines the traditional role of “reference services”, and that library reference staff are now becoming “information brokers”, because of the nature of the digital environment and changing user expectations. He discusses two issues, scalability (the ability to service growth), and ambiguity (identifying resources needed to meet user’s needs).  He describes several differing initiatives that have been or could be brought into play to address these issues, both alterations of existing reference practices, and new methods of providing relevant reference services in a digital age.

His arguments are sound, and pose fundamental questions as to what defines a “Library” and “Reference Services”, as one would expect in the introductory chapter of a book on the changing role the digital world plays in the reference field.  Some of the questions and possible solutions, however, seem very radical and unrealistic given the fragmented standard reference environment based on local libraries, both from a funding and staffing perspective, and assumes that some “entity” (modeled on the private sector) will provide a more centralized construct more appropriate for the digital age.

      <comment>Behavioralist theories</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">When discussing behaviorism and learning it is important to go back to the early roots and identify the key contributors to the theory. John B. Watson was considered the &quot;Founder of Behaviorism&quot; and B.F. Skinner was concerned with the functional relationships between the environment and behavior.

According to behavioral theory &quot;learning occurs when there is a measurable change in the frequency of observable performance&quot;. Learning is a process in which the &quot;shaping&quot; of behavior occurs through reinforcing the appropriate responses. 

Repetition, drills, practice and immediate feedback upon completion of the correct behavior will strengthen the chances  the behavior will occur again. Over time, the behavior will not require continous reinforcement and will be transferable to similar situations.

Behavioral theory and training is a key component of animal training and skill training in humans. Teaching animals to sit for a kibble is very similar to clapping and hugging your child for their first steps or bike ride. Slot machines are based on intermittent reinforcement, which in turn leads gamblers to put more quarters in the machine to be reinforced by the ching ching of winning. As students, we are reinforced by the 100 points or A we receive on the test or paper, or by the removal of the F on the grade card. Anna Pherson

==1. Know how to properly operate the kind of stove you have in your home. Know how to put out an oil or grease fire on your stove. Know how to prevent such a fire. Know safety precautions while cooking, including consideration of small children.==
;Operating a stove:
There are two major classes of stoves in common use in the United States today, the gas stove and the electric stove.  Gas stoves burn either propane or natural gas and cook with an exposed flame.  Most have automatic ignition so you do not need to strike a match to light a burner.  Simply turn the knob and set the flame to the desired level.  Electric stoves cook with a heating element which converts electrical energy into heat.  Like gas stoves, the cook must turn a knob, but unlike gas stoves, there is no flame, so its level cannot be directly observed.  Instead, the knobs are marked with numbers generally ranging from 1 to 9 or 10.  The settings 1-3 corresponds to low heat, 4-6 correspond to medium heat, and 7-10 correspond to high heat.

;Putting out a grease fire:
In case of a grease fire in a pan, cover the pan with its lid.  This will deprive the fire of oxygen and it will go out.  If the cover is already on the pan, you may need to use a fire extinguisher.

;Safety considerations:
Stoves with knobs along the back of the unit are more appropriate in households with small children because the children cannot reach the knobs and turn the stove on.  This does present a greater danger to the cook, as he or she must reach across the burners to adjust the knobs - don't wear loose clothing when cooking with such a stove.

Another hazard to children involving stoves are pot handles.  A pot handle should always be turned so it does not overhang the edge of the stove where a child could grab it or run into it.  An overturned pot of boiling water can cause severe burns.

Do not place flammable items on the stove, ever.  This includes paper or plastic plates, or food packaging items (boxes and bags).  It is easy to accidentally turn on the wrong burner, and if a flammable item is on that burner, tragedy may ensue.

Remember that the burners stay hot for several minutes after they have been turned off.  

Many foods (especially pastas) are boiled in water and the water is then drained.  Use a colander for this purpose.  When transporting a pot full of boiling water from the stove to the sink, do not lift the pot over the head of a child who may be underfoot - clear the area first.  While cooking, dishes and cooking implements pile up in the sinks of even the cleanest of kitchens.  Remove any dishes from the sink before pouring boiling water into it.  The sudden temperature increase can shatter glass, and you do not want boiling water to pool up in any dishes in the sink.

==2. Know how to properly use measuring spoons, measuring cups, and if available an electric mixer, a blender, and a food processor.==
===Measuring spoons and cups===
Measuring spoons are used for measuring small amounts of dry or liquid ingredients.  It is best to have two sets and use one for measuring dry ingredients and the other for measuring liquid ingredients.  This will save you time because you won't have to wash and dry the spoons every time you need to switch between dry and liquid items.

For liquid measures, fill the spoon all the way to the top.  For dry measures, level the spoon off with a knife.

Measuring cups are for measuring larger amounts of ingredients, and again, it is wise to have two to avoid mixing dry and wet ingredients during the measuring process, but even more importantly, a dry measure is not the same thing as a liquid measure.  A dry measuring cup measures ''volume'' while a liquid measuring cup measures ''weight.'' It is unfortunate that these units are both named '''ounces'''.  A one-ounce volume of water very nearly weighs one ounce, but a one-ounce volume of flour weighs quite a bit less than one ounce.  Make sure you understand which type of ounce is being specified in a recipe.

Measure dry ingredients with a dry measuring cup using the same procedure as with a measuring spoon - that is, level it off with a knife.  Liquid measuring cups are usually made of glass, and the measurements are marked on the side.  Fill the measuring cup to the correct level by looking directly across the measuring line, not looking down at an angle.

===Mixers===
[[image:Handheld_Electric_Beater.jpg|right|250px]]
A mixer is a kitchen appliance intended for mixing, folding, beating, and whipping food ingredients. Mixers come in two major variations, hand mixers and stand mixers.

A hand mixer, as the name implies, is a hand-held device. It typically consists of a handle mounted over a large enclosure containing the motor, which drives two beaters. The beaters are immersed in the food to be mixed.  Be careful when removing the beaters from the food.  If you have a deep bowl and can lift the beaters free of the food without lifting them above the rim of the bowl, you may lift them before turning off the mixer.  This will fling food onto the sides of the bowl freeing it from the beaters.  If you lift running beaters outside the bowl, you will fling food all over the kitchen, creating an unnecessary mess.

A stand mixer is essentially the same as a hand mixer, but is mounted on a stand which bears the weight of the device. Stand mixers are larger and have more powerful motors than their hand-held counterparts. They generally have a special bowl that is locked in place while the mixer is operating.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===Blenders===
[[image:ElectricBlender.jpg|right|250px]]
A blender is a kitchen appliance used to blend ingredients or puree food. The term typically refers to a stationary, upright electrical device, which is to be distinguished from a hand-powered or electric mixer that may be used for similar purposes.

A typical blender is built around a vessel for the ingredients to be blended. At the top of the vessel is a cap to prevent ingredients from escaping when the blender is switched on. At the bottom is a blade assembly, typically removable for cleaning purposes. The bottom seal is most likely watertight. The vessel rests upon a base containing a motor (for turning the blade assembly) with controls on its surface. Most modern blenders offer a number of possible speeds. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===Food Processors===
[[Image:Food Processor 2.jpg|right|250px]]

A '''food processor''' is a kitchen appliance used to facilitate various repetitive tasks in the process of preparation of food. Today, the term almost always refers to an electric-motor-driven appliance, although there are some manual devices also referred to as &quot;food processors&quot;.

Food processors are similar to blenders in many ways. The primary difference is that food processors use swappable blades and disks (''attachments'') instead of a fixed blade. Also, their bowls are wider and shorter, a more appropriate shape for the solid or semi-solid foods usually worked in a food processor. 

Its functions normally consist of:
* Chopping Vegetables
* Grinding items such as nuts, meat, or dried fruit
* Shredding or Grating cheese or vegetables
* Pureeing
* Mixing and kneading doughs

The base of the unit houses a motor which turns a vertical shaft. A bowl, usually made of transparent plastic, fits around the shaft. Cutting blades can be attached to the shaft; these fit so as to operate near the bottom of the bowl. Shredding or slicing disks can be attached instead; these spin near the top of the bowl. A lid with a &quot;feed tube&quot; is then fitted onto the bowl.

The feed tube allows ingredients to be added while chopping, grinding or pureeing. It also serves as a chute through which items are introduced to shredding or slicing disks. A &quot;pusher&quot; is provided, sized to slide through the feed tube, protecting fingers. 

Almost all modern food processors have safety devices which prevent the motor from operating if the bowl isn't properly affixed to the base or if the lid isn't properly affixed to the bowl.

==3. What is meant by boiling, broiling, frying, baking, simmering, waterless cooking, and if available microwave cooking? Which are the most healthful ways of preparing common foods? Which are the most unhealthful ways?==
===Boiling===
Boiling is cooking food in boiling water, or other water-based liquid such as stock or milk. Simmering is gentle boiling, while in poaching the cooking liquid moves but scarcely bubbles.

In places where the available water supply is contaminated with disease-causing bacteria, boiling water (and allowing it to cool) before drinking it is a valuable health measure. Boiling water for a few minutes kills most bacteria, amoebas, and other microbial pathogens. It thus can help prevent cholera, dysentery, and other diseases caused by these organisms.

Foods suitable for boiling include fish, vegetables, pasta, eggs, meats, sauces, stock, and soups.

Advantages:
* Older, tougher, cheaper joints of meat and poultry can be made digestible.
* It is appropriate for large-scale cookery
* Nutritious, well flavored stock is produced
* It is safe and simple
* Maximum colour and nutritive value is retained when cooking green vegetables, provided boiling time is kept to the minimum

Disadvantages:
* There is a loss of soluble vitamins in the water.
* It can be a slow method
* Foods can look unattractive

Boiling can be done in two ways: The food can be placed into already rapidly boiling water and left to cook, the heat can be turned down and the food can be simmered; or the food can also be placed into the pot, and cold water may be added to the pot. This may then be boiled until the food is satisfactory.

===Broiling===
Broiling is a process of cooking food with high heat with the heat applied directly to the food, most commonly from above. As it is a way of cooking without added oil, it is popular in low-fat diets.

In electric ovens, broiling is accomplished by placing the food near the upper heating element, with the lower heating element off and the oven door partially open. Gas ovens often have a separate compartment for broiling, as a drawer below the flame.

===Frying===
Frying is the cooking of food in oil or fat. Chemically, oils and fats are the same, differing only in melting point, but the distinction is only made when needed. 

Fats can reach much higher temperatures than water at normal atmospheric pressure. Through frying, one can sear or even carbonize the surface of foods while caramelizing sugars. The food is cooked much more quickly and has a special crispness and texture. Depending on the food, the fat will penetrate it to varying degrees, contributing richness, lubricity, and its own flavour.

Frying techniques vary in the amount of fat required, the cooking time, the type of cooking vessel required, and the manipulation of the food. Sautéing, stir frying, pan frying, shallow frying, and deep frying are all standard frying techniques.

===Baking===
Baking is the technique of cooking food in an oven by dry heat applied evenly throughout the oven or only from the bottom element.  Breads, desserts, and meat are often baked, and baking is the primary cooking technique used to produce cakes and pastry-based goods such as pies, tarts, and quiches.

===Simmering===
Simmering is a cooking technique in which foods are cooked in hot liquids kept at or just barely below the boiling point of water (at average sea level air pressure), 100 °C (212 °F). To keep a pot simmering, one brings it to a boil and then adjusts the heat downward until just before the formation of steam bubbles stops completely. Water normally begins to simmer at about 94 °C or 200 °F.

Simmering ensures gentler treatment than boiling to prevent toughening and prevent food from breaking up. Simmering is usually a rapid and efficient method of cooking.

===Waterless Cooking===
Waterless cooking is a method of cooking food without adding water (there is already water in most foods), fats, or oils.  This technique requires the use of some very expensive cookware designed expressly for this purpose, but there are some health benefits too.  Boiling water will dissolve some nutrients which are then flushed from the food.  Waterless cooking is done in a sealed container that locks in all the moisture already present in the food.  Vitamins and flavor are also retained by the food, so there is no need to add butter, salt or oil to liven it up.

===Microwave cooking===
Microwave ovens have revolutionized cooking since their use became widespread in the 1970s.

Professional chefs generally find microwave ovens to be of limited usefulness. On the other hand, people who are lacking in free time, or not comfortable with their cooking skills, can use microwave ovens to reheat stored food (including commercially available pre-cooked frozen dishes) in only a few minutes.

Food is heated for so short a time that it is often cooked unevenly. Microwave ovens are frequently used for reheating previously cooked food, and bacterial contamination may not be killed by the reheating, resulting in foodborne illness. The uneven heating is partly due to the uneven distribution of microwave energy inside the oven, and partly due to the different rates of energy absorption in different parts of the food.

The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan built in to the over (but hidden from view) that reflects microwave energy to different parts of the oven as it rotates, and by a turntable or carousel that turns the food.

It is also important not to place food or a container in the center of a microwave's turntable. That actually defeats its purpose. Rather, it should be placed a bit off-center so that the item travels all around the area of oven's cooking cavity, thus assuring even heating.

The second problem must be addressed by the cook, who should arrange the food so that it absorbs energy evenly, and periodically test and shield any parts of the food that overheat.

Many microwave ovens' performance drops after about 15 minutes of continuous usage, which means food takes longer to cook. When heating several meals, the last meal to be cooked may not be heated properly as a result.

Defrosting is another common weakness, as many microwave ovens may start to cook the edges of the frozen food, while the inside of the food remains frozen.

Closed containers and eggs can explode when heated in a microwave oven due to the pressure build-up of steam. Products that are heated too long can catch fire. Manuals of microwave ovens warn of such hazards.

Tin foil, aluminum foil, ceramics decorated with metal, and products containing other metals can cause sparks when they are used in a microwave.

Several microwave fires have been noted where Chinese takeout boxes with a metal handle are microwaved, and also where &quot;homemade&quot; microwave popcorn bags have been sealed using a metal staple, which is then heated and sets fire to the bag. This type of accident can pose a dangerous situation because of the extremely flammable mixture of popcorn and oil in the bag. Thus, it is good practice to remove any metal utensils or metal containing objects from a microwave oven before operating it, as the behavior of these objects when immersed in a strong microwave radiation field is unpredictable.

===Most/Least Healthful Methods===
Waterless cooking may be the most healthful way of cooking food, but baking is also a good choice.  Fried foods are the least healthful way to cook food, and unfortunately, this is the technique used most frequently by &quot;fast food&quot; restaurants.

{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recipe
|name = Hard-boiled Eggs
|ingredients=
*6 to 8 large eggs, depending on appetite and number of people
*Salt and pepper to taste
|procedure =
Using eggs that have been in the fridge for several days (but are still before the date on the shell or carton), will make it easier to peel the eggs once they are cooked. If you are using really fresh eggs, rather than commodity eggs from the store, you may have to keep them three weeks or more before they will be easily peeled.

Two major problems arise when making hard-boiled eggs: overcooking and cracking.

You can tell if an egg is overcooked by examining the yolk. If the egg was cooked too long the yolk will be a pale yellow surrounded by a green or greenish band. Overcooked eggs also give off the faint odor of sulfur.

Cracking of eggs while cooking is caused by the too rapid expansion of pressure in the air pocket inside the egg. Eggshell is porous and will allow the air to escape as the egg heats and its contents expand. However if the egg heats too quickly the air does not have time to escape. This causes an uneven pressure on the inside of the shell as the air pocket heats at a different rate than the white. The egg then cracks, often leaking into the cooking water.

There is one solution to these two problems. Place the eggs to be cooked in a pan or pot of cold water. There should be enough water to cover all the eggs completely. The pot should be large enough for all the eggs to lay on their sides with a little space between them. If they do touch it is alright, but there should be enough space that they don't have to be touching to fit.

Turn the stove on and bring the water to a rolling boil. Notice as you heat the eggs, you will see tiny air bubbles coming from the base (the big end) of the egg. This is air from the air pocket escaping. Once the water has been at a rolling boil for about a minute and a half, turn the stove off. Allow the water to gradually cool with the eggs in it. After about twenty minutes the water should be cool enough to reach in with your hands and remove the eggs. Not only have you allowed the air to escape, preventing the egg from cracking, but by gradually heating and then cooling the eggs they won't have overcooked. By the time the center of the egg has become hot enough to start really cooking the water will be cooling it down.

Enjoy your eggs!

==5. Prepare potatoes healthfully by two different methods.==
===Mashed Potatoes===
The first step in making mashed potatoes is to boil them.  Old potatoes normally need to be peeled before boiling. Many new potatoes are better when boiled in their skins, but you should of course wash them first. Small potatoes can be cooked whole. Larger potatoes will cook more evenly and quickly if you cut them into roughly egg-sized pieces. Put the potatoes in a large enough pan and add enough water to cover them easily. Add a little salt if you like. Bring to the boil. Potatoes will take around 25 minutes to cook through. To test whether they are done, press the tip of a cook's knife into one. It should be able to slip in and out easily. Drain the cooking water and attack the potatoes with a knife so that they are cut into small pieces. (This is very therapeutic.) You then need to add some milk and butter (according to taste and waistline) and puree all ingredients. Use a potato-ricer or a mixer for best results or a hand held masher for possibly lumpy mash. You can add salt and pepper or other herbs and spices as you wish.

===Baked Potatoes===
On a cold day, few things are nicer than a baked potato. Use a large potato, with its skin on. Preheat the oven to very hot (gas mark 7) and put in the potatoes for about an hour. Especially when using an electric oven, it is important to protect the potatoes from drying by covering them with foil or coating them in oil. A lid over the whole batch will do, saving on foil and oil. You may put a metal skewer through the potato to help distribute heat evenly. Trial and error are, as usual, your friends. Serve the potato as hot as you can stand it. Fillings can include butter, grated cheese (something strong like cheddar), baked beans, pesto - you name it. And eat the skin - it really is good for you, like your mum said.

==6. Cook three other vegetables in the most healthful way.==
The most healthful way to prepare vegetables is to wash them and serve them raw (possibly slicing them first), but the requirement ''does'' say to ''cook'' them, so we'll have to go that route.  Most vegetables can be steamed for a short amount of time - the shorter the better, as that's the closest to raw you're going to get and still cook them.

===Spinach===
Plain cooked spinach is best served steamed or boiled in a minimum amount of water for no more than five minutes. The bulk of the leaves reduces enormously in cooking. Allow about 4 ounces per serving and use the biggest pan you have. Serve with lemon juice, or perhaps with salt.

Spinach is a common ingredient in Indian cuisine, where it is known as ''saag''. Try sprinkling the raw leaves with garam masala before cooking for a slightly different and low sodium alternative to salt.

===Green Beans===
Wash beans thoroughly in clear, cool water. Beans can be cooked whole, cut crosswise or diagonally, or French-cut (i.e., cut along the length of the bean). If you want sweet tasting, crisp fresh beans, cut them as little as possible. Cut older, more mature beans in the French style (i.e., lengthwise).

Stir-frying is one of the easiest ways to prepare green beans. This method maintains more nutrients than other cooking methods, although it also adds a little fat to them. Whatever cooking method you choose, remember to cook beans as little as possible, using the least amount of water possible.

Boiling, steaming, and microwaving are other common methods for preparing green beans. When boiling, beans may release some nutrients into the water, so try to re-use the bean water to regain some of the nutrients lost. For example, you can use the water to boil rice.

===Winter Squash===
To cook a decent-sized winter squash in the traditional way, first slice it in half from stem end to blossom end. If the squash is very large, cut it a few more times. Place the pieces into a baking dish. Cover the dish with foil to keep the squash from getting terribly dry. Cook the squash for a fairly long time, not at a very high temperature, so that it gets soft all the way to the inside. The squash is done when you can easily shove a spoon into it. Serve the squash as it is. Add butter and maple syrup at the table.

==7. Prepare a simple salad. Why do we need fresh salads in our diet?==
Green salads are an excellent source of vitamins and dietary fiber.  Furthermore, salads are generally low in calories, and if served at the beginning of a meal, tend to satisfy the appetite before high-calorie items are introduced.  A simple salad may start out with one or more types of lettuce (iceberg, romaine, etc.), and to that other vegetables are added, such as tomatoes, olives, cucumber slices, green peppers, mushrooms, radishes, or onions.  This combination is then &quot;tossed&quot; to mix the ingredients together before serving.  Salad dressing may be selected and added by the person eating the salad.

==8. Know the food pyramid guide. Why is it important that we follow the food pyramid guide in our diet every day? Make a chart for one week of the foods you eat to see if you are following the food pyramid guide.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Food pyramid}}

==9. Set the table properly for your family for an evening meal. Serve a balanced meal that you have planned and prepared as much as possible by yourself. Include main dish, vegetable, and salad.==
Properly setting a table means ''not'' putting out utensils and dishes that will not be used in the meal.  A casual table setting will do for the family evening meal, and since this one requires a salad, vegetable, and main dish, we can dispense with many of the formalities.  

;Dinner Plate: Start by setting the dinner plate on the center of the placemat (if a placemat is not used, set the plate on the table centered in front of the chair), about two inches from the edge of the table.  

;Forks: You will need two forks - one for the salad (usually a smaller fork) and one for the main entree and vegetables.  Both forks should be placed to the left of the plate, with the dinner fork closest to the plate.  

;Napkin: Put a napkin to the left of the salad fork.

;Knife and Spoon: The knife and spoon go to the right of the dinner plate, with the knife set closer to the plate.  The knife's edge should face the plate, and the spoon should be placed right-side up (such that the bowl of the spoon would hold a liquid).

;Glasses: The drinking glass should be placed above the knife.

;Salad Bowl: The salad bowl should be placed above the forks.

==10. Follow a recipe correctly in making a vegetarian entree or a vegetable casserole.==

==5. Prepare two kinds of salad. How are salads kept crisp?==
The first step in preparing a salad with lettuce is to wash the lettuce.  Unfortunately, getting the lettuce wet will hasten its demise.  Removing the water from the lettuce will go a long way towards making it keep longer in the refrigerator, and this can be accomplished with either a salad spinner, or by patting it dry with paper towels.

Also, it helps to remove water-absorbent ingredients (such as croutons) before refrigerating, because these items will become mushy as they get wetter.
===Basic Mixed Greens Salad===
*1 large salad bowl
*1/2 head looseleaf lettuce or 1 lb. bag mixed salad greens
*1-2 tomatoes
*baby carrots (as many as desired, may be divided or shredded)
*1 can black olives, sliced (opt.)
*4 oz of cheese, chopped in squares OR shredded Parmesan or mozzarella cheese

Salad dressing of choice

===Fruit Salad===
1 can each of--
*Pears
*Peaches
*Pineapple
*Mixed fruit

Garnish with dried cranberries and/or walnuts as desired

Mix together, serve chilled.  Garnish with cranberries/walnuts just prior to serving.

==6. Know the difference in food value between whole milk, lowfat milk, and non-dairy milk.==
Whole milk is 3.7% fat by weight.  One cup of whole milk has about 160 calories and 1/3 of the saturated fat needed in a day's diet.  For children and others who need a lot of calories to fuel their day (such as athletes and people with non-sedentary jobs) whole milk is an excellent option.

Low-fat milk is 2%, 1%, or skim (0%) fat by weight.  One cup of milk has 80 to 120 calories.  Most adults live a sedentary lifestyle and thus should avoid whole milk in most circumstances.  Instead, most adults should choose 1% or skim milk.  Even though the calorie difference is only 40-60 calories, the difference in fat content (.4 gram for skim to 9 grams for whole milk) is significant.  The majority of adult diets in the modern world already contain an abundance of fat, well above the recommended daily allowance.

==7. Prepare a balanced breakfast using the food pyramid guide.==
The food pyramid guide recommends that a person get food from five different groups over the course of a day.  Remember that breakfast is only one meal, so it is not strictly necessary that it contain items from every group.  A simple breakfast of pancakes with apple sauce, veggie links, and a glass of milk make a great start to the day.  This covers the grain, fruit, meat, and dairy categories.

* Put on lid and simmer until water is absorbed. (about 15 minutes)
}}
&lt;br&gt;
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recipe
| name = Lentil Rice Loaf
| ingredients = 
* ½ cup brown rice (not all will be used)
* ½ cup lentils
* 2½ cups vegetable stock
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 beaten egg
* 2 tablespoon (approx.) seasoned bread crumbs
* ½ finely chopped onion
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
| procedure = 
Cook the lentils (in about 1½ cups of stock, with the bay leaf). Cover and simmer for approximately 45 minutes, or until lentils are tender but not falling apart (they should offer slight resistance to the bite). You may need to add additional stock during cooking; the lentils should remain covered. At the same time, cook the brown rice in 1 cup of stock--bring the stock to a boil, add rice, reduce heat to low, cover and cook at lowest setting for 50 minutes.

Empty about three-quarters of the rice into a bowl, along with lentils. A little liquid from the lentils should be added--maybe two to three tablespoons' worth, but not too much. To the lentil-rice mixture add the egg, onion, olive oil and bread crumbs. Adjust ratio of rice to lentils by adding more rice if desired. Add bread crumbs until mixture holds together.

Place mixture in a small greased baking dish and bake at 350° F for 35 minutes, or until a crust is formed around the edge. Allow to cool for at least ten minutes before cutting and serving. | servings = 4

==9. Plan menus for one week, choosing at least three dishes in which leftovers may be used.==
Before you begin, think about what will happen during the week.  Choose quick and easy recipes for those times when you will be pressed for time, and save the more complicated ones for when you are not so harried.  You may not need to plan every meal of every day - for instance, if no one is home for lunch on Monday through Friday and they will eat in a school cafeteria instead, you can skip planning those meals.  Or it could be as simple as peanut butter and jelly sandwiches if the family will pack a lunch (though a small bag of carrots, a banana, or a box of juice would certainly make a nice addition to that).

Simple dishes work best as leftovers because they can be used as ingredients to a more complicated recipe later in the week without becoming tiresome.  For example, think about recipes that require cooked rice or green beans as an ingredient, and try to work that into the menu as a side dish a day or two before it reappears as part of the entree.  Or think about the simple ingredients you will have left over and find a recipe that can use it.  Leftover veggies go great in soup, and macaroni and cheese is the basis for several casseroles.

==10. Prepare a balanced meal using a vegetarian entree, a vegetable casserole, and a salad.==
There are recipes for all three of these types of dishes sprinkled throughout this honor.

==11. Know several reasons why vinegar is unhealthful.==
There is very little written these days about vinegar's unhealthiness because scientists have discovered several remarkably good qualities about this once misunderstood food.   

However, back in the 1800's Ellen White wrote:

Letter 9, 1887 -- EGW states:
:''&quot;The salads are prepared with oil and vinegar, fermentation takes place in the stomach, and the food does not digest, but decays or putrefies; as a consequence, the blood is not nourished, but becomes filled with impurities, and liver and kidney difficulties appear.&quot;''

So that we see that vinegar is not the only condiment to warrant dietary caution, there are several other statements in which she mentions that pickles, chili, mustard, spices, and other condiments are also unhealthful.  
:''&quot;Condiments are injurious in their nature. Mustard, pepper, spices, pickles, and other things of a like character irritate the stomach and make the blood feverish and impure.&quot; MH 325''

However, her general principal seems to be 
:''&quot;In this fast age, the less exciting the food, the better.&quot;  MH 325''
While we may ask &quot;so what wrong with a little bit of _____ in our food&quot; the answer is NOT a salvation answer, but rather a matter of healthy choice:  Do I NEED that ________ in order to digest or enjoy my food?  In many cases we may find that the answer is &quot;No, not really.&quot;  

In fact, if we in general simplify our diet, we may find ourselves healthier &amp; happier than we did before!

==12. What does caffeine do to the body? List five foods that contain caffeine.==
Caffeine is a mild stimulant to the central nervous system. It is not addictive, though it can be habit forming. When caffeine intake is stopped abruptly, some individuals can experience headache, fatigue or drowsiness. Age and body size can make a difference in effect. A child or a smaller person may feel caffeine's effects more strongly than an adult or a heavier, taller person. A cup of strongly brewed coffee or tea has more caffeine than a weakly brewed cup.

Here is a list of some foods that contain caffeine:
#Caffeinated Coffee
#Some Soft drinks
#Some Root Beer
#Some Teas
#Chocolate
#Cocoa
#Kola Nuts

==13. Have 25 recipes of personally-prepared dishes, not more than five of which are candies or desserts.==
Here is where you get to be creative!  Scan recipe books in your family kitchen, at your grandparents home, or maybe even the library.  

What are some of your favorite recipes from your churches' potluck / fellowship lunch?  Maybe you could ask the people who cook those recipes to share them with you!

Many [http://www.adventistbookcenter.com Adventist Book Centers] offer a complete line of  recipe books that show you how to prepare healthy but yummy dishes.  Some of our favorites are &quot;Choices&quot; and &quot;More Choices.&quot;  Both of these books offer recipes with vegetarian and vegan options.

Organize your 25 recipes in a recipe box or book.  Your local retailer will have several options to choose from.


'''Some Categories of recipes:'''
*Entrees
*Breakfast
*Desserts
*Vegetables
*Side Dishes
*Salads
*Soups


Note:  One of the most successful &quot;rules of thumb&quot; for collecting truly successful recipes for YOU is:  Does my refrigerator and pantry USUALLY contain the majority of ingredients in the recipe.  That way, you can make the recipe when YOU feel like it, without making a last minute trip to the grocery store!

Cashew chicken was invented at Leong's Tea House in Springfield, Missouri.  Leong had difficulty popularizing Chinese cuisine in the area and based the dish on the popular fried foods common in the Ozarks.  The dish is not truly Chinese, rather an American dish with a &quot;Chinese&quot; theme.

Note that there is also an unbreaded [[Cookbook:Cashew Chicken|Cashew Chicken]] recipe with softened cashews.

==Ingredients==
* 2 medium chicken breasts
* 1 c flour
* 3 eggs
* 1 c milk
* salt (to taste)
* cashews
* green onions

===Sauce Ingredients===
* 1 can chicken broth
* 1 Tbsp cornstarch
* 2 Tbsp cold water
* 2 Tbsp soy sauce
* 2 Tbsp oyster sauce

==Procedure==
#Debone and cut chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces. 
#Beat eggs and mix with milk. 
#Dip breasts into egg/milk combination, then into flour (add a dash of salt) and deep fry.
#For the sauce, pour one can chicken broth in a saucepan and heat on low to medium heat. 
#Make a [[Cookbook:Cornstarch Slurry|cornstarch slurry]] with the cornstarch and cold water.  Set aside. 
#Add 2 tablespoons each oyster sauce and soy sauce to the broth to taste.  Continue heating the sauce.
#Add the cornstarch slurry as needed to thicken the sauce until it reaches the desired consistency.  

Serve chicken on fried rice, cover liberally with sauce and garnish with cashews (chopped, if desired) and chopped green onions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A mixin is the possibility to make a copy of a template to a specified place.

 &lt;font color=blue&gt;template&lt;/font&gt; t(T){
   T get(){
     &lt;font color=blue&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; mValue;
   }
 }

This alone makes no sense. But if you want to insert it into a class, 
which has got a member variable mValue this can make sense.

 &lt;font color=blue&gt;class&lt;/font&gt; C{
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;private int&lt;/font&gt; mValue;
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;mixin&lt;/font&gt; t(&lt;font color=blue&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;);
 }

You can use mixins to assemble a class out of pieces. 

== Make an outer class know the mixin ==
If you need a way to make your mixin known to the outer class, you can use 
static constructors.

 &lt;font color=blue&gt;template&lt;/font&gt; t(T){
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;static this&lt;/font&gt;(){
     sMixinCounter++;
   }
 }
 
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;class&lt;/font&gt; C{
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;private static int&lt;/font&gt; sMixinCounter;
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;private int&lt;/font&gt; mValue;
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;mixin&lt;/font&gt; t(&lt;font color=blue&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;);
 }

If you want to use multiple of such mixin, they have to be named, to avoid linker errors.

 &lt;font color=blue&gt;class&lt;/font&gt; C{
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;private static int&lt;/font&gt; sMixinCounter;
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;private int&lt;/font&gt; mValue;
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;mixin&lt;/font&gt; t(&lt;font color=blue&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;) t1;
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;mixin&lt;/font&gt; t(&lt;font color=blue&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;) t2;
 }

I think the analogy between traffic lights and languages is a logical short circuit. Just like the &quot;language&quot; of a traffic light, so are our languages limited. We can only express a limited number of objects, feelings, phenomena etc. If you want to differentiate the language of a traffic light and the verbal language of a human being, you should establish other parameters for differentiation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MotoDVRTOC}}
This is a book on using a [[W:Motorola|Motorola]] [[W:Digital video recorder|DVR]].

There are several different DVR models from Motorola.  The major models include:

* The ''' DCT64''xx'' and DCT34''xx'' ''' series are dual-tuner [[W:High-definition television|HDTV]] DVRs utilized by many cable companies in the US, Canada and Latin America.  Both DVRs can record two channels at once and play back a recorded show at the same time. The 64''xx'' can record two [[W:Analog_television|analog]], [[W:Digital_tv|digital]], or [[W:HDTV|HDTV]] channels. The 34''xx'' has no analog tuner, allowing for two digital or HDTV channels. The 6412 and 3412 have a 120[[W:Gigabyte|GB]] hard drive giving it an HDTV recording time of 12-20 hours and much more for analog or SD digital TV. The 6416 and 3416 have a 160[[W:Gigabyte|GB]] drive.  DCT is an acronym for &quot;Digital Consumer Terminal&quot; or &quot;Digital Cable Terminal&quot;.

* The '''DCT3080''' is a variation that can record HD, but can only output non-HD 480i video.  

* The '''QIP6416''' is a version that also supports IP television and [[W:Multimedia over Coax Alliance|MoCA]]. It is used by [[W:Verizon|Verizon]] [[W:FIOS|FIOS]] subscribers. QIP stands for &quot;QAM/Internet Protocol&quot;.  The Boxes look almost identical to the DCT

* The ''' DCH64''xx'' and DCH34''xx'' ''' series have a very different appearance than the DCT series, but otherwise internally are very similar.  The look of the DCH series was designed  the same team that designed the Motorola RAZR. DCH is an acronym for &quot;Digital Connected Home&quot;.

* The '''DCX series''' was announced by Motorola on January 3, 2008. The DCX series support [[w:MPEG-4|MPEG4]] compression, [[w:DOCSIS|DOCSIS 2.0]], and have 1GHz tuners. The first model is the DCX-3400. Then it was the DCX3200 which is a cable box that has the capabilities of the DCX3400 exempt for the dvr function. After that came the DCX3300 which is a hybrid of the DCX3200 and DCX3400 which allows you to have dvr capabilities by adding an external hard drive. Then came the DCX3200-M P2 (Phase 2) and DCX3200-M P3 (Phase 3) which are different in design then the dcx3200 but function the same but adds the total home dvr to work with any true2way dvr. The Newest one Motorola has released was the DCX3501/DCX3510 which is the same as the DCX3400 but can up convert all HD 720p and 1080i to 1080p. All New DCX series DVR's have a 500[[W:Gigabyte|GB]] Hard drive &lt;ref&gt;http://www.motorola.com/mediacenter/news/detail.jsp?globalObjectId=9066_8995_23 Motorola Delivers Enhanced Viewing Experiences and More HD Content with Next-Generation DVR Set-Tops&lt;/ref&gt; The DCX series further differs in appearance from the DCT and DCH series set-top boxes.

* The '''DCT6208''' may still be in use in some areas. This was the first DVR from Motorola, and is a modified DCT6200 (non-DVR). It only contains a single tuner and an 80[[W:Gigabyte|GB]] drive. It's generally used in areas that still use an A/B (dual cable) system. It appears to still be using an earlier version of the i-Guide software.

* The DCT-5100 and DCT-6200 are basically the same as the 64xx series, but without the DVR features.

Most of the software features, such as iGuide usage, will be the same for any Motorola DCT- or DCH-series cable box, and even many non-Motorola cable boxes.  Besides the i-Guide, in late 2007, Comcast added a Tivo software option after signing a deal with the widely popular DVR service, on the heels of Tivo being dropped by satellite programming provider DirecTV, in 2006.

In the United States, the Motorola DVR is usually owned by the cable company and rented to cable subscribers.

In Canada, the Motorola DVR is usually owned by the subscriber, purchased from their cable company or retail outlets such as [[W:Future Shop|Future Shop]] and [[W:Best Buy|Best Buy]].

# For Chapter 2's exercises, we created an XML document, schema, and stylesheet to define a museum entity.  Change that stylesheet to transform  that XML document into another XML document, instead of into HTML.
# In Chapter 4 we created an XML document, schema, and stylesheet to list restaurants, including the most popular, in a city.
#* a. Create a new stylesheet that uses a named template to output the name of the city. Then use two templates with different modes to print out the restaurants, using a larger font for the most popular restaurant. 
#* b. Now create a stylesheet that will sort the restaurant names alphabetically, and number them using the &lt;tt&gt;number()&lt;/tt&gt; function and a single level of numbering. 
#* c. Finally, we will use the &lt;tt&gt;call-template&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;with-param&lt;/tt&gt; elements to create a stylesheet that will count the restaurants in a city, and add the prices up, and output it to a text file. This stylesheet will first call a  template named &amp;quot;count-restaurants&amp;quot; and will use &lt;tt&gt;with-param&lt;/tt&gt; to pass a parameter to count the restaurants.  Then it will call a template named &amp;quot;sum-prices&amp;quot; that will use &lt;tt&gt;with-param&lt;/tt&gt; to pass the parameter &amp;quot;num&amp;quot; to sum() the upper price for the restaurant.

== [[:de:Hauptseite]] ==

If we are going to talk about attractive front pages for Wikibooks, I think the German Wikibooks is at least one to try and compare to.  I like the clean boxes and even how they organized the &quot;Welcome&quot; message at the top.  Pay attention to &quot;Buch des Monats&quot; (Books of the Month) and &quot;Hilf mit!&quot; (Collaboration of the Month).  Neither are over powering on the front page.  One feature we don't have that they do have is &quot;Review des Monats&quot; (Book review of the Month), where a nearly finished Wikibook is put up for editorial review and a request to give it a quick glance by Wikibooks contributors is made to the community.

One thing that both the French Wikipedia example and this German Wikibooks do well is to have a clean &quot;table of contents&quot; or content search area.  One thing I would like to add (and is hinted to on the Main Page) is to have multiple methods of searching for content.  Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress, Wikibooks Bookshelf, Alphabetical, Google, and other search methods for content ought to happen.  Some more on that it a bit, but this is a good place to try and cut down on the content.  One place I would like to see substantially enhanced with a search like this is to strongly emphasis what is the best of Wikibooks.  Considerable criticism of Wikibooks by many bloggers and outsiders to our project has been leveled at the quality of the content we have here... considering we have been going now for a couple of years with (from an outsider's viewpoint) nothing to show for all this effort except for a poorly done reproduction of Wikipedia.

As the &quot;flagship&quot; Wikibooks project, I think it is critical to keep the &quot;Wikibooks in other languages&quot; section on the Main Page, even if it takes up a little more room.  It needs to be updated (See [[Meta:List of Wikibooks]] for a more accurate and up to date list) but still should be here. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:42, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Considerable criticism of Wikibooks by many bloggers and outsiders to our project has been leveled at the quality of the content we have here... considering we have been going now for a couple of years with (from an outsider's viewpoint) nothing to show for all this effort except for a poorly done reproduction of Wikipedia.&quot;

Actually, as a think tank, this is unfair of them, because if you
use systems theory and reduce this effort to years and then think
of wikibooks as an entity going through its mirror of evolution, 
Wikibooks is still just a toddler. Skeptical review of the sort I
imagine exists ought to wait till there are 20 years of development.
Of course there is crap in wikibooks- frankly I have spotted some
stuff i think is bizzare and slightly frightening. But there is also
very good, very high quality, open source content here, and noise to
content ratio is only going to improve as time goes on.

Skeptics of wikimedia fail to understand the exponential growth
principle as it applies to information systems. An open edit system
may mean that there are 100 articles generated by somebody who knows
next to nothing on the subject for every article that is generated by
that team of experts. The happy thing is, each of those pieces of junk
is &quot;do-over&quot; bait for the interested, and the potential user base is
literally in the millions. Somewhere in America, some geek somewhere
DOES know the facts, and, given an opportunity, probably there are 10
of them who would be willing to share them. Our job is to create a
strong enough knowledge base that experts start to take the resource
seriously. From there, interest alone will drive a geometric expansion,
which will eventually yield the largest and most complete database on
any given subject ever created.

Back to the point at hand. I have generated a list of bookshelves,
and i'd like your opinion on it. I will go look at the &quot;Total list&quot;
and perhaps add it as the next item to my talk page.
Thanks.

:&quot;will eventually yield the largest and most complete database on any given subject ever created.&quot; Yes! The only problem with Wikibooks versus Wikipedia is that a Wikipedia article takes a few hours whereas a Wikibook takes a few months. Wikipedia started on its truly exponential phase after almost 2 years, Wikibooks will take 4 or 5 years. It is essential that worthwhile output from Wikibooks is put &quot;up-front&quot; on the main page so that new contributors can see what might be done and are drawn in. &quot;Highlighted books&quot; does this to some extent but readers must still explore the book development environment before finding something to read.

There are 4 or 5 other books that could be added once Print versions/PDFs have been made. Perhaps authors can make the production of print versions a priority?

I am no artists. Small images could be added and the colour scheme improved.

Readers who are interested in less complete books, and contributors can then be given a more complex set of instructions further down the page.

=== three places ===

We currently discuss the main page at three places. So I have to add a shameless plug to to draw some attention to my proposal of improving the front page: [[Template talk:Main Page introduction/Archive 1#Suggestion: A copy from w:fr:Modèle:Encyclopédie|
Template_talk:Main_Page_introduction#Suggestion:_A_copy_from_w:fr:Mod.C3.A8le:Encyclop.C3.A9die.]]
--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:45, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
:As far as your plug, I think it's a great layout. With a little section moving I think it would be a great addition to [[Wikibooks:Departments|Wikibooks:All Books]]. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 20:37, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

=== Removal of All Wikibooks ===

I decided to '''be bold''' and do some more rearranging of the content on the [[Main Page]].  The big difference is that I created a new page called [[Wikibooks:Departments|Wikibooks:All Books]] and moved the list of Wikibooks that was ever growing to that page instead.  I also added a very prominent link to this new page, and moved it directly underneath the list of featured Wikibooks.

One of the things that I would like to see changed, however, is perhaps the placement of the books themselves.  It is conflicting with the &quot;Other langauges/FAQ/table-free version&quot; floating bar and I'm not sure if this is the best place to put all of these books anyway.  I just wanted all of the book related links grouped together at the moment.

BTW, this isn't by any means the &quot;final&quot; version of this, just a suggestion to help cut down on the huge overload from having every single Wikibook on the main page.  Please discuss other options and ideas for this as well to help improve things here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:38, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

: Two notes.  First, on [[User:Karl_Wick|Karl's]] computer, the FAQ and Table-free bar does not extended into the Highlighted books box [{{fullurl:User_talk:Karl_Wick}}#Recent_edit_to_Template:Main_Page_introduction].  However, it does on mine (as it does on yours).  I haven't checked it from my Linux computer; but the spatial conflict is there on my Windows XP computer with both Firefox and Internet Explorer.  Second, the collected bookshelf templates you moved from the Main Page to [[Wikibooks:Departments|Wikibooks:All Books]] does ''not'' contain all books.  In theory, at least, a bookshelf template don't include the more stubby books from its bookshelf.

==Transwikiing a book from WP==
The Wikipedia article [[StrategyWiki:TimeSplitters: Future Perfect|TimeSplitters: Future Perfect strategy guide]] is being proposed for deletion, but I thought that the information should somehow be saved. Would it be appropriate for me to just dump the text here and not (necessarily) work on formatting it/etc.? [[User:Ardric47|Ardric47]] 04:24, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

:Either it's already been deleted or you've given the wrong URL. As to whether it belongs here, the questions to ask are (1) is it a textbook?; or (2) will it develop into a textbook? If the answer to at least one of those is yes, then it can be transwiki'ed here - however, it's best to let the editors of a transwiki'ed page know that it's come here if they may wish to work on it. As far as formatting, ideally you'd do it yourself, if you're unable to, don't worry, that can be done later, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:42, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

::Yes, it has been deleted. I would have assumed that the person who deleted it would have noted the discussion in the talk page...&lt;strike&gt;I'm not sure if it would be worth it to go through deletion review&lt;/strike&gt;. In any case, I wouldn't exactly call it a textbook, although I have noticed that Wikibooks has ''many'' video game strategy guides. [[User:Ardric47|Ardric47]] 09:26, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

:::Apparently undeletion &quot;[t]o permit a deleted article to be transwikified or properly moved to a sister wiki-site&quot; is a common reason, so I'm going to try that now. [[User:Ardric47|Ardric47]] 09:44, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

As I'm not an administrator on Wikipedia, I can't help you out with trying to undelete content there, although you are always welcome to remove the deletion tags on Wikipedia content as long as you have a good reason.  Wikipedia has a markup tag of '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Move to Wikibooks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' that you could have used to replace the speedy delete tag at any time with.  It is unfortunate that the Wikipedia administrators were abusive to you in this way that it seems.  Gaming strategy guides are welcome here on Wikibooks, and I hope that you have the opportunity to further the development of this content.  BTW, there is a talk page about this content at [[w:Talk:TimeSplitters: Future Perfect strategy guide]], and it appears as though the user listed above did try in good faith to move the content to Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:35, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

:::::There is no 'bot that adds the edit history (or is required at least), although there are some 'bots that do this automatically in terms of transfering complicated amounts of text from one Wikimedia project to another and include the edit history.  For a single article on Wikipedia this is completely unnecessary, but I would recommend that you add the edit history in some format on the talk page here on Wikibooks.  This is usually done immediately after you have copied the content.  Technically we ask people doing a transwiki to add it to the [[Transwiki:]] namespace (it makes it easier to make sure it gets to a logical place on Wikibooks), but if you are going to be adding substantial amounts of new content afterward you are certainly welcome to simply [[Help:How to start a book|create the new Wikibook]] just like it was completely new content and go from there.  There is no real standard way of adding the edit history, although most people do a simple cut and past from your web browser when you bring up the old history and simply put it into the talk page, with a note at the top where the content was transfered from (aka Edit history on en.wikipedia:) Note that [[Special:Import]], if it ever gets working correctly, would allow importing a page with the complete edit history as well, but that is not working yet.  I think the developers are waiting for the universal login working first.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:20, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

:::::::The point of the Transwiki namespace is if you plan on moving content over to a project and then not do any further development or editing.  It is also a transition warning to administrators and other participants on the project that some new content is being added, and that perhaps it needs to be reformatted or have other things occur with the content before it is added to the main project namespace.  If you intend to be active within Wikibooks and understand existing policies here, there is no need to move it into the transwiki namespace.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:07, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

== Copied a wikipedia article to a book... anyone have a bot for adding &quot;w:&quot;? ==

The book is [[Vermicomposting]], which will make a good foundation for a how-to book. I'd like to edit it for the formatting (making it more of a how-to than it already is), but it also has a million red links because it was well wikied on the 'pedia. Does anyone have a bot for adding &quot;w: &quot; to these links? It would take a lot of time to do it manually :). [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 15:45, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

:Keep in mind that you are going to need to do a considerable amount of editing for this content anyway if you are going to try and turn this into a book.  Generally, most of the content here doesn't have nearly as many link as a typical Wikipedia article does, and a good number of what you have in this initial stub would be good to remove as well.  Compare what you have there to [[How To Assemble A Desktop PC]] (a very good example of a polished Wikibook) and there are some major differences.

:Formerly, we had a specific policy that prohibited exactly what you did here by copying a Wikipedia article.  I fought to change that policy as I felt it was too exclusionary and arbitrary, but remember that if you want to work on content that is basicly an article worthy of inclusion with Wikipedia, you ought to keep it on Wikipedia and not here on Wikibooks.  A good rule of thumb is that the content should exceed the 32K text limit that generally enforced on Wikipedia for a single article.  Wikibooks is for situations where you need content on multiple pages that goes into much more depth than a typical Wikipedia article.

:I guess what I'm saying here is that simply having a 'bot clean up the red links and point them at Wikipedia is not going to be sufficient and much more editing needs to happen, with almost a complete rewrite of the whole content as well.  As a stub and a start to something much larger is fine, but what you have here would generally be considered a stub for Wikibooks, even if it wouldn't be for Wikipedia.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:00, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

::I've been wonjdering about how much &quot;wiki-linking&quot; needs to be done, actually. A lot of the links there aren't really necessary. So there are no 'bots? 

::Don't misunderstand my intentions... I'll be reformatting it, and am recruiting some folks with know-how(-to) from web forums. OTOH, it probably won't ever end up more than 10 or 20 pages with illustration. It might end up belonging to a larger book about composting in general, but the folks interested in writing and editing I've found so far are worm-bin fanatics. A lot of the gardening how-to stuff is going to be stubby (for example: [[How to Grow Daylilies]] is almost complete... there's just only so much to be said), and will probably end up needing to be reorganized into larger books. Small steps lead to great projects, of course :). [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 17:13, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

When I [[Using KDE|use KDE]], the Konqueror browser lets me search and replace wiki text. &lt;nowiki&gt;I type Command-R, search for &quot;[[&quot; and &quot;]]&quot;, and replace it with &quot;[[w:&quot; and &quot;|]]&quot;. This changes [[link]] into [[w:link|]], but it also changes [[link|label]] into [[w:link|label|]], so I then have to search for &quot;[[w:&quot; or &quot;|]]&quot; and manually fix the labeled links.&lt;/nowiki&gt; In effect, Command-R in Konqueror is almost like the bot that you want. If I am at some other browser, like Firefox, then I must wait until I find a computer with Konqueror again.

Actually, some users like to copy and abandon Wikipedia articles on this site. These are often the same users who forget to mention that Wikipedia is the source. Instead of fixing those pages, I try to have those pages deleted, because Wikibooks is not an encyclopedia. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:35, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

== Watching all pages of a book ==
:''Old title: &quot;Maybe a silly question...&quot;''

If I'm &quot;watching&quot; a book, am I also &quot;watching&quot; all the chapters of that book, or do I have to watch each chapter? This relates to my previous question, because the [[Vermicomposting]] book currently has all red links for its chapters, but I've been &quot;advertising&quot; it on web forums and expect content to be added.

== WikiNovel? ==

I'm going completely out on a limb here, but I've been discussing an idea with a few friends and colleagues of a creative writing wiki. If this is already in place somewhere, could I please get a link? Otherwise, I know that the idea might be somewhat far-fetched, but I have reason to believe that this kind of an effort would bring forth a new level of collaborative thinking. My main question is simple, is there a place that I could attempt to put my thoughts out on this, and possibly get a start for it? Even if it is on one of the WikiMedia user pages that I have yet to create. Could this be done without violating some principal rules or 'laws-of-the-land'? Would I be somewhat brow-beaten, or would this be acceptable somewhere? I'm sorry if this comment (question, really) is ill-placed, but since I had the idea, WikiBooks was the closest place I could think to get some insight. Thanks much in advance for any assistance/guidance you can provide.

:You might instead want to check out http://novelas.wikicities.com/ which is a part of the Wikicities family of projects.  A [[meta:Proposals for new projects#Creative writing / fiction|proposal for making a fiction based Wikimedia project]] has been offered many times and simply needs somebody to sit down and make a formal proposal that incorporates all of the various ideas.  As to if it will be accepted by the Wikimedia Foundation board, that remains to be seen.  The Novelas Wikicity is a much better choice at the moment as it is current up and running.

:Generally speaking, Wikibooks is only for non-fiction content.  I hope this answers you questions, and I hope that you can get a collaborative fiction group working.  There are some outstanding things that can be accomplished in this way, and writing fiction as a Wiki brings the whole concept of a detailed common fictional universe to an extreme that has not really been dealt with before.  I hope you can get your project put together and going.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:21, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote/Deletion Policy]] ==

This is a general announcement that I am restarting the vote for [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] to become enforced policy on Wikibooks.  [[User:Aya|Aya]] was bold in even suggesting that it was only a proposed policy in the first place, as it has been on Wikibooks now for over two years and added by one of the early founders of Wikibooks (Mav).  A few changes have happened over the years, including some significant changes this past year.

If you have an opinion on this, please go to the vote page listed in the section heading.  It is important that we do get community input on this, and try to come up with what the actual policy should be here for deleting content, as [[Special:Log/Delete]] is hardly dead by any means.

There is nothing special by my moving to make this a formal vote, but the previous voting page didn't really get any realistic input and needed to be advertised better.  I'm hoping that there will be some significant community input on this policy by becoming an enforced policy.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:25, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

== The Book Of The Year (BOTY) Award &amp; Book of the half-year Awards(1/2-year Book Award) ==

This is just a suggestion and is not been totally accepted by anyone. I have an idea that apart from Book Of The Month,we should create a Book Of The Year Award, because a year is always a blessed one, and we'll decide which was the best book created in that year. The Half-Year Award, I'm not so sure but I think it should be given to the best book created in the fisrt half (six months) of the special year). The nominations rules for the Awards should be as follows:-

BOTY = Book Of The Year ; 1/2-Year = Half-Year Award

*  BOTY: Every Book that has been a Book Of The Month in that specific year will receive a free nomination, although any exterior book can also be added (at least which is senseful). A Collaboration Of The Month book nominee '''which is been finished before the year''' also receives a '''free nomination'''.

* 1/2-Year: All rules are followed here from BOTY except that the books must be before the half of that specific year and after of the starting of that specific year.

Please think and then discuss. — &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[User:Mastermind_007|'''''Master''''']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;silver&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Mastermind_007|'''''mind''''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Mastermind_007|'''''007''''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''16:08, 4 March 2006 (UTC)'''&lt;/font&gt;

:Because this is March and not December, it seems premature to suggest this, but yeah, I think a Wikibook of the Year would be a good idea.  There is a small but dedicated community that seems to hang out with the Book of the Month nominations.  I don't think it is too late to hold a quick vote over the best of Wikibooks for 2005, however, and that might be something fun to do even now.  If you can come up with something that would be a useful template that we could add to the Main Page, feel free to write up the content and I'll try to find a place to put it.  With the reshuffling of the main page, I hope it doesn't get lost.  An honest question would be to determine how long a Book of the Year would appear on the main page (all year long? one month?) and how long we ought to be doing the voting.  Even now, the Wikijunior New Book of the Quarter seems to be up for far too long and IMHO is the absolute longest you want a voting page up.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:32, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

:I was trying to suggest it must not be done that quick either  because 9 moths are left before the end of this blessed year so [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] here are the answers to your questions:-

* The voting should begin at the starting of December. All the books who have became a Book Of The Month in that specific yearwill receive a free nomination (automatic nomination) although the useres can add a good collaborative also.

* If a book which has been nominated Collaboration Of The Month ''and'' has been '''''finished''''' completely in the same year, it also receives a free nomination.

* The voting for the Book Of The Year should appear on the [[Main Page]] '''at the starting of December''' and when the Book is won the award, it must remain for the next month's January (it will be taken off from the [[Main Page]] at the 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of January of the next year.

* The Book Of The Month should be concluded in the case of Book Of The Year. It must remain and must be carried on.

Since, there are 9 months remaining, more rules, logo can be created and more collaboration debates of the Book Of The Year logo, template and rules can be discussed first not accepted.

==The need for use and content statistics - So many books and so little time.==

I have been trawling through our books and gems keep on appearing.  The latest is:

[[XML:_Managing_Data_Exchange]]

This book has no &quot;development stage&quot; tag on it. It is also hidden under &quot;Domain specific languages&quot;.  Yet it is probably more developed than almost any Wikibook, has probably several hundred pages and it has a host of contributors. I had no idea it was so complete and only clicked on it by mistake! My guess is that there is about 6 man-months of effort by experts in [[XML:_Managing_Data_Exchange]] ($30,000+ of value) and it is hidden.

One way out of this problem is to produce statistics that rank books by content in megabytes and by number of views. This would allow two pages of rankings to be produced that could be used by administrators to highlight valuable books. Unfortunately we do not have any up-to-date statistics on views and the content statistics are difficult to use.

Does anyone know how to produce these statistics? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:19, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:For a source of this sort of statistical information, you can look at:  http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm

:This is a link that is buried in the Community Portal page, and something that is semi-regularly updated.  As far as sorting the information from largest to smallest, that may take a little more work, but at least the raw stats are here you you to look at.  I've used this page from time to time to find content that needs cleanup, or at least find stuff that doesn't look right.  The last update for this page was in December.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:56, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks. The list shows there are 4 or 5 large books outstanding that I had not located as candidates for PDFs. So there are at least 25-30 substantial books in Wikibooks! I am surprised because, at a cursory inspection a couple of months back, there seemed to be around 10. 

::The other essential statistic is &quot;views per book&quot;. This statistic will allow the most popular books to be identified so they can be placed prominently on the front page to attract readers. A &quot;views per page&quot; statistic would expose navigation routes and help system design. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:16, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:::I would agree that &quot;views per book&quot; would be an excellent statistic to generate.  Unfortunately, the view counter was disabled by the developers due to raw server load and an attempt to try and streamline the Wikimedia servers.  The raw growth in terms of page requests and the number of contributors is so large right now that there are some serious lags between a page request and content delivered.  An increase in bandwidth as well as expanding the number of servers on the cluster are both happening, as is physically moving some of the data to other locations.  The asian languages (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, etc.) are now hosted on physical servers in Korea and there is talk about physically locating some of the other languages on a server farm in Europe.  All of this takes money and time, and increased complexity as you expand these resources.  If enough CPU bandwidth can be opened up, the page counters may be turned back on.  It is a part of the MediaWiki software, and is used on other MediaWiki websites outside of Wikimedia projects.  The only other alternative for activity is to determine edit frequency per Wikibook, which can only realistically be calculated with a full DB dump of Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:21, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

==Structure by interest group==

I believe it would be useful to have a structure for the main page by interest group, by which I mean:

*Wikids (for example), for children under 8 (I don't think we have any books in the category yet though)
*[[Wikijunior]], for 8 to 12 year olds
*Wikistudy I, for those progressing towards exams usually first sat at age 15 or 16
*Wikistudy II, for those progressing towards exams usually first sat at age 17 or 18
*[[Wikiversity]], for undergraduates and graduates
*Wikiprofessional, for books useful to those engaged in a profession (eg accountancy)
*Wikilearn, for adult-learning books (eg computer programming books)
*Wikileisure, for books on leisure pursuits (eg the cookbook, Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter)

I'd be interested in others' views, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 14:33, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

: I was also thinking about a structure that helps people finding educational materials at their level (we probably have discussed it at IRC, haven't we?). But my opinion is that it should be parallel to existing book organisation, I think the best situation is when people can find a book in several different ways. An yes, I find your proposal reasonable. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:56, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:: It is interesting that [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] chose a structure where [[Wikiversity]] is a method to organise books. Some users are trying to make a separate wiki (see [[MetaWikipedia:Wikiversity]]). A while back, I started a [[MetaWikipedia:No to Wikiversity]] essay explaining why I opposed the creation of such a wiki. Then, after the Wikimedia Board opposed the wiki (&quot;no online courses&quot;), some users, including myself, attempted a [[MetaWikipedia:Wikiversity/Modified project proposal]].

:: Wikiversity tried to distinguish itself from Wikibooks by claiming that a &quot;course&quot; is different from a &quot;book&quot; - see [[Wikiversity:About]]. I disagree; a project like [[Engineering Acoustics]] or [[Cookbook]] or [[NetHack]] is ''both'' a course and a book. [[Wikiversity:School of Music]] and [[Wikiversity:School of Library and Information Science]] seem to belong on a bookshelf.

:: I considered creating a section of Wikiversity for [[Guide to Unix|Unix]] courses-books, but I am uncomfortable with how Wikiversity currently divides itself into schools and courses. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:29, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:::I agree to a structure that reflects the level or focus of studies, so for example a college student can go in and see all college texts grouped together. I am not sure what folks have made Wikiversity out to be, but for me, we need a university book section here on the site, and that could be Wikiversity. Course-related materials could be submitted along with the book, such as laboratory manuals, teachers' manuals, presentations, notes, etc. But it makes a lot of sense for a person to know if they click on [[General Biology]] if it is going to be a college text, or for eighth-graders. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 21:23, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

:::PS I agree with the proposed divisions above. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 21:26, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

:: OK, I too '''support''' the proposed divisions (Wikids, Wikijunior, Wikistudy, ... Wikileisure) of [[User:Jguk|Jguk]]. We still need to decide how to implement them, but students of various levels should be able to find their books! (Or contributors who want to help students of various levels should be able to find books to edit.) --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:22, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

== Identifying the Hot Picks ==

Please help identify the best work on WikiBooks so we can include it in the [[Main Page]]'s Hot Picks section.  [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Highlighted&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3 This is the link to where you can suggest books]. 

Criteria: The most complete, most useful, best-looking books... overall, the books that show the best of WikiBooks right now. Thank you in advance! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 23:49, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:May I modify the request, and ask for books that people consider to be &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;near-complete&quot;? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:59, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

::That makes sense to me, although at this point we should consider relative completeness, especially for books that will be very long. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 21:42, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

I have identified the following 36 books that are worth a look:

The Cookbook and the language books that have been identified elsewhere such as French, Chinese(Mandarin), Japanese, Spanish and German. (6)

'''These books are basically at the stage of an &quot;edition&quot;:'''

[[Wikibooks:PDF Versions]].  (By an &quot;edition&quot; I mean that they have reached a development stage where they are substantial texts that are definitely rewarding for a reader.) (20)

'''These books are substantial and complete enough to be well worth a read:'''

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Communication_Theory  - a tiny academic niche that is well covered in this book, undergrads should be grateful

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_law

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior_Ancient_Civilizations

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algebra

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Engineering_Acoustics - this is excellent

(5)


These books are also substantial but have problems of major sections missing etc:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:C_plus_plus
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Visual_Basic_Classic

(what is going on with HTML/XML/Perl/CSS/Web Design/Java/Javascript?)

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics - this is more advanced than the authors admit

(3)

Others

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Calculus - has excellent content but is so spread out into infinitessimal parts that new contributors will find it hard to discover whether their contribution has already been covered!

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_UNIX - quite good but highly fragmented

(2)

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Jokebook - Has a lot of jokes but all spread out and hard to access

It is interesting that fragmentation - using too many small sections - can ruin a book. 

There are also a large number of handbooks and user guides. Latex, Postscript, game guides etc. etc... Many are complete in their limited sphere - what can we do with these?

===Why not stick with Book of the Month?===

Why not simply stick with the Book of the Month winners as the criteria?  This avoids controvercial decisions on the part of trying to add picks to the Hot Picks list, and provides a forum to legitimately add new Wikibooks to the list as well in a slow but controlled manner.  My adding Cookbook near the end of the voting for the current month's Book of the Month was something unexpected, but demonstrates that a clear well written Wikibooks is likely to win the monthly competition.  Indeed, there are some Books of the Month that are IMHO sub-par, but the hits are much better than the misses.  If you have discovered a very good Wikibook that you think is one of the most outstanding here and deserves recognition, please add it to the Book of the Month nominations.

Far too often the Book of the Month is being used as an advertising forum instead, and where there are no high quality books that have been nominated, it is hard to turn down the sub-par books to win the monthly contest, sock puppets not withstanding.  I've had to go digging through the Wikibooks archives specifically to find some books that would be worth nominating so there might be something worth having on the front page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:59, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

: I think that is too restrictive. What would be useful would be to separate the complete and near-complete books out from the rest as it is those that are useful to readers. I doubt whether we really need to vote on these, their quality should be self-evident, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:50, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

: We would still need a pannel of trusted wikibook users to decide. And we can't grow the list indefinatly we need a limit like on &quot;new books&quot; - so eventualy whenever a new book comes along another has to go. There will be tears sen. With the BOTM there is only one new book a month but with &quot;hot pick&quot; there will be lots of new nominations coming pretty soon. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:26, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

:I am in favor of being flexible and practical, and am afraid that using ''just'' BOTM will not be either of those things, although the BOTM list was the first and primary source for &quot;Hot Pick&quot; books.  However there are great books that have not been featured yet, and I see no reson to wait months to see if they can be featured. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 21:01, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

Maybe you can help me with something that is making me crazy: How do I make / in titles work in a plain Wikimedia site as it does here ?

Here is something I have been thinking over: an effort to focus in on the most [[User:Karl Wick/Test/Foundational Books|foundational books]]. That is, books on subjects that are most universally given as core subjects: the basic sciences, mathematics, language skills, the stuff that you should learn if you aren't gonna learn anything else. This is naturally a controversial subject, but hopefully not so much, and my hope is that we can identify a dozen or a couple dozen prioritized books which can be promoted with the goal to be completed first. My first shot at it, at least for the university level, is located [[User:Karl Wick/Test/Foundational Books|here]]. Pls look it over and help me make it better.

==The PDF Versions page==

This page seems to have become a bit confusing. Originally it was intended as a quick access to the PDF version of a book with an auxillary link to the home page for the Wikibook where the book can be edited. 

There is already a &quot;Print Versions&quot; page and there are already bookshelves that allow contributors to locate and edit a book.

The [[Wikibooks:PDF_Versions]] (see http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:PDF_Versions&amp;oldid=396281 - now changed - see below) page now consists of a table where most of the links '''do not''' connect the reader to a PDF version. In fact the first column in the table connects the reader to the home page for the book, not the PDF.

I would suggest that we make the first column a link to the PDF, the second column a link to the home page for the book and the third column a link to previous editions (Just three columns).

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #EEFFFF; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; &quot;
 |-

 | [[Ada Programming|Edit]]
 | [[:File:Ada Programming.pdf|Prev]]
 |-
 |}

There are however some major books that have a print version but no PDF. 
My suggestion is that the authors are encouraged to create a PDF (or someone does it for them).  The trouble with HTML Print Versions is that they can take some time to be displayed, they provide a low quality print without pagination and often include navigation tables and other distractions. Perhaps we can encourage this process by explaining that &quot;HTML&quot; means a draft version in preparation for PDF.  The page would appear as follows:

------
Items marked &quot;HTML&quot; are at an intermediate stage of preparation for conversion to PDF. See [[:Category:Books with print version]] for a full list of WikiBooks with HTML versions ready for conversion to PDF.

Instructions on the creation of PDF Versions can be found at: [[Help:Print versions]].

Another suggestion is that we change the name &quot;Print version&quot; to &quot;Continuous HTML file&quot;.

[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 21:20, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

-----

The problem I see is that we have not yet got the means to automate the generation of PDF print versions. So I expect them to be old by an average of one month. So the reader has to choose:

# the pre-rendered fast-loaded but old pdf print version
# the slow-loading but up-to-date html print version.

We should not take that decision away fromt the reader especialy since any book with a pdf print version will have a html version as well.

But not vice versa and the Ada example shows that nicely. I expect that [[User:ManuelGR]] will create pdf's for all three volumes next time he creates the pdf version - however I don't know when he will have time to do so.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:18, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

:On the main page the reader has access to the bookshelves as a primary route into Wikibooks, the PDF versions are tucked away at the bottom.  How is this taking &quot;the decision away from the reader&quot; as to whether the reader accesses a transiently fixed or continuously variable version of the text? 

:: My original design hat [[Template:Main Page navigation|Main Page navigation]] before [[Template:Main Page content|Main Page content]] which placed printable version in the middle - but it was though that content is more important the navigation. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:35, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

:The [[Wikibooks:PDF_Versions]] page is simply a list of PDFs. There are separate lists with the &quot;Print version&quot; links and there are bookshelves. Surely a list of PDFs should have access to the PDFs as its most prominent feature. 

:Perhaps there is a policy issue here about whether there should be fixed editions at all. However, the page listing PDFs should just do what it says. I would like to propose that we restore the PDF Versions list to being a list of PDF versions.

:Perhaps we could hold a debate on whether PDFs and fixed editions containing completed books are desirable at all. But until this debate is resolved I really think we should restore the list of PDF versions. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:38, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

=== Role of PDF files in Wikibooks ===

[[File:Kid Reading Wikijunior Solar System.png|right|thumb|150px|My kid reading a dead-tree version of a Wikibook]]
I'll be honest here, I started a PDF file here in part due to the [[wikinews:Wikinews:Print edition|Print edition of Wikinews]].  I figured that if somebody could put together a daily news digets in PDF format, I could do the same for a much more leisurely content like a Wikibook.  In addition, I wanted to get some Wikibooks content into an actual bound book.  This image at the right, BTW, is a real book, not just something Photoshopped.  The web is a good way to help organize content and do collaborative writing and editing, but it really isn't a good place for doing in depth reading.  There is IMHO something special about sitting down with a bottle of Coca-Cola in your back yard and simply reading a book without having to deal with all of the electronic BS that goes with being connected to the internet.

I'll be honest about another idea I've had kicking around.  I'd like to try and get several Wikibooks up to a good quality to start a simple on-line printed book store of Wikibooks content.  I kicked around some ideas a while back through private e-mails and other channels about trying to get this accomplished.  Yes, we have [[Wikibooks:Wikibook Press]], but I would like to see something substantial move forward.  I have a small amount of money to get something like this going, but I need to find somebody who has experience with running an on-line e-Retail service and would like to get this going.  Mainly this is a way to get a wider audience for the content on Wikibooks, and frankly I'd like to have some of the Wikibooks content in dead tree format for my own pleasure.  

Not all Wikibooks have to be done this way, and many won't be.  As is stated with [[WB:WIN]], Wikibooks is not paper.  But some of the content can be transfered to paper and it is one of several analogies that can be followed, and is a role that Wikibooks can play.  For those Wikibooks authors who want to go this route, formal publication in a traditional sense may be possible.

My goal here is to mainly get something together that essentially sells books at a very modest markup to cover costs, and any excess profits would go to the Wikimedia Foundation directly.  I wouldn't anticipate the money would bring in that much, but this is something that is eventually going to happen one way or the other.  I would rather that the Wikibooks contributors themselves are the ones that are involved with any major leap of this nature and not some fly-by-night group that sees a bunch of PDF files and decides to make some money selling Wikibooks on their own.  This does not have to be official and approved by the Foundation Board, and indeed it would be better for the Foundation if it wasn't.  It would simply be a bunch of Wikibooks contributors who got together and were bold enough to make something happen.  As all of the content is available under the GFDL, if you want to make your own publishing company you are certainly welcome to use all of this content and make a stab at it yourself.  I just feel that if a bunch of us got together and worked together rather than against each other on this concept that we could make it something very worth while and be beneficial to the Wikibooks community as a whole.

PDF files are a critical part of this, because many printing houses can adopt the content of a PDF file and use it for publication directly.  There are also many e-book readers that can import a PDF file, so having data in this format is going to make it easier for us to expand Wikibooks into a much wider audience than what we have so far as simply another website.  It is also a demonstration of the level of quality that Wikibooks has reached, even more so that there are so many Wikibooks available in this format now.  That editorial issues need to occur with this content is true, and perhaps this next step will help attract those who are inclined to help with that sort of editorial assistance.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:30, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

=== Wikibooks Theory ===

I think that the Wikibooks project still needs more theoretical guidelines to make it as successful as Wikipedia. Stating that Wikibooks aims for offering manuals and textbooks is not enough. Checking various books offered on topics that I also know quite well (languages, eonomics, music) I could hardly find any satisfying book, because there’s seem no real difference between Wikibooks and Wikipedia. As a matter of fact, many articles in Wikipedia are much more elaborate and much more helpful. 

How could we change this? I suggest that Wikibooks includes two types of books: (1) “How-to-do” books and (2) textbooks that not only includes information (which could also be gathered from Wikipedia) and which actually be used in teaching. 

Wikibooks of type (1) should comprehend
* a step-by-step presention of the necessary information and activities in the necessary chronological order
* suggested exercises 
* a forum where readers can find help (e.g. the discussion page)
* bibliographical information on exercise books or further information

Wikibooks of type (2), this means that the textbook could, or should, include the following elements:
* presentation of core knowledge/basic information (this could be done by giving the necessary information or by giving the relevant Wikipedia links)
* a didactically sensible structure (modules should be ordered in a certain degree of progression)
* recommendations for further reading
* task type A: simple information questions (either with solutions in a separate chapter or for correction by a teacher) 
* task type B: discussion tasks (for plenary discussion in a class or on the discussion page or on a discussion forum)
* suggestions for little research projects or call for participation in a research project

What do you think about this? -- [[User:Sinatra|Sinatra]] 13:37, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

: Comment from [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]]: Each book is different. I will let each group of authors decide whether their book is type (1), type (2), both, neither, or otherwise.

: Since you mentioned Wikipedia, I want to quote [[Wikipedia:Encyclopedia Gamia]], a Wikipedia article about the ''Encyclopedia Gamia'', a wiki at http://www.strategema.net/ about games. Much of the Wikipedia article is a comparison of the Encyclopedia Gamia to Wikipedia. Near the end is this boast: &quot;Furthermore, it is important to note that Wikipedia's computer and video gaming content, both in number of articles and depth, eclipses all third party gaming wiki's.&quot;

: This is despite the fact that Wikipedia limits itself to encyclopedia articles. You will find much information in Encyclopedia Gamia, in Gameinfo (http://gameinfo.wikicities.com), or here at [[Subject:Electronic games|Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf]] that is not in Wikipedia. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:29, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

===Is the problem content or structure?===

When I first accessed Wikibooks, over a year ago, I found no books that could be read as books and turned away, disappointed.  A few months ago I looked again and went, painstakingly, through the bookshelves and found about 13 substantial books. (About the same number as were discovered by a recent reviewer of Wikibooks). Recently, having become more skilled and having been introduced to some tools for investigating where books are located I found '''36 substantial books'''! No, no-one has written 23 books in the last 3 months, it is just that the books themselves are so fragmented and difficult to access that it is not obvious whether a book contains anything of value.

Perhaps we should consider the structure of books as well as desirable content.

I agree with Rob Horning that Wikibooks should be about books.  Many contributors are just visiting from Wikipedia and seem to be following the same approach of highly fragmented, hyperlinked text. Take [[Modern Physics]] as an example, the first page looks fine, click on &quot;special relativity&quot;, another set of headings appears, click on a topic such as &quot;time dilation&quot; and we get a single page (about two thirds of an A4 printed page). Each individual physical page has its own link. This technique would require the reader to operate at least 200 online navigation links to read a 100 page book! The online book is basically unreadable and readers just give up.

There are some books, such as the cookbook and language tutors with audio files, that demand a hyperlinked presentation. However, most books benefit from being read as a single text. This is what differentiates &quot;books&quot; from &quot;articles&quot;; books are extended, connected texts not sets of unconnected articles. Sets of articles can be held in encyclopedias and readers return repeatedly to read them. Books are held in libraries and readers take them away. 

So I would suggest that the minimum level of fragmentation of the hyperlinks in a Wikibook should be the chapter, not the page. Further, although contributors need access by chapter and section within a chapter I believe that readers want access at the level of the whole book. Would you take out books from the library or buy a book that consisted of 100 pamphlets?  Basically the reader wants a stable PDF or other continuous file to read. They can scan this to see if the book is of interest, download it for rapid access and print it, or sets of pages from it, if desired. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:17, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

:One thing I will note about smaller modules in a larger Wikibooks is that they give both bite sized chunks for editing and proofing, as well as something that isn't so intimidating for a first time contributor.  Making a &quot;printed version&quot; of a large Wikibook is essential in this aspect, as it gives the opportunity to allow a very different group, the readers and reviewers, to get the content in a format that is easier for them.  By allowing transclusion of smaller chunks, it also gives the editor a chance to rearrange the content for presentation without having to deal with all of the linking issues.

:I had many of the same concerns about the chapter and page issues of Wikibooks, as [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2005/June#Breaking up particularly large wikibook modules|can be see from this archived discussion]] that was on the Staff Lounge last June.  Garrett's advise is the typical standard that does exist here on Wikibooks, although I would have to agree that a chapter by chapter approach seems to me as something more reasonable.

:The other issue that affects having many smaller modules is simply the editing interface with the MediaWiki software... or in reality the issues relating to editing through a web page.  HTTP (not HTML) doesn't seem to handle large chunks of text very well, and the typical web browser starts to go nuts when the text is over 32K.  That is the unofficial limit on Wikipedia for the length (in text) of the article.  I consider that limit to be unfortunate that it is often enforced, because I think some longer Encyclopedia articles can indeed be written.  Wikibooks is a good place to do that for the truly committed, but a longer treatment of a Wikipedia article so far hasn't been done too much.  This is a reality that we have to live with here, unfortunately.  It does tend to make content fragmented, and there is a tendancy to really break things up.  

:The worst offender here on Wikibooks is [[Puzzles:Riddles]], where the solution is given on a seperate page, and often is just a single word.  That seems to work for that Wikibook.  I'm not suggesting the Riddles book change much or is written incorrectly, but it does show the minimal degree that some content can end up looking like.

:This is just more food for thought.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:38, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

::Is the 32K still really accurate?  Mozilla in the past has opened 80 MB web pages for me, and displayed it fine (after an admittedly very long delay of parsing and downloading an 80 MB HTML file).  It seems to be almost a legacy idea these days.  I do absolutely garuntee that the HTTP portocol has no issue with going over 32K-  what do you think you use to download images and movies on the web?  HTTP.  If there is an issue, its with old versions of IE.

::I'd also say that puzzles is perhaps the one exception I'd make to a chapter like rule-  you don't want to put the puzzle and answer on the same page, its too easy to read it accidently.  And you don't want to put all the answers on 1 page, its too easy to read more than you want to check.  Puzzle magazines solve this by randomizing order (puzzle 1 answer on page 86, puzzle 2 on 89, puzzle 3 back on 86, etc).  Hypertext allows 1 answer/page, a more elegant solution.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 23:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

:::It isn't HTTP in itself (yes, that can in theory handle quite a bit of raw data), but the way it is implemented both by servers and web browsers... and unfortunately we have to take a lowest common denominator here, in other words, the browsers with the least features and the oldest browsers... at least browsers up to five years old or perhaps a little bit older.  And it isn't just the transfer and download of the files as a reader, it is the issue of being able to edit the content.  The Windows API library (aka Internet Explorer) had a problem with the traditional text edit windows that didn't let you edit more than 32K of raw ASCII text, due to using legacy 16-bit code for the edit windows (even in Windows '95).  This had to do with string allocation length and the transmission of over 32K of text in a submit request to a server.  Yeah, this is a legacy issue, but HTTP 1.0 (and HTML 1.0) didn't anticipate this sort of activity for web browsers.  Even now with MediaWiki software you get a warning message for pages over 32K of length, which has been interpreted on Wikipedia as a cut-off length for a page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:38, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

:Hhrumph. I'm fairly new here, but it seems to me that wikibooks is fairly new &quot;here&quot; too. Like WP, it's not on a deadline. Books are harder to write than articles. WP took only a few years to become somewhat authoritative, and it might take a decade or three for WB to achieve that. I don't think it's a question of content or structure, but rather a difficulty inherent in a project that demands more than just explaining &quot;what it is&quot;. Wikibooks are going to be written by people who want to share, but don't have the time or patience (or independent wealth) to devote themselves entirely to writing a book. Over time, we'll have a few more writers and editors interested in helping, but it's small now, and so it crawls a bit. The only way to improve WB is to improve it yourself, and perhaps encourage others to do so. I understand your frustration, but this isn't a publishing house or TV network... this is wiki!

== Semi Protect [[Programming languages bookshelf]] and it's template. ==

I would like to semi protect the above shelve and prehaps all the other bookshelfes as well. The Problem I have noticed is that anonymous bypassers randomly add links to non extisting books. As they are anonymous bypassers they have never heard of &quot;suggested books&quot; and the difference between writting a book or suggestion a new one. I guess they come from 'pedia where this behavior is accepted.

Programming languages is especialy hard hit since language advocated are keen to have there language of choice displayed but are to lazy to actualy begin a new book. And there are a damm lot of programming languages. Sometimes they just copy the entry above which is &quot;50% finished&quot; and create a red link to a non existing book which states that it is 50% finished.

Semi protection would at least mean they need to go to the effort of to register which is likely to stop most of them. And if it does not stop them we would have a talk page to tell them why we had to remove there change again.

: I've added a warning for anyone trying to edit the page. Hopefully that will work, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 10:15, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

=== Suggested Books on the shelves ===

Hello [[User:Jguk|Jguk]],

You also removed some of the &quot;Suggested Book&quot; chapters. Now I don't thing that was a good idea. I patroll the Bookselfes in general and the [[Wikibooks:Programming languages bookshelf|Programming languages bookshelf]] and the [[Wikibooks:Domain-specific languages bookshelf]] in particular for quite a while now. A year ago one could not remove the red links as fast as they where reappeared. They where just to many anonymous bypassers mistaking the shelfes with list of all available programming languages in existence.

Only after I have moved all red links into &quot;Suggested Book&quot; chapters the situation improved. I intentionaly added a suggested books sub-chapter to each chapter instead of adding a general chapter at the end of the shelf.

The reason is that the average Lua programming language fan will look at the &quot;G – L&quot; chapter and notice that his beloved programming language is missing and add it. He/She will not scroll down to the end of the bookshelf to take note of a &quot;Suggested Book&quot; at the end of the shelve. He/She will click on the [edit] button for &quot;G - L&quot; and won't read your &quot;Important Notice&quot; at the beginning of the page. And most certanly He/She will not search Wikibooks for the [[Wikibooks:Suggested books]].

: Side Note: I copied the link from your &quot;Important Notice&quot; and the link turned out to be red. I did search for &quot;Suggested books&quot; and did not find it. I am an administrator and I don'd know where the b**y page is - How can we expect an anonymous bypassers to find it.

If we want to go the way you suggest then we don't only need to semi-protect the selfes and add an &quot;Important Notice&quot; - we also have add &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOEDITSECTION__&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the sleves to make sure the notice is actualy read.

And - of corse - do it for all shelves!

An alternative would be to continue to have one ore more &quot;Suggested Books&quot; sections on each shelf. It did actualy work - the additions of red links to the shelfes went down to zero - only on the shelve template there where new red entries. But then the shelve templates have no suggested book section. That's a QED for me.

=== No strong objection ===

[[User:222.152.177.146]] has just added a programming platform to the programming language bookshelf - and not the first time such an a false addition is made.

Which again proofes my point that anonymous bypassers should not be allowed to edit the bookshelves - they just haven't been here long enough to understand our bookshelves and how they work and what belongs where. And since there was no strong objection to my post I might just go ahead and semiprotect the bookshelves and there templates. Well I sleep over it first to be shure.

:Perhaps because it was written before semi-protection was available.  This is a relatively new thing for Wikimedia projects and has only been available for the last couple of updates of the MediaWiki software.  I'm not exactly sure what sorts of things would have to be protected from unregistered users only, although it might be nice to put that sort of protection on voting pages, for instance.  I recently re-applied move protection to this page (the Staff Lounge) due to the fact that it is very visible and because it has been moved by vandals in the past.  No need to go into specifics, but it can be a pain to revert move changes.  The developers have made it easier, however.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:35, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

==Cleaning up [[:Category:Stubs]]==
I'm about to go through most of the category and organise it into subcategories, but there isn't any policy or guideline for creating subcategories. So, I've started [[Wikibooks talk:Stub|a discussion]] on the issue, and would appreciate feedback soon so I can get started on the cleanup. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 00:24, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

== Cataloging Wikibooks ==

I've been going through fits and starts over just how to approach this topic of cataloging Wikibooks.  I started [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]] as a place to try and get some discussion about the topic, and to try and get some effort organized, but what I've done so far just doesn't seem to &quot;feel&quot; right and I'm not happy with the direction the various approaches to cataloging Wikibooks have gone.

Indeed, the best system that seems to be working out right now is the [[Wikibooks:All Books|Bookshelf]] system, that seemed to get at least an initial boost because of its impact on the main page of Wikibooks.  It is one way to try and organize the content, but it shouldn't necessarily be the only way.

This is an ontological discussion, as the number of Wikibooks is now bursting apart any initial attempt at trying to classify the content.  My concern is that there is a huge amount of content on Wikibooks, and no real way to keep it all organized, with the current classification systems breaking down.  If you look at the number of modules lately, the number is actually going down, not up.  Some of this is due to an agressive deletion campaign that is going on to clean up some deadwood, but I'm also going to suggest that simply finding if some content exists takes a dedicated Wikibookian who really understands the structure of what is here.

Mind you, I'm not talking here about &quot;featured content&quot;, which has been the topic of discussions as of late, but I'm talking even obscure modules.  Some content is neglected or even duplicated due to the fact that nobody knows that it even exists.

Some approaches might include:

;Organization by Category:Using a standard template to automatically add Wikibooks to a series of categories, depending on how the book is classified.
;Manually Classification:Simply taking every Wikibook and adding it to a page, with manual organization.  Note that this is the way that the All Wikibooks page is working at the moment and seems to work out just fine.
;Automated Scripting (external):Erik Zachte created a seperate script [http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm found here] that classifies Wikibooks by size and following naming conventions of some sort.  This was prior to [[WB:NP]], but does surprisingly a pretty good job.  The drawback is that you either have to have access to the raw database or wait for Erik to get around to updating these pages when he feels like it.
;Automated Scripting (internal):This could be done in theory, and if somebody who has a passion for Wikibooks also wants to get involved with the main Wikimedia development team, I supposed it could be done.  The problem for both forms of scripting is that it is very hard for mere mortals to be able to make changes if it doesn't quite fit the needs of Wikibooks users.

Here are some goals that I also have in mind, before we consider where to go here as well.

* All new Wikibooks should be linked somehow into the classification system.
* Several different approaches to cataloging the books should occur.  No one single cataloging system is really adequate, and besides, with hyperlinking you can have multiple cataloging approaches (portions of all approaches listed above can be done).  Cataloging approaches should include alphabetical, by topic, and by classification code (aka Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress Catalog, perhaps other systems as well).
* A classification system should have ideally the ability to have related books &quot;close to&quot; each other, in a format similar to a public library.  At least as easy to use as glancing down a (real physical) bookshelf for similar books to that topic.  Multiple web pages breaks this analogy pretty hard.  BTW, this was the original idea of a bookshelf here on Wikibooks.
* It should be expandable so content even outside of Wikibooks could be integrated into this cataloging system.  My thought here is to add hyperlinks to other Wikimedia projects, primarily Wikisource, but it could also include Project Gutenberg or other free e-text repositories that would be of value to Wikibooks readers.  Categories are hard to work into something like this.

I've been working specifically on the [[Wikibooks:LOC Classification|Library of Congress Classification]] system, and my approach was to do deep categories.  I was thinking along the lines of [http://dmoz.org ODP(Open Directory Project)] here, but MediaWiki software doesn't seem to work very well for this type of classification method.  The problem here is that deep categories seldom have more than a few Wikibooks in them, and seems to fracture the whole organization.

The approach followed by the folks who helped put together the [[Wikibooks:Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal]] set of pages seems to work a little better.  It seriously needs to be cleaned up, but it is an approach to grouping books.  An approach that could be done here is to simply list all of the Wikibooks on one single page.  At some point in the future it would have to be broken up anyway (if it gets over 1 MB or raw text, for example).

I was also thinking something like this:

* 448 - [[French]]
* 449 - [[Catalan]]
* 458 - [[Italian]]
* 459 - [[Romanian]]

instead of having the full Dewey Decimal page with all of the sub-classification heading listed.  Any other thoughts?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:30, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

=== [[Wikibooks:Alphabetical Classification|Alphabetical Listings on Wikibooks]] ===

Related to the above notion, I compiled a complete (more or less) list of all Wikibooks that is in the main project space.  I am basing this list off of the [http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm statistical analysis] that Erik Zachte did on Wikibooks last Decembers.  Newer Wikibooks aren't in this list yet, but it is at least a place to start.

I'm going to ask that if you have a pet project and want it classified through the various Wikibook classification schemes, to please check through this list and see if it is listed here.  I've uncovered a few orphaned Wikibooks by going through this process, and I had to fix some links as well.  Erik's method culled out all of the Wikibooks that didn't have consistant naming systems (there are a few missing because of that) and any very short Wikibooks.  By his admission that was content &lt; 10K in length.  Because of those restrictions, I think this is a very good representation of all of the content currently on Wikibooks at the moment, arranged by book title.

The next step I'll be doing after I do some rough verification of some of the content here is to proceed with the [[Wikibooks:Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal]] and [[Wikibooks:LOC Classification|Library of Congress]] classification systems from this list of Wikibooks, slowly crawling from the &quot;A&quot;'s to the &quot;Z&quot;'s.  I'll also try to put those books that aren't on bookshelfs where they perhaps ought to go as well.

I know I'm going to miss stuff in all of this, so any general assistance in this matter would be significantly appreciated.  The goal here is to make Wikibooks much more usable simply by being able to find what you are looking for, and realizing that Wikibooks is going to double in size over the next year, provided the current trends toward new users and content continues.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:12, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

:While I'm all for organising books in as many ways as possible, I see a potential problem with having lots of different shelving systems - in order to &quot;keep up&quot;, new books would need to be shelved in several places, something which might be a little overwhelming to new users. Although there's a possible workaround to this: a subsection of the Card Catalog Office where new books can be placed pending shelving, and then a more experienced user could place it in the appropriate places.

:I also feel that categories are being underused for organisation. A category listing has several advantages over some of the bookshelves right now: Automatically alphabetised, automatic &quot;backlinks&quot; (category links at the bottom), they can be added at the book level, rather than requiring that a link be added on a seperate page, and they can also easily be added to multiple categories.

:That isn't to say using categories would be less work; the ''initial'' workload would be slightly larger due to the need to add categories to the front page of every book, but maintenance workload would be significantly less, and it would be a lot easier for new books to be added to the proper place(s) from the start. Just looking at [[Special:Lonelypages]], the lack of shelving on creation is a bit of a problem; in just going through the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; modules there, I found at least 10 books that were unshelved (and marked them with {{tl|cleanup-link}}).

:In any case, I do agree that there is significant room for improvement in organisation of books, and will try to help out whereever I can (it is, however, 5:30am right now, and I would like to get some sleep, so I won't exactly jump in right _now_). [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 10:28, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

::I see some problems with categories from several vantage points.  One huge one is that content can't be added through transclusion to another page if it is merely listed within the category.  Another is that you have no control over the formatting of the information inside of the catagory, as that is controlled entirely through the MediaWiki software instead.  That could be modified in the future, but it is a significant limitation.  I'm not saying that the developers need to make it a priority to allow customization, just that a tool like categories can't be a tool for all purposes in all places.

::For strictly alphabetizing books that are within Wikibooks, I would agree that categories can be useful, and it is something is currently underutilized.  A major motive I've had with trying to put together this list is that there is no current difinitive list of all Wikibooks anywhere.  The MediaWiki software simply doesn't accomodate our needs as well as for what it was designed to do:  writing an encyclopedia.  Furthermore, naming conventions have been haphazard at best, so even trying to design an algorithm to extract the titles of all of the Wikibooks is still going to miss some.  With [[WB:NP]], I think this situation is going to improve significantly.

::I'd also like to point out that a key component of this is also cataloging content on other Wikimedia projects as well, or at least debate that point.  Wikisource in particular needs this sort of cataloging as much as we do here, and it would be nice to have a &quot;one stop shopping&quot; area that could help in identifying useful source material for other Wikimedia projects.  BTW, I've mentioned this at the Scriptorium and the Wikisource people seem as receptive to the idea as could be reasonable.

::Ideally, the ultimate solution would be to have the [[meta:Wikidata|Wikidata]] proposed project set up a database for all Wikibooks allowing you to catalog each Wikibook with multiple cataloging systems and allowing you to use search terms to find the books through various means.  There has been some amazing progress with that project, but it isn't quite ready for open participation yet, or at least integration into Wikimedia projects.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:38, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

I think the alphabetical listing is much needed (if only to see exactly what we have!). The next stage is going through this list to identify more good books so we can give them more publicity. We shouldn't be afraid of relegating publicity for weaker books until they have improved.

I really think the Card Catalog Office denominations by LOC and Dewey are a waste of time (sorry, Rob, I know you've put a lot of work into them). To use them a reader (assuming they are not a librarian by profession) first has to look up what number covers the subject they are interested in, and then has to check what's listed under that subject. They are therefore less useful than the bookshelves - particularly as we are not trying to cover everything covered by Dewey and because we only have a small number of books. In this case they are poor mimics of the bookshelf system.

The category system also duplicates the bookshelves. But, offers a different way of finding information that may appeal to some. I therefore see no real problem with maintaining it. I do, however, think we can get away from putting all pages in the same book into one category - under the naming convention, the list of all pages in a book can easily be found by using the &quot;Prefix Index&quot; from the Special Pages, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:41, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

:The next stage that I was going to do after I simply collected a list of all of the Wikibooks that are here (that is harder to do that I first realized!) is to go thorugh this alphabetical list and try to see if all of the book on the various bookshelves are listed in the alphabetical list (I still havn't done that) and to make sure all of the various wikibooks are listed on the various bookshelves.  Adding them to a category at the same time would be trivial in comparion, so this is something perhaps worthwhile to set up a reasonable category structure.  Wikibooks is seriously lacking in this regard as no serious thought has gone into the category structure on Wikibooks.

:I was also thinking of perhaps setting up a special template for the name of each Wikibook that would be able to do something like load up the list of all pages for that book (aka Prefix index) list BOM winners, stages, or other information that would be useful for somebody trying to find some quick information about the book.

:As far as the LOC and Dewey tables are concerned, it is very difficult to topically arrange content, as human knowledge can be expressed in multiple dimensions.  Most of these cataloging schemes (including our Bookshelves) are largely expressed as a linear display of information, and it is very hard to say that one classification system is better than another.  They each have their own strengths and weaknesses.  Keep in mind that what I'm trying to accomplish here is to use the various classification systems to suggest that here is a Wikibook that you like, and to demonstrate a related book here are some others you can look at as well.  Books that are physical closer on the classification pages are more related than books that are listed further away.  This is precisely how libraries organize their book inventories, for the same reason.  The Library of Congress has over a century of experience in doing this, and it would be a shame not to at least try and see what their motivations are for their classification system, especially if we are going to repeat those same mistakes with our own bookshelf model.  Other major libraries have followed the lead of the Library of Congress, and are actively involved with discussions of classification systems.

:The ultimate goal is to have somebody come to Wikibooks, have a topic in mind that they want to learn more about, and have a place to find where that content might be located at.  On Wikipedia you can use the &quot;search&quot; tool and get the content rather effectively.  Here on Wikibooks, it is a bit tougher to do that as the content here isn't quite organized as cleanly as it is on Wikipedia.  I've already noticed a couple of real good-faith efforts to create content here on Wikibooks that largely duplicates content that already exists, including people doing a transwiki of content from other Wikimedia projects.  Most of this is marked up for mergers into other Wikibooks, but we don't catch all of that often before substantial amounts of material are added.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:16, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

== Depreciation of the &quot;Programming:&quot; psuedo namespace ==

A large number of Wikibooks have been named using the &quot;Programming&quot; psuedo namespace in their titles.  I don't know where the notion to start this practice originally came from, but as has been pointed out these are often distinctively different books in many cases.  Some arguements about this very topic have come up where some people suggest these are all in fact a part of a huge book called &quot;Programming&quot;.

What I'm suggesting here is that we have a discussion if it is wise to discontinue the use of this naming convention altogether, and possibly rename most of the Wikibooks that start with this prefix.  Very, very few naming conflicts exist with the book names not having the prefix, and otherwise it is just an advertisement of what bookshelf it is located on.  Other books have a similar issue, but it is the computer programming books that seemed to have adopted this standard most often.

Is there anybody here that is active that even supports keeping the Programming psuedo namespace?  It doesn't really fit with [[WB:NP]], but that is mostly because the policy doesn't even cover this topic.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:28, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

I vaguely seem to remember our having this conversation before and the decision being to dump the Programming psuedo namespace (but I don't have a reference for you).  Indeed, a number of old Programming:Xyz books have been renamed.  For example, [[Ada Programming]] used to be [[Programming:Ada]].  As for where it came from, I suspect it is an old practice that became depricated.  However, I don't know if deprication really counts if someone as active as Rob can't remember it. :-)   And besides, it may very well be my memory, not Rob's, that is faulty.  I also suspect that these the Programing Xyz books were always conceived as separate books rather than belonging to one big Programming book.  It seems to be an example of what was once considered the bookshelf naming policy, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Naming_policy&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=341777#Reference:_Historical_Conventions this old version of WB:NP] where Programming:Xyz books are cited as an example of that policy.  At any rate, I suggest going to the individual Programming:Xyz books one by one and try to get a consensus for a name change, perhaps with the aid of [[User:tsca.bot|tsca.bot]].  If noone responds after a respectful wait, than declare yourself a consensus and hire [[User:tsca.bot|tsca.bot]] without further ado.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 20:19, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

== [[B:CVG]] ==

I dislike typing the full names of bookshelves, especially [[Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf]] which is five words. So, I decided to create a shorcut '''[[B:CVG]]'''. The idea is to introduce a system like [[Wikibooks:Shortcuts]] for bookshelves.

Any comments? Should bookshelves have shortcuts? Is &quot;B:&quot; okay, or should I have used &quot;WB:&quot; like for other shortcuts? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:54, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

:&quot;B:&quot; looks fine, and using &quot;WB:&quot; could collide with other Wikibooks shortcuts. It's a good idea, and I'm surprised it hasn't been done yet. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 00:17, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

::Do we have a &quot;registry&quot; of available shortcuts?  I know I could do a special:prefixindex on it, but this would be a good page to put together that lists where everything goes.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:58, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

== Transwiki process is ridiculous ==
The transwiki process is way, way too complicated.  Transwikiing an article from wikipedia to wikibooks, for example, involves creating a new article on wikibooks, copying the text of the old article into the new article, copying the history page of the old article into the discussion page of the new article, leaving tags on both articles and on the new discussion page saying what you've done, putting info into the summaries of the new article and talk page saying what you've done, adding a line on the wikibooks transwiki log, including links, explaining what you've done, and adding a line to the wikipedia transwiki log, including links, explaining what you've done.

This is, no doubt, why virtually no one ever does this.  Go through the transwiki log, either on wikipedia or on wikibooks, and you'll see that almost every one of these in the last year and a half has been done by [[User:Uncle G's 'bot|Uncle G's 'bot]].

Uncle G and his bot haven't been around for weeks, leaving me trying to figure out how to get 90 articles transwikied to wikibooks.  I have no intention of spending 10 hours going through this whole laborious process by hand, and am about to rebel against the whole process and just ignore the logs on both sides completely.  So, now no one can say I didn't notify anyone of this.  I'd have mentioned this on the transwiki talk pages, but no one reads those. 

(I posted the above on one of the wikipedia village pump pages, I'll go into a little more detail here since you all may care more than they do, as you'll be the ones receiving the 90 new articles)  The articles are all cocktail recipes, they make up about half the articles on this page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Move_to_Wikibooks  They need to end up the in wikibooks bartending area.  If someone wants to give me some advice on this, feel free, I'm trying to clean up a mess on wikipedia (recipes don't belong there at all) and am looking for the best way to do it.  --[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 06:42, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

:Before you start, may I ask what the 90 new articles are. It is unusual, to say the least, for a short article originally on WP to develop into a viable textbook here on WB. Whilst recipes (for the [[Cookbook]]), drinks (for [[Bartending]]) and How-tos (for the [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf|How-to bookshelf]]) can be pretty much standalone, other individual articles/pages tend not to be worth transwiki'ing.

:On the other hand, the only real issue is to allow the history of an article (including in particular the names of the contributors) to be traced. Provided everything being transwiki'ed in goes to the pseudo-namespace, Transwiki:, under the name used in the old wiki, that the old location is identified in the summary and the transwiki page redirects to the new page, that is sufficient - and I wouldn't worry about the rest of the bureaucracy, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:24, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
::(Actually, I said this above, but...)they are all cocktail recipes, which would end up in the bartending area here.  Click on the link I gave above, if you want to see them; of the 150 articles on that page, 90 or so of them are the ones I'm planning on moving.  And, thanks for your response.  --[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 13:39, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

A fair number of those articles are duplicates/alternatives of existing articles. Also, be sure to liaise with [[User:Discordance]], who is the main editor of the [[Bartending]] book. We're currently looking at how best to organise the cocktails, and the addition of 90 more needs to be organised carefully, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 15:26, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
:Yeah, but I've checked them all, and the duplicates all have substantially different content, meaning they could be merged or replace the current ones.  I tried to make sure that if the wikipedia version was lower quality than the wikibooks one, I didn't bother transwikiing it.
:And, another notification -I've begun transwikiing these articles. Wikibooks is not currently accepting articles which contain external links.  There is a server which is supposed to send you the picture which you type the matching text in for, to prove you're a person and not a spambot.  I'm assuming this server is down or so backed up it is non-functional.  &lt;s&gt;So I've begun deliberately breaking the external links by inserting spaces into them.  Such is life.&lt;/s&gt;(fixed and cleaned up now)  --[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 15:42, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

:::The real point of the transwiki is to do several things:
:::# help copy over the content from one project to another.  Sometimes things get left out by new users doing a transwiki, so it helps to make sure that everything has been moved over... including the page history from the previous project.  This is omitted so often you wouldn't believe.
:::# to notify administrators and other active members of the new project that new content has been added that has at least been partially reviwed for copyright clearance, but is being added by people who don't have a clue as to what the policies of the new project.  Perhaps it is misplaced and needs to be moved elsewhere.
:::# log that the move has been made and there isn't a variation of an &quot;edit&quot; war that is more a transwiki war where neither project really want the content.  In theory we can (and should for many items) send stuff right back to Wikipedia with a note that it is completely inappropriate to have it on Wikibooks and it really belongs (from our perspective) on Wikipedia.  If an article ping-pongs between the two projects, we can either delete it or even move it to Wikicities somewhere.
:::# sometimes links and markup of content must occur where there are huge differences between the two projects, such as category naming systems, wikification (dewikification in the case of Wikibooks), and linking into any classification system (which is critical for both Wikibooks and Wikisource).
:::# it is a way to keep cordial relationships between each of the various Wikimedia projects and not seem to be imposing policies on each other.
:::# and most important:  Allow a project to simply &quot;accept&quot; the content altogether before it is moved into the main project namespace.
:::Mind you, Transwiki policies are not Wikibooks policies but rather Wikimedia policies.  Please [[meta:Transwiki|refer to the process on Meta]] for more details.  I've been a pain in the a&amp;&amp; on Wikipedia by changing the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{move to wikibooks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' template because I saw so much pure cruft that has been dumped on Wikibooks that I knew was from Wikipedia (I even found the deletion commons on Wikipedia).  The users who put the content here totally bypassed the transwiki process and I couldn't stand it anymore.  More to the point, I warned Wikipedia users in a very visible template that if you dump content on Wikibooks without going through the transwiki content, you might as well consider that you have just deleted it from all Wikimedia projects, and have caused grief and pain to Wikibooks administrators in the process... not a way to make yourself welcome here.
:::As far as moving 90 pages of content... I don't consider that to be that big of a deal, unless it is 90 pages of content that accumulate over a week and every week this happens again.  If there is that much content on Wikipedia that new users are adding to warrent this sort of content volume, perhaps some policy changes need to happen on Wikipedia instead to allow the content (obviously many users think it belongs there) or some very clear new user pages to help mentor them to keep from creating this sort of content.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:52, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
::::Actually this is perhaps a year's worth of cocktail recipes, so there shouldn't be any more coming soon.  I have been/will be communicating with the people on the bartending book as to how best to handle these articles once they get there.  And, I'd like to once again thank you all for responding.  I can't get any responses on any of this on wikipedia at all.  --[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 16:33, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
:::::BTW, the reason why you are being blocked for external references is because you have a low edit count and that you have a new user account.  This was a recently added feature to MediaWiki software that was to help stop some of the link spamming that has been going on for some time now.  Any admins/recent changes patrol guys notice any difference lately on that?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:47, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

:::::: I had to pass the &quot;image test&quot; for an external link on my recently-created de.wikibooks and en.wikinews user pages. However, other than that I forgot about it.

:::::: However, I have been reverting vandalism and test edits from this wiki, and none of my recent reversions was against [[Meatball:WikiSpam|WikiSpam]]. It is as if all of the spammers disappeared. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:46, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

== introductory course edit. ==

hello, i dont really know how who (if any) will read this or how the system of editing works but i have recently stumbled on wikiversity and saw a few probs in your school. firstly id like to say that this is the best idea and i love whats happening. i have been looking around wikipedia for weeks trying to improve my knolage in a few areas (spellings beyond hope) one of those being physics. i found that to go too quickly to subjects i desired to know about was in-practicle as they where complex and required much back reading, so started going through basics and improving my maths. you have created exactly the tool i and others will need, and that is great. howether, on aprouching your scool and being derected to high school physics (i doupt i need to go back this far but i thought id brush up) i was supprised to see that from the first paragraph the piece was badly written. im sorry to the auther but the grammer is awfull and the flow messy. im not suggesting that i could do better (indeed i touched my first edit button but pondered the legality of scrubbing whole sentances) but for me or another to take it in it needs clarity, i read the standard modle wiki the other day and it was clearer than the basic physics para 'the atom'. 
another problem i thoght of was the possibility of bad editing. perhaps this article started out clear and consice and was then edited by a, less clear person.
i hope someone can take a look because if basic phisics isnt accessabe then the whole thing will fail. and i for one think wikipedia is genius, and the future. 
thankyou for your time. john f


sorry id like to ammend myself, some of 'high school physics' is fine. the atom needs drastic work. and electricity is great but it is insyncranus, its first sentance is already assumes knolage of ac dc etc.             sorry, thanks john f</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Blades of Avernum Scenario Editor! The Blades of Avernum system enables you to make fantasy role-playing adventures of great detail and complexity. And, hopefully, fun. It is a demanding program, and creating the next great adventure is not for the faint of heart. However, with time and ingenuity, you can create stories that will captivate Blades of Avernum fans all over the world. Using the editor is a long journey. So, before you start, here are a few words of advice, intended to make your job a lot easier:

== Introduction To Scenario Design ==

=== If You Are a Beginner, Read the Tutorial ===

:If you’ve never used this scenario editor before, be absolutely sure to read Chapter 1.1, “Making Your First Scenario, Step By Step”. It’s the very first chapter. It will take you, step by step, through all of the most important features for scenario design. For the novice, it is absolutely invaluable.

=== Play the Game! ===

:Don’t even think about starting to use the editor until you have played through all of the scenarios that come with Blades of Avernum. Before you can work in this medium, you have to really understand how the game works. You should be comfortable with how the game flows, how the terrain works, and what the game system is like. That is the only way you can really understand what you are doing.

=== Don’t Expect Miracles ===

:I won’t lie to you. You can create very basic, simple scenarios with this editor without a lot of work. However, you will have to put in a lot of hours if you want to figure out how to make this editor truly shine. Scripting is powerful, but it is not always easy.

=== Expect Limitations ===

:The Blades of Avernum system is not created to be infinitely versatile. You can’t create arcade elements. It won’t lend itself well to making science fiction adventures, or adventures in settings far from Avernum. Also, you are sure to think of something extremely clever you want to do that the engine doesn’t make possible. I tried to anticipate everything, but I am sure I failed many, many times.

=== It Is Work ===

:People are often surprised at how much work and concentration is takes to make adventures. It takes time to make good stuff. I strongly suggest, for your first a adventure, aiming small. A few outdoor sections. Ten or twenty towns and dungeon levels. Don’t try to make the world-changing epic until you really understand what you’re getting into. It is better to release and share one small adventure than to make half of a huge one that nobody ever sees.

=== Learn From Examples ===

:The best way to learn how to do anything is to work from an example. If, for example, you want to see how to place a locked door, open one of the scenarios that came with the game and look at the doors in it. If you want to see how to make scripts, read the scripts in scenarios already completed. Do not be ashamed of looking at the work of others. It is the very best way to learn.

=== Back Up Your Work! ===

:I have lost count of the times that some poor user has relayed to me a tale of a crashed machine, file corruption, or similar problem that destroyed their scenario (along with many hours of work). Computers are machines, and machines can fail! Back up your work frequently!

=== Use Online Resources! ===

:Scenario design is complicated, but you don’t have to face the struggle alone. Go to the [http://www.avernum.com Scenario Workshop] to read helpful tutorials on scenario design, and go to the Blades of Avernum forum on our [http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com web site ] to ask questions and trade tips. Designing role-playing games can be really fun, exciting, and satisfying. I’ve been doing it for ten years, and I’m only just getting started. So if you want to give it a shot and see what people really think of your work, read on. If I haven’t scared you off... let’s go! &amp;mdash;Jeff Vogel, Keeper of Avernum

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General notes about scripting ==

===&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;''which_char''&lt;/font&gt;===
:Many calls expect to be given a value for ''which_char''. This expects the number of a character, which will be from 0 to 119.

'''Note''': You are not entering the character’s [[../Lexicon#Character ID/|Character ID]] or their [[../Lexicon#Personality/|Personality]]. To find the number of a character; in the editor, select the character and look at the number in the first description line.

:If you use such a call in a creature script, if you enter a value of -1 for ''which_char'', the function will act on the creature whose script is running. In such a case, you can also enter ME for which_char. This does the same thing.

===&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;''which_char_or_group''&lt;/font&gt;===
:When a call expects a value for ''which_char_or_group'', it wants the number of a character or group. This is exactly like ''which_char'', except for one difference: the call can also act on every member of a group. If you want to have the call act on group x, give ''which_char_or_group'' a value of 1000 + x. 

'''Note:''' Group 0 is always the party.

==The Most Important Calls==
:You should pay special attention to these calls. They are the calls that are, in general, used the most frequently to write special encounters.

===&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;[[../Dialog Calls#void begin_talk_mode(short start_node)/|''void'' begin_talk_mode(''short'' start_node)]]&lt;/font&gt;===
:This call is the way to begin a conversation.

===&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;[[../Basic Script and IO Calls#void block_entry(short do_blockage)/|''void'' block_entry(''short'' do_blockage)]]&lt;/font&gt;===
:This call lets you block containers and spaces from the party.

===&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;[[../Item, Special Item and Gold Calls#void change_coins(short coin_amount)/|''void'' change_coins(''short'' coin_amount)]] ''and'' [[../Item, Special Item and Gold Calls#short reward_give(short which_item)/|''short'' reward_give(''short'' which_item)]]&lt;/font&gt;===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== NPOV ==

Some thoughts about this here.... At first, I thought this violated NPOV standards, but this is not believes about Jehovah's Witnesses, but an NPOV treatment about how to deal with their beliefs in a Medical context.  This is an outstanding example of what NPOV ought to be rather than what it is not.  As this is still just from one author's perspective, there may still be some POV problems, but I don't see this as a problem at the moment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:44, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

You should sign your vote at [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship#Derbeth ( talk .7C email .7C contribs )]].  I added a comment noting who cast the vote, but it still might not get counted if you don't sign it yourself.  You can sign simply by adding four tildes: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; or, more commonly, two dashes followed by four tildes: &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JMRyan|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/JMRyan|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">These are all debugging functions, used to provide information while you write a scenario. They probably should be removed before you actually release your scenario to the public.

==void print_num(short num)==

:Prints the number num in the text area.

==void print_nums(short a,short b,short c)==

:Prints the numbers a, b, and c in the text area.

==''[[../Return Data Types#void/|void]]'' turn_on_debug_mode()==

:Enables debug mode for your scenario. To turn on debugging mode, type “}”, followed by “=” (so a right bracket, followed by an equals sign). To turn off debugging mode, type an equals sign. Once on, you can use the following commands:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Debug Mode Commands'''
! Key Combo
! Effect
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| Shift-’k’
| Kills all hostile monsters in the whole town.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| Shift-’m’
| Magic map. All creatures in the area will show up on the map. Type Shift-’m’ again to turn this off.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| Shift-’g’
| Enter ghost mode.

You will be able to walk through walls, and even through blackness. Type Shift-’g’ again to turn this off.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| Shift-’h’
| Heals and restores spell energy for everyone in your group.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| Shift-‘l’
| Add light. Gives the party 100 more turns of light.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| Shift-‘i’
| Advances the time in the scenario one day.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| Shift-‘s’
| Set special items.

Dialog boxes will come up asking you for two numbers. The first number you give is the number of a special item. The second number is the number of that special item the party would be set to have&gt; (so if you enter 12 and 4, the party will have 4 of special item 12.)
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| Shift-‘f’
| Set Stuff Done Flags.

You will be asked for 3 numbers. The first two numbers are the coordinates of a stuff done flag. If the third number is –1, you will be told the value of that flag in the text area. Otherwise, that SDF will be set to the third number. (So if you enter 5, 23, and –1, then the text area will tell you the value of SDF(5,23). If you enter 5, 23, and 8, then SDF(5,23) will be set to 8.
|}

'''Note''': Debug mode is automatically turned off whenever you load a saved game or enter a new scenario.

'''Note''': This call should definitely be removed before you release your scenario.

:Like &lt;CODE&gt;print_str()&lt;/CODE&gt;, but prints a more customized piece of text. Prints, on one line, the string ''str'', followed by the number ''num_to_print'', followed by the string ''str2''.

{{example|''print_big_str(“You are hit for “, 10000, “ damage.”);'' // Prints “You are hit for 10000 damage.” to the text window.}}

==''[[../Return Data Types#unknown|unknown]]'' print_big_str_num(''string'' str,''short'' num_to_print,''string'' str2,''short'' color)==
:Like &lt;CODE&gt;print_big_str()&lt;/CODE&gt;, but gives the text a different color. Colors are listed in the description of &lt;CODE&gt;print_str_color()&lt;/CODE&gt;.

==''void'' block_entry(''short'' do_blockage)==
:This very important call prevents the character from accessing the terrain spot/area that called the script. If called from a special encounter triggered by walking, this call prevents the party/character from entering the space. If called when searching a container, blocks the party from being able to get the item inside.

Values for ''do_blockage'' are:
{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=5
|0
|&amp;ndash; Allow access/entry.
|-
|1
|&amp;ndash; Block access/entry.
|}

==''void'' end()==
:If called in a script, immediately stops running the script. If called in the code of a dialogue node, also ends the conversation.

==''short'' get_ran(''short'' num_dice,''short'' min,''short'' max)==
:Returns a random number. The game generates ''num_dice'' random numbers, each is from ''min'' to ''max''. It then adds them up and returns the sum.

{{example|''get_ran(3,1,4);'' // Would return a random number from 3-12 (or 1-4 + 1-4 + 1-4).}}

==''short'' get_selected_char()==
:Returns the number of the character currently selected in the party roster area (which will be from 0 to 3).

==''short'' is_combat()==
:Self explainatory.

Returns:
{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=5
|0
|&amp;ndash; Party is not in combat mode.
|-
|1
|&amp;ndash; Party is in combat mode.
|}

==''short'' is_outdoor()==
Returns:
{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=5
|0
|&amp;ndash; Party is not in outdoor mode.
|-
|1
|&amp;ndash; Party is in outdoor mode.
|}


'''Notes''':
*Being in combat whilst outdoors '''does not''' count as being in outdoor mode.

==short is_town()==
:Self explainatory.

Returns:
{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=5
|0
|&amp;ndash; Party is not in town mode. 
|-
|1
|&amp;ndash; Party is in town mode.
|}

==''void'' play_sound(''short'' which_sound)==
:Plays the sound ''which_sound''. Sounds are listed in the appendices. If the number of the sound is positive, it stops the action while the sound plays. If negative, the sound plays while the game continues.

==''void'' print_str(''string'' to_print)==
:Displays the text ''to_print'' in the game’s text area. The maximum allowable length of text is 70 characters.

==''void'' print_str_color(''string'' to_print,short color)==
:Like &lt;CODE&gt;print_str()&lt;/CODE&gt;, but also gives the text a different color.

Values for ''color'' are:
{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=5
|0
|&amp;ndash; Black.
|-
|1
|&amp;ndash; Red. (Usually used for errors.)
|-
|2
|&amp;ndash; Blue.
|-
|3
|&amp;ndash; Magenta.
|-
|4
|&amp;ndash; Green.
|}

==''void'' run_scenario_script(''short'' which_node)==
:Immediately runs the [[../Lexicon#Scenario Script/|scenario script]] at [[../Lexicon#State/|state]] ''which_node''. Once the scenario script stops running, the script that made this call continues running normally.

==''void'' run_town_script(''short'' which_node)==
:Immediately runs the current [[../Lexicon#Town Script/|town script]] at state ''which_node''. Once the scenario script stops running, the script that made this call continues running normally. You can only make this call from dialogue, creature, or terrain scripts.

==''void'' set_incidental_sound(''short'' on_or_off)==
:Sets whether incidental sounds (birds chirping, etc.) are played in the background. If incidental sounds are turned off, they stay off unless this call is used to turn them on again.

Values for ''on_or_off'' are:
{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=5
|0
|&amp;ndash; Incidental sounds are turned on.
|-
|1
|&amp;ndash; Incidental sounds are turned off.
|}

==''void'' set_state(''short'' new_state)==
:Changes the state of the script to ''new_state'' and immediately stops running the script. Has no effect in a dialogue script or in the states [[../Constants#INIT_STATE/|INIT_STATE]], [[../Constants#DEAD_STATE/|DEAD_STATE]], or other predefined state types (except [[../Constants#START_STATE/|START_STATE]]).


'''Notes''':
*See [[../Constants/]], which lists constants and their known values (if any), that can be used for ''new_state''.

==''void'' set_state_continue(''short'' new_state)==
:Exactly like &lt;CODE&gt;set_state()&lt;/CODE&gt;, except that it doesn’t stop running the script.


'''Notes''':
*Despite the official documentation saying that &lt;CODE&gt;set_state_continue()&lt;/CODE&gt; works exactly like &lt;CODE&gt;set_state()&lt;/CODE&gt;, &lt;CODE&gt;set_state_continue()&lt;/CODE&gt; '''does''' work in predefined states (at least some of them), and possibly all of them.
*See [[../Constants/]], which lists constants and their known values (if any), that can be used for ''new_state''.

* Phase I is identified by the model number DCT-6412/2000 on a label on the bottom of the unit.
* Phase II is identified by the model number DCT-6412/2005, and has the Comcast logo.
* Both Phase I and Phase II have only a single [[W:Radio_frequency|RF]] input connector on the back. There is no RF output connector.
* Phase III is identified by:
** 6412 III logo on front of unit.
** [[W:HDMI|HDMI]] port on back of unit instead of the [[W:DVI|DVI]] port on older versions.
** [[W:SATA|SATA]] port on back of unit.
** (optional) RF output jack on back of unit.

Little is known about differences between the Phase I and Phase II.

Beyond the external differences, the Phase III has better analog picture quality and a 12.xx [[W:firmware|firmware]] revision (the older models use 9.xx). As of September 2006, the firmware for DCT-34''xx'' and DCT-64''xx'' Phase I, II &amp; III boxes has converged on 16.xx version numbers.

The [[W:Motorola 3412|Motorola 34''xx'']] is similar to the Phase III 64''xx'', but has no analog tuner and can only be used on cable systems where [[W:Simulcasted|analog-digital simulcasting (ADS)]] is set up.

The 34''xx'' is about the same width and height as the 64''xx'', but is not as deep (about 11 inches, versus 13 inches on the 64''xx''). On the front it has no [[W:SmartCard|SmartCard]] slot, no [[W:A/V|A/V]] input, and no [[W:USB|USB]] port (there is still one USB port on the back). On the back, there are no A/V inputs and no metal cover where the [[W:Radio_frequency|RF]] connectors are.

The DCT3080 is similar to the 3412, but has no HD output circuitry. It can record HD, but will only play it back in SD. On the back, it does '''NOT''' have [[w:Component video|component]], [[w:FireWire|FireWire]] or [[W:HDMI|HDMI]] ports.

The QIP6416 has [[W:A/V|A/V]] inputs on the front, but no [[W:SmartCard|SmartCard]] slot (it has been moved to the back). On the back, there is no [[W:SATA|SATA]] port. The QIP6416 has no analog tuner, but includes an IP tuner that uses frequencies from 1.125GHz to 1.425GHz, making it a 'hybrid' digital cable box.

The DCT6208 is the same size and generally looks similar to the 6412. It is identified by the model number DCT-6208/2005 on a label on the bottom of the unit.

The DCH3416 has a very different look than the DCT series. It has a large clear/black center, with many of the buttons along the bottom. On the back, it has an [[w:CableCard|M-Card]] slot for a card that contains encryption security codes.

The DCH6416 is similar to the DCH3416, but also has an analog tuner.

In Washington State, Comcast tried the ''Microsoft TV: Foundation Edition'' for several months, but switched to [[How to use a Motorola DVR/Using i-Guide|i-Guide]] in 2007.

No cable companies are currently using MSTV on Motorola DVRs.

==Remote Control==
[[Image:Comcast Motorola DCT6412 URC-1067ABG0 Silver Remote.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Comcast URC-106XXXXX Silver Remote]]

The Motorola DVR can be operated with a variety of remote controls. Cable operators are not locked into a specific model, though two forms of the &quot;silver remote&quot; (one with [[w:Digital video recorder|DVR]]-specific controls at the top and one without) are the most common. Both of these remotes are programmable - most of the buttons can be remapped to support functionality that is either not normally deployed (30-second skip) or that is missing (tuner swapping on the non-DVR specific remote). Some remotes supplied by cable operators (one of which is commonly called the &quot;brown&quot; remote) are not programmable.

The silver remote is made by Universal Electronics, and uses the same codes and commands as the 'One-For-All' series. You can find information on programming these remotes at [http://www.hifi-remote.com/ofa/ hifi-remote.com]. The silver remote has a 6-pin connector next to the batteries and is JP1.2. As of September 2006, there is now a cable and software that can let you use your computer to program the remote. Software support for the JP1.2 connection is still somewhat buggy. Support for the URC-1067 (version without the PIP keys), and the URC-1068 (version with PIP keys) was recently added. You can find the model number on a sticker in the battery compartment. The forums and code lists at hifi-remote.com offer useful information.

The Atlas 5 Device DVR/PVR remote (see [http://www.urcsupport.com/html.php?page_id=102 urcsupport.com]) (the so called &quot;black remote&quot;) distributed by CableOne in certain markets uses the same codes and commands as the &quot;silver remote&quot;, except that you need to discard the two leading zeros (e.g., for the 30-second skip, use code 173 instead of 00173). If your &quot;black remote&quot; is JP1.3 include the two leading zeros. You can check your remotes version by looking near the 6-pin connector inside the battery area.  All other steps work as described below.

Some units (6416 from Eastlake for example) are being shipped with a Motorola DR800 remote (see [https://www22.verizon.com/foryourhome/fttprepair/nr/common/SupportDetails.aspx?case=c30111]) which do not have a &quot;setup&quot; button. For basic programming you hold down the &quot;device&quot; button  for at least six seconds until the remote sequences through all four device buttons(Audio, DVD/VCR, TV or Cable). Follow the verizon link for a basic programming manual. As of 12 July 2009, it seems no one has worked out how to program the remote to add in the 30 Second skip feature.

==Device Codes==
The remote will probably come pre-configured for the DVR, but you will probably need to configure the TV and possibly the AUX keys by programming a Device Code for them.  An on-line copy of codes can be found at the [http://www.hifi-remote.com/ofa/codes.shtml One-For-All Universal Remote Setup Codes] page and the [http://www.comcast.com/corporate/customers/customer_support/remotes.html Comcast Remote Controls] page. 

''Comcast Universal Remotes'' accept 4 and 5 digit codes, depending on the model: for example, URC-105XXXX-style remotes (with &quot;gray OK-button&quot;) accept 4 digit codes and URC-106XXXX-style remotes (with &quot;red OK-button&quot;) accept 5-digit codes.  For remotes using 5 digits, the first digit corresponds to the device being programmed.  The first digit is 0 for a cable box; 1 for a TV; 2 for a VCR, DVR, or DVD player; and 3 for audio equipment.  The other four digits are the traditional device codes.  If a four digit code (e.g. 0476) doesn't work for you (i.e. the device button being programmed emits a long, single blink), try adding a leading digit corresponding to the device (e.g. 00476, for the cable box). 

According to the instructions, the Comcast silver-style remote is initially programmed for an [[W:RCA|RCA]] TV and an AUX RCA VCR; however, it doesn't mention the codes used.

===Setting a Device Code===
# Find the 4-digit code number for your device.
# Manually turn on the device you are setting the code for (used to verify you have the proper code).
# Press and release the device key you want to program.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until device key blinks twice.
# Type in the 4-digit code using the number keys.
# If successful, you will get 2 blinks. If not successful, you get one long blink.
# Use the remote to operate your device (use Power, Play, etc..)
# If it doesn't work, look for another code and repeat the above.

* The code for the DVR box is typically 1376 or 0476 (or 01376 or 00476 for models accepting five-digit codes). For the newer DCX series with a gray/platinum remote, use code 01982.

===Searching for a Device Code===
If you couldn't find a code for your device, or none of the listed codes work, you can try a Code Search. This will step through every code, sending a key until you find one that works, or it cycles back to the beginning.

# Manually turn on the device you are setting the code for (used to verify you have the proper code).
# Press and release the device key you want to program.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until device key blinks twice.
# Type in the code 991. The device key should blink twice.
# Aim the remote at the device and press Power (or Play or some other key that will give an obvious result.)
# If there is no response, press the device key.
# Keep repeating the Power (or other) key and device key until you get a response.
# If you do get a response, press the &quot;Setup&quot; key to lock the code.

===Checking your Device Code===
If you forget what device code you used, or it was found using Code Search, the remote can tell you what code is programmed for a device key.

# Press and release the device key you want to get the code for.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until device key blinks twice.
# Type in the code 990. The device key should blink twice.
# Press the 1 key and count the blinks. This is the first digit.
# Press the 2 key and count the blinks. This is the second digit.
# Press the 3 key and count the blinks. This is the third digit.
# Press the 4 key and count the blinks. This is the fourth digit.
# Press the 5 key and count the blinks. This is the fifth digit. (for remotes with five-digit codes)


'''Note:''' &lt;BR&gt;
*The number zero will show no blinks.&lt;BR&gt; 
*The most common CABLE codes are 1376 or 0476 (or 01376 or 00476 for models accepting five-digit codes).&lt;br&gt;
*Sony TV's often use code 0000. This can be confusing as you get no blinks for all digits!

===Reassigning a Device Key===
The device keys are designed to only work with certain codes. If you try to program a DVD player on the TV key, it may not work. You need to reassign the device key to a different category.

# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until device key blinks twice.
# Type in the code 992. The device key should blink twice.
# Press and release the device you want copy codes FROM.
# Press and release the device you want to copy codes TO.

To restore a device key, just press it twice (in other words, copy to itself.)

==Key Remapping (Key-Mover)==
Remapping a key allows you to move a key to a more convenient location, copy a key from another device, or add a new function to a key. One-For-All remotes call this feature ''Key-Mover''.

Key remapping is not available on the Universal Electronics' '''''1056B03''''' remote.

===Remap a Key===
This is the general procedure for remapping. Several common mapping options specific to the Motorola DVR are listed below.

# (Option) Press and release the device key to make it the default.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until a device key blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. A device key will blink twice.   
# (Option) Press and release the device key for the source device.
# Press the key to get the code from. This can be:
# Another button with an existing code or,
# Press and release &quot;Setup&quot;, then type in a 3- or 5-digit code. The code is called an 'Extended Function Code' (EFC). Most of the silver remotes use 5-digit codes. Most others use 3-digits. In most cases, you just add '00' to the front of the 3-digit code to get a 5-digit code (00173 = 173).
# (Option) Press and release the device key for the destination device.
# (Option) Press and release &quot;Setup&quot; to create a ''shifted'' key.
# Press and release the button you want to put the code on.
# If the remap is successful, a device key will blink twice.

A list of Extended Function Codes (EFC's) for many device codes can be found at [http://www.hifi-remote.com/ofa/adv-codes.shtml hifi-remote.com Advanced Codes]. See [[#Checking your Device Code|Checking your Device Code]] if you do not know the code for your device.

===Using a Shifted Key===
A Shifted key is a second code stored on a key. It is accessed by pressing and releasing the &quot;Setup&quot; key, then pressing the desired key. The &quot;Setup&quot; key acts like the Shift key on a keyboard. A common use is to put the DVR's own Mute code as a shifted Mute. A normal press of the Mute key will mute/un-mute your audio device (TV or amplifier), but the shifted-Mute will mute or un-mute the DVR.

===Restore a Remapped Key===
The following technique can be used to restore the original function to a key that has been remapped. You are essentially mapping the key onto itself.

# Press the device key (&quot;Cable&quot;, &quot;TV&quot;, or &quot;AUX&quot;) for the device you want.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until the selected device button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The selected device key will blink twice.
# Press the key you are restoring twice. The device key will blink twice if successful.

===Restore All Remapped Keys for a Device===
The following technique can be used to restore the original function to all remapped keys for a device.

# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until the a device button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. A device key will blink twice.
# Press the device key you are restoring twice. The device key will blink twice if successful.

The four most common remapping are:

*[[#Add 30-Second Skip|30-second skip (aka commercial skip)]]
*[[#Add 15-Second Back|15-second Back]]
*[[#Add A Dedicated STB Mute/Unmute|Dedicated STB (Set Top Box) mute/un-mute]]
*[[#Add A Tuner Swap Button|Tuner swap]]

===Add 30-Second Skip===
The following technique can be used to map an unused or unneeded button on the &quot;silver&quot; remote to the 30-second skip command. Current versions of the i-Guide software will skip forward 30 seconds into a recording when this command is sent.  A good choice is the 'A / Lock' button since many users don't need that function; you can feel both the '15-second-back' and '30-second-skip' buttons with one finger and move between them without looking.  Some users have found, however, that double-clicking the play button results in a 30-second skip forward.

# Press the &quot;Cable&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Cable&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press (do not hold) the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Type in the code 00173.
# Press whatever button you want to map the 30-second skip command to (ex: skip button at bottom of remote(using a/b/c will deprogram guide features on comcast remotes). The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice if successful.


Note: &lt;BR&gt;
If you have the dark gray remote and a DCX series cable box, use this procedure.

You must temporarily reprogram Aux to Cable, set 30 sec skip, then change Aux to your auxiliary device.

# Press the &quot;Aux&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Aux&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 01376. The &quot;Aux&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press the &quot;Aux&quot; button at the top of the remote again
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Aux&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The &quot;Aux&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press (do not hold) the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Type in the code 00173. 
# Press (do not hold) the &quot;Cable&quot; button.
# Press whatever button you want to map the 30-second skip command to (ex: A / Lock). The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice if successful.

'''Notes:''' &lt;BR&gt;
* This '''did not work''' on boxes with the Microsoft TV Foundation Interface (previously used in Washington State, but now converted back to the i-Guide software).  As of firmware version 12.22 Insight Cable disabled this feature, but has been re-enabled in firmware version 16.35. Comcast software Version 73.44 disabled this feature, but the latest software, Version 74.53-3321, re-enables it (this has been confirmed on the 3416 w/ 16.20 firmware). See [[../Firmware_and_Software#Software|software]] for more info.
* As of software A25.2-2, the ''Page Up'' key is removed from some operators and others have programmed it as a 5 min skip.
* This code ''does'' work for the PACE TDC577X (vegas) standard def DVR with Comcast service (SW version 75.69-a25p2-2S1.r-8).
* This works with the Comcast Universal Remote - Red and the Motorola DVR.

===Add 15-Second Back===
Most Comcast remotes have a counter-clockwise curly arrow that is pre-programmed for this code.

# Press the &quot;Cable&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Cable&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press (do not hold) the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Type in the code 00179.
# Press whatever button you want to map the 15-second back command to (ex: A / Lock). The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice if successful.

'''Note:''' To reprogram a [[w:Radio Shack|Radio Shack]] OneForAll™ remote please see this page-- http://www.hifi-remote.com/ofa/advanced.shtml

If you have the dark gray remote and a DCX series cable box, use this procedure:

You must temporarily reprogram Aux to Cable, set 30 sec skip, then change Aux to your auxiliary device.

# Press the &quot;Aux&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Aux&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 01376. The &quot;Aux&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press the &quot;Aux&quot; button at the top of the remote again
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Aux&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The &quot;Aux&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press (do not hold) the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Type in the code 00179.
# Press (do not hold) the &quot;Cable&quot; button.
# Press whatever button you want to map the 15-second back command to (ex: counter-clockwise curly arrow). The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice if successful.

===Add A Dedicated STB Mute/Un-mute===
The following technique can be used to map an unused or unneeded button on the &quot;silver&quot; remote to the 6412's mute/un-mute command. Since the &quot;silver&quot; remote's mute button often controls the TV's or HT receiver's mute command, this allows you to re-enable the sound if the box has muted itself (see [[../Bugs#Picture_but_no_sound_.28.22MUTE.22_superimposed_over_top-center_of_picture_in_small_white_letters.29|&quot;MUTE&quot; bug]]).

'''Method 1 - Remap the Mute Button (Comcast URC-106XXXXX Silver Remote):'''
# Press the &quot;Cable&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Cable&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press (do not hold) the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Type in the code 00141.
# Press whatever button you want to map the STB mute/un-mute command to (ex: PiP On/Off). The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice if successful.

'''''Note:''' You can also use the MUTE button for both the STB and your TV by mapping the STB mute/un-mute command to the MUTE button. The default function of the MUTE button will then be to mute/un-mute the STB (or activated by pressing CABLE, then MUTE). The TV mute/un-mute command can still be accessed by pressing the TV button, then MUTE.''

'''Method 2 - Use a Shifted Mute Command (Comcast URC-106XXXXX Silver Remote):'''
# Press the &quot;Cable&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Cable&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press and release the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Type in the code 00141.
# Press and release the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Press and release the &quot;Mute&quot; button.

Now, if the remote has volume lock enabled (the normal default is the TV), pressing MUTE will mute/un-mute that device. To mute/un-mute the STB, press and release the &quot;Setup&quot; button (acting as the &quot;shift&quot; button), then MUTE.

'''Method 3 (RCN Remote):'''
The remote from RCN does not have a setup button. On that remote, these instructions should work, and more detailed instructions can be found in [http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,13375545#13388234 this dslreports.com thread].
# Press and hold CBL, then press and hold OK until CBL lights up.
# Press VOL + (the upper part of the VOL button).
# Press and hold CBL. CBL should blink several times to indicate success.

'''Method 4 - Disable Volume Lock (Atlas 5 DVR Remote):'''
Another method to fix this is to make the volume controls independent for the TV and the Cable. Some companies have the remote set to automatically lock the volume control strictly to the television. To undo this on the Atlas 5 PVR/DVR:

# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button. 
# Press (do not hold) the &quot;CBL&quot; button. Wait for 2 flashes of the last pressed button.
# Enter 993 on the digit pad.
# Press &quot;VOL +&quot; on the remote. The last pressed mode button should flash twice.

This will unlock all the volume controls to be independent. If you want to control the TV's volume, press &quot;TV&quot; first. If you want to control the cable box's volume, press &quot;CBL&quot; first.

===Add A Tuner Swap Button===
The following technique can be used to map an unused or unneeded button on the &quot;silver&quot; remote to the tuner swap command. The Motorola DVR contains two tuners. Some versions of the &quot;silver&quot; remote lack the DVR-specific buttons, including the &quot;swap&quot; button that tells the DVR to swap the &quot;background&quot; tuner (which can record but does not display on-screen) with the &quot;foreground&quot; tuner (the tuner that is actively displaying on your TV). A common use for this command is to switch to a tuner that is not currently recording a program in order to watch another live program without disrupting the ability to pause or rewind the first program.

'''Method 1 (Comcast URC-106XXXXX Silver Remote):'''
# Press the &quot;Cable&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Cable&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press (do not hold) the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Type in the code 00236.
# Press whatever button you want to map the tuner swap command to (ex: PiP Swap). The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice if successful.
'''''Note:''' It was common for some Comcast remotes that had transport keys, but none of the PIP keys (URC1067BG1), to have the swap programmed on the TV/VCR key. This did not work on boxes with the Microsoft TV Foundation Interface (previously used in Washington State).''

'''Method 2 (Atlas 5 DVR Remote):'''
On Atlas 5 DVR/PVR devices, you can enable this functionality more simply by giving your remote the correct code to control the Motorola DVR. This is known to work on DCT6412 Phase III boxes, but has not been tested on Phase II or Phase I boxes, or any other model box. To do this, simply:

# Press the &quot;CBL&quot; button at the top right of your remote control once, to set it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button at the upper-left of your remote until the &quot;CBL&quot; button blinks twice.
# Enter 1376 on the number pad of the remote. The &quot;CBL&quot; button will blink twice.

The &quot;SWAP&quot; button at the bottom-left of the remote (small black button with white lettering) should now swap between your tuners. Additionally, the green &quot;LIST&quot; button in the middle of the remote control should now bring you straight to a list of your recorded programs, instead of having to navigate through a series of menus to get there.

===Sending an EFC code manually===
You can experiment with an Extended Function Code (EFC) before mapping it to a key by sending it manually.

# Press and release the device button for the device you want to send the EFC code for.
# Press and release the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Type in the 3- or 5-digit EFC code (the 5-digit code is usually just two zeros followed by the 3-digit code.)

===EFC list===
This is a list of the Extended Function Codes (EFC) that the Motorola DVR recognizes from a Universal Electronics/One-For-All style remote. For the silver Comcast remotes, you usually need to add two extra zeros to the front (example: 00173 for 30-second skip instead of the listed 173.)

'''NOTE:''' Preview List displays a list of currently playing Pay-Per-View movies. The top entry lets you see previews for some of them.&lt;br&gt;
'''NOTE:''' Music List displays a list of the music channels (DMX and Music Choice.) It's the same list shown by using Menu/Menu/Music.&lt;br&gt;
'''NOTE:''' On Comcast remotes, the On-Demand button is actually a macro sending '1', then OK/Select.&lt;br&gt;
'''NOTE:''' Captions may not show up until a timeshifting button (e.g. replay, live) is pressed. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
'''NOTE:''' There are no discrete ON or OFF commands, but you can emulate them with the following:
* ON = MENU - POWER - POWER  (if OFF: displays setup menu, powers OFF, then powers ON. If ON: displays menu, powers OFF, powers back ON.)
* OFF = MENU - POWER (if OFF: displays setup menu, then powers OFF. If ON: displays menu, then powers OFF.)
** '''NOTE:''' To get rid of the warning screen that sometimes comes up regarding interruption of an ongoing program recording, append a &quot;LIVE&quot; key to the end of the macro.  i.e.  ON = MENU - POWER - POWER - LIVE and OFF = MENU - POWER - LIVE.

==Macros==

===Add a Macro Button===
A &quot;macro&quot; can also be created that will simulate hitting a series of buttons from the single press of a button. 

# Press the &quot;Cable&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Cable&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 995. The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press the button you want to map the macro to (ex: PiP CH-) (Optional: You can push Setup first to have a &quot;shifted&quot; button. See above).
# Press the sequence of buttons you want executed by the macro (ex: AUX, POWER, TV, POWER --- turns on/off the Aux and TV equipment without turning on/off the cable box when PiP CH- is pressed --- useful to avoid some of the [[../Bugs#Bugs|bugs]]). 
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button. The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice if successful.

'''Note: Certain buttons cannot be reprogrammed to execute a macro, ex: &quot;All On&quot;, &quot;POWER&quot;, &quot;Setup&quot;.'''

'''Note: Macros typically operate across any device selected (Cable, TV, Aux) unless you use keymap to force a code onto a key. If that is done, the macro will not work for that device.

'''Note: 15 buttons can be programmed to each macro. ex: 5 channel up + 10 channel down. Macros cannot be combined, and the original function for a button is kept when used inside a macro. For example, I set a macro for my 'TV/VCR' button to change the input of my TV to my DVD player (the default for this button) and then set the remote to AUX. I then set a macro for the 'HD zoom' button to change the input of my TV to TV and then set the remote to CABLE. This macro included the pushing of 'TV/VCR' which when still performed its default function, not the macro I had assigned to it.

'''Note: Works well as fix for the &quot;my DVR&quot; button function change Comcast implemented ex: &quot;my DVR&quot; press now shows &quot;my recordings&quot; like it did before Comcast changed it.

Programming the &quot;My DVR&quot; button with a silver and platnium remote on the Motorola DCT3412 box

# Press the “Cable” button.
# Press and hold the “Setup” button until the “Cable” button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The “Cable” button will blink twice.
# Press (do not hold) the “Setup” button.
# Type in the code 00175.
# Press the &quot;My DVR&quot; button.

===Erase a Macro from a Button=== 
The following technique can be used to erase a macro programmed on a key. You are essentially creating a macro with no steps.

# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until a device button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 995. A device button will blink twice.
# Press the key with the macro you want to delete.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until a device button blinks twice.


==Volume Lock==
Volume Lock is a remote control function that forces the volume and mute keys to always send the codes for your audio device (typically the TV or an amplifier.) You can change what device is used for volume, or disable the feature. When disabled, the remote will send the volume code for whatever device is currently selected.

===Setting Global Volume Lock===
Global Volume Lock will force the volume and mute keys to be controlled by one device.

# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until a device key blinks twice.
# Type in the code 993. A device key should blink twice.
# Press and release the device key for the device you want the volume locked to.
# You will get two blinks if the lock is successful.

===Disable Volume Lock for one Device===
This will disable Volume lock only when a particular device is selected on the remote.

# Press and release the device key for the device you want to disable the Volume Lock on.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until a device key blinks twice.
# Type in the code 993. A device key should blink twice.
# Press and release the Volume Down (Vol -) button.
# The device key will blink FOUR times if successful.

===Disable Global Volume Lock===
This will disable Volume Lock for all devices. The Volume and Mute keys will send the codes for the selected device.

# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until a device key blinks twice.
# Type in the code 993. A device key should blink twice.
# Press and release the Volume Up (Vol +) button.
# A device key will blink FOUR times if successful.

==Channel Control Lock==
Some of these remotes also have a Channel Control Lock. This forces the number, Channel +/-, Enter, and Last keys to always send the codes for one of the devices, no matter which one is currently selected. Normally, it is locked to the CABLE device.

===Setting Channel Control Lock===
Setting Channel Control Lock will force the number, Channel +/-, Enter, and last keys to the selected device.

# Press and release the device key for the device you want to lock the keys to.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until the device key blinks twice.
# Type in the code 973. The device key should blink twice.
# Press the Channel Up (CH +) key.
# If successful, the device key should blink 2 times.

===Disabling Channel Control Lock===
Disabling Channel Control Lock will allow the number, Channel +/-, Enter, and last keys to be used with the currently selected device.

# Press and release the device key for the device you want to lock the keys to.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until the device key blinks twice.
# Type in the code 973. The device key should blink twice.
# Press the Channel Down (CH -) key.
# If successful, the device key should blink 2 times.

==All On key==
The ''All On'' key is a built-in macro that sends Power codes for all 3 devices. This macro cannot be altered or removed.

Due to bugs, it's often best to leave the DVR on all the time. Unfortunately, the ''All On'' macro will turn it off if somebody presses the button. A workaround is to alter the code sent for the DVR's Power command to something that is ignored. That way, when the macro runs, it sends the unused EFC code. The drawback to this method is that the Power button will not work at all. A workaround for the drawback involves mapping the Power code as a SHIFTed Power key.

There is a manual mechanical workaround to this issue.  Using a box cutter blade or swiss army knife blade, cut the top rubber off the ALL ON button so it is flat to the plastic...or slightly below the surface.  Do not pierce the rubber.  The button will still be usable but won't be likely to be pushed unless a dedicated &quot;little pinkie&quot; device is used.  As a further enhancement a piece of tape can be place over the surface making the button effectively gone.

===Disable DVR Power key===
# Press the &quot;Cable&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Cable&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press (do not hold) the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Type in the code 00000.
# Press the &quot;Power&quot; button.
# You will get 2 blinks if successful.
This does not work with 3412 cable box with Motorola DVR remote

===Enable DVR Power key===
# Press the &quot;Cable&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Cable&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press the &quot;Power&quot; button twice.
# You will get 2 blinks if successful.

This does not work with 3412 cable box with Motorola DVR remote

===Create a SHIFTed Power key===
# Press the &quot;Cable&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Cable&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code 994. The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice.
# Press (do not hold) the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Type in the code 00144.
# Press and release the &quot;Setup&quot; button.
# Press the &quot;Power&quot; button.
# You will get 2 blinks if successful.

To send the Power command, press and release the &quot;Setup&quot; key, then press the &quot;Power&quot; key.

This does not work with 3412 cable box with Motorola DVR remote

==Resets==
If your remote is not acting right, or you've made changes and messed things up, you can reset the remote to defaults.

'''WARNING:''' This could cause problems if your cable operator has pre-programmed some keys, as you may lose some functions.

===OPS Reset===
This reset will delete all macros and keymoves, including volume and channel locks. It will not reset device codes.

# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until a device key blinks twice.
# Type in the code 980.
# If successful, a device key will blink FOUR times.

===Factory Reset===
This reset will delete all macros and keymoves and reset device codes to defaults.

# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; key until a device key blinks twice.
# Type in the code 981.
# If successful, a device key will blink FOUR times.
# '''Also code 982 will unlock your remote from your previous cable box'''; note that you'll need to do this to reassign the &quot;Cable&quot; device key.

===Configuration after Reset===
As indicated above, functionality may be lost after performing a factory reset.  ''Comcast URC-style'' remotes, for example, will no longer communicate with the set-top box after a reset and must be reconfigured.  

Comcast gives the following codes for Motorola digital boxes (not dvr).  Note for these codes to be entered the remote must be unlocked (4 blinks after entering 982):

01376 (This works for Motorola DCT6208 DVR,
00476,
00810,
00276,
01187,
01254,
01982

The following has been confirmed to reconfigure the Comcast URC-106XXXX remote for the Comcast Motorola DCH-3416 HD DVR:

# Press the &quot;Cable&quot; button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.
# Press and hold the &quot;Setup&quot; button until the &quot;Cable&quot; button blinks twice.
# Type in the code: '''0476''' for URC-105XXXX-style remotes ''or'' '''00476''' for URC-106XXXX-style remotes.  The &quot;Cable&quot; button will blink twice.

Your remote should now work as originally configured by Comcast.


The Cable device code may be locked on some remotes. To unlock:

# press the CABLE button.
# press and hold the SETUP button until the CABLE button blinks twice.
# Enter 9 - 8 - 2. The CABLE key will blink four times.

Then, follow the normal programming procedure using the correct code as above for your set-top box. To re-lock the Cable device code, repeat the steps above.

EDIT: 01376 will work for all Motorola boxes, Source: Comcast employee.

EDIT: Kindly try the following codes:0877, 0008, 0017, 0277, 0477, 1877 for 'gray' remotes that use four digit codes.

==Other remotes==
If you have another universal or multi-device remote that you want to use to control your Motorola DVR, you need to find the proper setup code. If Motorola is not listed under cable devices, try using codes for General Instrument or GI, and possibly NextLevel and Jerrold. [[w:General Instrument|General Instrument]] was bought by Motorola a few years ago; Jerrold was a former General Instrument brand.

Many universal remotes or older cable remotes may not support the transport keys (play, pause, etc...) If the cursor keys are supported, you can use them as alternates:

==Firmware and Software==

The [[w:firmware|firmware]] is the operating system of the DVR, and is produced by [[w:Anand Enterprises|Anand Enterprises]] with options that can be enabled / disabled by your local cable provider / [[W:Multi system operator|MSO]]. The firmware is roughly like the [[w:BIOS|BIOS]] and core code of your computer's operating system. It has the programming to access the hardware, read and write files and video streams to/from the hard drive, and other basic functions.

The software is the user interface that you see, and typically handles the scheduling, program guide, [[w:Pay-per-view|PPV]]/[[w:Video_on_demand|VOD]] and many other complicated features. The [[w:software|software]] used depends on your cable system. There are several current suppliers. i-Guide is currently the most common.

The Interactive Programming Guide ([[W:EPG|IPG]]) software can be provided by i-Guide (Comcast, Time Warner, Adelphia, Mediacom, Brighthouse Communications, Passport Echo] (Cox, RCN, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Electric Service Electric] Wilkes-Barre), or Microsoft TV Foundation Edition] (&quot;MSTV Foundation Edition&quot; or MSFE) (Verizon, Comcast in WA state). 

i-Guide is a product of GuideWorks, LLC], an IPG development group formed in August 2011 by Comcast Corporation and Gemstar-TV Guide International]. The programming information is provided by the television network to GuideWorks, which supplies the data to cable providers for use with the i-Guide.

''Note: You cannot update/change the firmware, software, or IPG versions on your particular box. Updates are pushed out by your local cable provider/[[W:Multi system operator|MSO]] based on a variety of considerations, including maintenance windows, update schedules, and the software available on their own equipment.''

===How To Check Your Firmware and Software Versions - Main Menu===
Press the &quot;Menu&quot; button TWICE on the remote to get to the &quot;Main Menu&quot;.
Arrow down if necessary and select the &quot;Setup&quot; menu on the bottom left.
Arrow down once and select the second option, &quot;Cable Box Setup&quot;.
Arrow down to the bottom and select the &quot;Select to display&quot; button.
The text second down on the left is &quot;S/W Ver&quot;. This is your software version.
The text sixth down on the right is &quot;Firmware&quot;. This is your firmware version.

===How To Check Your Firmware and Software Versions - Diagnostic Menu===
Turn off the box (press POWER on the remote).
Immediately press OK/SELECT. Press it again if the display (black text on white background) does not come up within a second.
DOWN ARROW to &quot;d08 CODE MODULES&quot; and press OK/SELECT.
The firmware version and build date are listed at the top, e.g., &quot;Platform Built: Version: 16.20 Sep 1 2011 15:06:09&quot;.
In the middle of the page, there is an &quot;Object&quot; column and a &quot;Ver&quot; column that lists your firmware and software versions, e.g.,
Firmware: TC_OS_ED 16.20
IPG Software: TV_Guide 74.53
VOD Software: A231_VOD 23.45
To exit the menu press POWER twice. The unit will exit the menu and turn back on.

==Versions==
The latest firmware and software, and their respective versions, will vary by cable company and your local area (pushing out firmware and software versions is controlled by your local cable provider). The &quot;available&quot; date only represents a point in time when it was known to be available as the latest version in any given cable market. The date is in [[W:ISO_8601#Calendar_date|ISO]] Year-Month-Day format.

Some features, such as the 30-second skip, are options that can be enabled or disabled by the cable provider. Sometimes, they may accidentally disable the 30-second skip by mistake. Some cable providers replace the 30-second skip with a 3 minute skip, designed for quickly skipping commercials.

==Current HDDs Used in Motorola DVRs==
===DCT-6412 Phase I and II===
The DCT-6412 Phase I and Phase II use a standard [[w:SATA|SATA]] drive.
*Seagate ST3120025ACE (CE=Consumer Electronics version of ST3120025A.)
*Maxtor 4R120L0

===DCT-6412 Phase III===
The DCT-6412 Phase III uses a standard [[w:SATA|SATA]] drive.
*Maxtor 6L120M0
*Seagate ST3120026AS
*Seagate ST3120022AS
*Seagate ST380817AS

===DCT-6416===
*Seagate ST3160023AS
*Seagate ST3160021AS
*Seagate ST3120827AS
*Seagate ST3160212SCE

===DCT-6208===
*Seagate ST380012A
''The models mentioned below need to be verified, as the 6208 is a modified 6200, and is IDE, not SATA.''
*ST380013AS
*ST380011AS
*ST340111AS
*ST340014AS

===All Other Models===
Not yet tested and verified.

==Recording Capacity vs. HDD Size==

* On the 160GB drive the data partition is 147,581MB. At 5.6GB/hr, it would hold 26.3hrs.
* On the 120GB drive the data partition is 109,900MB. At 5.6GB/hr, it would hold 19.6hrs.
* The 160GB drive has 34% greater data capacity.

==Hidden F/W Features==
* F/W version 12.31, found in the DCT6412 III and 3412 I, harbors an undocumented ability to recognize a 160Gb HDD.
* Maxtor (Quick View series) and Seagate (Barracuda 7200.7 Serial ATA) HDD brands are used interchangeably in the DCT DVRs, so far three brands have been used in an operability test, done by four separate DCT DVR owners. One was a Western Digital (WD1600JS - SATA I Jumper enabled), two were Seagate, and one was a Samsung Spinpoint P 160GB. After installation, the HDDs were recognized and successfully formatted to 160Gb in all STBs.

==Credits &amp; Disclaimers==

* Technical information credit goes to Cavu, who did a great deal of research on the numbers.
* The highest capacity drive that was talked about and then implemented from Motorola is only 500Gb.
* A 300Gb HDD was used in one of the boxes. Once formatted, only 160Gb was allocated. So, it would seem that no larger HDD will work beyond that, and the S/W &amp; F/W are not intuitive or adaptable to anything higher than 160Gb.
* As of software version 75.59 a25p2-2.S1.r-8 and firmware version 16.53, the SATA, and USB ports have still not been enabled.  The HDD size is still limited to 160Gb.
* It is important to note the testing took place in Canada (on cable systems utilizing i-Guide), where subscribers buy and own their STBs, unlike in America where they are rented from cable providers. Installing or replacing parts (modding) may violate the manufacturers warranty. In the U.S. if the modded box isn't returned to the CC in a pre-mod state, at the very least you will be forced to buy the DCT back for full market price.

      <comment>/* How to check the temperature */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MotoDVRTOC}}

==Temperature==
The DVR has been observed to run better and perhaps produce fewer occurrences of [[w:Software bugs|bugs]] or undesigned behavior when it is kept running at a cooler temperature. Most users observe their boxes running within the 38-57°C (100-135°F) range; the cooler, the better.

''Note: The DCT64xx PIII and 34xx have a fan on the bottom of the unit to help with cooling.''

===How to check the temperature===
The temperature is displayed in the diagnostic menu.

# Turn off the box (press POWER on the remote)
# Immediately press the OK/SELECT button. Press it again if the display (black text on white background) does not come up within a second.
# DOWN ARROW to d13 and press OK/SELECT. You'll see a screen that lists HDD info.
# DOWN ARROW will get you to second screen which shows the current and high temp readings for the HDD.
# To get out of the menu just press POWER twice and the unit will turn back on.

''Note: This is only the temperature of the hard disk, which is towards the front center of the box.  The left side of the box where the power supply and CPU gets quite a bit hotter, particularly when recording. It can in fact be used to boil water for my coffee. When it gets this hot, it tends to shut itself off, (Intel CPUs power off for safety at 105°C (221°F)) and when having this problem the HDD temperature is 127°F.''

==Steps to keep your cable box running cooler==
* The Motorola manual recommends maintaining 2 inches of space surrounding the box on all sides and on top to allow for proper ventilation.
* Install a [[w:USB|USB]]-powered laptop/notebook cooler on top of the STB, a device that will pull air off the top and push it out the back. The USB ports on the front or back of the STB, if powered, may be used to power the cooler. Note: The USB ports may or may not be powered on your particular STB. The back ports have been found more likely to be powered than the front port.
* Install an 80mm or 120mm PC fan behind the STB, powered by a PC power supply or variable DC power supply.

==Hard Disk Drives==
Some units have noisier disk drives than others:
* Seagate drives seem to be quieter than Maxtor Quickview drives.
* Exchanging the unit may help you find a quieter one.

==How To Check Your Incoming Signal Strength==
* Set both of the STB tuners to channels you have seen exhibit problems. Use the [[../Programming the Remote#How To Add A Tuner Swap Button|tuner swap button]].
* Turn the STB off and press OK/SELECT on the remote within 2 seconds to enter the diagnostic menu.
* Press the DOWN arrow and then OK/SELECT to select the &quot;d03 OOB STATUS&quot; option.
** The [[w:Signal-to-noise ratio|SNR]] (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and [[w:Automatic Gain Control|AGC]] (Automatic Gain Control) values are of interest. Any value stated less than &quot;GOOD&quot; (i.e., &quot;FAIR&quot; or &quot;POOR&quot;) could indicate a problem.
* Press OK/SELECT to go back to the diagnostic menu.
* Now select the &quot;d04 INBAND STATUS&quot; option.
** The SNR and AGC values are of interest. Any value stated less than &quot;GOOD&quot; (i.e., &quot;FAIR&quot; or &quot;POOR&quot;) could indicate a problem. Be sure to look at values for both Tuner 1 and Tuner 2.
* Press OK/SELECT to go back to the diagnostic menu.
* Now select the &quot;d06 CURRENT CHANNEL STATUS&quot; option.
** On a digital/HD channel the MPEG VIDEO &amp; AUDIO LOCK values are of interest for both tuners. (Use the UP/DOWN ARROWS to see information for both Tuner 1 and Tuner 2.)
* Press OK/SELECT to go back to the diagnostic menu.
* Press the POWER button to exit the diagnostic menu and press the POWER button again to turn the STB back on.
===What the values tell you===
* If your AGC levels are FAIR or POOR and the percentage is high (over 50%), then a stronger signal may help. If possible, try to minimize the number of splitters, connections, and poor quality [[w:RG-59|RG-59]] cable. Try to use [[w:RG-6|RG-6]] whenever possible. If you have simplified as much as possible, consider a broadband compatible RF amplifier. Ideally, it should be placed as close to where the cable comes into your home as possible.
* If your AGC levels are FAIR or POOR and the percentage is low (under 50%), then you may have too strong of a signal, which can overload the tuner. Consider using an RF attenuator, or even a splitter or two to reduce the signal (a 1:2 splitter will reduce the signal strength by a little more than 50%). Any unused outputs on a splitter should have a [[w:Electrical_termination|terminator]] screwed onto it. (A terminator is a 75-ohm resistor inside a little cap to prevent noise from getting into the lines.)
* If your SNR levels are FAIR or POOR (typically below 20 dB), then check all connections. If possible, try to minimize the number of splitters, connections, and poor quality [[w:RG-59|RG-59]] cable. Try to use [[w:RG-6|RG-6]] whenever possible. A stronger signal MAY help, but not always. An amplifier also increases noise a bit, and could make things worse. If you only have problems with a few channels, it could be interference at a particular frequency leaking into the cable from someplace.

==How To Check If [[w:HDCP|HDCP]] is Enabled==
* Turn the STB off and press OK/SELECT on the remote within 2 seconds to enter the diagnostic menu.
* Press the down arrow and then OK/SELECT to select the &quot;d11 INTERFACE STATUS&quot; option.
* Press the down arrow to go to Page 2.
* Look under the &quot;DVI PORT&quot; section for the &quot;HDCP ENABLED&quot; option to check if it reads &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;.
* Press OK/SELECT to go back to the diagnostic menu.
* Press the POWER button to exit the diagnostic menu and press the power button again to turn the STB back on.

==How To Check If [[w:DTCP|5C DTCP]] is Enabled==
* Tune to the channel you are checking for [[w:DTCP|5C DTCP]] use.
* Turn the STB off and press OK/SELECT on the remote within 2 seconds to enter the diagnostic menu.
* Press the down arrow and then OK/SELECT to select the &quot;d11 INTERFACE STATUS&quot; option.
* Look at &quot;5C IMPLEMENTATION&quot;. A &quot;0&quot; indicates 5C DTCP is not being used, a &quot;1&quot; indicates 5C DTCP is being used.
* Press OK/SELECT to go back to the diagnostic menu.
* Press the power button to exit the diagnostic menu and press the power button again to turn the STB back on.

On some boxes, it may display &quot;5C IMPLEMENTATION = NO.&quot; If this is the case, then you must do the following instead to check your 5C status:

* Tune to the channel you are checking for [[w:DTCP|5C DTCP]] use.
* Turn the STB off and press OK/SELECT on the remote within 2 seconds to enter the diagnostic menu.
* Press the down arrow and then OK/SELECT to select the &quot;d06 CURRENT CHANNEL STATUS&quot; option.
* If &quot;CCI&quot; and &quot;DRM&quot; have values of &quot;0x00&quot; the channel is unencrypted. If either setting has any other value, such as &quot;0x01&quot; or &quot;0x02&quot;, it indicates encryption.
* If the &quot;RC Flag&quot; [[w:Broadcast Flag#The FCC Broadcast flag ruling|Redistribution Control Flag]] has any value other than &quot;0x00&quot;, then the [[w:Broadcast Flag|Broadcast Flag]] has been detected and the Firewire output is encrypted as a result.
* At least one person has been able to record over FireWire with &quot;CCI&quot; set to 0x02, &quot;DRM&quot; set to 0x00, and &quot;RC Flag&quot; set to 0x00.

==How To Check if Analog-Digital Simulcasting (ADS) is Enabled==

Analog-Digital Simulcasting ([[w:Simulcast|ADS]]) is used by the DVR in local cable markets where ADS is available. The [[w:DCT3412|DCT3412]], and the tiny non-DVR DCT700, having only digital tuners, always employ ADS. The DCT6208. along with the DCT64XX (all models), and non DVR DCT models 5100, 6200 1100/1200, 22XX, and 25XX have analog and digital tuners. In an ADS market, those models will default to their digital tuners, as ADS overrides their analog tuners completely.  Refer to [[w:Simulcast|the article on ADS]] for more information on how the technology is used in cable systems.

'''Method 1:'''
[[Image:Dolby_digital.png|thumb|right|Dolby Digital logo with &quot;double-D&quot; symbol]]
# Tune to a single-digit channel (ex: Ch. 9). These &quot;basic cable&quot; channels would normally be received as analog without ADS.
# Press the INFO button. If the [[w:Dolby_Digital|Dolby Digital]] double-D symbol is displayed, the channel is digital, and you have ADS.
'''Note:''' ''The Dolby Digital symbol may not show up on the second tuner. Use the [[../Programming the Remote#How To Add A Tuner Swap Button|tuner swap]] button to switch to Tuner 1 to check for the double-D symbol on a &quot;basic cable&quot; channel.''

'''Method 2:'''
# Tune to a single-digit channel (ex: Ch. 9). These &quot;basic cable&quot; channels would normally be received as analog without ADS.
# Press CABLE then POWER to shut off the box.
# Immediately press OK/SELECT to enter the diagnostic menu.
# Press the down arrow to go to &quot;d06 CURRENT CHANNEL STATUS&quot; and press OK/SELECT. 
#* If the type is &quot;ANALOG&quot;, you do not have ADS. 
#* If the type is &quot;DIGITAL&quot;, you may have ADS (this tuner may be tuned to a digital channel that wouldn't use ADS, check the other tuner in the next step to see if it is tuned to an analog channel).
# Press the down arrow to scroll to the second page showing details for Tuner 2. 
#* If the type is &quot;ANALOG&quot;, you do not have ADS. 
#* If the type is &quot;DIGITAL&quot;, and the type on Tuner 1 was also &quot;DIGITAL&quot;, you have ADS.
# Press OK/SELECT then the power button to exit the diagnostic menu, and then press the power button again to turn the STB back on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MotoDVRTOC}}

==Bugs==

The early versions of the hardware, software, and service have quite a few [[w:Software bug|bugs]]. Many of these have workarounds and are being worked on by Motorola, the cable companies, and the IPG developers, the suppliers of the software on the DVR. It is advisable to cold-reboot once a month, by simply unplugging the box for 30 seconds.  After power is restored, be patient as the program guide and other features reload (approximately. 20 minutes, and wait 24 hours for the guide to fully populate). Minor odd DVR behaviors are usually cleared up, and more serious ones prevented by this procedure. However, sometimes a bug is still just a bug.

If you are at a loss as to any other solution to a problem you are experiencing, you can also perform a [[../Resets#DVR Authorization and Factory Full Reset|DVR Authorization and Factory Full Reset]] or a [[../Resets#DVR HDD Reset|DVR HDD Reset]].

==Software, Firmware or Hardware==

Many of the software problems first encountered by users can be remedied by remembering one simple rule: ''Don't turn off the DVR.'' The DVR is never really off anyhow. Turning it off just turns off the video and audio outputs. It continues to buffer TV (on some models).

===The box may switch from sending Dolby Digital out of the digital outputs to PCM===
* '''Description:''' Instead of Dolby Digital audio, the box may switch to outputting PCM audio or no audio at all.
* '''Remedies:'''
** [[../Programming_the_Remote#Add_A_Dedicated_STB_Mute.2FUnmute|Mute then unmute the box]].
** Turn the box off and on.
** If HDMI output ceases Dolby Digital output (641''x''-PIII or 341''x'' boxes), try the optical or coaxial digital outputs.

===The box may freeze while recording or buffering analog channels===
*Keep it tuned to digital channels (bug should be fixed as of firmware 9.15 and newer)

===The picture and/or sound may freeze or stutter, particularly on HD channels===
* '''Cause:''' The incoming signal strength may be too weak.
* '''Remedies:'''
** [[../Configuration#How To Check Your Incoming Signal Strength|Check your incoming signal strength]]
** Reduce to a necessary minimum the number of splitters used on the cable line. Each split reduces the signal power.
** Install a signal booster, i.e, a Motorola 484095-001-00 Signal Booster Broadband Drop Amplifier
** Perform a [[../Resets#DVR Authorization and Factory Full Reset|DVR Authorization and Factory Full Reset]]
* '''Cause:''' If using the HDMI output on a 641''x'' or 341''x'' STB with [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_16.20|Firmware 16.20]] or later, there are often issues related to the [[../Setup#Additional_HDMI_Settings|HDMI/DVI OUTPUT MODE]].
* '''Remedies:''' 
** If using an HDMI-&gt;DVI adapter/cord, ensure the [[../Setup#Additional_HDMI_Settings|HDMI/DVI OUTPUT MODE]] is set to DVI. If it is, switch the OUTPUT MODE to &quot;HDMI&quot; then back to &quot;DVI&quot;. You can leave the OUTPUT MODE set to &quot;HDMI&quot;, but you may encounter [[../Bugs#When_turning_the_box_on.2C_it_may_not_display_a_picture.2C_the_picture_may_be_solid_green.2C_a_blue_box_may_appear_displaying_an_HDCP_error.2C_or_multiple_images_may_appear_on_HD_channels|HDCP errors]].
** If using a pure HDMI connection, ensure the [[../Setup#Additional_HDMI_Settings|HDMI/DVI OUTPUT MODE]] is set to &quot;HDMI&quot;. If it is, switch the OUTPUT MODE to &quot;DVI&quot; then back to &quot;HDMI&quot;. You can leave the OUTPUT MODE set to &quot;DVI&quot;, but you may encounter [[../Bugs#When_turning_the_box_on.2C_it_may_not_display_a_picture.2C_the_picture_may_be_solid_green.2C_a_blue_box_may_appear_displaying_an_HDCP_error.2C_or_multiple_images_may_appear_on_HD_channels|HDCP errors]].
** Replace the STB with a different box.

===When watching a recorded program, there are audio dropouts or digital video artifacts===
* '''Description:''' When watching a recorded or buffered program, every couple of minutes the audio will go dead for a moment, or a streak of pixels will blur across some part of the screen. Viewing live TV seems to be OK.
* '''Cause:''' Firmware may have been upgraded to [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_16.20|version 16.20]]. [[../Firmware_and_Software#How_To_Check_Your_Firmware_and_Software_Versions_.28i-Guide.29|Check your firmware version]].
* '''Remedies:''' 
** Perform a [[../Resets#DVR Authorization and Factory Full Reset|DVR Authorization and Factory Full Reset]] to re-download and install the firmware and software.

===When turning the box on, it may not display a picture or sound. Changing channels has no effect===
* '''Cause:''' The problem ''may'' be caused by a bug with scheduled recordings. The problem may occur when the box has shut itself off following a scheduled recording.  
* '''Remedies:'''
** Don't turn off the box
** Play a recorded program for a moment, then return to live programming
** Reboot the box (unplug power for a minute)
* '''Note:''' As of January 22, 2006 this bug persists in the current revision of firmware (9.19 for PI/PII boxes)  This problem also persists on PIII boxes.

===When turning the box on while using a digital video connection, the picture may not be visible or correct===
* '''Cause:''' If you are using DVI or HDMI output, it may be because a proper [[w:HDCP|HDCP]] handshake did not take place to allow the box to output the video to the TV. In this case, the DVI would display video for about 5 seconds then go blank or green. Occasionally, it may display video and put a big blue box saying there is an HDCP error (seen using a Sharp LC-45GD7U TV). On a Samsung TX-R2779H with a PII box and a DVI-to-HDMI cable, this led to multiple side-by-side images when watching a HD channel thru either DVI or component outputs.

* '''Remedies:'''
** [[../Configuration#How To Check If HDCP is Enabled|Check to see if HDCP is enabled]] (obviously, while using component or other non-digital output). 
** If using [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_16.20|Firmware 16.20]] or later, [[../Setup#Additional_HDMI_Settings|check to see if the HDMI/DVI OUTPUT MODE is set properly]].
** This user (Doug) doesn't remember the exact sequence of events used to fix the problem, but it consisted of doing these things in a particular order after powering off the TV, the STB (fully powered off, as in unplug the power cord), and disconnecting the DVI cable:
*** Plug in STB
*** Turn on TV
*** Connect DVI cable
*** Power on STB
*** '''''Note:''''' After a few tries of various combinations, I got the DVI to work fine and the status display showed HDCP was enabled.
** If you constantly have HDCP handshake issues between a PI/PII box and an HDMI display thru a DVI-to-HDMI cable or adapter, replace them with a PIII box and a pure HDMI connection.  On the Samsung above, this not only resolved the issue, but also improved analog picture quality and added digital sound. (Many cable companies in the United States will &quot;swap out&quot; leased PI/PII boxes for PIII boxes, if available, at their local offices for no charge.)

* '''Cause:''' The Motorola STBs with certain firmware revisions are [http://www.ianbell.com/2007/04/04/rip-hdmi-misadventures-with-shaw-motorola-pvrs-and-hdcp/| known to have issues] with HDMI/DVI repeaters, including most home theater receivers.

* '''Remedy:''' None. Motorola fixed the HDCP handshake to allow repeaters as of [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_12.35|Firmware 12.35]].

===The DVI or HDMI output works intermittently or not at all===
* '''Description:''' The DVI/HDMI connection can briefly show a picture, then revert to &quot;high definition static&quot; for about 3 seconds, and then repeat the sequence indefinitely. The connection also may not work at all.
* '''Causes:'''
**Firmware may have been upgraded to version 16.20. &lt;br&gt;[[../Firmware_and_Software#How_To_Check_Your_Firmware_and_Software_Versions_.28i-Guide.29|How to check your firmware version]].&lt;/br&gt;
**Improper settings.
* '''Remedies:'''
** Use the component video connection as a workaround. A firmware upgrade will be required to resolve the issue.  If using an HDMI to DVI converter, you may need to enter the HDMI advanced settings, and change the color space to RGB in HDMI mode or set it directly to DVI mode.
** The Phase II Motorola box running version 16.20 of firmware has a DVI connection that will often work with non-HDCP TVs (as confirmed by numerous users) - however the phase II DVI connection will ''NOT'' work with many HDCP TVs/LCDs (a specific example is the Sceptre x22wg-Gamer LCD monitor).  For those monitors/tvs that do not have component inputs (like the sceptre x22wg-Gamer), the only current workaround is to freely exchange your phase II box for a phase III box at the local cable center - as the HDMI connection on the Phase III hosts with 16.20 firmware works - at least when running in 720p with a HDMI&lt;-&gt;DVI cable to a sceptre x22wg-gamer LCD monitor (obviously the menu choice has to have HDMI selected instead of DVI).
** Try unplugging the HDMI cable and plugging it back in while both the display and box remain powered on.
** You have to do this viewing through the HDMI.  This works specific to each port that you view through.  Bear with it while it flashes on and off.  Turn off the power to the digital box, then select menu. The first setting should be set to 1080i.  Go to additional HDMI settings and select.  If it is set to DVI, change to HDMI.

===Picture but no sound (&quot;MUTE&quot; may be superimposed over the top-center of picture in small white letters)===
* '''Cause:''' Box turned itself on for a scheduled recording but muted its audio in case TV or HT audio was left on.
* '''Remedies:''' 
** As of [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_74.53-3321|S/W 74.53-3321]], pressing any button but &quot;Mute&quot; or a volume button will unmute the box.
** &quot;MUTE&quot; is also not displayed continually, so it may not be seen when turning on your TV. On TV's with large overscan values, &quot;MUTE&quot; may not be visible.
** The audio may not automatically unmute when pressing any other key if the box was tuned to an unauthorized channel before being turned off.

==Remedies==
* [[../Programming_the_Remote#Add_A_Dedicated_STB_Mute.2FUnmute|Map a remote button to unmute the box]].
* Interrupt the recording and turn off the box.
* [[../Programming_the_Remote#Setting_Global_Volume_Lock|Disable &quot;global volume lock&quot;, then press the &quot;Cable&quot; button to switch the remote to that mode, then adjust the volume up or down, or press &quot;mute&quot;.]]

===Box turns off by itself===
* '''Cause:''' Viewing began after box had turned itself on for a scheduled recording. Recording concluded.
* '''Remedy:''' (Never turn the DVR off)
* '''Note:''' As of [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_74.53-3321|S/W 74.53-3321]], pressing any key on the box or remote will cancel the shutoff and unmute the audio.

* Also- Can be caused by box overheating. Suggested remedy for an overheating issue is to isolate box on its own shelf, not vertically stacked with any other device above or below(like heat generating dvd players/surround sound amps) or a can of compressed air to get the dust out(please do so only when box is at room temperature)

===Box changes channels by itself===
* '''Description:''' Usually late in the night/early morning, the box suddenly changes the channel while viewing a program. This can occur while watching live TV or a recorded program. The channel may consistently change to a channel carrying an Emergency Alert System message. The LED display on the DVR may display &quot;EAS&quot;. After a few minutes, the channel is changed back to the previous one. 
* '''Cause:''' The channel is changed by the cable provider in order to provide an [[w:Emergency Alert System|Emergency Alert System]] message or test.
* '''Remedy:''' Unplug the DVR then plug it back in.

===Brief flashes of green every few seconds or minutes===
* '''Cause:''' Both tuners are on analog channels.
* '''Remedy:''' Change one of the tuners to a digital channel.
* '''Notes:''' Issue appears on all digital system as well, so there might be multiple causes.

===There is a recording with a blank title and a date of 12/31/1989===
* '''Cause:''' Power was lost or the box was rebooted while recording. Some other issues may also cause it.
** This appears to have been fixed as of [[../Firmware and Software#Version 16.20|Firmware version 16.20]].
* '''Cautions:''' Do '''NOT''' attempt to play or delete any 12/31/1989 recording. Doing so may cause the box to lock up and/or corrupt existing recordings!!
* '''Remedies:'''
** Try rebooting the box. Turn it off, wait a minute, unplug from power for a minute, then plug it in. Wait one minute before trying to turn it on. Sometimes, this may clear it up or make it appear as a regular recording.
** Try rebooting as above, but start a recording first, unplugging while it's recording.
** You can perform a [[../Resets#DVR_HDD_Reset|DVR HDD reset]] to wipe out ALL recordings and scheduled recordings.

===Picture appears split, shifted, garbled or &quot;doubled&quot;, sometimes with a bar down the center===
* '''Remedy:''' Press the Guide button to bring up the i-Guide overlay. The display should now look normal. Press Exit to exit the i-Guide.

===In the series priority list, there are duplicate numbers, missing numbers or problems moving entries===
* '''Cause:''' Most likely caused by not using the CONFIRM icon (checkmark) after every change. NEVER exit out of the series priority list without using CONFIRM unless you made no changes.
* '''Remedies:'''
** Power your DVR off, then power cycle the box by unplugging the power cord for a few seconds.  This will result in the temporary loss of all guide data, but shouldn't cause you to lose any recordings already stored on the DVR or info regarding shows that you have previously programmed the DVR to record, series or otherwise.
** Write down all your series. Begin deleting programs from the end of the list, up until the first problem number. Remember to hit CONFIRM after EVERY change. This will require having to go back into the menu each time. Once you are back to a clean list, try adding in new programs. Double-check the list to see if the numbers are all correct. If not, you will need to delete ALL the programs from the list and start over.
** If the channel numbers for your scheduled recordings are all set to non-existent channels, you may have to perform [[../Resets#DVR Authorization and Factory Full Reset|DVR Authorization and Factory Full Reset]] after deleting your scheduled recordings, and before adding them again. This bug occurred under [[../Firmware and Software#Version 16.20|F/W 16.20]].
** If the above still doesn't work, consider a [[../Resets#DVR_HDD_Reset|DVR HDD RESET]]. Remember to write down any non-series recordings so you can add them back in as the reset will erase ALL recordings, both recorded and scheduled.

===When I turn the DVR off, the Record light turns on, but there is no recording going on===
* '''Cause:''' RF Bypass is turned on. The Record light used to be the A/B light, and the software can turn it on for the wrong reason.
* '''Remedy:'''
** Go to the main menu (press MENU twice)
** Scroll down to ''Setup'' and press OK/Select
** Scroll down to ''Cable Box Setup'' and press OK/Select
** Scroll down to ''RF Bypass'' and use Left or Right to change it to OFF, then press OK/Select

===The DVR menu erroneously states the DVR hard drive is 100% full===
* '''Description:''' The DVR menu may show the DVR HDD is 100% full when it is not. A notice may appear stating the DVR is 100% full, and that new recordings and live TV buffering will not be possible until some space is freed up. As of [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_16.35|Firmware 16.35]], the error message may read:
:&quot;'''YOUR RECORDING SPACE IS FULL'''
:You must delete one or more recordings to continue to use your DVR. Current recordings have stopped and you may not be able to Pause or REW live TV. To prevent this in the future, set your recording settings with 'Save until space is needed.'&quot;
* '''Cause:''' Unknown. Arrived with [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_16.20|Firmware 16.20]]. Multiple reports of Firmware 12.35 having this issue as well.  On a DCH-3416 with Firmware 18.20, this occurred when trying to extend the record time of a one-time recording while it was in progress.
* '''Remedies:''' 
** Reboot the box: Unplug the power cord for 30 seconds, plug it back in, and wait for the Guide data and features to be restored.  
** Delete a recorded program (any recording will do). Try keeping several 1 minute recordings that can be deleted.
** Perform a [[../Resets#DVR_Authorization_and_Factory_Full_Reset|DVR Authorization and Factory Full Reset]] to re-install the firmware and software.
* '''Notes:''' 
** One user has seen the bug continue to reappear after rebooting and deleting recordings, but has not seen the bug resurface since performing the full reset. This may indicate the bug is related to a bad software/firmware installation.
** This bug may be related to incomplete HDD defragmentation.
** Shaw support advised that leaving the box off when not in use may stop the problem from occurring
*** For one user: Problem appeared only when box was turned off when not in use.  Not seen since box has been left &quot;always on&quot;.
*** For another user: Problem has been persistent since [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_16.20|Firmware 16.20]], even with the box always on.
** This bug may be related to recordings configured to ''Save Until '''I Delete''' ''. Changing the option to ''Save Until '''Space is needed''' '' may help, however, one user repeatedly received this error even with several recordings set to delete when 'space is needed'.
**  The DVR may seem to have much more channel buffer than usual (having the ability to go back several hours via rewind, so it may be filling the drive with temporary storage). One may try changing the channel to clear the buffer.
** One clear case of this bug involved attempting to record an already finished program within the channel buffer via rewinding back to the finished program and pressing the RECORD button. The bug's effects remained until a saved program was deleted.

===The DVR stops responding to the remote for several seconds===
* '''Notes:'''
** The program or recording will play fine without stutter.
** When you try to use the remote, the DVR will appear to ignore you. The remote response light (lower right of LED display) may turn on solid. There may be a pause of up to 30-60 seconds. Then, the DVR will respond to all the buttons you have pressed.
* '''Causes:'''
** Seems to be worse while Guide data is being downloaded.
** Known to be caused when unit is overheating- when near critical shutoff temp, processing is sluggish.
** Appears to be related to memory [[w:Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] or re-allocation.
** After freezing, some of the Guide data for the second week may be missing information (titles and descriptions).
** It is due to the 'transport bar' and an overloaded CPU. The transport bar is the bar you see on-screen showing the time into the program. Even when not on-screen, it keeps track of information. A fix may be out in February 2008.
* '''Remedy:''' A [[../Resets#DVR_Authorization_and_Factory_Full_Reset|DVR Authorization and Factory Full Reset]] may help for a short time, but it usually gets worse over time.
* '''Remedy:''' Remove SlingBox device from your setup if you use one.  Power set top box off to force a device reset.  Problem cleared immediately and has not resurfaced.

===On some display screens, you only see a corner of the video instead of it being scaled to fit===
* '''Note:''' On many of the screens where the video is supposed to be scaled down into the upper-right corner, you instead may only see a corner of the full video.
* '''Cause:''' The text in the overlay may be too far to the right.
* '''Remedy:'''
** Go to the main menu (press MENU twice)
** Scroll down to ''Setup'' or ''Cable Box Setup'' and press OK/Select.
** Go to ''Screen Position Setup''
** Press the left arrow once or twice, then press OK/Select.
** If the video still doesn't resize, repeat moving to the left.

===Recorded programs and scheduled recordings missing after a power outage or reboot===
* '''Cause:''' Possibly due to more rigorous checking on bootup to prevent the [[#There is a recording with a blank title and a date of 12/31/1989|12/31/89]] bug. If unrepairable corruption is detected, the firmware will reformat the drive, similar to a [[../Resets#DVR_HDD_Reset|DVR HDD RESET]].

===Audio is muted after starting or stopping a recording===
* '''Description:''' When you stop playing a recording, or begin to play one, the audio may remain muted.
* '''Cause:''' A bug introduced in [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version 78.44 - A28p0-2.0908.r4|software version A28]] and/or related firmware.
* '''Remedy:''' Press Pause, wait for the picture to stop, then hit PLAY. For live TV, you can use LIVE instead of PLAY.
* '''Remedy:''' Fixed in [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version 78.53 - A28p0-4.1005.r-8|software version A28 maintenance release]].

===Infobar pops up while watching a recording===
* '''Description:''' If you are tuned to an SD channel, and an HD program is beginning, the infobar will pop up telling you the program is available in HD, even if you are watching a recording.
* '''Cause:''' A new feature of [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version 78.44 - A28p0-2.0908.r4|software version A28]] that doesn't distinguish between viewing live TV or a recording.
* '''Remedy:''' Fixed in [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version 78.53 - A28p0-4.1005.r-8|software version A28 maintenance release]].

===Weekly manual recording stops at midnight===
* '''Description:''' If you have VCR-style manual recording that crosses midnight, and it's set to repeat weekly, the recording will stop at midnight. The option to add extra time to the end of the recording will not work and may cause a second short recording that is only a few seconds long.
* '''Cause:''' A bug introduced in [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version 78.44 - A28p0-2.0908.r4|software version A28]] and/or related firmware.
* '''Remedy:''' Create one recording that ends at midnight, and another that begins at midnight.

===After viewing program info, guide returns to first favorite===
* '''Description:''' If you are viewing the guide in the mode that only displays your favorites (heart icon), and view the detailed information on a program, the guide will reset to the first channel in your list, and the time to the current time.
* '''Cause:''' A bug introduced in [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version 78.44 - A28p0-2.0908.r4|software version A28]] and/or related firmware.
* '''Remedy:''' Fixed in [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version 78.53 - A28p0-4.1005.r-8|software version A28 maintenance release]].

===You cannot have more than 241 favorites===
* '''Description:''' You are unable to add favorite channels once the total reaches 241. Splitting into different favorites lists does not help.
* '''Cause:''' A bug introduced in [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version 78.44 - A28p0-2.0908.r4|software version A28]] and/or related firmware.
* '''Remedy:''' None.

===Series recording does not work right, especially for non-network daily shows===
* '''Cause:''' The guide data being sent to the box does not contain the '''New''' or '''Repeat''' flags. Also, the box doesn't remember what it's recorded after you delete it (unlike [[w:TiVo|TiVo]]).
* '''Remedy:''' Either let it record shows you don't want or do manual recordings. As of mid-2007, this seems to be improving (very slowly) as the quality of the guide data improves. [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version 78.44 - A28p0-2.0908.r4|Software version A28]] has added a 28 day DVR history to minimize duplicate recordings.

===The DVR records in SD when you've set it to an HD channel===
* '''Cause:''' If your HD and SD broadcast network channels share the same name in the guide listing, the DVR will record the lower channel number, which is usually the SD version. The cable companies could easily and immediately fix it by adding -DT to the HD channel in locations where it's not working right.
* '''Remedy:''' None

===Some channels can't be rewound or fast forwarded or have other problems with recording===
* '''Cause:''' Apparently some channels do not have marker frames, complete frames embedded in the digital stream. Instead, they encode the information which re-draws a new frame in multiple frames. The fast forward works on these marker frames and doesn't work for those channels.
* '''Remedy:''' There is apparently a software update the cable companies can get at the local office that will fix this. Not all locations appear to have this problem, but BBC America and the digital Discovery channels seem to have this problem.

===Simultaneous series recording cancellation problem, aka ''whack-a-mole''===
* '''Description''' If you have two Series recordings scheduled at the same time (i.e. two events of separate full-season recordings at once), and you want to cancel them, it will let you cancel one OR the other, but not both.  I.e. if you cancel show #1 @ 8pm it shows up as 'Negated' as soon as you say   'Don't record this episode'. But if you attempt to cancel show #2 also @ 8pm, that works... but then show #1 shows up as to-be-recorded again.
* '''Remedy:''' If you cancel the recordings by going though the standard guide instead of the DVR scheduled recordings listing, it should allow you to cancel both recordings. Use one of the following methods to find the scheduled recordings in the IPG:
** Press the MyDVR button, select Scheduled Recordings, highlight one of the recordings you want to cancel, then press the GUIDE button.
** While watching TV, press the GUIDE button, then scroll to the scheduled recording.
** Press the MENU button twice, select 'TV listings by channel', then scroll to the scheduled recording.
** Note: This remedy does not appear to work on [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_74.53-3321|iGuide 74.53-3321]].''
** Note: Appears to be fixed as of [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version 80.47-a30.1205.r-25|iGuide A30]].'' You can simply cancel an episode as normal.

===Box locks up between 4:20 and 4:50 AM or PM===
* '''Cause:''' Most likely involves a series recording configured to add extra time to the beginning or end.
* '''Remedies:'''
** Go through your series recordings, or through the Series Priority List. On each, choose to modify (wrench icon), then also go to 'View all Options' (also a wrench icon). Change both 'Start Recording' and 'End Recording' to 'On Time'.
** Delete all of your series recordings from the Series Priority List, then recreate them.
** Use [[../Resets#DVR_HDD_Reset|DVR HDD RESET]] to wipe everything and start from scratch.

* Cause: This was caused by an iGuide purge and a rebuild of data.

===&quot;To Be Announced&quot; displayed instead of program information when the Info button is pressed===
* '''Cause:''' Unknown. It may be related to using the time-shifting functions of the DVR (after having paused or rewound the program).
**'''''Note:''' If you press the Guide button to display the full [[w:EPG|IPG]], and &quot;To Be Announced&quot; is displayed instead of the program information, then it is due to your guide data still being downloaded (i.e., after power has been disconnected from the STB). The  bug discussed here affects the guide data when viewed with the Info button.''
* '''Remedies:'''
** Press OK/SELECT to display the mini-guide. The program information should display correctly in the mini-guide, and the Info button can be used to view the program information. Press Exit to exit the mini-guide. Pressing Info may now display the correct information for the program.
** Press Guide to display the full IPG. The program information should display correctly in the IPG, and the Info button can be used to view the program information. Press Exit to exit the IPG. Pressing Info may now display the correct information for the program.

===Program guide listings for the second week have few descriptions, many are listed as &quot;To Be Announced&quot;===
* '''Cause:''' Unknown. Best speculation is a lack of available memory. Second week programs that are duplicates of first week programs will be complete. The second week descriptions will be the first to go when memory needs to be reallocated for something else. Once all of that is freed up, second week program titles will be removed. The data may be visible while the data is being downloaded, but will disappear as memory is rearranged. This is related to: [[../Bugs#The DVR stops responding to the remote for several seconds|The DVR stops responding to the remote for several seconds]].
* '''Remedy:''' None

===The DVR records endlessly until all space is full===
*'''Cause:''' The following conditions, in combination, are known to cause this issue:
** A series recording exists for a program.
** The DVR automatically scheduled a recording for the program but the recording was manually set not to record.
** The same program was manually scheduled to record later. This recording will not end at the scheduled time, but continue to record until all HDD space is consumed.
*'''Remedies:''' Don't allow the conditions to occur by taking one of the following steps:
** Don't manually set the earlier recording not to record.
** Place another series recording at the earlier time slot and at a higher priority, so it is automatically recorded at the earlier time, while the other program is automatically recorded later.

===The DVR randomly records shows on a channel where a scheduled series recording for a program that no longer is on the air and deletion of said program from series recording fails.===
*'''Cause:''' Unknown, Shows up in firmware 16.35 on DCT-6412 PII and DCT-6416 PIII:
** This is only confirmed in one case on 2 separate boxes models.
** Insight refuses to upgrade firmware past 16.35 so Comcast customers may not have noticed or reported bug and it may have been fixed with newer firmware versions.
*'''Remedies:'''
** HDD Reset to clear recorded programs and saved information.
** Have Insight (or other cable company) replace the box.

&lt;b&gt;Warning!&lt;/b&gt;
The reset information below should only be done at your own risk!! In some cases, it could disable your DVR or cable features, requiring a service call or replacement. It's even possible you could be fined if the DVR is damaged.

==DVR HDD Reset==

This will wipe out all of your recordings, all scheduled recordings, all series recordings (your series priority list), and all manual recordings!! Write down everything you can before you do this!'''

# While the DVR is on, push power to turn it off (by pressing CABLE, POWER on your remote control) or by pushing power on your set top box.
# Immediately press OK on your remote or SELECT on your set top box. Push it twice. A diagnostics page -- black text on white background -- will appear on your television screen (make sure television is on).
# While on this screen, perform the following key sequence with your remote: 
:::Press the circular counter-clockwise arrow (REPLAY on some remotes) 2 times
:::Press the MyDVR (LIST on some remotes) button 3 times
:::Press the live button 2 times
# &quot;Clr&quot; will appear on the LED display. 
# Press OK/SELECT to proceed with the reset. The STB should now reformat the hard drive and then perform a STB reset and begin to reload your cable settings and time settings from the head end. It will then begin to populate the guide data over the next two to 24 hours.

(On some systems, the button press pattern may be 1-3-1, not 2-3-2 as above. This is true for all the STB's for Shaw Cable. For the DCH3416, the pattern is 1-3-2.)

==DVR Authorization and Factory Full Reset==

'''''WARNING'': This will download and reinstall the DVR firmware and software. This should not erase your user settings or delete your stored recordings on the DVR. This is not guaranteed, proceed at your own risk.

# Unplug the power cord from the DVR.
# On the front of the DVR, press &amp; hold the POWER &amp; MENU buttons while plugging the power cord back into the DVR. The display should now read &quot;boot&quot;.
# Release the POWER &amp; MENU buttons.
# Press the UP or DOWN ARROW buttons on the DVR (not the remote) until you see &quot;n dl&quot; on the display.
# Press the OK/SELECT on the DVR to begin authorization &amp; downloading of software, STB/DVR firmware from your cable [[w:cable television headend|headend]]. It could take up to 20 minutes to download the firmware, the software could take up to 2 hours depending on what software your cable provider has. You should see &quot;n dl&quot; in the [[w:LED|LED]] display with a line moving in a square.
# After it completes this download the DVR will then reboot and begin to download the time settings for the clock along with your cable account info and settings. After this is done, it will begin to populate the Guide info. It could take up to 24 hours to fill in all 2 weeks of information   . Depending on your location, environmental variables and amount of users with digital cable or cable Internet, the download can take up to twice as long.
#If the display on your Motorola DVR displays only the number 0 after performing this process, it is in need of a reset by your cable provider.  Call them and ask them to reset your box.  

===Supported Models===
* This procedure is not confirmed to work on the newer DCH-series and DCX-series DVRs.
* It is confirmed to be working on Insight and Cox Communications model 6416 III, Cox Communications model DCT3416 I, and Comcast Cable model 3412 I.

==Remote Control Resets==

Information on resetting the remote control can be found at [[../Programming the Remote#Resets|Programming the Remote\Resets]]

==Transferring Recorded or Live Programs to a Computer==

The cable companies have not disabled the firewire output on the 6412 -- it was only intended to be used for connecting to [[w:D-VHS|D-VHS]] recorders.  In the United States, the federal government ([[w:FCC|FCC]]) has ruled that the firewire output must be enabled. As a result, the firewire output will NOT display any [[w:EPG|IPG]] or DVR menus.  This is the normal, expected behavior.

One can emulate a D-VHS recorder on a PC or Mac through various software programs. Note that a computer will not be able to emulate the copy protection scheme of a D-VHS recorder if [[w:DTCP|5C DTCP]] is enabled (on a per-channel or per-program basis). These resources have instructions:

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==

Hebrew uses      a right-to-left abjad system. The Hebrew alphabet consists of twenty-two letters and five final letters, and is derived from the [[w:Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic alphabet]], which in its turn came from the [[w:Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician alphabet]], the source of most writing systems known today. In Hebrew (and other Semitic) writing, most vowels are optionally written as '''diacritics'''. 

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|diacritic|a mark added to a letter to change the way it is pronounced.}}

==How many people speak this language?==
Approximately 10 million people speak Hebrew. About 7 million of them live in Israel.

==Where is this language spoken?==
Modern Hebrew is spoken by many people all over the world and is the main language of Israel where it is the official language. Other countries with significant Hebrew speaking populations include 
[[Wikijunior:South America/Argentina|Argentina]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Belgium|Belgium]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Netherlands|The Netherlands]], [[Wikijunior:South America/Brazil|Brazil]], [[Wikijunior:South America/Chile|Chile]], Canada, [[Wikijunior:Europe/France|France]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Germany|Germany]], Iran, [[Wikijunior:Europe/Russia|Russia]], Panama, United States and [[Wikijunior:South America/Uruguay|Uruguay]].

==What is the history of this language?==
Hebrew is a very old language with ancestral links to Aramaic and Arabic. It was the language used to write most of the Jewish Bible, and was spoken in the Middle East. Hebrew stopped being a spoken everyday language when it was replaced by Aramaic, but continued to be used in the reading of the Jewish Bible texts and prayers. By the modern period, Hebrew had ceased to be the mother tongue of the Jewish people because many Jews had left Israel for other countries in the Middle East and Europe and had adopted the languages of their new countries. In Germany, Yiddish, a language based on German but mixed with many Hebrew, Russian and Polish words, arose and became popular. Judeo-Arabic also arose among some Jewish communities in the Middle East and North Africa, although many Jews in these lands, including those still living in the Land of Israel, used Arabic exclusively.  Hebrew remained exclusively the language for religious purposes until it was revived by Eliezer ben-Yehuda at the beginning of the 20th century. Ben-Yehuda began to compile a dictionary which still bears his name today. His children grew up tutored by their father and became the first native speakers of the Hebrew language in the modern period. 

Modern Hebrew, like ancient Hebrew, is written without vowels. Written Hebrew vowel symbols were invented by a group of Hebrew scholars named the Massoretes, who lived around Tiberias at the Sea of Galilee during the 10th century CE. The square script, familiar in modern Hebrew, also grew from this 10th century CE period. Hebrew script has evolved through the centuries, from the paleo script to the Qumran distinctive script to cursive script and finally to the modern square script.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
The most famous text in the world, the Bible, was written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. Many religious believers believe that the Bible was inspired directly by God, so they would say that God is a very famous author in Hebrew. Another famous author in Hebrew is the Nobel Prize laureate S. Y. Agnon (pronounced Shay Agnon). Among the currently popular writers in Hebrew are Amos Oz, Etgar Keret, Zeruya Shalev and also David Grossman, who writes books for adults and for children.

'''Rødkål''' - Red Cabbage

== Ingredients ==
* 1/4 cup (60ml) butter
* 5 lbs (2350g) red cabbage, finely cut
* ½ cup (120ml) vinegar
* ½ cup (120ml) sugar
* 1 Tablesp. salt

== Procedure ==
# Brown butter lightly. 
# Add finely cut cabbage and stir well. 
# Add vinegar, sugar and salt. 
# Let simmer 2-3 hours. 

To reduce cabbage odour, bring the mixture to a boil, then place in a 325°F/160°C oven in a covered container for two hours. The flavor is even better when it is reheated.

A delicious chocolate cake recipe.

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Atomicfudge1.JPG|thumb|Atomic Fudge Cake]]
*2 cups (470 ml) [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
*1 ¾ cup (415 ml) [[cookbook:flour|flour]]
*1 ¾ cups (415 ml) baking [[cookbook:cocoa|cocoa]]
*1 ½ teaspoon (7 ml) [[cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*1 ½ teaspoon (7 ml) [[cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1 teaspoon [[cookbook:salt|salt]] (5ml)
*2 [[cookbook:egg|eggs]]
*1 cup(235 ml) [[cookbook:milk|milk]]
*½ cup (120 ml) [[cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
*2 teaspoons (10 ml) [[cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]]
*1 cup (235 ml)boiling [[cookbook:water|water]]

== Procedure ==
#Mix the dry ingredients well in a large bowl. For better texture, sift them together.
#Add the eggs, milk, vanilla and vegetable oil and mix well. Then add the water. Mix it until it has a lot of little bubbles. This batter will be very thin.
#Pour into two greased 9 inch round baking pans
#[[cookbook:Bake|Bake]] in a preheated oven at 350 °F (175 °C) for thirty minutes. (About 20 minutes for a convection oven)

== Frosting/filling ==
[[Image:Atomicfudge2.JPG|thumb|right|Atomic Fudge Cake]]
Note: this should only be done after the cake has cooled and is ready for frosting.
*1/8th cup (30 ml) [[cookbook:cocoa|cocoa]]
*7 oz (200 g) [[cookbook:Dark chocolate|dark chocolate]]
*1/8th cup (30 ml) boiling [[cookbook:water|water]]
*1/16th cup (15 ml) [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]] or [[cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]]
*2/3rds cup (156 ml) [[cookbook:Cream|whipping cream]]

A hot fudge sauce to go over top of the cake is a nice extra touch.

warning: don't try and substitute baker's chocolate for the dark chocolate. The huge amount of sugar you'd have to add would be a pain, especially if using the powdered sugar, and if you use regular sugar, it gets grainy and crunchy. Also, to make things more interesting, spices such as [[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]] can be added, if so desired.

#Melt the chocolate by placing it in a small bowl or pot and placing that in boiling water.
#Mix the sugar and cocoa together in a small bowl and mix in the water. 
#Stir the sugar/cocoa/water mix into the melted chocolate
#quickly stir in the cream and mix until it has a nice smooth consistency.
#Immediately 'frost' the cake with this, and make sure that there is quite a bit between the two layers of cake. The cake will need to be refrigerated to harden the fudge, so don't worry about its relatively liquid nature.
#Refrigerate Cake

This cake is meant to be served warm - that is, after being refrigerated. So, slice a piece and microwave it for about 20 seconds. It is heavenly as the fudge melts and soaks into the cake. Serve with ice cream if you so desire.
One final note: a higher quality of chocolate and baking cocoa will make a HUGE difference in this cake. It is very worth the extra expense.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Userboxes ==

Let me give you a hint about userboxes. If you cannot find the userboxes you want, you can use this on your user page [[Template:Userbox]]:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Template:Userbox|Userbox]]&lt;nowiki&gt;|#ddddff|#ffdddd|[[Image:Flag of the United States.svg|40px]]|This user lives in the [[US History|United States]].}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

{{Userbox|#ddddff|#ffdddd|[[Image:Flag of the United States.svg|40px]]|This user lives in the [[US History|United States]].}}
It makes this userbox, which I use on my [[User:Kernigh]] page. This saves me the effort of creating some separate &quot;userbox usa&quot; template. You can also copy userbox templates from other wikis, such as the [[Wikipedia:Main Page|English Wikipedia]]. For example, [[Template:User admin]] is a userbox copied from Wikipedia. If you copy any userbox templates, you might want to add them to [[Wikibooks:Template messages/User namespace]]. Thanks, --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:58, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Writing functions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ruby Programming/TopNav|prev=Introduction to objects|next=Data types}}

As with the rest of this tutorial, we assume some basic familiarity with programming language concepts (i.e. if statement, while loops) and also some basic understanding of [[w:Object_oriented_programming|object-oriented programming]].

= Dealing with variables =

We'll deal with variables in much more depth when we talk about classes and objects.  For now, let's just say your basic local variable names should start with either a lower case letter or an underscore, and should contain upper or lower case letters, numbers, and underscore characters.  Global  variables start with a &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt;.

= Program flow =

Ruby includes a pretty standard set of looping and branching constructs: &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt;

For example, here's &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; in action:

 a = 10 * rand
 
 if a &lt; 5
   puts &quot;#{a} less than 5&quot;
 elsif a &gt; 7
   puts &quot;#{a} greater than 7&quot;
 else
   puts &quot;Cheese sandwich!&quot;
 end

[As in other languages, the &lt;tt&gt;rand&lt;/tt&gt; function generates a random number between 0 and 1&lt;/tt&gt;]

There will be plenty more time to discuss conditional statements in later chapters.  The above example should be pretty clear.

Ruby also includes a negated form of &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; called &lt;tt&gt;unless&lt;/tt&gt; which goes something like

 unless a &gt; 5
   puts &quot;a is less than or equal to 5&quot;
 else
   puts &quot;a is greater than 5&quot;
 end

Generally speaking, Ruby keeps an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement straight as long as the conditional (&lt;tt&gt;if ...&lt;/tt&gt;) and the associated code block are on separate lines. If you have to smash everything together on one line, you'll need to place the &lt;tt&gt;then&lt;/tt&gt; keyword after the conditional

 if a &lt; 5 then puts &quot;#{a} less than 5&quot; end 
 if a &lt; 5 then puts &quot;#{a} less than 5&quot; else puts &quot;#{a} greater than 5&quot; end

Note that the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement is also an expression; its value is the last line of the block executed. Therefore, the line above could also have been written as

 puts(if a &lt; 5 then &quot;#{a} less than 5&quot; else &quot;#{a} greater than 5&quot; end)

Ruby has also adopted the syntax from Perl where &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;unless&lt;/tt&gt; statements can be used as conditional modifiers ''after'' a statement.  For example

 puts &quot;#{a} less than 5&quot; if a &lt; 5
 puts &quot;Cheese sandwich&quot; unless a == 4

&lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; behaves as it does in other languages -- the code block that follows is run zero or more times, as long as the conditional is true

 while a &gt; 5
   a = 10*rand
 end

And like &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt;, there is also a negated version of &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; called &lt;tt&gt;until&lt;/tt&gt; which runs the code block ''until'' the condition is true.

Finally there is the &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt; statement which we'll just include here with a brief example.  &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt; is actually a very powerful super version of the &lt;tt&gt;if ... elsif...&lt;/tt&gt; system

 a = (10*rand).round
 #a = rand(11) would do the same
 
 case a
 when 0..5
   puts &quot;#{a}: Low&quot;
 when 6
   puts &quot;#{a}: Six&quot;
 else
   puts &quot;#{a}: Cheese toast!&quot;
 end

There are some other interesting things going on in this example, but here the &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt; statement is the center of attention.

= Writing functions =

In keeping with Ruby's all-object-oriented-all-the-time design, functions are typically referred to as methods.  No difference.  We'll cover methods in much more detail when we get to objects and classes.  For now, basic method writing looks something like this (save the following code in a file called func1.rb):

 # Demonstrate a method with func1.rb
 def my_function( a )
   puts &quot;Hello, #{a}&quot;
   return a.length
 end
 
 len = my_function( &quot;Giraffe&quot; )
 puts &quot;My secret word is #{len} characters long&quot;

now run the script:

 $ '''func1.rb'''
 Hello, Giraffe
 My secret word is 7 characters long

Methods are defined with the &lt;tt&gt;def&lt;/tt&gt; keyword, followed by the function name.  As with variables, local and class methods should start with a lower case letter.  

In this example, the function takes one argument (&lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;) and returns a value.  Note that the input arguments aren't typed (i.e. &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; need not be a string) ... this allows for great flexibility but can also cause a lot of trouble.  The function also returns a single value with the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.  Technically this isn't necessary -- the value of the last line executed in the function is used as the return value -- but more often than not using &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; explicitly makes things clearer.

As with other languages, &lt;tt&gt;Ruby&lt;/tt&gt; supports both default values for arguments and variable-length argument lists, both of which will be covered in due time.  There's also support for code blocks, as discussed below.

= Blocks =

One very important concept in Ruby is the code block.  It's actually not a particularly revolutionary concept -- any time you've written &lt;tt&gt;if  ... {  ... }&lt;/tt&gt; in C or Perl you've defined a code block, but in Ruby a code block has some hidden secret powers...

Code blocks in Ruby are defined either with the keywords &lt;tt&gt;do..end&lt;/tt&gt; or the curly brackets &lt;tt&gt;{..}&lt;/tt&gt;

 do
   print &quot;I like &quot;
   print &quot;code blocks!&quot;
 end
 
 {
   print &quot;Me too!&quot;
 }

One very powerful usage of code blocks is that methods can take one as a parameter and ''execute'' it along the way.

''[ed note: the Pragmatic Programmers actually want to point out that it's not very useful to describe it this way.  Instead, the block of code behaves like a 'partner' to which the function occasionally hands over control]''

The concept can be hard to get the first time it's explained to you.  Here's an example:

 $ '''irb --simple-prompt'''
 &gt;&gt; '''3.times { puts &quot;Hi!&quot; }'''
 Hi!
 Hi!
 Hi!
 =&gt; 3

Surprise!  You always thought 3 was just a number, but it's actually an object (of type &lt;tt&gt;Fixnum&lt;/tt&gt;)   As it's an object, it has a member function &lt;tt&gt;times&lt;/tt&gt; which takes a block as a parameter.  The function runs the block 3 times. 

Blocks can actually receive parameters, using a special notation &lt;tt&gt;|..|&lt;/tt&gt;.  In this case, a quick check of the documentation for &lt;tt&gt;times&lt;/tt&gt; shows it will pass a single parameter into the block, indicating which loop it's on:

 $ '''irb --simple-prompt'''
 &gt;&gt; '''4.times { |x| puts &quot;Loop number #{x}&quot; }'''
 Loop number 0
 Loop number 1
 Loop number 2
 Loop number 3
 =&gt; 4

The &lt;tt&gt;times&lt;/tt&gt; function passes a number into the block.  The block gets that number in the variable &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; (as set by the &lt;tt&gt;|x|&lt;/tt&gt;), then prints out the result.

Functions interact with blocks through the &lt;tt&gt;yield&lt;/tt&gt;.  Every time the function invokes &lt;tt&gt;yield&lt;/tt&gt; control passes to the block.  It only comes back to the function when the block finishes.  Here's a simple example:

 # Script block2.rb
 
 def simpleFunction
   yield 
   yield
 end
 
 simpleFunction { puts &quot;Hello!&quot; }

 $ '''block2.rb'''
 Hello!
 Hello!

The &lt;tt&gt;simpleFunction&lt;/tt&gt; simply yields to the block twice -- so the block is run twice and we get two times the output.  Here's an example where the function passes a parameter to the block:

 # Script block1.rb
 
 def animals
   yield &quot;Tiger&quot;
   yield &quot;Giraffe&quot;
 end
 
 animals { |x| puts &quot;Hello, #{x}&quot; }

 $ '''block1.rb'''
 Hello, Tiger
 Hello, Giraffe

It might take a couple of reads through to figure out what's going on here.  We've defined the function &quot;animals&quot;  -- it expects a code block.  When executed, the function calls the code block twice, first with the parameter &quot;Tiger&quot; then again with the parameter &quot;Giraffe&quot;.  In this example, we've written a simple code block which just prints out a greeting to the animals.  We could write a different block, for example:

 animals { |x| puts &quot;It's #{x.length} characters long!&quot; }

which would give:

 It's 5 characters long!
 It's 7 characters long!

Two completely different results from running the same function with two different blocks.

There are many powerful uses of blocks.  One of the first you'll come across is the &lt;tt&gt;each&lt;/tt&gt; function for arrays -- it runs a code block once for each element in the array -- it's great for iterating over lists.

= Ruby is really, really object-oriented =

Ruby is very object oriented.  Everything is an object -- even things you might consider constants.  This also means that the vast majority of what you might consider &quot;standard functions&quot; aren't floating around in some library somewhere, but are instead methods of a given variable.  

Here's one example we've already seen:

 3.times { puts &quot;Hi!&quot; }

Even though 3 might seem like just a constant number, it's in fact an instance of the class &lt;tt&gt;Fixnum&lt;/tt&gt; (which inherits from the class &lt;tt&gt;Numeric&lt;/tt&gt; which inherits from the class &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;).  The method &lt;tt&gt;times&lt;/tt&gt; comes from &lt;tt&gt;Fixnum&lt;/tt&gt; and does just what it claims to do.

Here are some other examples

 $ '''irb --simple-prompt'''
 &gt;&gt; '''3.abs'''
 =&gt; 3
 &gt;&gt; '''-3.abs'''
 =&gt; 3
 &gt;&gt; '''&quot;giraffe&quot;.length'''
 =&gt; 7
 &gt;&gt; '''a = &quot;giraffe&quot;'''
 =&gt; &quot;giraffe&quot;
 &gt;&gt; '''a.reverse'''
 =&gt; &quot;effarig&quot;

There will be lots of time to consider how object-oriented design filters through Ruby in the coming chapters.</text>

I noticed your new book, '''[[How to use a Motorola DVR]]'''. Because Wikipedia is not in the public domain, we need to credit Wikipedia when we copy from there, so I added a credit. (Wikipedia and Wikibooks both use the [[GNU Free Documentation License]].)

So far, you are doing a good job. Your book is split into multiple pages, and it is clear that you are expanding the Wikipedia article into a book. If you had just copied a Wikipedia article (complete with red links and bad template calls), someone might have tried to delete it -- it is against [[WB:WIW|Wikibooks policy]] to have an entire book that is only a Wikipedia article.

There are still a few red links that need to be removed or diverted to Wikipedia or Wiktionary, but other than that, your new book is in good condition. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:23, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some unique piano moving techniques have been developed over the last century that ease the difficult job of moving pianos. This section will instruct you in the basics of these professional piano-moving techniques. But even with this knowledge always remember that actually moving your piano carries with it a tremendous amount of responsibility for the piano movers safety and the piano's condition when you're done moving it. So, before proceeding on to these teachings please be sure to review the section on piano moving warnings.

You somehow erased most of the &quot;MapleStory/Jobs&quot; page. I suggest that you instead play in the '''[[Wikibooks:Sandbox]]''', to learn how everything works.

Please do not remove paragraphs from pages without cause. Thanks, --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:25, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Introduction and Statistics====
The name &quot;Roman Catholicism&quot; denotes the beliefs of those Christians who are in communion with the Pope who, as the successor of St Peter as Bishop of Rome, has primacy among all the bishops. Such Christians may be termed &quot;Roman Catholics&quot; or simply &quot;Catholics&quot;. Historically speaking, the word &quot;Catholic&quot; has always been applied to the Church (it means &quot;universal&quot;) and &quot;Roman&quot; goes before it to emphasise both the primacy of the Pope and continuity with the teachings of Jesus Christ and his apostles.

According to the 2006 ''Annuario Pontificio'', the official yearbook of the Vatican, the membership of the Catholic Church was approximately 1,098,000,000 in 2004. There were 405,891 priests, 32,324 permanent deacons, and 113,044 seminarians when the data was compiled [http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=42515][http://www.cathnews.com/news/602/116.php].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just began work on it--keep adding! [[User:JBogdan|JBogdan]] 03:39, 15 April 2006 (UTC)


==Proposal to make this book no rights reserved==
As the principal editor so far, I propose to make this book no rights reserved. Since several other people have edited it, it will either be necessary to get the other editors' OK's or to not use their additions. Hopefully I can get the OK from the admins. [[User:JBogdan|JBogdan]] 15:47, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

For now, I will just revert the book back to what it was before users other than myself edited it. The edits by the other users ARE good, and will be reverted back once I complete my tasks with the book at the end of the night (unless I manage to write enough that it is not necessary). [[User:JBogdan|JBogdan]] 17:18, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

===JBogdan's correspondence with Whiteknight===

Can I have a more &quot;free&quot; license used for a book, such as by attribution or no rights reserved? Please let me know on my talk page--I could not find how to do it in the policy pages. [[User:JBogdan|JBogdan]] 15:52, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

:All content on wikibooks is licensed under the GFDL. This is expressly stated on the &quot;edit&quot; screen, and clicking the &quot;save page&quot; button shows acceptance of that license. Now, I see that you have specifically used the {{tl|User PD}} template on your user page, so all contributions by you are released into the public domain. However, contributions by other users may not be. I don't think there is any way to expressly state that an entire book will be released under a different license, because the contributions of other editors might not be under other licenses. If you do not like the GDFL for whatever reason, you may be forced to contribute to another website. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:00, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

::Can I set up a template at the top of the page that says the individual book is under a more &quot;free&quot; license? [[User:JBogdan|JBogdan]] 21:35, 20 August 2006 (UTC)


:::You can, if you want, try to make a banner that says your book is to be licensed under a different license. I am not particularly knowledgable in this subject, so you you want to try something like this, I would ask [[User:Robert Horning]], because he knows this topic pretty well. What are your reasons, if i may ask, for your insistance that your book not be released under the GFDL? It's not a particularly restrictive license. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:47, 21 August 2006 (UTC)


::::On Wikipedia there have apparently been proposals to use less restrictive licensing for articles about governments. My thought was to do it with the books I both start and to which I substantially contribute. I just made a template that might work well for the matter: Template:Public Domain. The book I wanted to add it to was Roman Catholicism. I was the original creator of the book and the principal contributor so far. Today I set up the article so that the only contributions are mine and anything from the addition of the template onward will be public domain. Since I go to bed in about an hour, if there is something incorrect with the template or it should not be on the book or something is wrong with the book, feel free to fix it, as I will probably not be on again until next Sunday at the earliest. [[User:JBogdan|JBogdan]] 03:21, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

So, for now, I will add the public domain template. All the contributions of other editors previous to this tag are still licensed under the GDFL and are unaffected, as they were not used in the present article on account of the revert. If the admins do not like this or the users do not, just fix it--I go to bed soon and will not be back until at least next Sunday. [[User:JBogdan|JBogdan]] 03:29, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
:Just to let you know, we've been discussing this issue, and it really isn't possible to release this book into the public domain here on wikibooks. You may release your own personal contributions into the public domain, but you cannot force future contributors to do the same. The best thing to do if you are interested in a less restrictive copyright scheme is to make it clear that your personal contributions are released with no rights reserved. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:25, 1 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

आयुषो वेदः आयुर्वेदः ॥&lt;br /&gt;
Ayurveda means the knowledge of life. &lt;br /&gt; 
['आयु' is life and 'वेदः' is knowledge]

Ayurveda (pronounced eye-yur-VAY-dah) is an Indian traditional system of medicine. It's based on the ancient Indian mythological books and west number of medical literature mostly narrated by ancient doctors like ''Charaka'', ''Susritha'', ''Vaghbata''. Some of these techniques are followed successfully nowadays.

==Principles==

Ayurveda is mainly classified with the hypothesis of 3 humors.
* '''[[/Vata/]]'''
* '''[[/Pitta/]]'''
* '''[[/Kapha/]]'''

These are recognized as being fundamental of health and disease and are seen in the processes of growth, maintenance, and decay.  Equilibrium of these 3 humors is called health and disturbances in equilibrium known as disease.Their actions are named anabolism, metabolism, and catabolism in the western sciences &lt;reference needed&gt;. Life, light, and love exemplify all these energies and are found in our environments at every moment on every level.

These energies combine in limitless ways to create the unique qualities of each individual. When you become aware of these qualities within yourself, you take the first steps toward creating a healthy life. Ayurveda assists you in identifying these energies in your body and shows you how to more fully experience their gifts and to gain freedom from their limitations. By working with the body's unique nature, you are able to create true health.

In the Ayurvedic approach to life and health, we recognize how these energies are at work at each moment in our bodies and minds. When we recognize this, we can begin to create balance for ourselves by countering the destructive forces with positive actions.

== Mechanism of action ==

With Ayurveda, we acknowledge that beneficial daily habits are different for each person, because each person is a unique combination of these three energies. Everybody has all three energies- though people experience each of them to a greater or lesser degree. Ayurveda can be a mirror that reflects our true nature and maps out the path for a return to the lives of vitality that we are meant to have.

Everyday Ayurveda would like to assist you on this healing journey by providing more information for discovering your underlying nature using Ayurvedic principles. Once you are familiar with this, you can bring balance to the body through the foods you eat and how you eat them, daily practices including exercise, rest and massage, and five-sense therapies utilizing color, aroma, taste, touch, and sounds.

Your health is your business!

Everyday Ayurveda provides introductory classes on Ayurvedic principles and how you can apply these principles to live a fully balanced life. Ayurveda is an affordable, accessible daily practice for creating health and harmony in your body and in your environment. Once you begin to incorporate these principles in your daily activities, you will see positive benefits in every aspect of your life.

There is not one food, herb, or activity that is Ayurvedic. You already have many practices that create balance in your life. When this brings clarity and healing at the deepest level, you are practicing Ayurveda.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Types of grassland==

Britain’s lowland limestone grasslands share the common geochemical feature that they are composed mainly of rocks rich in calcium carbonate.  Also, until recent times they were unenclosed and formed the principal sheep pastures of southern England. These grasslands, which may never have been cultivated or have escaped ploughing for hundreds of years, are often described as semi-natural grasslands. Their distribution in England rests on five main geological formations, 

*Chalk, 
*Oolitic limestone, 
*Carboniferous limestone, 
*Magnesium limestone 
*Devonian limestone.

The most important differences which influence the vegetation they carry appears to be physical rather than chemical. Limestones are harder and frequently form rocky outcrops on hills which may give rise to cliffs, often associated with screes. In some districts there are extensive areas in which landscape features produced through rocks being dissolved by running water are developed (karstic features). It has been postulated that the difference in hardness of the rocks may have been an important factor in determining the present-day flora, the softer limestone hills having been tree-covered in early post-glacial times whereas the harder rocks, especially on cliffs, gorges and similar exposed sites may have remained open throughout the period of forest maximum. This hypothesis suggests that until forest clearance by people in the Neolithic(3000-1850 B.C.) and Bronze Age (1850-550 B.C.) periods some of these sites may have served as refuges for plants which subsequently colonized the open grasslands.
Lowland calcareous grasslands are derived from sedimentary deposits of chalk or other types of limestone, e.g. metamorphic mica schist and serpentine. Other base-rich substrates, such as ultrabasic igneous formations and heavy metal contaminated soil support Calaminarian grassland.

The most diverse communities, with characteristic flora including some important lower plant communities, characteristic and specialist invertebrates and birds, occur on shallow rendzina soils over calcareous bedrock. Other quality measures include the presence of short-lived disturbance patches, patches of developing and mature scrub, and areas with continuity of low-intensity grazing.

Large sites tend to occur along escarpments where modern agricultural techniques are not dominant and where soils derived from glacial deposits have not obscured the calcareous bedrock. Large sites, or smaller contiguous sites, are more likely to suppc characteristic species with large ranges and provide opportunities for recolonisation local extinctions occur.

The Lizard peninsula Cornwall's is Britain's most southerly point.  Nowhere else in Cornwall can boast such a density of nationally recognised Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI's) or regionally important county geology sites (formery known as RIGS). The rocks on the Lizard are totally different from the rest of Cornwall. The most extensive (20 square miles) is the serpentine which is largest outcrop.

Serpentine and gabbro produce magnesium or calcium rich soils and it is the resulting alkalinity of the soils on these parts of the Lizard that has enabled a large number of quite rare plants to thrive here, such as dropwort, salad burnet, bloody cranesbill and the rare Cornish heath which is only found on The Lizard.

===Chalk===
Chalk is a particularly soft form of limestone, which weathers to form smooth rounded hills known as &quot;downs&quot; or &quot;wolds&quot;, often dissected by flat bottomed valleys associated with prominent, rounded spurs.  The rock formation was laid down in shallow seas some sixty million years ago.  Chalk rarely outcrops and only forms cliffs at the coast (e.g. the &quot;White Cliffs of Dover&quot;). 
English downland is broadly divisible into four main regions:- 

* the North Downs of Kent and Surrey;
* the broader South Downs of Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight;
* the Chilterns;
* the Wessex downs of Wiltshire, Dorset, Hampshire and Berkshire, in the centre of which lies Salisbury Plain. 

Until the middle of the last century these downlands were devoted almost exclusively to sheep-rearing. In many places on the chalk, woodland occurs, and in some areas such as the Chilterns, there are substantial beech forests.  Ungrazed chalk grassland will soon be invaded by bushes, and eventually by woodland trees. These facts are the starting point for the conservation of downland because is indicates that grassland of to-day is stable only because of the grazing of animals— domestic sheep, and wild rabbits. 
It has been inferred, from the concentration of artifacts of late Neolithic culture on the Wessex downs, and, to a less extent, on the South Downs, that the original forest covering these chalk hills must have been at least partly removed by 2500 B.C.; and it may well be that in these areas a good deal of the chalk grassland turf is about 4,000 years old. But in other areas, e.g. the North Downs, there was no such widespread early culture, and the origin of the open downland must be a good deal more recent. Woodland of today many not be all that ancient; for in several places lynchets,' or old Celtic ploughing terraces, can be detected in present day mature beech woods.

===Harder limestones===

The term limestone is commonly used to describe calcareous strata that are harder and older than chalk. As a guide to their distribution it may be said that in the British Isles the chalk areas occur in east and south-east England where the young rocks are exposed; next, to the north and west, are situated the older Oolitic limestones—rather soft yellowish stone so beautifully used for building in the Cotswolds, for example; and farther north and west, in a larger arc, are to be found the Carboniferous or Mountain limestones, e.g. the Mendips, Gower, the Great Orme, the Craven district of Yorkshire, and the Derbyshire Dales. Elsewhere in north and west Britain the limestones are small in extent and most of the rocks are ancient siliceous strata. In Ireland, however, there is a great deal of Carboniferous limestone; but little is free from peat covering which is maintained as an organic ground cover in that very wet climate. In general, much of the geographical variability of lowland calcareous grassland over the country as a whole may be accounted for by differences in climate.

==Regional differences in biodiversity==

===Plants===

Regional botanical differences can be generalised in terms of distinctive groupings of plants. For example in Matthew's oceanic southern biodiversity element, Helianthemum apenninum is restricted to the outcrop of Devonian limestone and to certain areas in the Mendips; Koeleria vallesiana is restricted entirely to the Mendips. Polygala calcarea an important species of the Chalk and Oolitic limestone within the oceanic southern element is more widespread but reaches its highest abundance in the western chalk grasslands and its northern limit on the Oolitic limestone in Rutland.

Twenty-six European species, most of them rare or local plants of calcareous grasslands, are included in Matthew's continental southern element, which in Britain has a markedly southern distribution with the highest concentration of species in south-east England, south of a line joining the Bristol Channel and the Wash. Ophrys fuciflora, 0. purpurea and 0. simia are restricted to the chalk in Kent while 0. sphegodes is found in Kent, Sussex, on the Isle of Wight and on the Jurassic formation in Dorset. More widespread species in this group includes Hippocrepis comosa which extends northwards to the carboniferous limestone in northern England but is only common in the chalk grasslands of southern England. Other species in this group, each with their own special distribution pattern but included in this major south-eastern floristic element are:

*Aceras anthropophorum, Ajuga chamaepitys. Anacamptis pyramidalis, Asperula cynanchica, Blackstonia perfoliata, Buxus sempervirens, Carex humilis, Cephalanthera damasonium, Daphne laureola, Himantoglossum hircinum, Spiranthes spiralis, Trifolium scabrum and Trinia glauca. 

Helianthemum canum, Hornungia petraea and Linosyris vulgaris are, however, western species in Britain and found mainly on Carboniferous limestone.

The continental element includes many of the rare species characteristic of the chalk and Oolitic limestone in the south and south-east which are mostly absent from the western Carboniferous limestone. This group includes Pulsatilla vulgaris, Bunium bulbocastanum, Dianthus gratianopolitanus, Hypochaeris maculate, Ophrys insectifera, Orchis militaris, 0. ustulata, Orobanche elatior, Phleum phleoides, Phyteuma tenerum, Carex ericetorum, Senecio integrifolius and Seseli libanotis. 

Cirsium acaulon, which is included in this group also occurs on the carboniferous limestone, but it is significant that at the northern limit of its range, in Derbyshire and Yorkshire, it occurs only on south to south-west facing slopes. The northern and sub-montane calcicole element in the flora is well represented below 1,000 ft. on the carboniferous limestone of Northern England, but only one species (Antennaria diolca) in this floristic element reaches the chalk, although the moss Rhytidium rugosum is abundant on the chalky boulder clay in the Breckland. Examples of northern species relatively abundant on the lowland carboniferous limestone of the Pennines, the Peak District and Morecambe Bay are: Viola lutea, Crepis mollis, Trollius europaeus, Prunus padus, Rosa villosa, Draba incana, Cirsium heterophyllum, Geranium sylvaticum, Epipactis atrorubens, Melica nutans, Saxifraga hypnoides and Asplenium viride.

===Animals===

Much the same factors which appear to determine the distribution of plant species are relevant to the distribution of animals. The proximity of the Continent of Europe to the eastern chalk in Kent and Sussex is undoubtedly related to the particular richness of the fauna in these counties. Relatively few species seem to be more numerous or only present in western Britain, although the insects of the Cornish peninsula, particularly associated with vegetation of the calcareous maritime serpentine rocks at the Lizard, probably include many species which only occur in this region in Britain. Species such as the Small Blue butterfly Cupido minimus are undoubtedly commoner in Western Britain than in the East.

Many animal species have distributions in Britain which are markedly southern. Some occur only along the south coast of England, others are not found north of the Thames while others again occur only up to the Midlands. It is often difficult, especially in the case of predacious species, to determine whether these are restricted to limestone formations or not. Limestone in southern England warms up quickly and shares with arenaceous and cindery substrates an abundance of  thermophilous animal species which is not found so frequently on the colder clay soils.

The richness of phytophagous animals on limestone in southern Britain is frequently easily related to the occurrence of particular foodplants and the abundance of these. It seems probable that the physical characteristics of limestone rocks and soils, the occurrence of these rocks and soil abundantly in southern England, and the growth and diverse vegetation on limestones are the most important factors in determining the distribution and abundance of the animals. Chemical factors are of over-riding importance in some cases, for example the occurrence of many terrestrial Mollusca. The proximity of the sea seems to be a powerful modifying influence, with many maritime species being particularly associated with limestone cliff tops and cliff faces.

The history of grasslands in Britain whether in the long term (i.e. throughout the Pleistocene), medium term (Prehistoric) or recent (Historic) has been important in determining the composition of the fauna. Palaeoecological studies have shown how different the fauna of Britain has been in recent geological time. The creation of grasslands from the primaeval forest is reflected in the fossil faunas collected from different sites. In historic times the introduction of the Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and the extinction of the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) and near extinction of the Large Blue_ butterfly (Maculinea anion) are examples of the greatly modifying influence directed by human activity on the fauna of calcareous grasslands.

==Targets and sites==

In the Biodiversity Challenge, and agenda for conservation in the UK (1994), produced by a group of voluntary conservation organizations the targets for lowland dry calcareous grassland were stated as:-

*Develop and/or maintain appropriate management of the existing resource, and protect sites from damaging activities.
*Restore adjacent areas where possible, to create a buffer zone for the main site ar a mosaic of bare soil habitats, short-grazed and tall-sward pastures and scrub of various ages.
*Establish the true extent of the remaining resource as an essential first step to achieving these targets.

The total extent of unimproved grassland habitats in the UK is estimated to be less than 0.3 million ha (UK Action Plan) with only a proportion of this figure 'supporting its characteristic biodiversity'. In 1972, Dorset had only 2,268 ha of unimproved cha grassland left compared with 28,000 ha in 1811.  Best estimates suggest that the total resource of lowland unimproved calcareous grassland is now less than 20,000 ha in the UK. Priority areas for action include: 
*Salisbury Plain, 
*Chiltern Scarp, 
*the North and South Downs, 
*Cotswold Scarp, 
*the Mendips, 
*the Lincolnshire and Yorkshire Wolds, 
*Anglesey and the Vale of Clwyd in Wales, 
*Breckland (CG7b), 
*the magnesian limestone grasslands in Durham (CG8), 
*the Dorset Downs, 
*the Isle of Wight, 
*the Carboniferous limestones of Derbyshire, 
*the Pembroke coast (CG1b) 

The grasslands are under threat from changes in farming practice, particularly:

* abandonment of grazing on steep slopes which leads to encroachment by coarse grasses and scrub
* fertilising
* ploughing.

RDB vascular plants of lowland calcareous grasslands, such as Gentianella anglica, tend to be more characteristic of the short, grazed pastures provided by low-intensity sheep grazing, mixed livestock grazing or unmanaged rabbit grazing.

==Examples of threatened species==
 
Examples of key species whose conservation is closely linked to the conservation of unimproved lowland calcareous grasslands are listed below. A suggested conservation target is given for each species.

; Lichens
*Buellia asterella (starry Breck lichen) 
**Reduce scrub encroachment by appropriate management and reinstate rabbit-grazing. Prosecute botanists illegally collecting material. Known from only three areas in the Suffolk Breckland. Characteristic of rabbit-grazed, calcareous, sandy, lichen-dominated turf.

; Bryophytes
*Barbula glauca (glaucous beard-moss). 
**Known from only one site in Wiltshire, in a dry chalk crevice. Threatened by shading, rubbish dumping and collecting, the site should be managed appropriately and collecting discouraged by prosecution.

; Flowering plants
*Althaea hirsuta (hairy mallow) 
**Continue to restore appropriate management at threatened Somerset site and only Kent site. Monitor recovery of these populations and monitor status of third native population. Known from only three native sites. A plant of disturbance patches on south-facing calcareous slopes.
Gentianella anglica (early gentian) Maintain in 25 sites on chalk in southern England. A UK endemic species.
*Orchis militaris (military orchid) 
**Maintain conservation management to enhance populations at only two known sites in the UK, both owned by the FC. Establish the extent of genetic variation between British and continental plants using gene or enzyme analysis. Provide suitable management at other historic sites to allow natural recolonisation.

; Insects
*Decticus verrucivorus (wart-biter grasshopper) 
**Survey Wiltshire chalk grasslands for further populations. Re-establish in the only former known site in the county.
*Gomphocerripus rufus (a grasshopper) 
**Maintain range on limestone grassland. Hesperia comma (silver-spotted skipper) Halt decline and restore range.
*Siona lineata (black-veined moth) 
**Maintain remaining populations at two chalk grassland sites in Kent. Restore to other sites in previous range.

; Birds
*Burhinus oedicnemus (stone-curlew) 
**Target from the RSPB /JNCC species action plan. Increase the population breeding in England to 200 pairs by the year 2000, within the present range which also includes arable and calcifugous grassland. Encourage recolonisation of the past breeding range within England. Increase the proportion of the population nesting in semi-natural grassland habitats. An important part of the population nests on chalk grassland in southern England.

A '''sticky date pudding''' is a favorite Australian pudding, especially in Southern climates in the winter months.

Your family and friends will love you forever if you make them the following recipe, but warning, exceedingly diet unfriendly.

==Ingredients==
*4 eggs (at room temperature for best results)
*1½ cups (360ml) of castor sugar
*1 cup (240ml) of light oil
*2 tsp of vanilla essence
*2 cups (480ml) of plain four
*1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
*2 tsp salt
*2 tsp mixed spice
*1 cup (240ml) pitted dates
*2 cups (480ml) brown sugar
*1 cup (240ml) water
*Further tsp bicarbonate of soda
*500ml cream
 
==Utensils==
*double saucepan
*mixer for cake (a free standing one is better, as you need to beat the eggs for some time for best results)
*sieve or four sifter
*large cake tin, MUST be lined with paper &amp; well greased.  I prefer a log tin rather than a round one
*wax proof baking paper
*Preheated oven to 180°C

==Procedure==
# Place 2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup of water in top of double saucepan,
# Over simmering heat stir until caramel formed (i.e. all brown sugar dissolved)
# Remove top saucepan, set aside to cool.
# Chop dates roughly, place in saucepan, cover with only enough water to cover and add 1 tsp bicarb.
# Bring to boil, and simmer for 1 minute (it will froth up from the bicarb, if so remove from heat once foam reaches the top of the saucepan)
# Set aside to cool
# Preheat oven to 180°C
# Grease and line cake tin.  (Cannot emphasise enough that the tin MUST be papered - I learnt the hard way.)
# Sift dry ingredients (I like to do this twice)
# Beat eggs lightly
# Add castor sugar and beat as for making a sponge; really light and fluffy
# Fold in oil and vanilla essence, but don’t over-mix this otherwise you’ll lose all the air in the egg mixture
# Fold in the sifted flour, bicarb, and salt.
# Fold in the cooled date mixture
# Pour into prepared tin
# Bake in oven @180°C for about 80-90 minutes, not too high in the oven otherwise the top will burn.  Cooking time and temperature can be reduced slightly if a fan forced oven is used
# Test cake with skewer, skewer should come out dry
# Remove from oven leave pudding in the papered tin
# Use a skewer to create lots of holes throughout the hot pudding
# Pour approximately 1 cup of caramel mixture onto the hot pudding; this will soak into the holes of the pudding

==Butterscotch Sauce==

* 1 cup of brown sugar
* 100g butter
* 1 cup of cream

place all ingredients in saucepan stirring occasionally for 3 minutes. pour over warm sticky date pudding and serve with cream and strawberries (optional)

==When ready to serve==

#tip cake out of pan
#slice into desired portions
#place slice in bowl, drizzle with butterscotch sauce
#serve immediately with cream or ice cream

      <text xml:space="preserve">I removed the speedy delete tag for a couple of reasons:

#  This is not a trivial amount of content that is being requested to be deleted.  If it were just a single sentance or even a single paragraph that outlined the project, that would be one thing.  There is some actual content to this book, so it should go to a VfD if something this large is deleted.
#  Stubs are useful on Wikibooks, and this is a stub.  This page ([[SNFO Flight Planning:Philosophy of this project]]) spells out very clearly what the goals of this wikibook are, and is a very admirable goal.  Unfortunately trying to gather these materials is a very difficult task, and I understand why this project was abandoned.  What is needed instead is for this book to be indexed in such a way that other participants on Wikibooks can find this book.  Unfortunately it is not linked on any bookshelf and there is no real reason to even know it exists on Wikibooks at all.  If they happened to find it on Google, they might have come here, but that is a lousy way to find this content.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:04, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

:Then transwiki it to Wikisource on the grounds that its a source text. The creator wants Wikibooks readers to basically copyedit the document found at [https://cnatra.navaltx.navy.mil/cnatra/ppub_nfo_snfo.htm], but a &quot;work of the United States federal Government&quot; released into the public domain is better suited for Wikisource. I hope you have this watched... --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 17:28, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

::The goal was to do more than simply copy edit an existing document, but to also add in all of the errata, and updates as published.  The problem with errata is that it is soothing for academic publishers as it shows their mistakes, but for somebody who has to use an advanced technical document for practical use it is practically a living nightmare.  And pilots are expected to know all of this, including the errata.  As a publication of the U.S. government, this is in the public domain, so there are no copyright issues here at all.  I'm really not sure if Wikisource can deal with a project of this nature or not, and that is an interesting question.  Can a &quot;current document&quot;, updated to correct errata problems, be included in Wikisource?  It seems like a reasonable question.  It is a matter of how much of being a purist toward the original document it should get.

::I think there was also the thought that additional &quot;practical experience&quot; from pilots would also be included in this manual... as perhaps a suppliment to or even a replacement of the manual that you cited.  From this perspective, it is an interesting Wikibook as well.  I don't have the time to develop this Wikibook, but it would be something very interesting to see.  Perhaps some future editor/contributor to Wikibooks will want to take this from its current point and push it further.  I don't see a reason to remove this book at the moment, as it otherwise does fit with the reasons for Wikibooks as outlined on [[WB:WIN]] except for the original source material clause.  And in its current state it doesn't have enough source material to qualify for moving to Wikisource.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:33, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many of the conclusions in climate science are based on direct observations of the climate system, such as temperature, humidity, and winds. Over the years, our observations have become more accurate, more precise, and more expensive. Beginning in the 1970s, satellite observations of the atmosphere and surface of Earth began to shed light on global-average quantities in a way that was impossible before. Even with the knowledge gained from space-borne instruments, there are uncertainties, especially of older data. 

The best reconstructions of past climate give a picture of surface temperature that has risen extremely rapidly since the middle 20th century. 

For many years there was much controversy over whether anthropogenic climate change was a reality or not, but as evidence has mounted almost all of the scientific skeptics have accepted that humans are affecting climate. As it stands now, there is resounding scientific consensus [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686 Oreskes, Science 2004, 306(5702), DOI: 10.1126/science.1103618] that humans are the leading contribution to global warming. 

Some economists believe that drastic limitations on production are potentially economically damaging. Others have begun to come forward with more lucrative ideas for how to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Move tab ==

I noticed that you blanked [[Philosophy of Mathematics - the Why, the What and the How]] and copied it to [[Philosophy of Mathematics - The Scope]]. This is a frequent mistake. [[Philosophy of Mathematics - the Why, the What and the How]] is a now a blank page. ''Blank pages are bad for Wikibooks'' because they confuse readers, and some users will guess that the blanking was vandalism.

At the top of each page, between &quot;history&quot; and &quot;watch&quot;, is a '''move tab''' &amp;ndash; using this is the best way to move a page. I hope that if you move any more pages, you will use this move tab. Thanks for contributing to Wikibooks and Wikiversity, --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:02, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

-- thanks for the hint!

==Blanking==
Please take care not to replace Wikibooks pages with blank content. Blank pages have a tendency to confuse readers and may be mistaken for [[WB:DWV|vandalism]]. If it is a duplicate page, please [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirect]] it to an appropriate existing page. If the page has been vandalised, please [[Help:How to revert a page to an earlier version|revert]] it to the last legitimate version. If you feel that the content of a page is inappropriate, please [[Help:Editing|edit]] the page and replace it with appropriate content. If you believe there is no hope for the page, please see the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy|deletion policy]] for how to proceed. If page is no longer useful, insert {{tlx|delete}} to its top. Thanks for contributing to Wikibooks!

== [[Computer Science:Logic]] ==

I saw that you had moved this page. It looks like you can't quite decide what this book should be named. For reference, we have a [[WB:NP|naming policy]]. Perhaps something like [[Computer Science Logic]] or [[Logic for Computer Science]] or [[Computer Logic]]... any of those would meet the policy. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:43, 29 August 2007 (UTC)

My renaming was just due to the blank. Someone changed it before to just 'Logic'.
--[[User:Sterling|Sterling]] 14:59, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

: I've gone ahead and fixed what I could fine so everything has a consistent name now which follows the [[WB:NP|naming policy]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:06, 3 September 2007 (UTC)

I don't really care what the name is, just try to keep it consistent as [[WB:NP|naming policy]] suggests. I only picked the name 'Logic', because as you said, someone had changed it before to that name, and as someone else noted here, you seemed to be having trouble deciding on a name. I'm wondering if perhaps this contents was intended to be part of the [[Logic for Computer Scientists]] book rather then a separate book. With all the name inconsistencies its hard to tell. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:19, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

== Deletions ==

I saw you blank and move a page to say delete. Both can look like vandalism. If you believe a page should be deleted in the future please instead add {{tlx|delete|&lt;reason why you think the page should be deleted}} to the top of the page. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:17, 2 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Origins of the English Breakfast ==
The traditional English [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] of eggs, [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] and other ingredients is ubiquitous the world over. Cafés and hotels all around the world offer a version of &quot;English breakfast&quot;, often far removed from what might be considered conventional!

The English breakfast as it is known today is based, like so many British traditions, on what became popular in the Victorian era. Victorian home economist Isabella Beeton gives the following advice in ''The Book of Household Management'' (1861) about breakfast:

{{Cquote|The following list of hot dishes may perhaps assist our readers in knowing what to provide for the comfortable meal called breakfast. Broiled fish, such as mackerel, whiting, herrings, dried haddocks, &amp;c.; mutton chops and rump-steaks, broiled sheep’s kidneys, kidneys à la maître d’hôtel, sausages, plain rashers of bacon, bacon and poached eggs, ham and poached eggs, omelets, plain boiled eggs, oeufs-au-plat, poached eggs on toast, muffins, toast, marmalade, butter, &amp;c. &amp;c.}}

Nowadays far too few Englishmen start their day with such a large meal. Surveys cited in ''The Magpie history of food'' (Audrey Ellis, 1977) indicate that in 1958 50% of British families still started their day with a cooked breakfast, but by 1976 it had fallen to 18%. More recent surveys (within the last 2-3 years) put the figure today at less than 1%.

The English breakfast is still a mainstay of boarding houses, hotels and cafés in Britain, however, and will always be found on the menu of most such establishments. There are also many varieties across the United Kingdom and Ireland, including the Full Irish, Ulster Fry, Full Welsh, and Full Scottish, [[w:Full breakfast|among others]].

== What is in an English breakfast? ==
The key components of an English breakfast include:
* bacon
* sausages
* white egg
* sliced fried red tomatoes 
* baked beans (in cans)
* fresh salted mushrooms 
* fried or roast potatoes
* fried bread 
* black pudding

An English breakfast may also include:
* stewed prunes
* buttered toast, often spread with orange marmalade
* tea
* orange juice

Usually the eggs are fried, but for a lighter, more healthy option they can be poached. The bacon can also be fried, but traditionally it is more often [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]] until slightly crispy. A fresh tomato, halved and then grilled until browned, is much nicer than the tinned tomatoes or tinned baked beans so often substituted, and hot toast completes the meal. Traditionally it is served with tea (with milk), although coffee and orange juice are usually also offered.

[[Image:Full English Breakfast.JPG|right|thumb|Full English Breakfast]]
A variant on the above, called the &quot;Full English Breakfast&quot;, is a more substantial version which additionally contains a selection of the following:
* one fried egg
* one English-style sausage
* two rashers of crispy fried bacon
* a portion of fried mushrooms (browned)
* two slices of fried [[Cookbook:black pudding|black pudding]] (a type of sausage made with pig's blood)
* half a tomato, fried until brown
* one slice of fried bread (a slice of white bread fried in oil, preferably the oil used to cook the bacon)

By the time you have added in all these (and other fried items such as hash browns, [[Cookbook:Bubble and squeak|bubble and squeak]] or beans), it can become quite a plateful. Really large full English breakfasts (often colloquially known as &quot;fry-ups&quot;) are a staple of cheap cafés, themselves known as &quot;greasy spoons&quot; - a reference to the lack of quality and low standards of cleanliness of the establishment.  True aficionados, however, often maintain that the best examples of a fry-up can only be found from such establishments, and many believe this is a result of the frying fat being reused and thus infused with the flavours of the dish.

== Making an English breakfast ==
Like so many famous dishes, the English breakfast frequently suffers from being prepared badly and with poor quality ingredients. Often this means everything is fried in copious quantities of fat, making for a heavy and unpleasant meal. Cooked well, with high quality ingredients, it can be a delicious start to the day - although something to have more as an occasional treat, perhaps, than every day!

Preparing an English breakfast is quite easy; it is basically a matter of starting off cooking the items that take the longest to cook, and moving through to the things that take the least time so that it is all ready at the same time. It is made even easier by the fact that most of the ingredients can be kept warm for a while once cooked without spoiling; this fact allows for the common way of serving English breakfasts as a kind of buffet where diners can help themselves from warm serving plates.

==Ingredients==
To make an English breakfast for 4 people, you will need:
* 4 rashers of [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] (smoked bacon without too much fat is best, e.g. smoked back bacon)
* 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] (although you could cook 2 eggs per person if your guests are hungry!)
* 4 English-style [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausages]]
* 4 medium sized [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], halved across-ways
* 400g [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], sliced
* 4-8 slices of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] (traditionally white)
* tin [[Cookbook:Baked Beans|baked beans]] (optional)

==Procedure==

===&quot;Healthy&quot; Version===

The following instructions are for making a slightly healthier version of an English breakfast, with the emphasis on grilling and poaching rather than frying.

# Heat the grill to a medium heat, and cook the sausages under it, turning frequently.
# Cover the base of a frying pan with about 1cm of water, and heat on a high heat until boiling. When it is boiling, carefully break the eggs into it. If you have cooking rings, you can put these into the water first and then break the eggs into the rings, to prevent the eggs from spreading too much - although really fresh eggs should stay together anyway. Once the eggs are in the pan, wait a few moments for the water to heat up again, then turn the heat down to a very very gently simmer. To ensure the tops of the eggs are cooked, spoon water from around the edge of the pan over the top of the eggs a few times during cooking. When cooked, the egg white should be soft but cooked through and the yolk still runny.
# Put the halved tomatoes under the grill with the sausages.
# If using, put the baked beans into a pan and heat through over a medium heat.
# Heat up a very small amount of oil in another pan, and fry the mushrooms until they are soft.
# Put the bacon under the grill along with the sausages and tomatoes. Cook on one side for about 2 minutes, then turn once and repeat. Cook longer if crispier bacon is preferred.
# Whilst cooking the bacon, use a toaster or grill to toast the bread until golden.
# Serve the eggs, bacon, mushrooms, sausage, tomato and beans onto piping hot plates, with the toast on a separate plate or toast rack. Serve with butter and jam for the toast, and hot tea with milk.

As a timing guide, here is how long (approximately) each item takes to cook:
* sausages - 10-15 mins
* eggs - 8-10 mins
* tomatoes - 6 mins
* beans - 5 mins
* mushrooms - 4 mins
* bacon - 4 mins
* toast - 3 mins

However, if you can't cope with doing it all at once (or don't have enough pans / rings), it is possible to keep all of the items warm in a preheated oven, so you can just cook each item in turn and keep it warm until needed. Try not to keep the eggs warm for too long before serving though, as the yolks may harden.

===&quot;Unhealthy&quot; Version===

They use the same ingredients as above and are more in keeping with the spirit of the dish.

# While frying the other ingredients, toast the bread in a grill or toaster.  Assuming 2 slices per person, you should have enough by the time you finish the fried food.  Be sure to butter them heavily with real butter rather than low-fat spread.  Place 4 plates on the bottom shelf of an oven, and one on the top.  Set the oven to its lowest heat.
# Melt some [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] in a large frying pan (enough to make a layer of fat around 1cm deep) and brown the sausage in it over a high heat.  Lower heat and cook the sausage for around 4 minutes, leave it in the pan.  A lot of fat will leak from the sausages.  Add the bacon (2 strips per person rather than 1) and cook to taste, flipping regularly (2-3 minutes for pink, 4-6 for a darker red bacon with crispy fat).  The bacon will also release a lot of fat.  Transfer the bacon to the warmed dish in the top of the oven.  Leave the sausage in the pan.
# Add the mushrooms and tomatoes to the pan. Add the tin of baked beans to a small pot and heat on a separate ring.  After 2-4 minutes, transfer the mushrooms to the oven with the bacon. Transfer the tomato then too, or leave it a little longer depending on taste.
# The sausages should now be dark brown, push them to the side of the pan and break an egg into the fat.  Using a spatula, push hot fat over the yolk until it begins to bubble but is still liquid.  This should take about 1 minute or so in a hot pan.  Set out the 4 warmed plates beforehand and add an egg to each.  When done, add the sausage, bacon, and mushrooms.  Add the beans last.  Serve with the buttered toast on a separate plate.
# If you are using black pudding, add it to the fat with the bacon and remove it before the eggs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{bicycles}}
[[File:Marin bike.jpg|thumbnail|200px|A Cross-country mountain bike]]
When you walk into a bike shop you see a huge range of different styles of bicycles. There may be bikes with enormous suspension systems, little things with ribbons sticking out, bikes that are light with very thin wheels, and big monsters you think King Kong couldn't lift. There are three main types of bicycles you'll see in your local bike shop--mountain bikes, road bikes and kids bikes.

Mountain bikes are usually the bigger bikes with wider but smaller diameter wheels. As other bikes they come in many varieties. Cross-country mountain bikes are the lightest weight modern mountain bikes, with only front shocks or with low travel full suspension; the intended use being riding long distances over unpaved paths through medium terrain, like hiking on a bicycle.  For more aggressive mountain bikers, all-mountain, freeride, or downhill mountain bikes exist.  They are for going down steep slopes at high speeds, over big drops.  They are extremely strong, but heavy, and not designed to be pedaled for much distance.  In many places they are taken up ski lifts in the summer, or driven up in a automobile, and only ridden down hill.

Road bikes are designed for road riding as a sport. They are suited for speed and efficiency.  For example, the thin tires cut down on rolling resistance and the ultra light frames allow riders to reach some amazing speeds with the least effort.  

You might see cyclocross bikes, which are similar to road bikes in geometry, but are built to take larger tires and be ridden off-road.  Often, there are separate brake levers on the tops of the road handlebars.
&lt;!--(Place Holder: Then there are BMX bikes, Hybrid, touring bikes, and Recumbent bikes.)!--&gt;

There are many types of bicycle available. Choosing the bicycle that fits your needs is an important first step to enjoying your cycling experience. This chapter aims to weigh the pros and cons of some cycles. 

==Road biking==
[[File:Kusuma bike large.jpg|thumbnail|200px|A racing bicycle]]
Pros:
* Roads are easily accessible.
* Speeds can reach well in excess of 40KPH. 
* Can be made easy or hard (if you ride long or fast or take hills).
* Can be very enjoyable and exhilarating.
* Burns lots and lots of calories and increases physical fitness.

Cons:
* Can be dull, rigorous and sweaty. 
* Traffic requires being aware of situations and using safe skills.
* Fast riding and descending require skill.
* Entry-level road bikes tend to cost more than entry-level mountain or &quot;hybrid&quot; bikes.
* Crashes at high-speed are very dangerous.

==Cross-country Mountain Biking==
Pros:
* Very challenging
* Very good exercise.
* Scenery is usually better than road biking.
* Facilities and Trails accessible.

Cons:
* Hard.
* Can be tiring.
* Smooth ride is a joke
* Facilities not as easily accessible as road biking.
* Also dangerous!

This type of riding is for die-hard individuals, and people who like hiking.

==Freeride Mountain Biking==
Pros:
* Increasingly popular.
* If you like skiing...
* Fast.
* Going off jumps is an exhilarating experience (once you get used to it).
* Fairly challenging.
* Truckload of fun.
* Safe if rider is wearing body armor.
* You can do big tricks in this type of riding.

Cons:
* Highly Dangerous if rider is not wearing body armor.
* Scary at first.
* Hard to access.
* Not good exercise.
* Expensive.

In slopestyle, riders can perform tricks. 
For daredevils with lots of money and health insurance.

==Recumbent Bikes==
[[File:Jersey Town Criterium 2010 recumbent 059.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Two recumbent bicycles]]
Pros:
* Comfortable.
* The fastest of all bicycle styles[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tlinden/winforb.html].
* Excellent exercise.
* Can ride longer distances in comfort.
* With proper gearing, can climb hills easily.

Cons:
* Not ideal for riding in urban conditions due to low riding position. Cars may have trouble seeing you.
* Recumbent bicycles tend to be more expensive because they are not mass produced.
* Recumbents tend to be harder to find for test rides.
* More skill needed to balance (unless you're riding a recumbent trike!).
* Not as well understood by bike mechanics and shops.
* Climbing hills can be more difficult if one is used to standing up off the pedals to climb in an improperly high gear on a diamond frame bicycle, although extra leverage can be gained by pushing against the back of the seat.  As noted in advantages, this is not an issue with proper gearing.

'''NOTE:''' Your cable company controls which ports are active. Typically, the USB, composite video IN and Ethernet ports are disabled. The Audio IN ports will pass audio through to Audio OUT when the DVR is turned off. The USB port may supply power for devices like a fan or light.

===DCT-64''xx'' Phase I===

''Need information about Phase I DVRs.''

==Connection samples==

Below are a few basic connection ideas for common situations.

===[[W:Standard-definition_television|SD]] TV with no A/V inputs===

You either must use a DCT-64''xx'' Phase III or DCT-34''xx'', or purchase an [[w:RF_Modulator|RF Modulator]].

#Connect coaxial cable from cable company to DVR's ''CABLE IN'' connector
#Connect coaxial cable from the DVR's ''RF OUT'' connector to your TV (alternatively, you can connect it to a VCR or DVD recorder's RF input, and connect it's RF output to your TV.)
##If your DVR does not have an RF out connection, purchase an [[w:RF_Modulator|RF Modulator]]. Connect the DVR's [[w:Composite video|Composite video]] OUT (yellow RCA) jack to the modulator. Connect the DVR's audio OUT (Left [white] &amp; Right [red] RCA) jacks to the modulator.
#Tune your TV to channel 3 (or sometimes channel 4)
#Refer to the [[../Setup|Setup]] page and change the ''YPbPr Output'' setting to [[w:480i|480i]].

===[[W:Standard-definition_television|SD]] TV with A/V inputs===
#Connect coaxial cable from cable company to the DVR's ''CABLE IN'' connector
#(optional) Connect coaxial cable from the DVR's ''RF OUT'' connector to your TV (alternatively, you can connect it to a VCR or DVD recorder's RF input, and connect it's RF output to your TV.)
#Connect the DVR's audio OUT (Left [white] &amp; Right [red] RCA) jacks to your TV's Audio IN jacks.
#Determine the highest quality connection your TV supports. From highest to lowest, these will be [[w:Component Video|Component]], [[w:S-Video|S-Video]], then [[w:Composite video|Composite]]. (If you have a rare standard definition TV that has [[w:HDMI|HDMI]] or [[w:DVI|DVI]] ports, those should be considered highest quality.)
#Make your video connection:
##[[w:Component Video|Component]]: Use 3 RCA cables, typically color coded green (Y), blue (Pb), and red (Pr).
##[[w:S-Video|S-Video]]: Use cable with large round connector that has 4 pins and a plastic post inside it.
##[[w:Composite video|Composite]]: Use an RCA cable, typically color coded yellow.
#Tune your TV to the video input you made your connections to.
#Refer to the [[../Setup|Setup]] page and change the ''YPbPr Output'' setting to [[w:480i|480i]].

==Setting video display options==
The DVR has several options to configure the video output format for your TV or display. This includes HD modes, SD mode, screen format (4:3 or 16:9), and closed captioning. Some newer models with the latest firmware also have options to fine tune DVI or HDMI settings.

==Accessing the user settings menu==

To access the video options, you need to go to ''USER SETTINGS''
#Turn the DVR off.
#Press the Menu button on the remote or the front of the DVR.

==Accessing the user settings menu: Verizon FiOS TV with IMG v2.0==

Subscribers to Verizon's FiOS TV that have the IMG v2.0 have a slightly different method to enter ''USER SETTINGS''.  Perform the following steps quickly (pauses between button presses may prevent the menu from appearing):
#Press the power button to turn the DVR off. Be prepared to quickly press the next 2 buttons.
#Immediately press and release the OK button on the remote (or the Select button on the front of the DVR)
#Immediately press and release the Menu button on the remote or the front of the DVR.
#If your current aspect ratio does not display (16:9, 4:3L, or 4:3P) you may have waited too long between button presses.  Turn the DVR on and try again.

Alternately, FiOS TV subscribers with IMG 2.0 may access the user settings menu during the DVR's boot sequence.  Note that with this approach, the menu will go away when the DVR finishes booting (in a minute or two):
#Unplug the DVR for 30+ seconds.
#Plug in the DVR
#Press the Menu button on the front of the DVR when --:-- shows on the front of the DVR.
#If your current aspect ratio does not display (16:9, 4:3L, or 4:3P) you may not have had the DVR powered off long enough. Repeat the steps above but leave the DVR unplugged longer.

==Navigating in the user settings menu==

While in the menu, the up or down arrows move between options. The left and right arrows will change the selected option.

To exit, press the Power key on the remote or the front of the DVR.

If you are unable to see the video on your display, most of the options will also display on the front panel of the DVR.

If you tune into a [[W:Standard-definition_television|SD]] channel before turning off the DVR, the user settings menu will display in standard [[w:480i|480i]]

==TV Type==

''TV TYPE'' is where you specify the screen format. This only appears to affect how [[W:HDTV|HD]] material is displayed when downconverted to [[w:480i|480i]] ([[W:Standard-definition_television|SD]]) or [[w:480p|480p]] ([[w:Enhanced-definition television|ED]]).

The options are:
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4
|'''TV display'''
|'''LED Display'''
|'''Description'''
|-
|16:9
|16:9
|For most widescreen displays. [[W:HDTV|HD]] will be displayed in its native format.
|-
|4:3 Letterbox
|4:3L
|For 4:3 displays. [[W:HDTV|HD]] will be downconverted with [[w:letterbox|letterboxing]].
|-
|4:3 Pan Scan
|4:3P
|For 4:3 displays. [[W:HDTV|HD]] will be downconverted with the sides cut off.
|}

==HDMI/YPbPr Output==

''HDMI/YPbPr OUTPUT'' sets the [[W:HDTV|HD]] format used by the [[w:Component Video|component]], [[w:DVI|DVI]], or [[w:HDMI|HDMI]] outputs. The RF, [[w:Composite video|composite]], and [[w:S-Video|S-Video]] outputs will ALWAYS be [[w:480i|480i]].

The DVR can only output one [[W:HDTV|HD]] format. For example, if you set it to [[w:1080i|1080i]], all [[W:HDTV|HD]] will be output as [[w:1080i|1080i]]. Any source that is [[w:720p|720p]] or [[w:480p|480p]] will be converted to [[w:1080i|1080i]]. This is only done when on playback or viewing live video. Recordings are ALWAYS saved in their native format.

'''WARNING:''' If ''HDMI/YPbPr OUTPUT'' is set to anything other than [[w:480i|480i]], and you are watching [[W:HDTV|HD]] material, you will NOT be able to see the on-screen menus on the RF, [[w:Composite Video|composite]], or [[w:S-Video|S-Video]] outputs.

'''WARNING:''' As you scroll through the options, the output will change to that format. If you are using the RF, [[w:Composite video|composite]], or [[w:S-Video|S-Video]] output, the video may go blank until you go back to [[w:480i|480i]].

The options are:

NOTE:  This option is available only on DCX models with an HDMI cable hookup, but the DCX3501(Comcast Calls the Box the RNG200N)/DCX3510 can upscale all HiDef signals to 1080p60. The rest of the DCX Models can when selected to this resolution will display content at 1080p30 or 1080p24 when content is broadcast at 1080p. The only channels and programs Comcast broadcasts at 1080p are: 3D channels, 3D programs on VOD(Video On Demand), and some PPV events/specials.

===Which ''HDMI/YPbPr Output'' Setting Should I Use?===

If your display is not [[W:HDTV|HD]] capable, then set ''HDMI/YPbPr OUTPUT'' to [[w:480i|480i]]. This will guarantee you can always see the menus. Set the ''TV Type'' selection to match your display [[w:aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and [[w:letterbox|letterboxing]] preferences when viewing [[W:HDTV|HD]] material (which will be downconverted for your TV).

If your display is [[W:HDTV|HD]] capable, there is no hard and fast rule. You need to check the owners manual, or information on the back panel of the TV to find out what resolutions it accepts.

If it's an [[w:EDTV|EDTV]], then a setting of [[w:480P|480P]] will probably work best.

If it's [[w:CRT|CRT]]-based (direct-view or projection), then [[w:1080i|1080i]] may be the best option, as most display [[w:1080i|1080i]] natively.

If it's a fixed resolution panel such as [[w:Plasma Display|Plasma]], [[w:LCD|LCD]], [[w:DLP|DLP]], [[w:LCoS|LCoS]], [[w:LCoS|SXRD]] or similar, it depends on its vertical resolution. That is typically the second number listed: 1920 x 1080 would have a vertical resolution of 1080 lines. If that number matches one of the ''HDMI/YPbPr OUTPUT'' options, try that first. If it's an oddball number like 768 or 786 or 1024, then it's a matter of trial-and-error to find which format you like and that works best with your display.

==4:3 OVERRIDE==

''4:3 OVERRIDE'' tells the DVR how to output [[W:Standard-definition_television|SD]] programming. This option is disabled if ''HDMI/YPbPr OUTPUT'' is set to [[w:480i|480i]].

The options are:
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4
|'''TV display'''
|'''LED Display'''
|'''Description'''
|-
|OFF
|OFF
|[[W:Standard-definition_television|SD]] is converted to the ''HDMI/YPbPR OUTPUT'' format with [[w:pillar box|pillar boxes]] on the sides
|-
|480I
|480I
|[[W:Standard-definition_television|SD]] is not converted (''recommended'')
|-
|480P
|480P
|[[W:Standard-definition_television|SD]] is converted to [[w:480p|480p]]
|-
|STRETCH
|Strh
|[[W:Standard-definition_television|SD]] is converted to the ''HDMI/YPbPR OUTPUT'' format and stretched horizontally for a [[w:Aspect Ratio|16:9]] screen
|}

You should try the '''480I''' (no conversion) setting first. Most newer displays do a better job handling [[W:Standard-definition_television|SD]] upconversion than the Motorola. Also, most widescreen displays offer more &quot;zoom&quot; options in 480I for material that is already letterboxed, to fill the widescreen.  If you choose one of the other settings for ''4:3 OVERRIDE'', these &quot;zoom&quot; setting may not be available.

NOTE: On DCX models when &quot;Native&quot; mode is chosen under ''HDMI/YPbPR OUTPUT'', the ''4:3 OVERRIDE'' setting is greyed out and has no effect.

==Additional HDMI Settings==

The 641''x''-PIII and 341''x'' include an [[w:HDMI|HDMI]] output instead of a [[w:DVI|DVI]] output. As of [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_16.20|Firmware 16.20]], a new option, &quot;ADDITIONAL HDMI SETTINGS &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; was added to the menu. Highlighting it and pressing OK/Select will switch to a second screen.

You can arrow down to each option and press the OK/Select to change it.

The options are:
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
|'''Setting'''

|duI
|You can use this option if you are using an HDMI/DVI converter cable or adapter to connect to a DVI port on your TV. Note that you may notice some [[../Bugs#The_picture_and.2For_sound_may_freeze_or_stutter.2C_particularly_on_HD_channels|stutter in the video]] with this setting. Try the HDMI mode, even if you are connecting to a DVI port. You can also try switching between modes temporarily, to solve [[../Bugs#The_picture_and.2For_sound_may_freeze_or_stutter.2C_particularly_on_HD_channels|stutter/jitter problems]] or [[../Bugs#When_turning_the_box_on.2C_it_may_not_display_a_picture.2C_the_picture_may_be_solid_green.2C_a_blue_box_may_appear_displaying_an_HDCP_error.2C_or_multiple_images_may_appear_on_HD_channels| HDCP errors]]. If you lose the video output because of HDCP errors, use the LED display to navigate switching back the output mode.
|-

|Use this setting if your TV uses [[w:RGB|RGB]] color decoding. The color will be obviously wrong if your TV does not. The conversion from [[w:Mpeg2|MPEG2]] [[w:colorspace|colorspace]] (YCbCr) to RGB is performed in the DVR.
|-
|COLOR SPACE:
|YCC 4:4:4
|yCC
|Use this setting if your TV uses [[w:YCbCr|YCbCr]] color decoding (YCbCr is abbreviated &quot;YCC&quot;). The color will be obviously wrong if your TV does not. YCbCr is the native [[w:colorspace|colorspace]] of [[w:Mpeg2|MPEG2]]. The conversion from YCbCr to RGB will occur in your TV.
|-
|AUDIO OUTPUT:
|AUTO
|AUdI
|This is the preferred setting. Use this setting under normal conditions to receive Dolby Digital when available and supported by your A/V equipment, or L-PCM when Dolby Digital is unavailable or unsupported by your A/V equipment.
|-
|AUDIO OUTPUT:
|L-PCM
|AUdI
|Use this setting if your TV does not decode [[w:Dolby Digital|Dolby Digital]]. This will convert all incoming Dolby Digital audio to [[w:PCM|Linear PCM]]. PCM is normal stereo audio, similar to what is contained on an [[w:CDDA|audio CD]], so you will lose any surround sound.
|-
|AUDIO OUTPUT:
|PASS THROUGH
|AUdI
|Use this setting if you want the native format of the incoming signal to be passed on unchanged. This will normally be Dolby Digital for digital channels, or L-PCM for analog channels. Note that this may corrupt an HDMI-&gt;DVI conversion.
|}

This is a draft in-progress for updates to the Motorola DVR page.

==Closed Caption==

The way that [[w:closed captioning|closed captioning]] works depends on the type of cable used to connect the DVR to your TV.

===Closed Caption: Coaxial, S-Video, or RCA video===

Use your TV's built-in closed caption decoding to display closed captions when you connect the DVR to the TV with any of the following: 

* Coaxial RF OUT: The typical screw-on cable connector.
* Composite video: The yellow RCA jack.
* S-Video

Your TV may have a closed caption button on the remote (often labeled &quot;CC&quot;), or else you may need to use your TV's on-screen menu system to enable decoding of closed captions.

===Closed Caption: HDMI, Component, etc===

You must use the ''USER SETTINGS'' menu on the DVR if you connect with any other cable type, including HDMI and component (YPbPr).  You can not use your TV's closed caption features because these other connections can not carry the closed caption signal.  Instead, you must tell the DVR to decode closed captions, and then overlay them on the video sent to the TV. 

Unfortunately, it is very inconvenient to switch between displaying and hiding closed captions.  You must use the ''USER SETTINGS'' menu which requires you to power-off your DVR.  After accessing the menu (see above), move down to the ''CLOSED CAPTION'' entry then change ''DISABLED'' to ''ENABLED''.  When you power on the DVR again the next time, captions will always be displayed.  

There are some other caption settings when ''ENABLED'' which are mostly self explanatory.  For ''ANALOG'', CC1 is the standard closed captioning channel. CC2, or CC3 is often used for Spanish captioning.

For more details on the limitations of HDMI and component connections, see the [[w:Closed_captioning#HDTV_interoperability_issues|HDTV interoperability issues]] section of the Wikipedia page on [[w:closed captions|closed captions]].

==Subtitle Settings==

As of [[../Firmware_and_Software#Version_16.20|Firmware 16.20]], the user menu has a ''SUBTITLE SETTINGS &gt;&gt;&gt;'' option at the top of the display. Highlighting it and pressing OK/select will switch to a second screen.

The second screen offers options for ''STATUS'' (ON or OFF), and ''LANGUAGE'' (ENG [English], FRE [French], SPA [Spanish], and POR [Portuguese].)

To exit the screen, highlight the ''RETURN TO MAIN MENU &gt;&gt;&gt;'' option at the bottom.

It's unknown what the subtitle settings are used for.

==Restore All Defaults==

''RESTORE ALL DEFAULTS'' will reset all options to common defaults.

This will typically be:
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4
|'''Setting'''
|'''Selection'''
|-
|TV TYPE
|[[w:Aspect Ratio|16:9]]
|-
|HDMI/YPbPr

=Laptop or Desktop?=

=='''Do I need a laptop?'''==

This question is rhetorical and primarily philosophical due to the word 'need'. Take away all that and you ask yourself, &quot;'''Do I ''want'' a laptop?'''&quot; That's a good question!

What does a laptop offer?

Well, that's easy to answer: a [[w:Laptop|laptop]] offers almost as much as a [[w:Desktop_computer|desktop computer]]. Desktop computers have an equivalent degree of power and hardware that a laptop would have, but the desktop computer's parts cost about half as much as a laptop. Yet some students will choose the laptop because of its ability to be transported. Desktop computers are often neglected because they can't be transported. Since desktop computers lack the ability to be transported, many students choose laptops as their scholarly device. Furthermore, desktop computers are sometimes found around the school a student attends. A student can connect to the Internet and write reports while using the school's computer. Therefore, the idea of buying a desktop computer gets neglected more and more. 

If there are already computers at school, then why does a person need a laptop? Does a person really want a laptop when other alternatives are around? After all, laptops are clunky, expensive, and can weigh around 5 lbs. The number one answer typically boils down to the ability to transport the device. Nonetheless, most students have this preconceived idea that a laptop will solve all of their problems. In other words, laptops seem like the holy grail when surfing the Internet and writing reports. Yet the &quot;surfing the Internet&quot; part seems contradicting. Unless a student is [[w:wardriving|wardriving]] or the school has wireless Internet, then he or she will be sitting at a stationary location to be on the Internet. A student would be walking around the school, go into the cafeteria, and start using his or her laptop. However, the student would be in a stationary location to use the laptop. The student could have saved hundreds of dollars by going to a room with school computers and using those computers. With this incidence, laptops seem to be a convenience and most importantly ''a want''.

During class some students may want to connect to the Internet. Some colleges and universities have cable ports located in different places; these outlets (also known as ports) allow a student to connect his or her laptop to the school's Internet server. Yet again, some of this seems contradicting. Hopefully, students wouldn't be searching the Internet in class, unless researching something. But most students research things after class; therefore, researching in class is quite odd and rare. Using the Internet in class could be seen as rude to some professors. In other words, it could be seen as deviant by some social norms. It all depends on the situation, location, time, etc. But nonetheless, most students don't use the Internet while in class. Therefore, a student could most likely use the school's computers for Internet research. Thus, a school computer would be a stationary one. Being that a stationary computer is most likely a desktop, then a student would save money if she or she doesn't buy a laptop.

Like cell-phones, a person could always go to a payphone. Then again, payphones aren't everywhere, but schools do have computers. Therefore, if a student is forced to be at a stationary location to use the Internet at school, then he or she ought to consider using the school's computer and getting a desktop computer for the home.

Now that the reasons for using a laptop for Internet usage have been eliminated (or to a degree), there is still one problem: writing.

Writing reports, notes, and other little tidbits that become important for class make a student choose the laptop. But hold up, other devices can do that too. These other devices can be transported, carried around like a laptop, are smaller than a laptop, and cost less than a laptop. Some of these devices can connect to the Internet and send email.

==About Alternatives==

'''So why do people buy laptops when there are alternatives?'''

I don't know, but I do know there are multiple alternatives: [[w:palm pilot|palm pilot]], [[w:Tablet_pc|tablet PCs]], [[w:Personal_digital_assistant|PDAs]], [[w:Voyage_200|calculators]] with QWERTY keyboard, etc. If you're looking for a computer to transport, these would be your the type of thing. They are small and versatile. An example of the Texas Instruments keyboard can be seen at this external link: [http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/productDetail/us_ti_keyboard.html click here to view.]

For a student looking forward to take notes in class and very little else, then he or she would do fine with a calculator and keyboard. A problem with choosing a calculator, however, would be the amount of Kilobytes and storage space on the calculator. 

''Math time!''

A calculator, such as the TI-89, has about 700 Kilobytes of memory set aside for the user. A kilobyte is comprised of 1024 bytes. Therefore, 700*1024=716800 bytes. But it takes 8 bits (8 bits = 1 byte) to create a letter on a computer--a letter such as the letter A or B or a semicolon. And some people say an elementary word is made of five letters. Therefore, the calculator can hold approximately 143360 words or less. The complaint I've seen from people who use the TI calculators is that the calculators don't have an adequate amount of memory. This article section of Wikibooks (Laptop or Desktop?), however, has about 9000 characters. 

That's 
*(9000 characters) * (8 bits) = 72000 bytes
or
*(72000 bytes) / (1024 bytes in a kilobyte) = 70 kilobytes taken up = (1/10 of the memory set aside on a TI-89)

'''In other words, a person may not be able to type of the next literary novel to shake the world based on its ethical and scientific revolutions on a Texas Instrument calculator, but it will do for an English paper or notes.'''

For a student who would like to take notes with a laptop, some people have been turning to keyboards that connect to PDAs. ([http://freedominput.com/mainsite/index.php external link])

This method is often more versatile, affordable, and convenient. Laptop batteries can cost above $100 USD to replace, and the laptop batteries take a long time to recharge. The reason people have been turning to freedom keyboards and PDAs is because batteries can be bought at a store at a more affordable price. Finding a powersource for a PDA with keyboard attachment is easier than a laptop.

After having my own experience of &quot;laptop vs. a desktop computer,&quot; I would have to say a laptop is futile compared to the keyboard and PDA setup. My laptop has saved me at times, but the amount of time the batteries offer has depleted. I find that using a keyboard with a PDA setup is more efficient and easier to deal with. Depending on the type of laptop someone buys, it can be heavy or light. Usually, the lighter a laptop, the more expensive it is.

With the PDA and keyboard setup, a person gets a very light setup for an affordable price. Laptops are nice, but I would highly suggest someone buys a very light and inexpensive one.

Desktops are easier to deal with, and they are often hard to steal without the thief being noticed. For a person living in a dorm, having a laptop stolen is a great expense compared to a desktop. 

I have become more annoyed with laptops as new portable technology comes out. Laptops are good for viewing PDF files, webpages, and other materials in privacy, but a person can find ways to save money and view those things on a desktop computer at home or at campus.

If money was no object, I would probably choose the PDA keyboard console setup over a very light laptop. Getting batteries are charging a laptop can be annoying. The amount of power a laptop battery can hold over time depletes as the owner keeps recharging it; thus, the owner would most likely be using an AC adapter all the time for the laptop. Finding a power outlet in a college classroom isn't easy. Otherwise, go with a tablet pc.

A tablet PC is nice because of its ability to be transferred from one place to another. However, it does require an external powersource if it is being used for long periods of time. This can be a problem for students that do not have the ability to sit next to a power outlet in a classroom.

The other alternative that is like the PDA and keyboard setup is the TI-Keyboard by Texas Instruments. This keyboard hooks up to a TI-Calculator (certain series only) and can be an affordable choice. TI-Calculators can range from $30 USD to $100 and above. The keyboard costs around $40 USD and comes to a total cost of around $80 USD for a keyboard and calculator. The benefit of using the keyboard and calculator is that both will be necessary tools to the math student. A student that takes math courses can use the calculator for math, and he or she could use it when taking notes in a different course.

Both things end up being keepers in the long run and have many uses. However, the alternatives that take household batteries can be the better than other alternatives. Household batteries can be bought almost anywhere, and the lithium batteries give more power than alkaline batteries.

== MS Office or...? ==
If you bought a desktop computer or laptop, then a good office suite would be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openoffice.org Openoffice.org]

Openoffice.org is more affordable than [[Microsoft Office]]. Actually, it's totally FREE. 
This program can be used on Windows, Linux, and Macintosh computers.

It differs from Microsoft Office and can be a little complex to get use to at first. The controls are a bit different than MS Office but a person can find help documentation for that. Overall, learning how to use openoffice.org is a very valuable skill.

* Openoffice.org allows a person to save in .doc format.

If a person is willing to use Openoffice.org for home use, but wants to manipulate files at school that have MS Office, then this is how a person would go about it.

# Compile a file on Openoffice.org
# Save the file on a floppy disk, jump drive, or other storage medium.
# Bring the file to school and load it into MS Office
# Manipulate the file with MS Office until you are satisfied.

=== Notes about the Jumpdrive ===
I've known people to lose these things extraordinarily quick. These things need to be chained around the neck or around keys. Either way, these things are the best thing around when it comes to transporting a storage medium. I love the things. I like the ability to store Pocket Firefox and other programs so I don't have to deal with the hassle of downloading programs the lazy administrators don't want to upgrade. If a person were to get the PDA console setup, he or she could put all the drivers and programs on the jumpdrive instead of carrying the original setup CD around. That way, a person can upload files from the PDA onto a computer and then onto the jumpdrive.

==Learn FTP==

FTP will save you a lot of grief. Learn to work on files and save them to multiple storage mediums: email, jumpdrive, CD, FTP server, etc.

Being able to upload to an FTP is a valuable skill. If a person were to lose a disk with schoolwork on it at the last moment, he or she could go onto the FTP server, download the document he or she uploaded, and then put it on a disk or send it to the professor's email.

Websites that offer FTP are free. I suggest all college students learn how to use FTP.

It's a lot more simple than the complexity people show.

# Go to a website that offers free webspace and FTP access
# Search around that website for information on how to use FTP for it
# Download an FTP program
# Start playing around with the FTP program, uploading, and downloading.

Hey someone should put somewhere in there the tip that you can also use blender alone to create skybox textures for some other project. i.e. make a scene in blender and envmap it to the cube.

I managed to get an environment map. How do i use it in a blender game? Like the one in the previous tutorial?

The textures are drawn only on the outside of the skydome, not the inside where it's needed.    Perhaps this article needs updating for 2.49b or 3.0.  In game, the dome looks black even with sun lighting. Also textures don't display with viewport set to draw type: texture (shaded mode works). --[[User:Spudgunne|Spudgunne]] ([[User talk:Spudgunne|talk]]) 20:19, 12 October 2009 (UTC)</text>

This section should stay seperate, and needs to be substantially edited and added to.

There is a large amount of arguable and circumstantial information provided, as well has an immense lack of information in many areas.

Are the basics addressed? Yes. But for the depth of information presented, it should be revised to have some corrections made, as well as more information added.

I agree that a lot of the discussion is unsubstantiated or worse.  I think a lot of basic stuff is missing.  The material that is present is more like a how-to guide than a real detailed treatment of the material.  There is no discussion of frequency hopping, channel allocation, the relationship between US, European and other countries wireless regulation .  Missing material includes 802.11a, 802.11n , pre-N and other variants plus all of the non-802.11 network variants.

__TOC__



=Types of Mass Spectrometry=
Previous Section: [[Proteomics/Protein Identification - Mass Spectrometry/Instrumentation| Instrumentation]]
==AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry)==
In [[w:Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS]] (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry), a “tandem accelerator” is used to accelerate the ions at several million volts. This tandem accelerator works twice. During the first stage, negative ions are created from an ion source. These negative ions are accelerated by an electrostatic accelerator to very high kinetic energies. Then a sheet of carbon is introduced in to the instrument, to convert the negative ions into positive ions. Since these ions are positive now, they accelerate away from the center. Hence these ions while leaving the accelerator are moving very fast. Now a velocity selector with a combination of both electric and magnetic fields is used to allow the ions with particular and kinetic energy. Then m/z is determined by passing through a magnetic or electric sector mass analyzer.

==Gas Chromatography-MS==
Gas chromatography separates the components of a mixture and mass spectroscopy characterizes each of the components individually. This method is a preferred method within the proteomics community, and is known as a &quot;golden standard&quot; for analysis.[[http://www.scientific.org/tutorials/articles/gcms.html]] In gas chromatography (GC), the mobile phase is an inert gas such as helium. Gas chromatography is a method in which molecules are separated based on volatility and bond characteristics when subjected to a carrier gas. The sample enters a vacuum chamber through an inlet and is converted into gas phase ions.  The ions are sorted according to their mass to charge ratios, usually with a quadrupole or ion trap. This data is converted into representative electrical signals and finally, a mass spectrum is created.  

[[Image:Gas chromatograph.png|thumb|350px|right|Diagram of a gas chromatograph.]]

This technique is a simple type of [[Proteomics/Protein Separations - Chromatography| chromatography]] that is coupled to a mass spectrometer. When coupled with MS it is known as a hyphenated analytical technique due to the combination of two separately performed techniques. Dependent on the type of chromatography, buffers, and conditions, some methods of separations can be coupled with MS and some cannot. GC is a method that can normally be coupled with MS due to the samples already being in a volatile form, the form that MS can only read in. Due to the lack of buffers and salts this method does not interfere with the MS detection ability.  

A great advantage to this method is that a researcher can take an organic solution, inject it into the instrument, separate the individual components, and identify each of them. Furthermore, the researcher can determine the quantities (concentrations) of each of the components. 

There are some important limitations to GC-MS:

If the GC instrument does not separate the samples compounds completely or correctly, the MS feed is impure. If this occurs, background noise can appear in the mass spectrum resulting in poor resolution and poor retention times which can cause significant error in data.

Of course, the MS portion of the coupling involves a large amount of analysis from a skilled technician. Many aspects come into play, and the analyst must correlate computer calculations with system conditions. This can produce a large amount of human error within the data.

==Liquid Chromatography-MS==

[[Image:NanoESIFT.jpg|thumb|Picture of electrospray needle]] LC-MS separates compounds chromatographically before they are introduced to the ion source and mass spectrometer by means of using liquid mobile phases which ultimately must be volatilized before entering the MS. It differs from GC-MS in that the mobile phase is liquid, usually a combination of water, organic solvents, and samples instead of gases. The method of coupling high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can also be performed with MS. A HPLC simply uses a smaller column that is highly chemically modified to separate on a more precise level than normal LC.  Once a sample is injected it goes through a column which separates it based on charge and goes into a drying chamber where the sample is volatilized by a drying gas such as N2. The ions are then collected into a gas capillary where they are collected to be injected further in the system. When the ions proceed out of the gas capillary, the ions go through an area where collision activated dissociation occurs between a skimmer and the capillary, causing the ions to exit individually. The area where the gas capillary and the skimmer meet is the area where volatilization begins. From the capillary, the liquid ions are put through a &quot;Taylor cone&quot;.  The Taylor cone creates the effect of a fine filament of liquid that volatilizes into a gaseous form by changing its stable liquid droplets to unstable liquid droplets before changing them to gas phase ions. The samples then proceed to an inlet for the mass spectroscopy machine into a quadrupole where they are further separated by charge to mass and then moved to a detector to obtain a mass spectrum.

==ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass spectrometry )==

ICP-MS involves the formation of gas containing electrons, ions and neutral particles from Argon gas. The sample is atomized and ionized by this gas. In a high vacuum mass analyzer, these ionized atoms from gas are passed through cones (apertures). Based on the m/z ratio, the isotopes of the elements can be identified. The intensity of the element’s peak in the mass spectrum will be proportional to the amount of the isotope in the original sample[http://web.missouri.edu/~umcreactorweb/pages/ac_icpms1.shtml ].

==IRMS (Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry)==

[[w:Isotope ratio mass spectrometery|Isotope ratio mass spectrometery]] (IRMS) is used to measure mixture of stable isotopes. It has two inlets that help in repetitive measurements with continuous supply of sample gases. This supply is sequentially switched over by a valve. This instrument has collector with conductive metal vessels that neutralizes ions, also multicollectors in some of them allowing detection of multiple isotopes. Samples that are introduced in to this instrument should be pure gases obtained from combustion or chemical trapping. An isotopic make up of a sample can be obtained by comparing the standard isotopes to the detected isotopes from the sample.

==Ion Mobility Spectrometry-MS==

Previously it was believed that this method could not be coupled with MS due to its non-volatile state as well as reaction of buffers, however a few groups have been experimenting with techniques and methods to couple these two performances to be able to analyze simple samples. Experiments and current tests are attempting to couple these two by using a curtain gas from the MS as a drift gas for the ion mobility to allow proper gaseous form for the MS to run. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/109799746/ABSTRACT] This method is believed to be a fast and cheaper alternative to the slower expensive methods of separations for those samples that do not require much resolution. 

The design of the ion mobility spectrometer allows reasonably fast installation (about 1 hour), and thus the ion mobility spectrometer can be considered as an accessory of the mass spectrometer. The ion mobility spectrometer module can also be used as an independently operated device when equipped with a Faraday cup detector. The drift tube of the ion mobility spectrometer module consists of inlet, desolvation, drift, and extraction regions. The desolvation, drift and extraction regions are separated by ion gates. The inlet region has the shape of a stainless steel cup equipped with a small orifice. Ion mobility spectrometer drift gas is introduced through a curtain gas line from an original flange of the mass spectrometer. After passing through the drift tube, the drift gas serves as a curtain gas for the ion-sampling orifice of the ion mobility spectrometer before entering the ion source. Counter-flow of the drift gas improves evaporation of the solvent from the electrosprayed sample. Drift gas is pumped away from the ion source through the original exhaust orifice of the ion source. Initial characterization of the ion mobility spectrometer device includes determination of resolving power values for a selected set of test compounds, separation of a simple mixture, and comparison of the sensitivity of the electrospray ionization ion mobility spectrometry/mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS/MS) mode with that of the ESI-MS mode.

==MALDI-TOF==
Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation (MALDI) (F. Hillenkamp, 1991) deals with thermolabile, non-volatile organic compounds and those of high molecular mass. It is used in for the analysis of proteins, peptides, glycoproteins, oligosaccharides, and oligonucleotides. 

MALDI is based on the usage of matrix complexed with a given sample molecule that is bombarded with a laser in order for the sample molecule to form a sample ionization. The sample is normally mixed into a high absorbable matrix with as little matrix as possible as the matrix will also become excited and come off and ionize as well. The matrix itself acts as a substance which infuses the sample as well as a transformer for the laser's energy into excitation energy to allow for the vaporization of the sample ions and matrix ions from the surface of the matrix. Most commercially available MALDI mass spectrometers are now a pulsed nitrogen laser of wavelength 337 nm. This method is normally coupled with a Time of Flight detector in order to obtain proper charge-mass ratios and calculate a mass spectrum.

&lt;!-- this part seems clumsy--&gt;
Samples for this procedure are prepared based on retaining homogeneous MALDI sample. This would include focusing on the concentration of the matrix and analyte, the choice of matrix, the analyte sample history, such as how its exposure to strong ionic detergents and formic acid may affect it, also hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of both the matrix and sample, and possible contaminants and compatible solubilities of matrix and analyte solutions.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldi]

==SELDI-TOF==
Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption Ionization is a modification of the procedure used in MALDI.  Instead of mixing the UV sensitive matrix with the protein sample, the protein sample is spotted on a plate which has some surface binding characteristics such as a chromatographic array.  The spots are then washed to remove impurities and weakly bound proteins.  The UV matrix is then added to the spot and allowed to co-crystallize.  After the ionization with the UV laser, the ions are analyzed using a TOF mass analyzer, in the same manner as MALDI.

SELDI provides on-chip separation as well as the capability to perform enzymatic reactions directly on the chip.  However, there are concerns about the reproducibility of SELDI-TOF mass spectra, especially when normal post processing techniques frequently used with MALDI such as baseline correction are applied.  Environmental sources of variation such as humidity can also play a large role.([http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/screenpdf/20/5/777 Baggerly et al. 20 (5): 777. (2004)

==Tandem MS==
Tandem Mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is spectrometer used to separate ions based on a sample's &quot;electronic&quot; mass using two or more quadrupoles. A sample is normally coupled into tandem MS via chromatography method, normally an electron spray method like gas chromatography or liquid chromatography where the contents are volatilized. More popular tandem mass spectrometers are quadrupole-quadrupole, magnetic sector-quadrupole , and the quadrupole-time-of-flight geometries (P. Roepstorrf, 1989)

The Tandem MS is constructed of two or more quadrupoles, with a collision cell separating each quadrupole. Once a sample has been separated by chromatography, the substances initially go through an initial quadrupole which separates the mixture of ions allotting only certain ions (Pre-cursor ions), passage to the collision cell. The first quadropole is used to select user-specified sample ions from a specific component; usually the molecular-related (i.e (M+H)+ or (M-H)-) ions. Within the collision cell the Precursor-ions also known as &quot;Parent ions&quot; are then bombarded with an inert gas (Xe, Ar, ect ) and are further broken down into different charged and mass ions (Product ions). These product ions also known as &quot;Daughter ions&quot; are then run through an additional quadrupole to further separate the ions which is set to monitor specific ion fragments. This process can be repeated several times in order to get highly specific readings. 

In peptide sequencing, selected ion components are either positive (M+H)+ or negative (M-H)- ions.  The selected ions will pass into the collision cell, there are three different types of bonds that can fragment along the amino acid backbone: NH-CH, CH-CO, and CO-NH.  For each of these fragments, the charge can be maintained by either the N or C-terminal fragment.  There are actually six different types of fragments that can be formed.  The mass difference between two fragments of the same type is indicative of a particular amino acid. [http://www.astbury.leeds.ac.uk/facil/MStut/mstutorial.htm]

This technique is primarily used with peptide sequencing due to the parent-daughter ion scanning. Due to the two ions being scanned initially as a precursor and product ion, a mass fingerprinting can occur where through further analysis and investigation the fragments of ions can be pieced together to determine a peptide sequence. Since it is known that amino acid backbone fragments among the NH-CH, CH-CO, and CO-NH bonds, each type of bond can give rise to six different type of species, and these can then be pieced together to provide peptide fragmentation.

==TIMS (Thermal Ionization-Mass Spectrometry)==

TIMS (Thermal Ionization-Mass Spectrometry) is a mass spectrometer that can make exact measurements of isotope ratios of thermally ionizable elements. This ionization can be done by passing them through metal ribbons under vacuum. The resulting ions are accelerated by electrical potential gradient and they are focused into a beam using electrostatically charged plates and slits. The beam is passed through a magnetic field and based on the m/z ratio the original beam produces many separated beams. Using collectors, these separated beams are converted into voltage and exact isotope ratios can be obtained by comparing these beams to their individual ion beams[http://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/techniques/TIMS.html].

==SSMS (Spark Source Mass Spectrometry)==
SSMS (Spark Source Mass Spectrometry) can ionize the analytes in solid samples using electric current with two electrodes. It works as one electrode if the sample is metal or can be placed in a cup-shaped electrode by mixing with graphite[http://www.chemistry.adelaide.edu.au/external/soc-rel/content/ionizatn.htm].

==How does a Mass Spectrometer work?==
[[Image:WidmoMS.gif|thumb|300px]]
A mass spectrometer is made up of three components: an ion source, mass analyzer, and a detector. The unknown sample which may originate as solid, liquid, solution or vapor, is presented to the ionization source. After ionizing the sample, the ions of the sample are passed to the mass analyzer region where separation based on the mass-to-charge ratio occurs. Once separated by the analyzer, the ions then enter the detector portion of the mass spectrometer. At this point, the machine calculates the mass-to-charge ratio and the relative abundance of each of the different ions. From this information, a spectrum graph can be created such as the one to the right.

Most mass spectrometers are maintained under a vacuum to improve the chances of ions traveling from ionization source to detector without interference by collision with air molecules.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==Ion Source==
The ion source is the mass spectrometer component which ionizes the sample to be analyzed.  Ionization mainly serves to present the sample as vaporized ions which can be acted upon by the mass analyzer and measured by the ion detector.  There are many different methods available to ionize samples, such as positive or negative ion modes.  The ionization method chosen should depend on the type of sample and the type of mass spectrometer. 

'''Ionization Methods:''' [[Image:ES-MassSpec.jpeg|thumb|Electronspray ionization]][[Image:maldi.PNG|thumb|MALDI]]&lt;br&gt;
There are three types of ionization methods, electron ionization, chemical ionization and photo-induced ionization. Electron ionization involves application of an electrical current to the sample to induce ionization. Chemical ionization involves interaction of the sample with reagent molecules to induce ionization. Ions produced are often denoted with symbols that indicate the nature of the ionization, eg. [M+H]+ is used to represent a molecule which is protonated.

*Electron ionization&lt;br&gt; 
**[[w:Electrospray_ionization|Electrospray Ionization]]&lt;br&gt;
**[[w:Field_desorption|Field Desorption / Field Ionization]]&lt;br&gt;
*Chemical Ionization&lt;br&gt; 
**[[w:MALDI-TOF|Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization]]&lt;br&gt;
**[[w:Fast_atom_bombardment|Fast Atom Bombardment]]&lt;br&gt; 
**[[w:Thermal_ionization|Thermal Ionisation]]&lt;br&gt;

The methods commonly used in proteomics are ‘Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization’ or MALDI and ‘Electrospray Ionization’ also known as ESI.  Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and Atmospheric pressure photo-ionization are two other forms as well.

'''MALDI''' uses a solid support target plate where a UV active matrix (solid or liquid) is spotted on the plate followed by the sample over the matrix. The laser hits the spot on the crystallized matrix and transfers energy from the matrix molecule to the sample. This energy transfer vaporizes the sample, sending a plume of ions into the MALDI source. This plume of ions is then collected and held in the source until a pulse sends them all out simultaneously. If the MALDI is attached to a Time of Flight(TOF) mass analyzer these ions are then sent down the TOF tube (typically ~2m) and are separated according to their velocity (light ions hitting first). MALDI is the preferred instrumentation for proteomics due to ease of reading the spectrum; most ions are found in the +1 charge state [M+H].

'''Electrospray''', on the other hand, is done by injecting the sample dissolved in a slightly acidic solution through a heated capillary that has a voltage around 10v. This allows for highly charged particles to be formed at the tip of the capillary. As the particles evaporate, their charge/volume increases to a point where charge repulsion forces take over and the particle will explode. A small drop will form which continues the process until individual molecules are in the gas phase and charged. These ions will then travel into the analyzer, typically a quadrupole, to be scanned one mass at a time. The molecules in electrospray tend to be multiply charged and even though the upper mass limit of a quadrupole is 2000 m/z, the multiple charges allow for high mass ions or proteins to be identified. Proteins will have a charge envelope in which each peak has a different amount of charges on them. Special software is needed to deconvolve the multiple charge species peaks into a single mass peak, such as MassLynx from Waters. This form of ionization is good for most compounds, although is not best with neutral or low polarity molecules. 

'''Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization''' involves interaction of the sample with reagent molecules to induce ionization. As in electrospray ionization, liquid is pumped through a capillary. At the tip it is nebulized and a corona discharge takes place ionizing the molecules. The molecules interact with the analyte and transfer their charge. This form of ionization is good for small thermally stable molecules. 

'''Atmospheric pressure photo-ionization''' uses photons to excite and ionize the molecules after they have been nebulized. This form of ionization is good for neutral compounds.
&lt;br&gt;

==Mass Analyzers==
The mass analyzer is the component that separates the ions created from the ion source by their mass-to-charge ratios.  Mass analyzers are based on the principles of charged particles in an electric or magnetic field.  By using Lorentz force law and Newton’s second law of motion you can generate the following equation:

 &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;math&gt;(\frac{m}{q}) \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{E}+ \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Where m is the mass, the ionic charge is q , a the acceleration, E is the electric field, and the vector cross product of the ion velocity and the magnetic field is v x B.   This equation says that two particles with the same mass to charge ratio (m/q) will behave exactly the same. 

So what this equation is basically saying is that the mass to charge ratio acts as a determinant of acceleration of the ion, which can also be represented as the addition of the electric field plus the cross product of the ion velocity and magnetic field.


''' Scanning Mass Analyzers '''

Scanning mass analyzers need to separate the ions based on their relative abundances and mass to charge ratios.  Electromagnetic fields are used to separate the ions based on their mass to charge ratios, by using a slit they are able to regulate which mass to charge ratio ions get to the detector. Once selected for a particular mass to charge ratio, the ion current is then recorded as a function of time which is analagous to mass.


''' Sector Mass Spectrometer '''

Mass spectrometer that uses a mass analyzer using magnetic, electric or static sector in it is called a sector instrument. This also works in combination of sectors like BEB, magnetic-electric-magnetic. In the present days, these sector instruments are mostly double focusing i.e, the ion beams are focused in both direction and velocity. Here is how a magnetic sector mass spectrometer works, imagine a tube like thing between two electromagnets. When the electrons are passed through the tube from one end to another the magnetic field bends the electron stream by exerting turning force on it. Then m/z ratio is determined. 

''' Orbitrap Mass spectrometer '''

Orbitrap Mass spectrometer is the one in which ions are subjected to an electric field produced by electrodes tangentially. Also these ions are trapped between outer electrodes, where as ions are attracted with an electrostatic attraction to the inner electrode which is balanced by centrifugal force. Therefore these ions move in a circular manner around the inner electrode also back and forth with a particular m/z ratio. By using this ion oscillation based on the m/z ratio, the trap can act as a mass analyzer.



''' Quadrupole Mass Spectrometers '''

You can think of this method as a filter or funnel  which only allows certain ion masses to pass through.  The &quot;funnel&quot; is actually a combination of positively and negatively charged metal rods which together form a channel through which the ions travel.  The theory is that only selected masses will be able to pass through the channel, as all other ions won't have a stable trajectory though it and will hit the quadrupole rods, stopping the ion from reaching the detector.

''' Ion trap Quadrupole Spectrometer ''' 

A quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer consists of hyperbolic electrodes with a ring and two endcaps, which is the core of this instrument. In this method, ions are trapped and then sequentially ejected into a conventional electron multiplier detector from the ion trap. That way all ions can be stored during the process of mass analysis. Recent findings showed that using 1 mtorr of helium gas in the trapping volume substantially improved the resolution of the instrument with the kinetic energy of the ions reducing and the ion trajectories contracted to the center of the trap. A packet can be formed with a given m/z ions. This spectrometer is used widely for commercial purposes because of the high resolution and it is inexpensive. 

''' Linear Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer '''

In the linear ion trap mass spectrometer the ions are trapped within a set of quadrupole rods to hold the ions radially and end electrodes to maintain the ions axially with a static electrical potential. It is simply said that unlike Quadrupole Ion Trap, which uses a 3-D field, Linear Quadrupole Ion Trap uses a 2-D field. It has a selective mass filter that detects the ions of particular m/z ratio. This method has advantages like higher ion storage capacity and faster scanning technique.

''' Time of Flight Mass Analyzers '''

The TOF (Time of Flight) is a mass analyzer that allows ions to flow down a field free region; which allows the ions with a greater velocity, lighter ions, to hit the detector first. This is especially compatible with MALDI due to the fact that the TOF needs a pulsed instrument for its source. In this way ions are generated in the MALDI source and held there for a brief time and all are pulsed into the TOF at the same exact time. In this way, If all ions have the same kinetic energy, the ions with the lower mass will have a higher velocity and reach the detector first; whereas the ions with the higher mass will have a lower velocity and hit the detector last.


The kinetic energy of an ion leaving a source if given by:

     &lt;math&gt; T=eV= \frac{mv^2}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Where velocity v is defined by the Length of the path L divided by time t. 

     &lt;math&gt; v= \frac{L}{t} &lt;/math&gt;

By substituting this equation into the first and solving for time you arrive at.

     &lt;math&gt;t=L * \sqrt{( \frac{m}{e})*( \frac{1}{2V})}&lt;/math&gt;

From this equation you can easily see how mass directly affects travel time.  Mass is directly proportional to time.  Using the m/e portion of the equation you can clearly see how a larger mass means a longer time, and likewise how a lower mass would mean a smaller m/e and thus shorter travel time.


''' Ion Cyclotron Resonance Spectrometer '''

ICR is a form of trapped Ion mass analyzer, that specifically is defined as a static trap. It is basically a box with three parallel metal sides.  Trapped ion analyzers work by keeping the ions in the trap and controlling the ions by using positive and negatively charged electrical fields in a carefully series of timed events.

ICR specifically works on the principle that in a magnetic field, ions move in a circular path whose frequency is mass dependent.  So using the cyclotron frequency you can surmise the mass.  Equating the Lorentz force in a magnetic field to the equation for centripetal force yields.

     &lt;math&gt; evB= \frac{mv^2}{r} &lt;/math&gt;


You can then easily solve the above equation for the frequency F or
     &lt;math&gt; F= \frac{v}{r} &lt;/math&gt;

Groups of ions with the same mass to charge ratios will have the same cyclotron frequency but may be moving out of synch with one another, this is why an excitation pulse is needed to bring the resonant ions into phase with one another and the excitation pulse.  Next the ions which will be passing close to the ICR cell receiver plates cause &quot;image currents&quot; which can be collected and amplified and analyzed. This signal registered in the receiver plates depends both on the number of ions and their distances from the receiver plates.

''' Fourier transformation '''

This mass spectrometry includes a mass analyzer that uses cyclotron frequency of the ions to determine their m/z ratio. Here a magnetic field with electric trapping plates known as penning trap is used to hold the ions. An oscillating electric field with the magnetic field at right angle to it is used to excite the trapped ions to a larger cyclotron radius. This results in packets of oscillating ions. The trapping plates detects the signal as a image current and results in a interferogram with sine waves called free induction decay (FID). By performing a Fourier transform to this data, a mass spectrum can be generated with useful signal.

==Detector==
Those ions which pass through analyzer are now separated by the desired methods.  This mass spectrometry component records the charge induced by an ion passing by a surface or current produced when an ion hits a surface.  From these charges or currents, a mass spectrum can be produced as well as measure the total number of ions at each each m/z which are present.  Due to the fact that the number of ions entering the detector at any given moment is minuscule, signal amplification is often necessary.

One benefit of Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry is there are different configurations to allow for results more geared toward the experiment.

'''Summary'''[[image:Ms_block_schematic.gif|right|400px|Block Diagram of an LC-MS System]]

LC-MS was slow to take off due to inefficient technologies. However, in the mid 1990’s, after new technologies were developed, it became more popular. This was in part due to its high specificity and ability to handle more complex mixtures than the other options available at the time, such as GC-MS. Mass spectrometry starts by ionizing samples to generate charged molecule fragments then analyzing their mass to charge-ratio. There are different technologies used to perform the mass spectrometry part of LC-MS to obtain different results, some being more versatile than others, such as changing the ion source, changing the mass analyzer, changing the ion suppression as well as changing the direct injection method.

Different ion sources that can be used clinically would be an electrospray ionization source, an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source or an atmospheric pressure photo-ionization source. Electrospray ionization, also known as ESI, works well on polar molecules; metabolites, xenobiotics and peptides are some examples. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source, also known as APCI, is great analyzer for small thermally stable molecules and neutral non-polar molecules such as free steroids. Atmospheric pressure photo-ionization, also known as APPI, works well with neutral compounds such as steroids.

There are four different types of mass analyzers that can be used; these are the quadrupole analyzers, time-of-flight analyzers, ion trap analyzers, and hybrid analyzers. Quadrupole analyzers are are widely used because their ease of scanning and good quality quantitative data. Time-of-flight analyzers are used for small molecules because of its high sensitivity. Ion trap analyzers have the ability to fragment an ionize ions several times giving so-called MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; capabilities. Hybrid analyzers can be switched between ion trap mode and conventional quadrupole mode.

There are also different steps that can be changed in the Liquid Chromatography part of LC-MS to make the procedure more versatile such as changing the flow rate, the mobile phase, the resolution and through-put and the quanitation (calibration). The parameters and conditions involved in LC-MS can be changed to optimize the assay. However, these conditions are specific to the particular analyte and the LC separation. Therefore there are no general conditions. Some of these conditions include using a dilute solution of the analyte and using single MS or tandem MS. It is also important to make sure the LC-MS system is working properly with protocols to detect deviations from normal performance. LC-MS is used in the Biochemical screening for genetic disorders as well as therapeutic drug monitoring and steroid hormones.

===What is Mass Spectrometry?===

Chiu CM, Muddiman DC. http://www.asms.org/whatisms/index.html (3/28/09)

'''Main Focus'''

This website discusses what mass spectrometry is, the history behind it, and how it works.

'''Summary'''

Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known compounds, and to elucidate the structure and chemical properties of molecules. Compounds can be identified at very low concentrations. Mass spectrometry is used by a wide range of professionals such as physicians, astonomers, and biologists. For example it can monitor the breath of patients by anesthesiologists during surgery and determine the composition of molecular species found in space. It can be used to identify structures of biomolecules as well sequence them. It is also used to identify and quantitate compounds of complex organic mixtures.
Mass spectrometry was invented by J.J. Thomson in a  vacuum tube. His invention was used to discover a number of isotopes, to determine the relative abundance of the isotopes, and to measure their &quot;exact masses&quot; which are important in the foundation for later developments in diverse fields ranging from geochronology to biochemical research.

A mass spectrometer is an instrument that measures the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions by becoming electrically charged. A mass spectrometer does not actually measure the molecular mass directly, but rather the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions formed from the molecules. The charge on an ion is denoted by the integer number of the fundamental unit of charge, and the mass-to-charge ratio. It represents daltons per fundamental unit of charge. Results are in a generated mass spectrum. A mass spectrum is a graph of ion intensity as a function of mass-to-charge ratio.

Proteomics is the study of the protein and is defined as the qualitative and quantitative comparison of proteomes under different conditions to further unravel biological processes. Mass spectrometry allows for the study of the components of an organism and how they create their individual functions.

__TOC__


==Protein Identification==
The process of protein identification through mass spectrometry is done in two main ways:
*Peptide Mass Fingerprinting&lt;br&gt;
*Tandem MS&lt;/br&gt;

Peptide mass fingerprinting typically uses the masses of peptides derived from a spectrum as to check against a database of predicted peptide masses.  These predicted masses are recorded from digestion of a list of well documented proteins. If a protein sequence has a significant number of predicted masses that match the experimental values, there is a excellent chance that the given protein is present in the sample.  Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometers are the instrumentation that is commonly used for this type of peptide analysis.

The other technique that is typically used is Tandem MS.  This technique utilizes collision-induced dissociation.  This process breaks proteins within the peptide backbone and because of this fragmentation, comparisons between the observed fragment sizes and the database of predicted masses is possible.  A very similar method to the Tandem MS approach is peptide fragmentation fingerprinting or 'PFF'.  Instead of utilizing collision-induced dissociation, this method uses enzymatic digestion of a single peptide to generate a fragmentation pattern.  These fragments are analyzed and compared to a database of observed fragments for the particular enzyme in a method similar to the Tandem MS approach.  Tandem MS and and peptide fragmentation fingerprinting can also be used for protein sequencing.

Only about four to five peptides are adequate to accurately identify a protein with a known amino acid sequence.  Surprisingly, as the identification information contained within databases increases, the amount of information required to identify a specific protein increases.  Over time, the number of peptides required to identify a protein has risen.  In some cases, a specific peptide fragment or a few fragments in rare combination are unique to a particular type or class of protein.  This fragment or group of fragments can be used as signature peptides to identify the presence of the particular protein.  These signature fragments exist for both collision-induced dissociation and enzymatic digestion.  The recognition of a fragment as an effective signature fragment requires a significant amount of background information.

==Protein Sequencing==
Tandem MS can be used in conjunction with fragmentation methods such as trypsin digestion. This allows a sample to generate overlapping peptides of varying length. This method works in a similar fashion to the approach taken by genome sequencers, when they  generate overlapping DNA sequence fragments and assemble into the genome. On the mass spectra, the mass difference between two overlapping peaks can be used to determine the difference in sequence based on the well documented data on the weights of the amino acids. Sequences are usually determined using one or more search algorithms linked to an appropriate database, such as the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/IPIhelp.html International Protein Index (IPI)] at the European Bioinformatics Institute or the nr (non-redundant) protein sequence database provided by NCBI. Commonly used search algorithms include SEQUEST, X! Tandem, and MASCOT.

==Quantitative Proteomics==
There are several methods available for the quantitation of proteins using mass spectrometry. These typically involve some labeling method to differentiate between two different cell types.  In isotopic labeling, heavier isotopes are introduced to one sample while lighter isotopes are used to label the other. Before mass spectrometry analysis, these two differentially labeled samples are mixed. The peptide fragments associated with the samples can be differentiated based on their mass differences. The quantification is made by the comparison of the peak ratio of the intensities on the mass spectrum to derive the relative abundance. Multiple methods currently exist which are widely employed in quantitative proteomics, including stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture, isotope-coded affinity tags and metal coded tags.

The objective of quantitative proteomics is to determine quantitative information about a particular protein sample. Although qualitative provide insights that are of value, quantitative datasets give a larger understanding. Quantitative proteomics is a cellular technique that is based on the use of mass spectrometry. Such quantitative technique enables the detection of quantitative changes in proteins and their post-translational modifications in biological systems.

Generally, major quantitative proteomics methods assist in carrying out the analysis of protein complexes, where the priority is to gain access to information on the bona fide interactions of affinity tagged protein of interest. This action is crucial in providing a certain understanding to the novel interactions with known proteins, which can unravel the mysteries of unknown proteins. The bona fide protein interactions can be examined with bait proteins and protein complexes that are usually carried out with or without stable isotopes. The study of the interactions of protein complexes have been made possible by affinity purification and specific quantitative proteomics techniques -such as the combination of cleavable ICAT, iTRAQ, and DNA-affinity purification.

Quantitative proteomic analyses of protein complexes also serve the purpose of determining the changes in protein-protein interactions within a protein complex under various cellular conditions. For example, an approach based on SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acid in Cell culture) is used to examine the mechanics of the TATA binding proteins along with their phosphorylation states during the cell cycle. Moreover, SILAC provides an analysis of the circadian rhythm mechanistic features and the extracellular signal regulation of kinases interactions under certain conditions.

Profoundly, quantitative proteomics has grown a useful application in the analysis of protein interaction networks. Despite the advanced technological approaches in discovering the protein complexes, these complexes mostly function with other protein complexes and most proteins inhabit in more than one distinct complex. Quantitative proteomic therefore has the ability to confirm the many functions of protein complexes when interacting with protein complexes, and to address questions in determining the probability of protein-protein interactions.

Proteomics research is usually categorized into discovery and targeted proteomics. Discovery proteomics optimizes the identification of the protein by dedicating more time per protein sample and limiting the number of samples. On the contrary, targeted proteomics limits the number of features that will be analyzed, and then efficiently perform chromatography to obtain the highest sensitivity through many samples.

Furthermore, the use of mass spectrometry does not inherently produce quantitative results due to the ionization efficiency of the peptide sample. Because of this, relative and absolute abundance quantitative proteomics developed as sub-categorized techniques. Relative quantitation can be obtained by examining samples individually by mass spectrometry and comparing the spectra in order to actuate the peptide abundance in one sample in comparison to another.  Often times, relative proteomic quantitation requires a labeling process involving stable isotope; this allows the mass spectrometer to distinguish between identical proteins into separate samples. Absolute proteomic quantitation utilizes isotropic peptides that evoke known concentrations of synthetic, dense isotopopgoues of target peptides into a sample and then performing liquid- chromatography- mass spectrometry. Like relative quantitation, absolute proteomic quantitation uses isotropic labels. However, the experimental target peptide sample is compared to heavy peptide and reverse- calculated to the starting concentration of the standard with the help of a pre-determined standard curve to allow for the quantitation of the target peptide.

Quantitative proteomics is a constantly developing and highly renewable field of study. Because of quantitative proteomic analysis, a large variety of biological problems have been solved and resolved.

==Bacterial Identification==

Mass spectrometry has been applied as a tool for bacterial recognition by &quot;fingerprinting&quot; species based on their proteomic inventory, though until recently work using this method was hindered by the procedure's reliance on high resolution data and the consequently high cost of sufficiently accurate instruments. Recent work in making the method more accessible has seen success by using MALDI (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization) mass spectrometry, which uses comparatively low energy nitrogen lasers for ionization and also stabilizes large, fragile protein species by supporting them on a matrix. These modifications help minimize fragmentation of protein species and ultimately reduces the complexity of the resulting mass spectrum, lessening the need for high-resolution data and thus making the process possible using less expensive mid-range spectrometers.

Mass spectrometry-based bacterial identification is preferable to current differentiation methods which generally involve multiple tests to identify species based on physiological, serological, chemotaxonomic, and overall biochemical characteristics, each of which requires time consuming culturing steps. In contrast, mass spectrometry methods generally take on the order of a few hours and require a single culturing step to increase cell counts and purity.

Identification is achieved using databases not unlike those used currently to identify unknown chemical compounds. Multiple spectra of a specific bacterial species are taken and averaged to remove noise, and the resulting averaged spectra is used as the species' proteomic fingerprint. This is then stored in a public database, and when an unknown is tested its spectra is compared via statistical algorithms specific to the database and identified based on closeness of fit to members of the database inventory.

==Pharmaceuticals==
Within pharmaceuticals, mass spectrometry is being used to due to the complicated mixtures of samples such as blood, urine, lymph, and is used with high sensitivity methods to measure low doses and long time point data. The most commonly used technique is LC/MS coupled to a triple quadrupole mass analyzer.

The sensitivity of mass spectrometry affords the capability to carry out measurements of [[w:microdosing|microdosing]] experiments which minimize the necessity of animal experimentation, with approximately a 70% congruence between observed effects of the compound between microdosing and animal model experimentation.

==Disease Biomarker Detection==
Research has shown that tumors can introduce proteins into various bodily fluids which might not normally exist at those concentrations in those locations. This has led to the interest in the study of mass spectrometry in the use of clinical early detection of cancer through analysis of these fluids. These disease-associated molecules are known as [[w:Biomarker_%28medicine%29| biomarkers]]. The issues associated with clinical usage of such analytical methods is the problem of false positives and false negatives. There are investigations into whether a protein signature composed of multiple proteins can be capable of providing a diagnostic measure of sufficient quality for use in a clinical setting.&lt;br&gt;

There are a number of hurdles that exist for this type of mass spectrometry analysis.
*Variations in the protein content of samples between individuals and even between the same person make the construction of a disease signature very complex
*High dynamic range of protein concentrations are present, possibly with biomarkers existing on the fringes of that range
*Accuracy and reproducibility of the mass spectrometry method(most frequently SELDI TOF)

Edge Fractionation Technology provides a powerful density based separation and enrichment method for rapid screening of potential Biomarkers.  This method was used in a study, [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2062558&amp;tool=pmcentrez A Density-Based Proteomics Sample Fractionation Technology: Folate Deficiency–Induced Oxidative Stress Response in Liver and Brain], on biomarkers for oxidative stress, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75), as a result of folate deficiency.

===Classification and Identification of Bacteria by Mass Spectrometry and Computational Analysis===

[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2475672&amp;tool=pmcentrez Sauer, S, et al. Classification and Identification of Bacteria by Mass Spectrometry and Computational Analysis. PLoS ONE 3(7): e2843.doi:10.1371/pournal.pone.0002843]

'''Main Focus'''

An alternative methodology coupled with database design in order to make bacterial identification with mass spectrometry more accessible.

'''Summary'''

The intention of Sauer et al.  was to expand the use and improve the efficiency of mass spectometry-based microbiological identification procedures. Such procedures have been shown to be successful before, but the generally high cost of the equipment was exacerbated by the need for high-resolution data in identifying bacterial species based on their proteome. Consequently, the field of mass-spec microbe identification is not often used and is therefore both ill-developed and unproven in extensive field tests. However, the authors note that the potential of mass spec identification is appealing; current methods involve labor-intensive culturing and processing based on an assortment of tests used to elucidate the biochemical properties of the sample species, which takes considerable time and preparation. Genetic differentiation based on the 16S ribosome RNA sequence is possible and common, but requires pre-defined sequence data. In contrast, the authors’ described method can (ignoring culture times) be performed in 90 minutes or so, and requires only that a proteome “fingerprint” be established beforehand for comparison.

[[Image:Agarplate_redbloodcells_edit.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Common bacterial plating method used to distinguish between species of bacteria.]]

The proposed method centers on three key components which are intended to make the use of mass spec identification more accessible and accurate. First, the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometers allows for the identification of large, often fragile particles (specifically proteins or DNA fragments) by first fixing them on a supportive matrix and then ejecting them with comparatively low energy lasers (nitrogen based). This method allows for much larger fragments to be maintained than are generally possible with other mass spec methods, which in turn allows for much simpler mass spectra data and consequently a decreased reliance on resolution. Thus, a lower resolution (and therefore more affordable) mass spec system can be used for identification.
The second implemented change was the use of single nucleotide polymorphism’s (SNPs) to differentiate between species with very similar proteomes (in the case of this study, to differentiate between European and North American strains of Erwinia amylovora). This was accomplished by sequencing the galE gene of the two strains and then using PCR to amplify this sequence using the necessary primers. This results in an amplified concentration of the galE gene, which could then be identified through MALDI mass spec as well. In this way it was now possible to differentiate between these species with approximately identical proteomes.
The third and most crucial component to the broad-range use of mass spectrometric identification is the generation of a database of bacterial fingerprints. By generating mass spec data for a species twenty times, the data were averaged to give the most common spectrum for the species, which could then be compared to field results via statistical software to give a closeness of fit result not unlike the methods currently used for BLAST searches. The authors note that the database is available for free online, and that in addition to the 2800-plus strains already fingerprinted a global effort is anticipated which should allow the database to grow rapidly, particularly for species of interest in particular fields, such as plant infection.

With full implementation, the authors’ method for species identification is accomplished by first sampling a particular microbe species (such as a pathogen) and then culturing it to both increase the cell number and to allow for purification (minimizing the number of species being analyzed in a particular sample). Next, this culture can be fixed on the MALDI matrix and tested, possibly multiple times to allow for greater confidence levels. Assuming the species has already been fingerprinted, the resulting spectrum is statistically compared to those of the database and a closest fit is applied; with sufficiently high closeness values, a definitive identification can be made. In the event that the species is proteomically identical to other bacterial strains, database entries would also include SNP analysis results to allow this extra level of differentiation.

'''Course Relevance'''

:This work is of considerable value in the study of metabolism given that it functions by establishing “fingerprints” of microbiological species which contain data from their entire proteome. While this “big picture” approach appears effective for differentiation between species, it is conceivable that mass spec identification using MALDI could be used to differentiate between different conditions of the same species; for example, between a microbe in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions. This procedure is currently undertaken using SDS-PAGE or similar approaches, but these methods are difficult to automate and very time consuming. Mass spectrometry has shown itself to be easily automated, and with established methodology can be done very quickly.

===A Density-Based Proteomics Sample Fractionation Technology: Folate Deficiency–Induced Oxidative Stress Response in Liver and Brain===
[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2062558&amp;tool=pmcentrez Lan W, Guhaniyogi J, Horn MJ, Xia JQ, Graham B. ''J Biomol Tech.'' ''2007 September'' ''18(4): 213–225.'' ]


'''Main Focus'''

Folate is important in both brain and liver and using it as a factor to force disease in rats it is possible to identify unique proteins and potential biomarkers for identifying the disease outside a controlled experiment.

'''Summary'''

Folate is a cofactor in biosynthetic pathways crucial for DNA synthesis, DNA repair and various methylation reactions. Most mammals including humans can not synthesize folate and must attain it from their diet.  Folate deficiency is linked to stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, depression, cancer and cardiovascular disease. [[Image:Protein Fractionation.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The process of protein fractionation.]] Folate deficiency disrupts one-carbon metabolism, increasing the level of homocysteine, a cytotoxic amino acid that can induce DNA strand breakage, apoptosis and induce oxidative stress, which will cascade DNA damage, alter one-carbon metabolism and trigger multiple organ damage and neurodegenerative disorders. Oxidative Stress and oxidative damage can alter protein functions in many ways, including directly modifying catalytic amino acids, changing critical amino acid residues in binding or regulatory sites, and altering proteolytic susceptibility and states of aggregation. In animals the liver is an important organ for folate storage and metabolism. Two groups of four rats each were given a folate-defined diet for two weeks, and then the experimental group was switched to a folate deficient diet. After four more weeks their organs were harvested. The proteins obtained from the organs were separated into 11 samples based on density using Edge 200 Fractionation.  Fractionation is used to increase the visibility of less prevalent proteins.  Each of these samples were measured with mass spectrometry to determine at which densities folate and biomarkers indicative of oxidative stress occur. In folate deficient rats, GPx1, a protein involved in the control of oxidative stress, was increased in abundance by 50 to 70% compared to rats with a diet containing folate. Oxidative stress induced by folate deficiency is less in brain tissue than in liver tissue. Several proteins related to oxidative stress were found in the experimental rats. Changes in many proteins of unknown function or unknown relation to folate deficiency were also observed in the experimental rats. Western blot results show changes in the relative percentage distribution of markers in each fraction, indicating their potential translocation in the cell.

Use of Mass Spectrometry to find Post translational modification (PTM) of proteins which play a key role in the control of a wide range of biological functions and activities is enhanced by increasing the concentrations of the PTMs.[[File:Insulin path.svg|right|thumb|200px| Post Translational Modification of Insulin]]

'''Summary'''

Analysis of Post Translational Modified (PTM) proteins is difficult because the modified proteins exist in far lower concentrations than the unmodified versions of the proteins and the modification itself is a hinderer to mass spectrometry.  By increasing the concentration of modified form of the protein and using computational algorithms designed specifically for the analysis of the unique MS/MS fragmentation patterns generated by post-translationally modified peptides, the chances of identifying the modified peptide during mass spectrometric analysis are greatly improved.  Enriching methods include purification to homogeneity and conjugation to a solid support using hydrazide chemistry and stable isotope labeling.  Further advances in defining PTMs are being developed such as; Peptide mixtures to be methyl esterified to block carboxylates from further reaction in subsequent steps, and to introduce stable isotopes for quantitative analysis, elution and bonding to polyamine.

'''Main Focus'''

Establishing an expansive, freely accessible resource for the cataloging of current and future biological data.

'''Summary'''

The National Center of Biotechnology Information acts as a global center for accumulation of biotechnology-related information in the form of publicly accessible databases, and their Taxonomy database is maintained to be as up-to-date as possible in terms of the current classification of various organisms based on collaborative data. As data are generated by an assortment of independent research bodies, submission of this data to the NCBI website benefits authors in two ways in particular: by confirming their work through comparison to data in existence both before and after publication, and by making it available for citation.

For the general scientific community, the NCBI website is just one of many separate attempts to publicize and make both available and searchable the vast amounts of incoming scientific data published every year.  All fields benefit from easy access to relevant data, but nowhere is this more apparent than the field of biology, in which new data is being constantly accrued over time as new methods are proven and then applied. The vast number of known organisms coupled with the continuous improvement of analytical methods ensures that a limitless amount of data will always remain to be gathered, for species and systems both newly and previously studied.  Further, as the much of the global community continues to improve in terms of education and economic status, the number of individual outfits generating data is continuously increasing. This influx of data would be impossible to archive effectively in the methods of the past several centuries; individual genomes would fill entire volumes, and even these would need to be updated with such regularity that printing would need to occur more than annually. Most importantly, this data would be incredibly hard to access in terms of both cost and searching.  Single procedures often necessitate the use of data gathered by anywhere between dozens and hundreds of sources, which would make locating this information incredibly difficult, and much data (such as protein or DNA sequence comparisons) requires the comparison of thousands of data points (base pairs), making computer application an absolute necessity.

For all of these reasons the NCBI Taxonomy website has been created and has quickly become an incredibly useful source for biological and related studies. The site allows for the searching of any species currently known and archived, and for each offers tabular summations of current works available, such as genome sequences or projects, known protein and/or other biochemical structures, and even the number of times a particular species has been cited in PubMed databases. Even more importantly, all of these references and data points are linked, allowing for incredible amounts of data to be accessed in moments. It is safe to assume that without NCBI and other public databases, many of our most recent biological and biochemical breakthroughs would have taken much longer, or may have been altogether impossible.

==Mass Spectrum==


A [[w:Mass_spectrum|mass spectrum]] is a plot of an intensity vs. mass-to-charge ratio of a separated chemical collection. The mass spectrum of a given sample is the distribution pattern of the components of that collection, whether atoms or molecules, based their mass-charge ratio. 

The X-axis of the plot is the mass-charge ratio also seen as (m/z) which is the quantity obtained by dividing the mass number of an ion by its charge number. For mass analyzers such as Time of Flight, the direct X-axis measurement is the time series of the ions measured by the detector. For such cases, the spectra must be calibrated with known standards in order to transform the X-axis from a time series into a m/z ratio. The values for the standards are used to generate the parameters for the equations relating the time of flight to m/z ratio. After these parameters are determined, the m/z ratios for the unknown sample can be calculated from their time of flight.  With the [[Proteomics/Protein_Identification_-_Mass_Spectrometry/Instrumentation#Mass_Analyzers|Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance]] mass spectrometer, the frequency measurements gathered by the detector plates undergo [[w:Fast_Fourier_transform|Fast Fourier Transformation]] before they are mass calibrated.
[[Image:Spectra.gif|thumb|Typical Mass Spectra]]
The Y-axis of a mass spectrum represents the signal intensity of the ions, and has arbitrary units. In most forms of mass spectrometry, the signal intensity of an ion current does not represent relative abundance accurately, but somewhat correlates loosely with it. Signal intensity is dependent on certain factors, the nature of the molecules being analyzed, how they ionize, the buffers' interaction, and the sample interaction.

==Method of Interpretation==

Samples can sometimes be highly difficult to analyze due to the amount of restrictions as well as variables that play roles in the output. Many factors can play roles in how a mass spectrum is interpreted, these factors may include: even electron vs. odd electron species, positive vs. negative ion mode, intact protein vs. fragmented peptide ions, etc.

Basis of resolution as well as peak height is reliant on the amount of sample being used and the amount of separation done prior to the mass spectroscopy. Based on certain heights and areas or peaks, structures can be determined. 

Not all mass spectra can be interpreted similarly, due to the varying nature of the mass analyzers and ionization methods available. For example, some mass spectrometers break the analyte molecules into fragments; others observe the intact molecular masses with little fragmentation. A mass spectrum can represent many different types of information based on the type of mass spectrometer and the specific experimental conditions applied; however, all plots of intensity vs. mass-to-charge are referred to as mass spectra.

==Normalization Techniques==

[[Image:QuantileNormVar.gif|right|300 px|thumb|On the y-axis is the ratio of variance across a set of replicates after quantile normalisation, divided by the variance of the scale-normalized values. On the x-axis are the mean levels. Both axes are on the log scale.]]

The process of removing statistical error from data created from repeated measurements is called normalization.  In MS normalization techniques are used to remove systematic biases from peptide samples.  These biases can arise from various sources including protein degradation, measurement errors, and variation in loading samples.  The common normalization techniques used on MS data require that the data is transformed from the linear to the log scale.  Doing so allows the values to conform to the normal distribution and reduces the likelihood of masking more relevant proteins with less relevant ones.

==Annotation==

As described in the section above, there are a number of factors that are vital to meaningful interpretation of the data from a mass spectrometry experiment. Without this metadata about the variables of the experiment, it is difficult to use a mass spectrum to generate an assessment. Combine this with the variance among types of mass spectrometers, and the utility of a reporting standard emerges.&lt;br&gt;

In the vein of [http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html Minimum Information About A Microarray Experiment(MIAME)],  the [http://psidev.sourceforge.net/ HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative] developed [http://psidev.sourceforge.net/miape/MIAPE_MS_2.1.pdf  MIAPE MS], a Minimum Information About a Proteomics Experiment in Mass Spectrometry.  The standard requires metadata to be recorded about general information such as the machine manufacturer and model, variables of the ion source for ESI and MALDI, mass analyzers and detectors involved, and post-processing involved in peak list generation and annotation.  In addition to the mass spectrometer operation, post-processing methods that are often used in other fields of signal processing are frequently applied to mass spectra in order to generate a more useful spectrum.&lt;br&gt;

Further work has been done to regulate the expression of Mass Spectroscopy data via the establishment of a Controlled  Vocabulary (CV) [http://psidev.sourceforge.net/ms/xml/mzdata/psi-ms-cv-latest.obo]. Developed by HUPO under the Proteomics Standards Initiative, the CV provides an ontology, comprised of applicable terms and transitions, which will better control the representation of Mass Sepctrometry data by regulating the vocabulary used in their description.

==Accurate Mass Time Tags==


[[Image:Hplc-perfume-chromatogram.png|thumb|300px|A chromatogram of complex mixture (perfume water) obtained by reversed phase HPLC]]

The accurate time tag approach, or AMT, takes advantage of the highly accurate readings from FTICR-MS and nanoLC.  Data from these techniques can be used to form unique tags based on their molecular mass and retention times for a specific peptide.  This technique assumes that there is enough separation power in two dimensions that it is very unlikely that two will occur with the same mass and separation time.  Thus is it unlikely that a new species will be detected upon further analysis of the same sample with the same mass and retention time as any other species.

==Decision Tree Ensembles==

[[Image:DTE_Bagging.png|right|thumb|200px|Decision tree ensemble using Bagging algorithm]]

Decision tree is one of the machine learning methods widely used to analyze proteomics data.  Generated from a given dataset, a single decision tree reports a classification result by each of its terminal leaves (classifiers).  Even though there exist many algorithms such as C4.5 that can be used to generate a well-modeled single decision tree, it is still possible that its prediction is biased, thus adversely affecting its accuracy.

To overcome this problem, more than one decision trees are used to analyze the data.  It is based on the concept of forming a panel of experts who will then vote to decide the final outcome.  The panel of experts is analogous to the ensemble of decision trees, which provide a pool of classifiers.  Similar to voting, the classifier that has a majority becomes the true classification result for the data.  As reported by Ge et al.&lt;ref name=Ge_G_2008&gt;Ge G, Wong GW. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2440392&amp;tool=pmcentrez &quot;Classification of premalignant pancreatic cancer mass-spectrometry data using decision tree ensembles&quot;] ''BMC Bioinformatics'' '''9:'''275 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;, the decision tree ensemble is more accurate than a single decision tree.

The diagram shown summarizes the process of generating decision tree ensemble and classification of data using Bagging (bootstrap aggregating) algorithm.  To explain briefly, Bagging algorithm begins with randomly sampling (with replacement) the data from the original dataset to form a training set.  A multiple of training sets are usually generated.  Note that, since the replacement is allowed, the data in the training set can be duplicated.  Each of training sets then generates a decision tree.  For a given test data, each decision tree predicts an outcome, represented by a classifier.  The ensemble of decision trees forms a panel of experts whose votes determine the final classification result from this group of classifiers.

==Significance Analysis of Microarray Applied to MS data==

While the Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) method was intended for the identification of differential gene expression, it has recently been utilized for identifying differential protein expression with data obtained from liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.  Proteomic data retrieved from nanoLC/LTQ/FTMS and analyzed via SAM’s algorithm has revealed reliable data not only relating to differential protein expression, but in determining false discovery rates with a level of accuracy previously unmatched by standard proteomic analysis tools. The superiority of this method over other methods of analysis such as identifying genes as significantly changed if an R-fold change is observed and significant changes in expression based on if an R-fold change was seen consistently between paired samples were discussed. Additionally, information regarding obtaining and using the SAM program is available (Section 1.11.4).



==Mass Spectra Data Formats==

===mzData===

HUPO PSI developed this XML format meant to unify the existing formats into a standard format for reporting peak list information called [http://psidev.sourceforge.net/ms/#mzdata mzData]. Essentially mzData provided a standard meas to represent peak data from a Mass spectroscopy experiment, and establish the fundamental parameters necessary for proper interpretation of the spectra, such as negative or positive ion spectra, and other basal information.

===mzXML===

Developed by the Seattle Proteome Center at the Institute for Systems Biology this data format is similar in its minimal requirements for the presentation of MS data, but with several key differences which make it the preferred file format for MS data[http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Formats:mzXML].  Numerous converters and tanslaters exist whihc allow for the ubiquitous data transfer from a variety of the major Mass Spectrometers including Waters, Thermo, Bruker, MDS, Agilent, and ABI. Based from the same data structure as mzXML, prepXML (aslo produced by the Seattle Proteome Center), is a data format that has arisen to model protein sequencing data generated from MS-MS experimentation. Additional data formats for only protein and peptide data, such as protXML (Seattle Proteome Center), exist for purpose driven representation of protein MS experiments.

===mzML===

Resultant of the HUPO-Proteomics Standards Initiative's continuing progress towards standardization of proteomics data, specifically Mass Spectroscopy data, led to the development of a new unifying Mass Spectra data format called mzML. Simply put this data format attempts to combine the existing standards for both Mass Spectrometry experimental design as well as the resulting peak information.

'''Main Focus'''

The focus is to attempt to find a technique for statistically normalizing MS data so that it can be meaningfully analyzed.


'''Summary'''

When looking at Mass Spectrometry (MS) data, the results can never be replicated, even when running replicate samples.  Thus, there needs to be a way to make the results comparable.  Since the difference in results can be related to bias and noise in addition to biological change, causing extraneous variability, normalization techniques are necessary.  Four different normalization techniques commonly used in Microarray Analysis (central tendency, linear regression, locally weighted regression, and quantile techniques) were tested on three different sample sets (standard proteins, an early-log growth phase ''D. radiodurans'' sample and a stationary growth phase sample, and a striata brain sample of a control mouse and a striata brain sample of a methamphetamine-stressed mouse), which showed different levels of protein complexity.  

Although all of the techniques did reduce systematic bias at least somewhat, because there was no definitive trend among the results obtained by the different techniques, none of these can yet be used for normalizing MS data; however, this study provides guidance for developing proper normalization techniques.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the main tools of Proteomics, as it provides a way to obtain measurements of the abundance of individual proteins in the sample.  Since the goal of Proteomics is to obtain measurements of the abundance of the different expressed proteins in different conditions, MS is a powerful tool.

'''Main Focus'''

Recent advances in proteomic technologies have provided tools which provide both high efficiency and high-throughput proteomic analysis.  These tools, specifically nanoLC-FTICR-MS and the necessary data processing and management tools, are the focus of this article.

'''Summary'''



While the field of proteomics is relatively new techniques have existed for 30 years which can now be applied to these new proteomic problems.  These techniques, such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS), provides both high sensitivity and high mass measurement accuracy (MMA) necessary for identification of species as well as a wide dynamic range.  FTICR-MS is also well suited for both “top-down” and “bottom-up” proteomics in so much as it can determine protein/peptide identities from parent masses as well as based upon fragmented patterns, which can deal with very complex mixtures of peptides.  
	In addition to the difficulties in the production of high throughput techniques, problems also exist in the data management of the collected data.  Results from a single experiment using high performance FTICR-MS can typically produce a 10GB raw data file, much too large for storage of any significant volume.  Using techniques which take advantage of low statistical probabilities existing that new species detected in a sample will be detected in additional analyses of the same system.  Using clustering in n-dimensional space using the Euclidean distance sets of unique mass classes can be produced reducing redundancy.
	Clustering is necessary due to the unreliable reproduction of data from LC-MS.  Typically shifts in elution time occur and differ between multiple runs of the same peptides, where one would expect the same result.  These shifts are the result of flow rate, temperature, differences in the packing of the columns as well as contamination.  These same problems can also exacerbate the process of normalization of the data sets.
	Sample preparation is a key step in the proteomic analysis and can be quite difficult.  Protein concentrations can vary greatly with only slight environmental changes.  Many such techniques have been developed, such as solid phase isotope-coded affinity tags (SPICAT) for quantitative analysis,  post-digestion trypsin-catalyzed 16O/18O labeling which has its advantages in that all types of samples can be labeled in the manner, quantitative cysteinyl-peptide enrichment technology (QCET), for use in high throughput experiments involving mammalian cells.  Each of these techniques has their own limitations and steps are being taken to overcome these limitations.
	Additionally methods have been developed to expand the dynamic range and minimize noise created by abundant species of a sample.  Dynamic range enhancement applied to mass spectrometry (DREAMS) aids in the detection of species which are both biologically significant and have low relative abundance on the fly.  Targeted, or data-directed, LC-MS/MS can focus on a subset of proteins that have significant changes in abundance between two samples, and multiplexed MS/MS provides a way to increase the rate and sensitivity of proteomic measurements.
	These techniques have a wide range of applications already being thoroughly researched as well as adapt current techniques to better understand the biological processes which require the presence of these proteins or changes in their relative abundance.

===Classification of Premalignant Pancreatic Cancer Mass-Spectrometry Data Using Decision Tree Ensembles===

[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2440392&amp;tool=pmcentrez Ge G, Wong GW. ''BMC Bioinformatics'' '''9:'''275 (2008)]

'''Main Focus'''

To compare the performance of several machine learning algorithms based on decision tree, Ge et al. conducted a series of statistical analyses on mass spectral data, obtained from a premalignant pancreatic cancer research.  It was found that the classifier ensemble techniques outperformed their single algorithm counterparts in terms of the consistency in identifying the cancer biomarkers and the accuracy in the classification of the data.

'''Summary'''

[[Image:study_procedure_v1.png|right|thumb|400px|Flow chart describing the study procedure for biomarker identification and performance comparison between the decision tree ensembles and single decision tree methods]]

In this article, Ge et al. reported that the performance in identifying biomarkers for premalignant pancreatic cancer could be enhanced by using the decision tree ensemble techniques instead of a single algorithm counterpart. These techniques had proven more likely to accurately distinguish disease class from normal class as indicated by a larger area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.  Moreover, they achieved comparatively lower root mean squared errors.

According to their method, the peptide mass-spectrometry data were processed first to improve data integrity and reduce variations among data due to the differences in sample loading conditions.  The preprocessing steps involved baseline adjustment using group median, smoothing to remove noise using a Gaussian kernel, and normalization to make all the data comparable.  After that, the data were randomly sampled such that 90% formed a training set and the remaining 10% formed a test set.

The training set was used in feature selection.  In the study, the authors considered three different feature selection methods.  The first method was a two-sample homoscedastic t test, which was used under the assumption that all the features from either normal or disease class had normal distribution.  Unlike the first method, the second method based on Wilcoxon rank test considered that the features had no distribution.  The last feature selection method was a genetic algorithm.

The test set was used to generate a single decision tree including the decision tree ensembles.  The ensemble methods being studied were Random Forest, Random Tree, Bagging, Logitboost, Stacking, Adaboost, and Multiboost.  Their performances were measured in terms of accuracy and error in the classification of the features, selected by each selection method.  Then, they were compared against the performance of a single decision tree generated by C4.5 algorithm.  The process repeated ten times to validate the resulting performance consistency.

According to the results reported, the decision tree ensembles achieved higher accuracy up to 70% regardless of the feature selection methods used.  In terms of biomarker identification, both the t test and the Wilcoxon rank test had similarly impressive performance by consistently selecting the same biomarker-suspect features.  Unlike the first two methods, the performance of the genetic algorithm was considerably poor.  Ge et al. also noted that 70% accuracy was still lower than expected.  This could be as a result from a naturally low concentration of the biomarkers at the premalignant stage of the cancer. In addition, it was also possible that one dataset might not be suitable for all algorithms, thus underestimating the accuracy.

'''Main Focus'''

The Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) analysis method which is nomally used in the analysis of DNA micorarrays to identify differential gene expression may also be used to identify differential protein expression.  This analysis method can identify false positive results more accuretly than the conventional test generally used for this purpose.

'''Summary'''

The Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) analysis method was developed by researchers 
at the Stanford University to analyze genes in microarrays in order to identify genes that 
are differentially expressed (statistically) and obtain accurate false discovery rate 
statistics.  In &quot;Significance Analysis of Microarray for Relative Quantitation of LC/MS Data 
in Proteomics&quot; (Li et.al.) the SAM method is applied to proteomics data retrieved from 
nanoLC/LTQ/FTMS in order to determine differential expression for the proteins in a 
biological sample.  SAM was also used to determine and estimate of rates of false discovery 
as well as miss rates.  SAM results were them compared to results obtained from more 
tradition proteomics analysis tools such as the conventions t-test and by fold change.  The 
biological system that was used to test the analysis techniques involved growing 
''mycobacterium smegmatis'' cultures at pH5 and pH7, and looking for differences in protein 
expression under these two conditions.  They compared protein abundance and focused on 
changes in protein expression and rates for false positives.  The analysis appears to reveal 
that the SAM method can &quot;zero in&quot; on false positives more accurately than the t-test, making it 
the more accurate test, and allowing protein changes to be identified with a 5% false positive rate. The chart below contains data showing that a larger number of differentially expressed proteins were found using SAM, while maintaining a low false positive rate.

===Significance Analysis of Microarrays Applied to the Ionizing Radiation Response===

'''Main Focus'''

The SAM analytical method is discussed as well as it validity for a given data set. The superiority of the analysis method over other methods is also discussed.

'''Summary'''

DNA Microarrays are capable of measuring the expression of thousands of genes within a single experiment. They are often used to identify any changes in expression of genes under a number of different conditions. Given that these experiments generate massive amounts of data, systems must be developed to analyze the data that is generated for any experimental significance. The authors of &quot;Significance Analysis of Microarrays applied to the Ionizing Radiation Response&quot; described a method for doing this known as SAM. This method provides a score for each gene based on its change in gene expression as compared to the standard deviation of repeat measurements. The system also provides an estimate for the false discovery rate. In the paper, the authors explain the algorithm behind how the SAM method arrives at these scores as well as the math behind determining the false discovery rate. SAM was tested on a data set that was collected by the authors and its validity was checked by Northern blots. The authors discuss SAM and its superiority over other methods of identifying experimental significance. These methods include identifying genes as having been significantly changed, if an R-fold change is observed, and declaring a significant change in expression based on whether or not an R-fold change was seen consistently between paired samples. SAM was shown to be superior to the other methods discussed&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

The algorithm behind SAM calculates the relative difference in gene expression based on permutation analysis of expression data and provides a score for these changes. It also calculates a false discovery rate. The algorithm used to calculate the score for each gene based on its change (if any) in gene expression is shown below:

'''Main Focus'''

The author describes the necessary signal conditioning steps in mass spectrometry spectral analysis before proteomics data are used in the classification of biomarkers.

'''Summary'''

[[Image:signal_conditioning_v1.png|right|thumb|250px|Flow chart describing the signal conditioning steps in mass spectrometry spectral analysis]]

From this website, the author describes the signal conditioning steps used to improve the integrity of mass spectrometry data and to reduce their high dimensionality.  These steps include the uses of statistical techniques to exclude the influence of processing matrix, remove noises, minimize a data variation due to experiment conditions, and reduce the redundancy in the dataset.

Baseline removal was applied first to remove the data offset caused by the processing matrix usually used in the crystallization of protein sample for mass spectrometry.  According to the website, the weighted quadratic fitting was used in this step.  However, not all the effects of the matrix could be removed.  Some remained and contributed in a form of noise in addition to the electrical noise from the machine itself.  To alleviate the influence of noise, the denoising and smoothing techniques were used.  The author reported that the wavelet decomposition together with a median filter was applied for this purpose.  The spectral data was then normalized to dissociate the data from the experiment conditions.  This process helped reduce a variation among data.

In the next step, a peak detection technique was used to remove the spatial redundancy of the data.   Conceptually, it selected a mass-to-charge ratio value at the peak intensity in a specified range between two adjacent minima to represent the data in that range.  Then, the selected spectral data were calibrated such that the data possessed the same spectral characteristic were clustered together.  These clusters were referred to as the selected features, which were used by a machine learning algorithm in the classification of biomarkers.

;Baseline removal (or baseline fitting): A method of removing an offset segment of spectral data so that the data can be further analyzed on the same basis.  In general, the technique is to fit a curve to that offset segment and then subtract the values along the curve from the original data.  As a result, the new spectral data will have a flat base.

Usually, the weighting factor is derived from the error incurred from the regular quadratic fit.  By accounting for this error, a better fit can be obtained. ( http://class.phys.psu.edu/p559/experiments/html/error.html ) 
;(Orthogonal) wavelet decomposition: A signal analysis technique that uses a particular basis function, which is finite, to fit the signal and generates a series of time-varying coefficients.  The decomposition yields a set of orthogonal signals.  Each reflects a local change in the original signal at a given time. ( http://www.tideman.co.nz/Salalah/OrthWaveDecomp.html )
;Median filter: A method of removing noise or data that has a distinctively large standard deviation for a given set of data.  Consider a window of 2n + 1 data points.  The median filter replaces the (n + 1)st data point with a median from this window.  If the (n + 1)st data appears to be an out-of-range noise, it will be removed by this process.

[http://proteomics.stanford.edu/chu/ Property of: Stanford University (3/29/09)]

'''Main Focus'''

Gilbert Chu, M.D., Ph.D. and Robert Tibshirani, Ph.D. are attempting to create protein analysis tools/programs that will incorporated variable such as protein levels and post-translational modifications, and protein interactions in order to obtain more usable information from proteomic data.

'''Summary'''

This site offers information about the proteomic analysis research conducted by Gilbert Chu, M.D., Ph.D. and Robert Tibshirani, Ph.D.  The site includes publications by Chu and Tibshirani (books and journal articles), as well as laboratory profiles for both professors.  The overview provides concise information about the challenges and benefits of separating and analyzing proteomic data, and then merging it with gene expression data in order to obtain new information about biological systems.  The software section on the website provides access to four different types of proteomic analysis software including Signifance Analysis of Microarray(SAM), Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM), laboratory statistical analysis for microarrays, and Peak Probability Contrast (PPC). The site also provides biographical background on the two professors as well as current research interests they are pursuing.  These interest include elucidating a way to diagnose autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus)from the analysis of proteins expressed in serum blood samples.

'''New Terms'''

;PPC: Peak Probability Contrast - This is a class prediction software for protein MS data.  It does this by obtaining a list of significant peaks where each class has an intensity level assigned to it. It can compare and contrast the intensity levels of the data to predict class and generate a false positive rate.  Either raw spectra or extracted peaks can be input into this program.( http://proteomics.stanford.edu/chu/software.html ) 
;PAM: Prediction Analysis for Microarrays - This is a program that performs sample classification from antibody reactivity data to provide a list of significant genes whose expression characterizes each sample group.  The software can work with either cDNA or oligo microarrays. ( http://proteomics.stanford.edu/chu/software.html )
;cDNA: complementary DNA - This is a single-stranded DNA that is reverse transcribed via the enzyme reverse transcriptase using a messenger RNA template.  It is complimentary to the mRNA. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_DNA)
;Autoimmune disease: A medical condition that occurs when the body's immune system mistakes its own normal tissue for foreign tissue and therefore launches an immune response attacking the tissue.  There are over 80 known autoimmune disorders. (http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2402)
;SLE: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - This is an autoimmune disease more generally known as Lupus.  The autoimmune response creates inflammation (both acute and chronic) in various tissues including heart, joints, skin, lungs, blood vessels, liver, kidneys, and nervous system.  Most fatalities are due to renal failure and the 10yr survival rate is 80%. (http://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus/article.htm)

===Introduction to FTICR/MS Technology===

[http://www.wangnmr.com/FTICR_MS_technology.htm Wang B INTRODUCTION TO FTICR/MS TECHNOLOGY 2001]

'''Main Focus'''

A breif introduction to the parts of a FTICR/MS machine and how it differs from other forms of MS.

'''Summary'''

[[Image:Bruker_HCT-schematicJune2008.PNG|thumb|250px|Schematic diagram of ion trap mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source]]

Fourier transform mass spectrometry is a technique that has gained attention due to its ability to provide mass and resolution information from bio-molecules at levels that are higher than many forms of mass spectrometry.  As an ion trapping form of mass spectroscapy it is unique in its technique on collecting these ions, it is for this reason that it is able to measure with far greater accuracy than other forms of mass spec.
	While the primary ideas for FTICR were first developed in the 1930’s it was not until the late 1970’s when Fourier transform techniques were adapted for ICR techniques.  Since that time this technique has quickly increased in popularity and availability.
	While there are many types of FTMS machines they all contain four basic parts, which are necessary for their function.  Primarily there is a magnet, which has a profound effect on the performance of the machine with stronger magnets yielding better results. It is for this reason that there is a constant movement toward stronger and stronger magnets.  Secondly there is a cell that is used to store ions and is where they are detected and analyzed.   Two types of cells can be utilized, cubic cells, composed of six magnetic plates arranged in a cube shape, hence its name, and open-ended cylindrical cells that perform in a manner similar to the cubic cells but utilizes six electrodes instead.
	The third feature is a vacuum system, a requirement to all mass spectrometers, but which is particularly important to the proper and accurate function to FTMS instruments, however this vacuum is only necessary when ions are detected in the trap.  The final part of the system is the data system.  The several components of this system, including a computer to monitor and analyze all of the other components and data have all improved in quality over the past ten years while their computer performance has also increased.

===SAM: Significance Analysis of Microarrays===

[http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/ Property of: Stanford University (3/29/09)]

'''Main Focus'''

This website provides information specifically about the SAM program developed at Standford University. It includes links to downloading and using the program as well as information regarding its background and algorithm.

'''Summary'''

[[Image:Expressionpic2.jpg|thumb|right]]

This website is specifically dedicated to the SAM program. It includes information about how the program works (the algorithms behind it) as well as how it differs from other analysis programs. It provides a link to the instruction manual. They give a list of features for the program as well as links to other extras that may be used alongside it (such as an Excel add-in). A FAQ section is also available to answer the most popular questions. There are links to download the SAM program in addition to information about how to get licensing (if it is necessary). Most users can download the program simply by registering at the appropriate site (http://www-stat-class.stanford.edu/~tibs/clickwrap/sam.html), however, if SAM is going to be for commercial use, more formal licensing is required. Additionally, the site keeps everyone up to date about any changes they make to SAM as well as when new versions come out. 

'''New Terms'''

;PAM: Prediction Analysis of Microarrays; Another system available through the SAM website that is used for class prediction and survival analysis for gene expression as well as data mining. The system performs sample classification from gene expression data. ( http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/PAM/index.html )
;Algorithm: A finite sequence of instructions usually in the form of an explicit, step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. It is often used for calculation and data processing. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm )
;Two Class (Unpaired) Groups: Two sets of measurements, in which the experiment units are all different in the two groups. ( http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/sam.pdf )
;Multiclass: There are more than two groups, each containing different experimental units. ( http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/sam.pdf )
;Normalization: This is a way of systematically making sure that a database is able to carry out general-purpose queries and that these queries don't result in undesirable results by either insertion, updating, or deletion of any anomalies that can results in loss of the quality of the data. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization )

===An (Opinionated) Guide to Microarray Data Analysis===

http://www.bea.ki.se/staff/reimers/Web.Pages/Microarray.Home.htm (3/29/09)

'''Main Focus'''

Overall, this website provides information about common problems in the analysis of microarray data and presents suggestions on how to resolve these problems.  Some of these solutions take the form of normalization techniques.

[[File:DNA microarray.svg|thumb|This is an example of a microarray that uses two different color dyes to show gene expression. Because many Proteomics Normalization Techniques are based off of Normalization Techniques used for Microarray Analysis, understanding Microarray Analysis can aid with developing and understanding current techniques for Proteomics Data.]]


'''Summary'''

The website is organized into eleven total sections--Experimental design, Distributions and transforms, Approaches to Normalization, Quality Control of spotted arrays, Normalization of spotted arrays, Quality control, Normalization, Estimates of Abundance (methods for combining data from multiple probes to get single estimates), Graphics, Clustering, and Statistical Significance—that explain some of the different techniques people use to solve some of the problems that arise when analyzing microarray data.  The first three sections talk about problems that arise in all types of microarray analysis.   The website gives a brief explanation of the concepts being covered and then proceeds to talk about their strong and weak points.  The next five sections then talk about these concepts specifically for two-color cDNA spotted microarrays and for the Affymetrix arrays respectively.  In the Quality Control sections the website goes over some basic controls that should be kept in mind before running the experiment just to cut down on systematic bias.  While normalization of the data will account for some of the bias, it won’t necessarily catch everything, so it is best to avoid introducing bias if possible.  The last section discusses different statistical methods that are appropriate for microarray data and the other two sections discuss different ways that the data is then visualized for human analysis.


'''New Terms'''

;p-value: probability that given the null hypothesis is true, the results obtained from the experiment make sense (http://www.childrensmercy.org/stats/definitions/pvalue.htm)
;Bonferroni correction: a method that is used to keep results arising from multiple comparison tests from being incorrectly deemed statistically significant (http://www.utdallas.edu/~herve/Abdi-Bonferroni2007-pretty.pdf)
;Sidak correction: another correction method that is less stringent than the Bonferroni correction allowing a greater chance for something to be considered statistically significant (http://www.utdallas.edu/~herve/Abdi-Bonferroni2007-pretty.pdf)
;Lowess curve (locally weighted linear regression curve): a smooth curve that's plotted through the points and is calculated by using locally weighted linear regression over the values (http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/software/dataplot/refman1/ch3/lowess_s.pdf)
;t-test: a statistical hypothesis test that follows the Student's t distribution if the null hypothesis is true (http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/stat_t.php)


'''Course Relevance'''

Most of the normalization techniques used for Proteomics were first found useful for microarray data, so learning about problems that arise in microarray data analysis can be useful when doing experimental design.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Palming==

Look at your hand, especially at each point that the hand bends, these are potential palming locations.

[[File:Magic Palming.png]]

As you can see    anti gathered are a number of areas that can be used for palming. Each point that the hand bends provides a point of grip for holding a coin. For example if you look at the fore finger, there are three areas that bend, each of which can hold a coin in edge palm position. There are also two areas between the bends that can hold coins in standard palm position.
Palming is an art of hiding necessary items without the knowledge of others it can be used in most of the sleight of hands. If you have a smooth hand you can easily practice palming. This can be start by trying to palm a coin in the center of the palm.
Want to try?, first place a coin in the center of your palm and try to hold in by shrinking your fingers. No you are not allowed to fold your fingers at first it would be obvious that you are having something in the hand,

But... after  a little practice you will be able to keep a neutral positioned palm and still can keep coins small balls inside the palm even without your knowledge,, I tried to keep coins in my hand for six to seven hours a day with out anybody knows even typing this I have  a One dhs coin in my hand.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

An '''object''' is composed of '''fields''' and '''methods'''. The fields, also called ''data members'', ''characteristics'', ''attributes'', or ''properties'', describe the state of the object. The methods generally describe the actions associated with a particular object. Think of an object as a noun, its fields as adjectives describing that noun, and its methods as the verbs that can be performed by or on that noun.

For example, a sports car is an object. Some of its fields might be its height, weight, acceleration, and speed. An object's fields just hold data about that object. Some of the methods of the sports car could be &quot;drive&quot;, &quot;park&quot;, &quot;race&quot;, etc. The methods really don't mean much unless associated with the sports car, and the same goes for the fields.

The blueprint that lets us build our sports car object is called a ''class''. A class doesn't tell us how fast our sports car goes, or what color it is, but it does tell us that our sports car will have a field representing speed and color, and that they will be say, a number and a word (or hex color code), respectively. The class also lays out the methods for us, telling the car how to park and drive, but these methods can't take any action with just the blueprint &amp;mdash; they need an object to have an effect.

In Java, a class is located in a file similar to its own name.  If you want to have a class called &lt;code&gt;SportsCar&lt;/code&gt;, its source file needs to be &lt;code&gt;SportsCar.java&lt;/code&gt;.  The class is created by placing the following in the source file:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-13&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.13: SportsCar.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class SportsCar {
   /* Insert your code here */
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The class doesn't do anything yet, as you will need to add methods and field variables first.

The objects are different from the primitive types because:
# The primitive types are not instantiated.
# In the memory, only their value is stored, directly. No reference to an instance is stored.
# In the memory, the allocated space is fixed, whatever their value. The allocated space of an object vary, for instance either the object is intantiated or not.
# The primitive types don't have methods callable on them.
# A primitive type can't be inherited.

==Instantiation and constructors==
In order to get from class to object, we &quot;build&quot; our object by ''instantiation''. Instantiation simply means to create an ''instance'' of a class. Instance and object are very similar terms and are sometimes interchangeable, but remember that an instance refers to a ''specific object'', which was created from a class.

This instantiation is brought about by one of the class's methods, called a ''constructor''. As its name implies, a constructor builds the object based on the blueprint. Behind the scenes, this means that computer memory is being allocated for the instance, and values are being assigned to the data members.

In general there are four constructor types: default, non-default, copy, and cloning.

A '''default constructor''' will build the most basic instance. Generally, this means assigning all the fields values like null, zero, or an empty string. Nothing would stop you, however, from your default sports car color from being red, but this is generally bad programming style. Another programmer would be confused if your basic car came out red instead of say, colorless.
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.79: A default constructor.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
SportsCar car = new SportsCar();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

A '''non-default constructor''' is designed to create an object instance with prescribed values for most, if not all, of the object's fields. The car is red, goes from 0-60 in 12 seconds, tops out at 190mph, etc.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.80: A non-default constructor.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
SportsCar car = new SportsCar(&quot;red&quot;, 12, 190);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

A '''copy constructor''' is not included in the Java language, however one can easily create a constructor that do the same as a copy constructor. It's important to understand what it is. As the name implies, a copy constructor creates a new instance to be a duplicate of an already existing one. In Java, this can be also accomplished by creating the instance with the default constructor, and then using the assignment operator to equivocate them. This is not possible in all languages though, so just keep the terminology under your belt.

Java has the concepts of '''cloning object''', and the end results are similar to copy constructor. Cloning an object is faster than creation with the {{java:new}} keyword, because all the object memory is copied at once to destination cloned object. This is possible by implementing the &lt;code&gt;Cloneable&lt;/code&gt; interface, which allows the method &lt;code&gt;Object.clone()&lt;/code&gt; to perform a field-by-field copy.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.81: Cloning object.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
SportsCar car = oldCar.clone();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Type ==
When an object is created, a reference to the object is also created. The object can not be accessed directly in Java, only through this object reference. This object reference has a ''type'' assigned to it. We need this type when passing the object reference to a method as a parameter. Java does strong type checking.

Type is basically a list of features/operations, that can be performed through that object reference.  The object reference type is basically a contract that guarantees that those operations will be there at run time.

When a car is created, it comes with a list of features/operations listed in the user manual that guarantees that those will be there when the car is used.

When you create an object from a class by default its type is the same as its class. It means that all the features/operations the class defined are there and available, and can be used. See below:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.82: Default type.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
(new ClassName()).operations();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

You can assign this to a variable having the same type as the class:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.83: A variable having the same type as the class.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
ClassName objRefVariable = new ClassName();
objRefVariable.operations();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

You can assign the created object reference to the class, super class, or to an interface the class implements:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.84: Using the super class.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
SuperClass objectRef = new ClassName(); // features/operations list are defined by the SuperClass class
...
Interface inter = new ClassName(); // features/operations list are defined by the interface
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the car analogy, the created car may have different '''Type''' of drivers. We create separate user manuals for them, Average user manual, Power user manual, Child user manual, or Handicapped user manual. Each type of user manual describes only those features/operations appropriate for the type of driver.  The Power driver may have additional gears to switch to higher speeds, that are not available to other type of users...

When the car key is passed from an adult to a child we replacing the user manuals, that is called ''Type Casting''.

In Java, casts can occur in three ways:
* up casting going up in the inheritance tree, until we reach the {{java:Object}}
* up casting to an interface the class implements
* down casting until we reach the class the object was created from

== Autoboxing/unboxing ==
Autoboxing and unboxing, language features since Java 1.5, make the programmer's life much easier when it comes to working with the primitive wrapper types. Consider this code fragment:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.85: Traditional object creation.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int age = 23;
Integer ageObject = new Integer(age);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Primitive wrapper objects were Java's way of allowing one to treat primitive data types as though they were objects. Consequently, one was expected to ''wrap'' one's primitive data type with the corresponding primitive wrapper object, as shown above.

Since Java 1.5, one may write as below and the compiler will automatically create the wrap object. The extra step of wrapping the primitive is no longer required. It has been ''automatically boxed up'' on your behalf:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.86: Autoboxing.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int age = 23;
Integer ageObject = age;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
{{XNote|Keep in mind that the compiler still creates the missing wrapper code, so one doesn't really gain anything performance-wise. Consider this feature a programmer convenience, not a performance booster.}}
Each primitive type has a class wrapper:
{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
| Primitive type
| Class wrapper
|-
| &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Byte&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;char &lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Character&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;short &lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Short&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Integer&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Long&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Float&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Double&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Boolean&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Void&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Unboxing uses the same process in reverse. Study the following code for a moment. The {{java:if}} statement requires a {{java:boolean}} primitive value, yet it was given a Boolean wrapper object. No problem! Java 1.5 will automatically ''unbox'' this.
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.87: Unboxing.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Boolean canMove = new Boolean(true);
 
if (canMove) {
  System.out.println(&quot;This code is legal in Java 1.5&quot;);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Test your knowledge}}
'''Question 3.11''': Consider the following code:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-11&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.11: Autoboxing/unboxing.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
Integer a = 10;
Integer b = a + 2;
System.out.println(b);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

How many autoboxings and unboxings are there in this code?
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-11&quot;&gt;Answer 3.11: Autoboxing/unboxing.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-2&quot;&gt;
Integer a = 10;
Integer b = a + 2;
System.out.println(b);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
3
* 1 autoboxing at line 1 to assign.
* 1 unboxing at line 2 to do the addition.
* 1 autoboxing at line 2 to assign.
* No autoboxing nor unboxing at line 3 as &lt;code&gt;println()&lt;/code&gt; supports the &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; class as parameter.

== Methods in the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; class ==
Methods in the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object&lt;/code&gt; class are inherited, and thus shared in common by all classes.

=== The &lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt; method ===
The &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object.clone()&lt;/code&gt; method returns a new object that is a copy of the current object.  Classes must implement the marker interface &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Cloneable&lt;/code&gt; to indicate that they can be cloned.

=== The &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; method ===
The &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object.equals(java.lang.Object)&lt;/code&gt; method compares the object to another object and returns a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; result indicating if the two objects are equal.  Semantically, this method compares the contents of the objects whereas the equality comparison operator &quot;&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;&quot; compares the object references.  The &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; method is used by many of the data structure classes in the &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt; package.  Some of these data structure classes also rely on the &lt;code&gt;Object.hashCode&lt;/code&gt; method—see the &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; method for details on the contract between &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt;. Implementing equals() isn't always as easy as it seems, see '[http://www.angelikalanger.com/Articles/JavaSolutions/SecretsOfEquals/Equals.html Secrets of equals()]' for more information.

=== The &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt; method ===
The &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object.finalize()&lt;/code&gt; method is called exactly once before the garbage collector frees the memory for object.  A class overrides &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt; to perform any clean up that must be performed before an object is reclaimed.  Most objects do not need to override &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt;.

There is no guarantee when the &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt; method will be called, or the order in which the &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt; method will be called for multiple objects.  If the JVM exits without performing garbage collection, the OS may free the objects, in which case the &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt; method doesn't get called.

The &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt; method should always be declared &lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt; to prevent other classes from calling the &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt; method.

 protected void finalize() throws Throwable { ... }

=== The &lt;code&gt;getClass&lt;/code&gt; method ===
The &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object.getClass()&lt;/code&gt; method returns the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Class&lt;/code&gt; object for the class that was used to instantiate the object.  The class object is the base class of [[Java Programming/Reflection|reflection]] in Java.  Additional reflection support is provided in the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.reflect&lt;/code&gt; package.

=== The &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; method ===
The &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object.hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; method returns an integer (&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;) that is used as a ''hash code'' for storing the object in an associative array.  Classes that implement the &lt;code&gt;java.util.Map&lt;/code&gt; interface provide associative arrays and rely on the &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; method.  A good &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; implementation will return a hash code that is stable (does not change) and evenly distributed (the hash codes of unequal objects tend to be unequal and the hash codes are evenly distributed across integer values).

Because associative arrays depend on both the &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; methods, there is an important contract between these two methods that must be maintained if the objects are to be inserted into a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt;:

: For two objects ''a'' and ''b''
:* &lt;code&gt;a.equals(b) == b.equals(a)&lt;/code&gt;
:* if &lt;code&gt;a.equals(b)&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;a.hashCode() == b.hashCode()&lt;/code&gt;

In order to maintain this contract, a class that overrides the &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; method must also override the &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; method, and vice versa, so that &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; is based on the same properties (or a subset of the properties) as &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt;.

A further contract that the map has with the object is that the results of the &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; methods will not change once the object has been inserted into the map.  For this reason, it is generally a good practice to base the hash function on immutable properties of the object.

Two equal objects must have the same hashcode. However, 2 different objects are NOT required to have different hashcodes.

=== The &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt; method ===
The &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object.toString()&lt;/code&gt; method returns a &lt;code&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/code&gt; that contains a text representation of the object.  The &lt;code&gt;'''''toString'''''&lt;/code&gt; method is implicitly called by the compiler when an object operand is used with the string concatenation operators (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt;).

=== The wait and notify thread signaling methods ===
Every object has two wait lists for threads associated with it.  One wait list is used by the &lt;code&gt;synchronized&lt;/code&gt; keyword to acquire the mutex lock associated with the object.  If the mutex lock is currently held by another thread, the current thread is added to the list of blocked threads waiting on the mutex lock.  The other wait list is used for signaling between threads accomplished through the &lt;code&gt;wait&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;notify&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;notifyAll&lt;/code&gt; methods.

Use of wait/notify allows efficient coordination of tasks between threads.  When one thread needs to wait for another thread to complete an operation, or needs to wait until an event occurs, the thread can suspend its execution and wait to be notified when the event occurs.  This is in contrast to polling, where the thread repeatedly sleeps for a short period of time and then checks a flag or other condition indicator.  Polling is both more computationally expensive, as the thread has to continue checking, and less responsive since the thread won't notice the condition has changed until the next time to check.

==== The &lt;code&gt;wait&lt;/code&gt; methods ====
There are three overloaded versions of the &lt;code&gt;wait&lt;/code&gt; method to support different ways to specify the timeout value: &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object.wait()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object.wait(long)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object.wait(long, int)&lt;/code&gt;.  The first method uses a timeout value of zero (0), which means that the wait does not timeout; the second method takes the number of milliseconds as a timeout; the third method takes the number of nanoseconds as a timeout, calculated as &lt;code&gt;1000000 * timeout + nanos&lt;/code&gt;.

The thread calling &lt;code&gt;wait&lt;/code&gt; is blocked (removed from the set of executable threads) and added to the object's wait list.  The thread remains in the object's wait list until one of three events occurs:
# another thread calls the object's &lt;code&gt;notify&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;notifyAll&lt;/code&gt; method;
# another thread calls the thread's &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Thread.interrupt&lt;/code&gt; method; or
# a non-zero timeout that was specified in the call to &lt;code&gt;wait&lt;/code&gt; expires.

The &lt;code&gt;wait&lt;/code&gt; method must be called inside of a block or method synchronized on the object.  This insures that there are no race conditions between &lt;code&gt;wait&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;notify&lt;/code&gt;.  When the thread is placed in the wait list, the thread releases the object's mutex lock.  After the thread is removed from the wait list and added to the set of executable threads, it must acquire the object's mutex lock before continuing execution.

==== The &lt;code&gt;notify&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;notifyAll&lt;/code&gt; methods ====
The &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object.notify()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object.notifyAll()&lt;/code&gt; methods remove one or more threads from an object's wait list and add them to the set of executable threads.  &lt;code&gt;notify&lt;/code&gt; removes a single thread from the wait list, while &lt;code&gt;notifyAll&lt;/code&gt; removes all threads from the wait list.  Which thread is removed by &lt;code&gt;notify&lt;/code&gt; is unspecified and dependent on the JVM implementation.

The notify methods must be called inside of a block or method synchronized on the object.  This insures that there are no race conditions between &lt;code&gt;wait&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;notify&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Direct Translations==
Hi Ronclau,

Welcome to Wikibooks. Please don't take offense, but I reverted your direct translation edits to the Chinese Wikibook lessons. Thanks for your contributions to the 'Nations of the World' page, but I think word-for-word translations are a bit redundant, considering a vocab list will be made available for all lessons. Not having direct translations there will also help test vocab recall.&lt;br&gt;--[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 20:25, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

==C++ Programming==

Hi, just saw your edits to the C++ memory management text -- better than my original text, so thanks.  Please feel very free (indeed, asked if you would be willing) to do likewise elsewhere in the C++ Programming wikibook.  I think you'll find your contributions welcome by the others who have worked on the book so far (I'm a fairly minor contributor myself). -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 21:48, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

Hi again... noted your comment on http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Functions and responded to it with examples of passing arrays by reference.  Thanks for the feedback, it's always useful to see what's not clear to readers. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 07:57, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Linguistic Intelligence 

“Linguistic intelligence is the ability to use languages to excite, please, convince, stimulate or convey information, http://www.cookps.act.edu.au/mi_ling.htm. Linguistic intelligence involves not only ease in producing language, but also sensitivity to the nuances, order and rhythm of words.

From a very early age we have all been encouraged to develop the art of communication. Even if we do not consider ourselves to be particularly talented, we have at least learned sufficient so as to interact fairly successfully with others. There are however, individuals who have developed their linguistic skills to the point where it becomes an art. They have the ability to write and talk fluently, utilising a broad vocabulary to express the precise meaning of what they wish to convey and they can speak almost melodically with changing intonations and rhythms of sound to express feelings and promote memory.

“ Language, the chief product of linguistic intelligence, is surprisingly flexible. The deaf can learn language, and people can learn to read language through totally different symbol-processing systems --through a sound-oriented system of syllables (like our alphabet) or through a visually oriented system of ideograms (like Chinese symbols). Studies indicate that syllables and ideograms are processed in entirely different areas of the brain, yet the linguistic intelligence can successfully make use of either method of encoding. It is characteristic of intelligence, in Gardner's view, to appropriate whatever faculties or senses it needs, without being entirely dependent upon any of them. Gardner's linguistic intelligence includes qualities of both left and right hemispheric processing of language--both language in the linear sense and language in the enfolded, holistic sense. The linguistic intelligence appears to be a combination of several differently evolved systems--expressive gesture, intonation, the cognitive abilities of naming and classifying, and syntactical parsing” [http://www.longleaf.net/ggrow/7In/Linguistic.html]

Characteristic of linguistic intelligence:

“A deep understanding of words and sensitivity to the literal and figurative meaning of words, high developed oral and written communication skills, knowledge of grammar rules and when it is appropriate to disregard those rules, knowledge of the many different uses for languages, such as persuasion, information, or pleasure” http://www.arches.uga.edu/~hmt/webwrite/linguistic.htm

Possible career interests:

Journalist, writer, teacher, lawyer, politician, translator, poet, actor, comedian, orator novelist, and speechwriter.

Exercises to strengthen linguistic intelligence

“The advantages of developing ones Linguistic Intelligence further are many. We use language to explain, persuade, sell, argue, speak publicly, describe, write and so on” [http://www.inspiring-breakthrough.co.uk/learning-styles/linguistic-learning.htm]  Activities that can aid to improve Linguistic Intelligence are: learn a new word every day, write poems and stories, do puzzles and crosswords, learn about neuro-Linguistic Programming and use computer to write letters and emails.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electronic Paper

Using Electronic paper for Education

“Electronic paper, e-paper is a technology that let the text on a piece of paper to be re-written. The paper is actually made of organic electronics that use conductive plastic which restrain tiny balls that react to an electric charge, changing the page in much the same way that pixels change on a computer monitor” [http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper]

Electronic paper was developed in order to overcome some of the limitations of computer monitors. For example, the backlighting of monitors is hard on the human eye, whereas electronic paper reflects light just like normal paper. It is easier to read at an angle than flat screen monitors because it is made of plastic, electronic paper has the potential to be flexible. It is light and potentially inexpensive.

“Electronic paper might one day serve as the vehicle for a low-cost stream of data to schools all over the world. And, while students today often hurt backs with the heavy books they have to carry around in their backpacks, students of the future might get by with only one textbook. It would be electronic, and its pages would change with the touch of a button. Electronic paper is much easier to read than typical computer screen, on the other hand it reflects the light around it make it much clearer, crisper, easier way to read text on a display, Bischoff says”. [http://www.sciencenewsforkids.org/articles/20031203/Feature1.asp]

“Electronic papers were used in all subjects areas, more as suggested reading than as course materials. They were used a lot in Computer and Information Science, Geography, Languages, Mathematics and Statistics, and Medicine, and least used in English and Science. All of the Geography, Mathematics and Statistics, and Medicine. 
[http://jodi.tamu.edu/Articles/v03/i04/Wilson]

Books with printed pages are unique in that they embody the simultaneous, high-resolution display of hundreds of pages of information. The representation of information on a large number of physical pages, which may be physically turned and written on, constitutes a highly preferred means of information interaction. An obvious disadvantage of the printed page, however, is its immutability once typeset. We are currently developing electronically addressable paper-page displays that use real paper substrates. This effort includes the development of novel electronically addressable 
Contrast media, microencapsulation chemistry, and desktop printing technologies to print functional circuits, logic, and display elements on paper or paper-like substrates, including interconnecting vias and multi-layer logic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Virtual classroom

“Virtual classroom it is an environment unlike the traditional classroom. In actual fact, the virtual classroom is wherever you and your computer happen to be. It could be in your room, in one of the University microcomputer labs, or at an isolated site far removed from the KSU campus. Your virtual class schedule is whatever time you want it to be” [http://www.cis.ksu.edu/cis10X/virtual.htm
]
Virtual classroom provides a perfect environment for online training and gives a feel of being in the classroom itself. Virtual classroom integrates the best learning practices with the power of internet to provide a dynamic learning platform to the learner. The virtual classroom/e-learning has innumerable advantages and the most vital of which are the saving of time and cost, no interaction between teachers and students and no sense of peer pressure.

Of course, taking internet-based course at the pre-College/university level can have both pros and cons. Below will follow some of them that would make you decide if virtual learning is for you.

Positive aspects of virtual classroom/e-learning.

“Independence and time Management

Students who take courses online often sharpen their ability to work on their own, and they also expand experience in managing their time efficiently. With nobody to stand over them and make them work, virtual learners tend to develop these skills more rapidly than if they were to learn strictly in a traditional classroom.

Advanced and specialized classes

In many cases, small school and rural schools simply cannot offer advanced or specialized classes. Virtual education gives students the opportunity to gain experience in areas that would otherwise remain out of reach.

Emphasis on the written work

Strong writing skills are essential to success in secondary and higher education as well as in the workplace. Virtual learning/distance education teaches students to communicate more effectively through writing, because the questions they ask and the work they complete is based almost solely on the written word. Virtual learning clearly gives students the chance to widen writing skills.

Knotty aspects of virtual/distance education

Lack of face-to face interaction

Some educators dispute that both teacher-student and student-student contact are essential to the learning process, and online classes eradicate these elements of education altogether. Also, students who excel at class participation need to deem that this piece of the learning puzzle will be missing as well.

The need to self-start

Virtual education actually lets students make their own schedules. Those who have a hard time with self-motivation will undoubtedly have problem in this type of educational setting” [http://www.collegeboard.com/article/0,3868,2-7-0-47337,00.html]

[[Category:Educational Technology Innovation and Impact]]SCREEN READER


“A screen reader is a software application that attempts to identify and interpret what is being displayed on the screen. This is then presented to a blind user as speech (by text-to-speech) or by driving a Braille display. Screen readers are used by people with little or no functional vision: people with some vision often use screen magnifiers” [http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/screen_reader] Besides people with low-vision, people with limited-vision, learning disabilities, mobility impairments, English as a second language, the elderly, and people with reading delays can use text-to-speech technology as an assistive technology.

Screen readers (or speech output systems) are designed to aid blind people give them access to standard computers and software such as word processors, spreadsheets, email, icons, windows and internet browsers. Screen reader have gave people with low vision a very great opportunity to access wide range of information, neuro-processing and the communication ideas that was behind their reach. “However, using a screen reader is, according to some users, considerably more difficult than using Graphical User Interface and many applications have specific problems resulting from the nature of the application (e.g. animations in Macromedia Flash) or failure to comply with accessibility standards for the platform (e.g. Microsoft word and Active Accessibility” [http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/screen reader]

A standard computer whether is laptop or desktop can be personalized by tallying a screen reader, which enable the computer to speak. The screen reader let navigation around the computer screen and presents what is happening on the screen to the user in a significant way using speech output. The computer is used by mingling a standard keyboard and keyboard shortcuts rather than a mouse use the computer.

“Different screen readers do have some common features: 1) You can mute the speech with one keystroke, adjust the speech, pitch and volume of the voice and repeat what was last said. As text is entered it can be spoken as each word or letter is completed. 2) There is also optional speaking of capital letters, punctuation and symbols. 3) Menus, dialogues boxes, tool tips, system messages and other text and graphical information can be read back” [http://www.rnib.org.uk/]

There are various types of screen readers available and some are more popular in different environments. Some more sophisticated products are designed to work best in an education or employment situation as they can be configured to work with different programs. Others are more for home use as they may offer restricted features in comparison with more expensive screen readers, focusing on word processing, Internet and email. Some of the screen readers on the market include JAWS by Freedom Scientific, Window-Eyes by GW Micro[http://www.gwmicro.com/] LookOUT from Choice Technology [http://www.screenreader.co.uk/], and Hal and Supernova from Dolphin [http://www.dolphincomputeraccess.com/].

      <comment>Rejected the last text change (by [[Special:Contributions/121.1.18.239|121.1.18.239]]) and restored revision 1537719 by Adrignola</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A trial balance (OR a list of account balances) is a list of all ledger balances (which form part of the double entry system only) shown in debit and credit columns. The totals of each columns should be the same if all debits and credits are entered systematically. 

The trial balance is not a financial document officially, but it is just a method used to test the accuracy of the double entry bookkeeping methods. Because of this, the exact format may vary but in practice many trial balance reports appear very similar.  A common format is to list the balance sheet accounts first, followed by the income statement accounts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Performing an Oil Change

Changing your auto's oil regularly is essential to your engine's proper operation.  As dirt and metal filings build up in your car's oil it becomes less able to provide proper lubrication.  With time your oil will degrade, causing Viscosity to increase, further limiting its ability to lubricate the engine.  This guide will not get into specifics for each model of auto, more info can be found online and in the various brands of repair manuals available.

In recent years, both the metallurgy of engines and the chemistry of oil have seen great advances, so that many engines outlast the rest of the car without need for major overhauls or rebuilding, if given proper scheduled lubrication.

Car manuals state the recommended oil service interval for the car; there are often a specification for easy duty and one for heavier duty. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, sustained operation at higher power levels and higher temperatures constitutes easier duty, as far as the oil is concerned, as it allows any contamination of water vapor and/or fuel to boil off. Thus, engines which are mostly restricted only to short usage in the city will require more frequent oil changes due to the buildup of these contaminants. Extreme high temperatures, however, will cause normal oils first to deteriorate, then to &quot;carbonize&quot;, ''i.e.'' turn into hard solid carbon particles, with bad effects on lubricated parts; this generally is only a problem in engines which badly overheat, or in the bearings of turbochargers which do not have mechanisms to prevent this, such as water cooling for the bearings, or systems to continue to pump the oil after engine shutoff. In these cases, in addition to more frequent oil changes, use of synthetic oil, which is more stable to high temperatures, may be of advantage.

== Required Materials ==
1) Basic Socket set and Ratchet. Almost any basic socket set 3/8in drive will have the proper size for most cars and light trucks.

2) Oil of the correct type for your auto.  Your car's manual will list the proper type and amount of oil to use.

3) Oil filter. Someone at the auto parts store will help you find the correct filter for your auto. Quality of filters varies widely, in terms of quality and amount of filtration material as well as quality of such internal components as bypass valves, and much debate is documented on Usenet and the Web regarding analysis of the internal components of various brands. 

4) Something to catch the used oil.  I use an old kitchen pot, but car parts stores sell suitable alternatives.

5) Oil filter wrench. The &quot;strap type&quot; looks a bit like a large egg frying ring with a handle, and wraps around the filter body and tightens its grip as it is twisted, somewhat similar to kitchen gadgets sold for opening tops of jars. It often has two separate settings for wide and narrow filters; however the wide range of filters used currently does not guarantee that either of these settings on a given wrench will fit, so a few sizes of this type of wrench are available. The handle may be fixed in the plane of the strap, or swivel to allow angled access in tight areas.
:The second type of wrench is the &quot;cup&quot; type, which fits over the end of the filter, which usually has several flutes pressed in, and in turn attaches to a socket wrench. This type of wrench comes in several sizes which must be fit to the particular filter.
:It is also possible to pierce the oil filter with a screw driver and a hammer if you do not have access to any tools. 

*Optional
You may find it more comfortable to purchase some ramps or jack stands to raise the auto a bit off the ground while you work. Proper use of these is outside the scope of this how-to, but be sure to follow all directions and warnings.
Also, I use a large piece of cardboard to keep my back out of the dirt when working under the car.

== Changing the Oil ==


=== Step 1: Removing the old oil ===


Firstly run the engine on idle for a few minutes, This makes the oil warm which will let it drain from the sump faster. After turning off the engine, get under the auto and locate the oil pan, usually directly under the engine. At the base of the oil pan there will be a drain plug. Position the bucket/pot/etc. you decided to use for old oil below and in front of the drain plug.  Remove the drain plug with the ratchet and socket set. Allow the oil to drain completely. Replace the drain plug.

There are two schools of thought regarding draining the old oil; one believes in letting the oil drain for a long time so as to extract as much of the old, presumably dirty and contaminated oil from the oil passages as possible. The other philosophy is the opposite;  to complete the entire operation in the shortest possible time, in order that there be some residual oil still present in the oil passages to provide some lubrication during the period while the oiling system (including the filter) must refill, on the grounds that, if the oil is changed on a reasonably frequent schedule, a few ounces of contaminated oil in the new oil for the next few months are preferable to a few seconds of oil starvation. 


=== Step 2: Removing the old oil filter, and installing the new one ===


Locate your auto's oil filter. Position a rag below it, as some oil will come out as you unscrew it with the oil filter wrench. Unscrew the old oil filter, and put it aside.  Lubricate the seal on the new oil filter with a few drops of oil.  Check the old filter to ensure that the seal is still there and did not stick to the engine, as happens occasionally and is easy to miss; in such a case, the new filter will not seal correctly and chronic major oil leaks will result. Then screw it on until it starts to get tight and then just 3/4 of a turn more.  This ensures the filter will be properly seated with out over-tightening it. Since a properly installed filter will become slightly more tightly sealed over time as the gasket swells somewhat, an overtightened filter can become a major problem to remove, with strap type wrenches slipping before the filter turns and cup-type filters actually breaking before the filter loosens.

=== Step 3: Refilling with new oil ===


Locate your auto's oil fill spout, generally on the top of the engine somewhere.  Take the top off, and fill with the amount of oil specified in your auto's manual using a funnel to avoid spilling. Replace top.  If you're like many people and don't have a manual and you were able to fill the oil filter, go ahead and fill the engine until the oil is level with the full line on the dipstick.  
Start the engine and let idle for a few minutes, then shutoff the engine, wait a few minutes for the oil to drain into the sump, and check the dipstick to make sure the oil is at the proper level.  Always check the oil with the engine off unless the dipstick says otherwise.  Do not overfill or underfill.
Remember to dispose of your old engine oil correctly at your local waste recycling center.


That's it.  Your auto is now ready for another 3000 miles (~5000km) of use with most oils.  Consult the packaging that came with your oil to determine its proper use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This generic object is a [[../GfsEvent/]] which also defines where to write the data to output.

The syntax in parameter files is as follows:

 [ [[../GfsEvent/]] ] FILE

where FILE is either a string defining the file in which to write the output, or a shell-script enclosed within braces to which the output will be piped. Two file names have special meaning: &quot;stderr&quot; and &quot;stdout&quot; for the standard error and standard output respectively.

If a C-like formatting string appears in the file name, it is interpreted as follows:

; %d :	is replaced with the current processor number.
; %ld :	is replaced with the current time step number.
; %f :	is replaced with the current physical time.

Note that most of the C language format specifiers are recognized (i.e. it is possible to use formatting strings like %05.2f etc...).

If the simulation does not start at time zero the existing files are appended otherwise they are overwritten.

The &quot;pipe&quot; feature of GfsOutput can for example be used to do on-the-flight post-processing of the data stream, as in the following example:

  GfsOutputPPM { istep = 1 } { ppmtoy4m -v 0 -F 24:1 | mpeg2enc -v 0 -o vorticity.mpg } { v = Vorticity }

which will convert the PPM stream generated by GfsOutputPPM directly to MPEG using the MJPEG tools collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Events are used to control any action which needs to be performed at a given time during a simulation. This includes one off actions as well as periodically repeated actions.

The syntax in parameter files is as follows:

 GfsEvent { start = 0.1 istart = 10 ( step = 1.2 | istep = 10 ) end = 0.4 iend = 123 }

with:

;start:	Physical starting time (default is zero). The &quot;end&quot; keyword can be used to indicate the end of the simulation.
;istart: Time step starting time (default is zero).
;step:	Repeat every step physical time units (default is infinity).
;istep:	Repeat every istep time steps (default is infinity).
;end:	Stop at or before this physical time (default is infinity).
;iend:	Stop at or before this number of time steps (default is infinity).

Parametric equations are typically definied by two equations that specify both the x and y coordinates of a graph using a parameter. They are graphed using the parameter (usually t) to figure out both the x and y coordinates.

'''Example 1:'''

&lt;math&gt;x = t \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = t^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;

Note: This parametric equation is equivalent to the rectangular equation &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example 2:'''

&lt;math&gt;x = \cos t \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = \sin t \ &lt;/math&gt;

Note: This parametric equation is equivalent to the rectangular equation &lt;math&gt; x^2 + y^2 = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt; and the polar equation &lt;math&gt;  
r=1 \ &lt;/math&gt;.

Parametric equations can be plotted by using a t-table to show values of x and y for each value of t.  They can also be plotted by eliminating the parameter though this method removes the parameter's importance.

==Forms of Parametric Equations==

Parametric equations can be described in three ways:
* Parametric form
* Vector form
* An equality

The first two forms are used far more often, as they allow us to find the value of the component at the given value of the parameter.  The final form is used less often; it allows us to verify a solution to the equation, or find the parameter (or some constant multiple thereof).

===Parametric Form===
A parametric equation can be shown in ''parametric form'' by describing it with a system of equations.  For instance:

&lt;math&gt;x = t \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = t^2 - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

===Vector Form===
''Vector form'' can be used to describe a parametric equation in a similar manner to ''parametric form''.  In this case, a position vector is given:
&lt;math&gt;[x,y] = [t, t^2 - 1] \ &lt;/math&gt;

===Equalities===
A parametric equation can also be described with a set of equalities.  This is done by solving for the parameter, and equating the components.  For example:

&lt;math&gt;x = t \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = t^2 - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

From here, we can solve for t:

&lt;math&gt;t = x \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t = \pm\sqrt{1+y} \ &lt;/math&gt;

And hence equate the two right-hand sides:

&lt;math&gt;x = \pm\sqrt{1+y} \ &lt;/math&gt;

==Converting Parametric Equations==

There are a few common place methods used to change a parametric equation to rectangular form. The first involves solving for t in one of the two equations and then replacing the new expression for t with the variable found in the second equation. 

'''Example 1:'''

&lt;math&gt;x=t-3 \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y=t^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x=t-3 \ &lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt; x+3=t \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; y=(x+3)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 2:'''

Given

&lt;math&gt; x=3\cos{\theta} \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; y=4\sin{\theta} \ &lt;/math&gt;

Isolate the trigonometric functions

&lt;math&gt; \cos{\theta} = \frac{x}{3} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sin{\theta} = \frac{y}{4} &lt;/math&gt;

Use the &quot;Beloved Identity&quot;

&lt;math&gt; \cos^2{\theta} + \sin^2{\theta} = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{x^2}{9} + \frac{y^2}{16} = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

==Strategy==

===Forward Planning===
Forward planning in IT is critical if an organization's future needs are going to be met. Network design, hardware and software are constantly changing and being improved with new technologies and trends. Besides the technology, organizations change locations, the number of staff, their approach to marketing and communication and so do their customers.&lt;br&gt;
There are several areas to consider in forward IT planning:
* The new ways that people will be communicating eg. VOIP, Instant Messaging and Blogs
* The possible new locations that your organisation will be operating in
* How many IT staff will be required and what specialties they should have
* How desktop and laptop PCs will be upgraded over time
* How servers will be upgraded
* How network hardware and bandwidth will be upgraded
* How possible acquisitions by your organisation can be accommodated
* New applications that could be implemented on the server or client
* New technologies such as mobile internet-aware devices or server virtualisation

===Outsourcing===
It may or may not be worth outsourcing IT services.

Some important factors include:
* the cost of doing it yourself as opposed to paying someone else,
* the burden of hiring and managing staff, 
* whether staff are available at a reasonable cost,
* whether a company can utilise overseas people to save on labour costs
* the potential liability in doing it yourself, 
* the accountability you can gain from service level agreements if you pay someone else to do it
* the frequency of the task concerned - an infrequent job might not sustain a full-time person

Pretty much any area of IT can be outsourced.&lt;br&gt;
Areas that can be outsourced include:
* email security such as spam and virus filtering
* email servers
* network security/design/management
** this includes firewalls/routers/network links
* software development
* web development/design
* desktop publishing
* IT strategy


===Policies===
Policies assist both with keeping organisations and their employees accountable and with limiting the organisation's liability. Policies set the standards on what is acceptable and what is not.
Policies are essential for setting out the guidelines for:
* monitoring of employees' email, files, print jobs and phone calls. This is enforced by privacy laws, particularly in the US and Australia.
* system administrators use of power - eg. allowing others to see someone's email or web access logs, accessing senior management's email, accessing financial information, auditing file access
* acceptable websites and whether unacceptable ones will be blocked by a proxy server.
* acceptable language to use when representing the company
* personal email such as Hotmail/Yahoo and when they should be accessed if at all
* personal emails within the organisation's email system - particularly who owns them
* personal phone calls on both mobile/cellular phones and office phones
* filing of emails with projects
* how to use the company logos ie. preserving the organisation's visual identity
* who can change the company website(s)

Procedures might also be useful for when:
* someone wants to make a change to the company website
* to be completed...
* Awareness policies about the securities of official data as well as adopting new researches results which can bring more productivity at work.

===Liability===
There are many areas where IT affects the legal liability of an organisation. An IT professional needs to be aware of them and attempt to minimise them.
Some examples are:
* licensing - using software without being licensed could result in lawsuits
* access control to files - sensitive government projects or information pertaining to confidentiality agreed projects will need to be carefully managed, not all staff will necessarily need access
* record keeping standards and procedures - as a result of major corporate failures, government tax and reporting laws are becoming stricter. These spill over into IT 
* backup procedures - you may not want to keep some things because they represent a risk
* supplier contracts - only IT will know the intimate details of suppliers contracts and will need to be aware of payment obligations, marketing the supplier may do using your name
* tendering suppliers - potential suppliers may sue if they feel they have been discriminated against during the tender process

==Introduction==
Same place, different day. Knut is sitting at his desk again, staring at a blank paper in front of him, while nervously playing with a pen in his right hand. Just a few hours left to hand in his essay and he has not written a word. All of a sudden he smashes his fist on the table and cries out: &quot;I need a plan!&quot;

That thing Knut is confronted with is something everyone of us encounters in his daily life. He has got a problem - and he does not really know how to solve it. But [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#What_is_a_problem|what exactly is a problem?]] Are there strategies to solve problems? These are just a few of the questions we want to answer in this chapter.

We begin our chapter by giving a short description of what psychologists regard as a problem. Afterwards we are going to present different approaches towards problem solving, starting with [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Restructuring_-_The_Gestalt_Approach|gestalt psychologists]] and ending with modern [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Problem_Solving_as_a_Search_Problem|search strategies]] connected to artificial intelligence. In addition we will also consider [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#How_do_Experts_Solve_Problems|how experts do solve problems]] and finally we will have a closer look at two topics: The [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Neurophysiological_Background|neurophysiological background]] on the one hand and the question what kind of role can be assigned to [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#The_Evolutionary_Perspective|evolution]] regarding problem solving on the other.

The most basic definition is “A problem is any given situation that differs from a desired goal”. This definition is very useful for discussing problem solving in terms of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution evolutionary] adaptation, as it allows to understand every aspect of (human or animal) life as a problem. This includes issues like finding food in harsh winters, remembering where you left your provisions, making decisions about which way to go, learning, repeating and varying all kinds of complex movements, and so on. Though all these problems were of crucial importance during the evolutionary process that created us the way we are, they are by no means solved exclusively by humans. We find a most amazing variety of different solutions for these problems in nature (just consider, e.g., by which means a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat#Anatomy bat] hunts its prey, compared to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider#Predatory_techniques spider]). For this essay we will mainly focus on those problems that are not solved by animals or evolution, that is, all kinds of abstract problems (e.g. playing chess). Furthermore, we will not consider those situations as problems that have an obvious solution: Imagine Knut decides to take a sip of coffee from the mug next to his right hand. He does not even have to think about how to do this. This is not because the situation itself is trivial (a robot capable of recognising the mug, deciding whether it is full, then grabbing it and moving it to Knut’s mouth would be a highly complex machine) but because in the context of all possible situations it is so trivial that it no longer is a problem our consciousness needs to be bothered with. The problems we will discuss in the following all need some conscious effort, though some seem to be solved without us being able to say how exactly we got to the solution. Still we will find that often the strategies we use to solve these problems are applicable to more basic problems, too.

Non-trivial, abstract problems can be divided into two groups:

===Well-defined Problems===
For many abstract problems it is possible to find an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm algorithmic] solution. We call all those problems well-defined that can be properly formalised, which comes along with the following properties:

*        The problem has a clearly defined given state. This might be the line-up of a chess game, a given formula you have to solve, or the set-up of the towers of Hanoi game (which we will [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Means-End_Analysis|discuss later]]).

*        There is a finite set of operators, that is, of rules you may apply to the given state. For the chess game, e.g.,  these would be the rules that tell you which piece you may move to which position.

*        Finally, the problem has a clear goal state: The equations is resolved to x, all discs are moved to the right stack, or the other player is in checkmate.

Not surprisingly, a problem that fulfils these requirements can be implemented algorithmically (also see [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Convergent_Thinking|convergent thinking]]). Therefore many well-defined problems can be very effectively solved by computers, like playing chess.

===Ill-defined Problems===
Though many problems can be properly formalised (sometimes only if we accept an enormous complexity) there are still others where this is not the case. Good examples for this are all kinds of tasks that involve [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity creativity], and, generally speaking, all problems for which it is not possible to clearly define a given state and a goal state: Formalising a problem of the kind “Please paint a beautiful picture” may be impossible. Still this is a problem most people would be able to access in one way or the other, even if the result may be totally different from person to person. And while Knut might judge that picture X is gorgeous, you might completely disagree.

Nevertheless ill-defined problems often involve sub-problems that can be totally well-defined. On the other hand, many every-day problems that seem to be completely well-defined involve- when examined in detail- a big deal of creativity and ambiguities.

If we think of Knut's fairly ill-defined task of writing an essay, he will not be able to complete this task without first understanding the text he has to write about. This step is the first subgoal Knut has to solve. Interestingly, ill-defined problems often involve subproblems that are well-defined.

==Restructuring - The Gestalt Approach==

One dominant approach to Problem Solving originated from [[wikipedia:Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]] in the 1920s. Their understanding of problem solving emphasises behaviour in situations requiring relatively novel means of attaining goals and suggests that problem solving involves a process called restructuring. Since this indicates a perceptual approach, two main questions have to be considered:
*How is a problem represented in a person's mind?
*How does solving this problem involve a reorganisation or restructuring of this representation?
This is what we are going to do in the following part of this section.

===How is a problem represented in the mind?===

In current research internal and external representations are distinguished: The first kind is regarded as the [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Knowledge|knowledge]] and structure of [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Memory|memory]], while the latter type is defined as the knowledge and structure of the environment, such like physical objects or symbols whose information can be picked up and processed by the perceptual system autonomously. On the contrary the information in internal representations has to be retrieved by cognitive processes. 

Generally speaking, problem representations are [[wikipedia:Mental model|models]] of the situation as experienced by the agent. Representing a problem means to analyse it and split it into separate components:
*objects, predicates
*state space
*operators
*selection criteria
Therefore the efficiency of Problem Solving depends on the underlying representations in a person’s mind, which usually also involves personal aspects.
Analysing the problem domain according to different dimensions, i.e., changing from one representation to another, results in arriving at a new understanding of a problem. This is basically what is described as restructuring.
The following example illustrates this:

:Two boys of different age are playing badminton. The older one is a more skilled player, and therefore it is predictable for the outcome of usual matches who will be the winner. After some time and several defeats the younger boy finally loses interest in playing, and the older boy faces a problem, namely that he has no one to play with anymore.
:The usual options, according to M. Wertheimer (1945/82), at this point of the story range from 'offering candy' and 'playing another game' to 'not playing to full ability' and 'shaming the younger boy into playing'. All those strategies aim at making the younger stay.
:And this is what the older boy comes up with: He proposes that they should try to keep the bird in play as long as possible. Thus they change from a game of competition to one of cooperation. They'd start with easy shots and make them harder as their success increases, counting the number of consecutive hits. The proposal is happily accepted and the game is on again.

The key in this story is that the older boy ''restructured'' the problem and found out that he used an attitude towards the younger which made it difficult to keep him playing. With the new type of game the problem is solved: the older is not bored, the younger not frustrated. 

Possibly, new representations can make a problem more difficult or much easier to solve. To the latter case [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Insight|insight]]– the sudden realisation of a problem’s solution – seems to be related.

===Insight===

There are two very different ways of approaching a ''goal-oriented situation''. In one case an organism readily ''reproduces'' the response to the given problem from past experience. This is called '''reproductive thinking'''.

The second way requires ''something new and different'' to achieve the goal, prior learning is of little help here. Such '''productive thinking''' is (sometimes) argued to involve '''insight'''. Gestalt psychologists even state that insight problems are a separate category of problems in their own right.

Tasks that might involve insight usually have certain features - they require something new and non-obvious to be done and in most cases they are difficult enough to predict that the initial solution attempt will be unsuccessful. When you solve a problem of this kind you often have a so called '''&quot;AHA-experience&quot;''' - the solution pops up all of a sudden. At one time you do not have any ideas of  the answer to the problem, you do not even feel to make any progress trying out different ideas, but in the next second the problem is solved.

For all those readers who would like to experience such an effect, here is an example for an Insight Problem: Knut is given four pieces of a chain; each made up of three links. The task is to link it all up to a closed loop and he has only 15 cents. To open a link costs 2, to close a link costs 3 cents. What should Knut do? 

[[Image:chain solved.svg|thumbnail=chain_task.svg|center|If you want to know the correct solution, click to enlarge the image.]]

To show that solving insight problems involves ''restructuring'', psychologists created a number of problems that were more difficult to solve for participants provided with previous experiences, since it was harder for them to change the representation of the given situation (see [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Fixation|Fixation]]). Sometimes  given hints may lead to the insight required to solve the problem. And this is also true for involuntarily given ones. For instance it might help you to solve a memory game if someone accidentally drops a card on the floor and you look at the other side. Although such help is not obviously a hint, the effect does not differ from that of intended help. 

For ''non-insight'' problems the opposite is the case. Solving arithmetical problems, for instance, requires [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Schema|schemas]], through which one can get to the solution step by step.

===Fixation===

Sometimes, previous experience or familiarity can even make problem solving more difficult. This is the case whenever habitual directions get in the way of finding new directions – an effect called '''fixation'''.

====Functional fixedness====

Functional fixedness concerns the solution of ''object-use problems''. The basic idea is that when the usual way of using an object is emphasised, it will be far more difficult for a person to use that object in a novel manner. An example for this effect is the '''candle problem''': Imagine you are given a box of matches, some candles and tacks. On the wall of the room there is a cork-board. Your task is to fix the candle to the cork-board in such a way that no wax will drop on the floor when the candle is lit. – Got an idea?

[[image:Candle solved.svg|thumbnail=Candle_task.svg|center|The candle task]]

:Explanation: The clue is just the following: when people are confronted with a problem and given certain objects to solve it, it is difficult for them to figure out that they could use them in a different (not so familiar or obvious) way. In this example the box has to be recognised as a support rather than as a container.

A further example is the '''two-string problem''': Knut is left in a room with a chair and a pair of pliers given the task to bind two strings together that are hanging from the ceiling. The problem he faces is that he can never reach both strings at a time because they are just too far away from each other. What can Knut do?

[[image:Two string.png|400px|center]]

:Solution: Knut has to recognise he can use the pliers in a novel function – as weight for a pendulum. He can bind them to one of the :strings, push it away, hold the other string and just wait for the first one moving towards him. If necessary, Knut can even climb on the chair, but he is not that small, we suppose . . .

====Mental fixedness====

Functional fixedness as involved in the examples above illustrates a '''mental set''' - a person’s tendency to respond to a given task in a manner based on past experience. Because Knut maps an object to a particular function he has difficulties to ''vary the way of use'' (pliers as pendulum's weight).

One approach to studying fixation was to study ''wrong-answer verbal insight problems''. It was shown that people tend to give rather an incorrect answer when failing to solve a problem than to give no answer at all.
:A typical example: People are told that on a lake the area covered by water lilies doubles every 24 hours and that it takes 60 days to cover the whole lake. Then they are asked how many days it takes to cover half the lake. The typical response is '30 days' (whereas 59 days is correct).

These wrong solutions are due to an ''inaccurate interpretation'', hence ''representation'', of the problem. This can happen because of ''sloppiness'' (a quick shallow reading of the problem and/or weak monitoring of their efforts made to come to a solution). In this case error feedback should help people to reconsider the problem features, note the inadequacy of their first answer, and find the correct solution. If, however, people are truly fixated on their incorrect representation, being told the answer is wrong does not help. In a study made by P.I. Dallop and R.L. Dominowski in 1992 these two possibilities were contrasted. In approximately one third of the cases ''error feedback'' led to right answers, so only approximately one third of the wrong answers were due to ''inadequate monitoring''.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Dominowski and P. Dallob, Insight and Problem Solving. In The Nature of Insight, R.J. Sternberg &amp; J.E. Davidson (Eds). MIT Press: USA, pp.33-62 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is the study of examples with and without a preceding [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Analogies|analogous]] task. In cases such like the '''water-jug task''' analogous thinking indeed leads to a correct solution, but to take a different way might make the case much simpler:
:Imagine Knut again, this time he is given three jugs with different capacities and is asked to measure the required amount of water. :Of course he is not allowed to use anything despite the jugs and as much water as he likes. In the first case the sizes are: 127 litres, 21 litres and 3 litres while 100 litres are desired.

:In the second case Knut is asked to measure 18 litres from jugs of 39, 15 and three litres size.
In fact participants faced with the 100 litre task first choose a complicate way in order to solve the second one. Others on the contrary who did not know about that complex task solved the 18 litre case by just adding three litres to 15.

==Problem Solving as a Search Problem==
The idea of regarding problem solving as a search problem originated from Alan Newell and Herbert Simon while trying to design computer programs which could solve certain problems. This led them to develop a program called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Problem_Solver General Problem Solver] which was able to solve any well-defined problem by creating heuristics on the basis of the user's input. This input consisted of objects and operations that could be done on them.

As we already know, every problem is composed of an initial state, intermediate states and a goal state (also: desired or final state), while the initial and goal states characterise the situations before and after solving the problem. The intermediate states describe any possible situation between initial and goal state. The set of operators builds up the transitions between the states. A solution is defined as the sequence of operators which leads from the initial state across intermediate states to the goal state.

The simplest method to solve a problem, defined in these terms, is to search for a solution by just trying one possibility after another (also called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error trial and error]).

As already mentioned above, an organised search, following a specific strategy, might not be helpful for finding a solution to some ill-defined problem, since it is impossible to formalise such problems in a way that a search algorithm can find a solution.

As an example we could just take Knut and his essay: he has to find out about his own opinion and formulate it and he has to make sure he understands the sources texts. But there are no predefined operators he can use, there is no panacea how to get to an opinion and even not how to write it down.

===Means-End Analysis===

In Means-End Analysis you try to reduce the difference between initial state and goal state by creating subgoals until a subgoal can be reached directly (probably you know several examples of recursion which works on the basis of this).
 

An example for a problem that can be solved by Means-End Analysis are the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_of_hanoi „Towers of Hanoi“]:

Towers of Hanoi - A well defined problem

 

The initial state of this problem is described by the different sized discs being stacked in order of size on the first of three pegs (the “start-peg“). The goal state is described by these discs being stacked on the third pegs (the “end-peg“) in exactly the same order.

[[Image:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|center]]

There are three operators:
* You are allowed to move one single disc from one peg to another one
* You are only able to move a disc if it is on top of one stack
* A disc cannot be put onto a smaller one.

[[Image:ToH.PNG|center]]

In order to use Means-End Analysis we have to create subgoals. One possible way of doing this is described in the picture:

1.   Moving the discs lying on the biggest one onto the second peg.  

2.   Shifting the biggest disc to the third peg.  

3.   Moving the other ones onto the third peg, too  

You can apply this strategy again and again in order to reduce the problem to the case where you only have to move a single disc – which is then something you are allowed to do. 

Strategies of this kind can easily be formulated for a computer; the respective algorithm for the Towers of Hanoi would look like this:

1.   move n-1 discs from A to B

2.   move disc #n from A to C

3.   move n-1 discs from B to C

where n is the total number of discs, A is the first peg, B the second, C the third one.
Now the problem is reduced by one with each recursive loop.
 
Means-end analysis is important to solve everyday-problems - like getting the right train connection:
You have to figure out where you catch the first train and where you want to arrive, first of all. Then you have to look for possible changes just in case you do not get a direct connection. Third, you have to figure out what are the best times of departure and arrival, on which platforms you leave and arrive and make it all fit together.

===Analogies===

Analogies describe similar structures and interconnect them to clarify and explain certain relations. In a recent study, for example, a song that got stuck in your head is compared to an itching of the brain that can only be scratched by repeating the song over and over again.

===Restructuring by Using Analogies===

One special kind of restructuring, the way already mentioned during the discussion of the Gestalt approach, is analogical problem solving. Here, to find a solution to one problem - the so called target problem, an analogous solution to another problem - the source problem, is presented.

An example for this kind of strategy is the radiation problem posed by K. Duncker in 1945:

As a doctor you have to treat a patient with a malignant, inoperable tumour, buried deep inside the body. There exists a special kind of ray, which is perfectly harmless at a low intensity, but at the sufficient high intensity is able to destroy the tumour - as well as the healthy tissue on his way to it. What can be done to avoid the latter?

When this question was asked to participants in an experiment, most of them couldn't come up with the appropriate answer to the problem. Then they were told a story that went something like this:

A General wanted to capture his enemy's fortress. He gathered a large army to launch a full-scale direct attack, but then learned, that all the roads leading directly towards the fortress were blocked by mines. These roadblocks were designed in such a way, that it was possible for small groups of the fortress-owner's men to pass them safely, but every large group of men would initially set them off. Now the General figured out the following plan: He divided his troops into several smaller groups and made each of them march down a different road, timed in such a way, that the entire army would reunite exactly when reaching the fortress and could hit with full strength.

Here, the story about the General is the source problem, and the radiation problem is the target problem. The fortress is analogous to the tumour and the big army corresponds to the highly intensive ray. Consequently a small group of soldiers represents a ray at low intensity. The solution to the problem is to split the ray up, as the general did with his army, and send the now harmless rays towards the tumour from different angles in such a way that they all meet when reaching it. No healthy tissue is damaged but the tumour itself gets destroyed by the ray at its full intensity.

M. Gick and K. Holyoak presented Duncker's radiation problem to a group of participants in 1980 and 1983. Only 10 percent of them were able to solve the problem right away, 30 percent could solve it when they read the story of the general before. After given an additional hint - to use the story as help - 75 percent of them solved the problem.

With this results, Gick and Holyoak concluded, that analogical problem solving depends on three steps:

1. '''Noticing''' that an analogical connection exists between the source and the target problem.&lt;br&gt;
2. '''Mapping''' corresponding parts of the two problems onto each other (fortress → tumour, army → ray, etc.)&lt;br&gt;
3. '''Applying''' the mapping to generate a parallel solution to the target problem (using little groups of soldiers approaching from different directions → sending several weaker rays from different directions)

Next, Gick and Holyoak started looking for factors that could be helpful for the noticing and the mapping parts, for example:

Discovering the basic linking concept behind the source and the target problem.

'''--&gt;picture coming soon&lt;--'''

====Schema====

The concept that links the target problem with the analogy (the “source problem“) is called problem schema. Gick and Holyoak obtained the activation of a schema on their participants by giving them two stories and asking them to compare and summarise them. This activation of problem schemata is called “schema induction“.

The two presented texts were picked out of six stories which describe analogical problems and their solution. One of these stories was &quot;The General&quot; (remember example in [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Analogies|Chapter 4.1]]).

After solving the task the participants were asked to solve the radiation problem (see chapter 4.2). The experiment showed that in order to solve the target problem reading of two stories with analogical problems is more helpful than reading only one story:
After reading two stories 52% of the participants were able to solve the radiation problem (As told in chapter 4.2 only 30% were able to solve it after reading only one story, namely: “The General“).

Gick and Holyoak found out that the quality of the schema a participant developed differs. They classified them into three groups:
*Good schemata: In good schemata it was recognised that the same concept was used in order to solve the problem (21% of the participants created a good schema and 91% of them were able to solve the radiation problem).
*Intermediate schemata: The creator of an intermediate schema has figured out that the root of the matter equals (here: many small forces solved the problem). (20% created one, 40% of them had the right solution).
*Poor schemata: The poor schemata were hardly related to the target problem. In many poor schemata the participant only detected that the hero of the story was rewarded for his efforts (59% created one, 30% of them had the right solution).

The process of using a schema or analogy, i.e. applying it to a novel situation is called transduction. One can use a common strategy to solve problems of a new kind.

To create a good schema and finally get to a solution is a problem-solving skill that requires practise and some background knowledge.

==How do Experts Solve Problems?==
With the term expert we describe someone who devotes large amounts of his or her time and energy to one specific field of interest in which he, subsequently, reaches a certain level of mastery. It should not be of surprise that experts tend to be better in solving problems in their field than novices (people who are beginners or not as well trained in a field as experts) are. They are faster in coming up with solutions and have a higher success rate of right solutions. But what is the difference between the way experts and non-experts solve problems? Research on the nature of expertise has come up with the following conclusions:

:Experts know more about their field,
:their knowledge is organised differently, and
:they spend more time analysing the problem.

When it comes to problems that are situated outside the experts' field, their performance often does not differ from that of novices.
 
'''Knowledge:'''
An experiment by Chase and Simon (1973a, b) dealt with the question how well experts and novices are able to reproduce positions of chess pieces on chessboards when these are presented to them only briefly. The results showed that experts were far better in reproducing actual game positions, but that their performance was comparable with that of novices when the chess pieces were arranged randomly on the board. Chase and Simon concluded that the superior performance on actual game positions was due to the ability to recognise familiar patterns: A chess expert has up to 50,000 patterns stored in his memory. In comparison, a good player might know about 1,000 patterns by heart and a novice only few to none at all.
This very detailed knowledge is of crucial help when an expert is confronted with a new problem in his field. Still, it is not pure size of knowledge that makes an expert more successful. Experts also organise their knowledge quite differently from novices.

'''Organisation:'''
In 1982 M. Chi and her co-workers took a set of 24 physics problems and presented them to a group of physics professors as well as to a group of students with only one semester of physics. The task was to group the problems based on their similarities.
As it turned out the students tended to group the problems based on their surface structure (similarities of objects used in the problem, e.g. on sketches illustrating the problem), whereas the professors used their deep structure (the general physical principles that underlay the problems) as criteria.
By recognising the actual structure of a problem experts are able to connect the given task to the relevant knowledge they already have (e.g. another problem they solved earlier which required the same strategy).

'''Analysis:'''
Experts often spend more time analysing a problem before actually trying to solve it. This way of approaching a problem may often result in what appears to be a slow start, but in the long run this strategy is much more effective. A novice, on the other hand, might start working on the problem right away, but often has to realise that he reaches dead ends as he chose a wrong path in the very beginning.

==Creative Cognition==
We already introduced a lot of ways to solve a problem, mainly strategies that can be used to find the “correct” answer. But there are also problems which do not require a “right answer” to be given - It is time for creative productiveness!

Imagine you are given three objects – your task is to invent a completely new object that is related to nothing you know. Then try to describe its function and how it could additionally be used. Difficult? Well, you are free to think creatively and will not be at risk to give an incorrect answer. For example think of what can be constructed from a half-sphere, wire and a handle. The result is amazing: a lawn lounger, global earrings, a sled, a water weigher, a portable agitator, ... 
&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, E.B. (2005). Cogntive Psychology. Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience. Belmont: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divergent Thinking===
The term divergent thinking describes a way of thinking that does not lead to one goal, but is open-ended. Problems that are solved this way can have a large number of potential 'solutions' of which none is exactly 'right' or 'wrong', though some might be more suitable than others.  

Solving a problem like this involves indirect and productive thinking and is mostly very helpful when somebody faces an [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Ill-defined_Problems|ill-defined]]problem, i.e. when either initial state or goal state cannot be stated clearly and operators or either insufficient or not given at all. 

The process of divergent thinking is often associated with creativity, and it undoubtedly leads to many creative ideas. Nevertheless, researches have shown that there is only modest correlation between performance on divergent thinking tasks and other measures of creativity.
Additionally it was found that in processes resulting in original and practical inventions things like searching for solutions, being aware of structures and looking for analogies are heavily involved, too.

Thus, divergent thinking alone is not an appropriate tool for making an invention. You also need to analyse the problem in order to make the suggested, i.e. invention, solution appropriate.

===Convergent Thinking===
Divergent can be contrasted by convergent thinking - thinking that seeks to find the correct answer to a specific problem. This is an adequate strategy for solving most of the [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Well-defined_Problems|well-defined]] problems (problems with given initial state, operators and goal state) we presented so far. To solve the given tasks it was necessary to think directly or reproductively.

It is always helpful to use a strategy to think of a way to come closer to the solution, perhaps using knowledge from previous tasks or sudden insight.

==Neurophysiological Background==
Presenting Neurophysiology in its entirety would be enough to fill several books. Fortunately we do not have to concern ourselves with most of these facts. Instead, let's just focus on the aspects that are really relevant to problem solving. Nevertheless this topic is quite complex and problem solving cannot be attributed to one single brain area. Rather there are systems of several brain areas working together to perform a specific task. This is best shown by an example:

:In 1994 Paolo Nichelli and coworkers used the method of PET (Positron Emission Tomography), to localise certain brain areas, which are involved in solving various chess problems. In the following table you can see which brain area was active during a specific task:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Task 
! Location of Brain activity
|- 
|
* Identifying chess pieces

* determining location of pieces
     
 
* Thinking about making a move
     
* Remembering a pieces move
  
      
* Planning and executing strategies
|
* Pathway from Occipital to Temporal Lobe
(also called the &quot;what&quot;-pathway of visual processing)
* Pathway from Occipital to parietal Lobe
(also called the &quot;where&quot;-pathway of visual processing)
* Premotor area

* Hippocampus
(forming new memories)
* Prefrontal cortex
|}

[[Image:Lobes of the brain.svg‎|framed|center|Lobes of the Brain]]

One of the key tasks, namely '''planning and executing strategies''', is performed by a brain area which also plays an important role for several other tasks correlated with problem solving - [[wikipedia:Prefrontal cortex|the prefrontal cortex (PFC)]]. This can be made clear if you take a look at several examples of damages to the PFC and their effects on the ability to solve problems.&lt;br&gt;
Patients with a '''lesion''' in this brain area have difficulty switching from one behaviouristic pattern to another. A well known example is the [[wikipedia:Wisconsin card sort|wisconsin card-sorting task]]. A patient with a PFC lesion who is told to separate all blue cards from a deck, would continue sorting out the blue ones, even if the experimenter told him to sort out all brown cards. Transferred to a more complex problem, this person would most likely fail, because he is not flexible enough to change his strategy after running into a '''dead end'''.&lt;br&gt;
Another example is the one of a young homemaker, who had a tumour in the frontal lobe. Even though she was able to cook individual dishes, preparing a whole family meal was an infeasible task for her.

As the examples above illustrate, the structure of our brain seems to be of great importance regarding problem solving, i.e. cognitive life. But how was our cognitive apparatus designed? How did perception-action integration as a central species specific property come about?

==The Evolutionary Perspective==
[[wikipedia:Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin]] developed the [[wikipedia:Evolutionary theory|evolutionary theory]] which was primarily meant to explain why there are so many different kinds of species. This theory is also important for psychology because it explains how species were ''designed'' by evolutionary forces and what their goals are. By knowing the goals of species it is possible to explain and predict their behaviour.

The process of evolution involves several components, for instance ''[[wikipedia:Natural selection|natural selection]]'' - which is a feedback process that 'chooses' among 'alternative designs' on the basis of deciding how good the respective modulation is. As a result of this natural selection we find [[wikipedia:Adaption|adaption]]. This is a process that constantly tests the variations among individuals in relation to the environment. If adaptions are useful they get passed on; if not they’ll just be an unimportant variation.

Another component of the evolutionary process is sexual selection, i.e. increasing of certain sex characteristics, which give individuals the ability to rival with other individuals of the same sex or an increased ability to attract individuals of the opposite sex.

[[wikipedia:Altruism|Altruism]] is a further component of the evolutionary process, which will be explained in more detail in the following chapter [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions|Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions]].

==Summary and Conclusion==

After Knut read this WikiChapter he was relieved that he did not waste his time for the essay – quite the opposite! He now has a new view on problem solving - and recognises his problem as a well-defined one:          

His initial state was the clear blank paper without any philosophical sentences on it. The goal state was just in front of his mind's eye: Him – grinning broadly – handing in the essay with some carefully developed arguments.
 

He decides to use the technique of Means-End Analysis and creates several subgoals:

:1. Read important passages again
:2. Summarise parts of the text
:3. Develop an argumentative structure
:4. Write the essay
:5. Look for typos

Right after he hands in his essay Knut will go on reading this WikiBook.
He now looks forward to turning the page over and to discovering the [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions|next chapter...]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Electromagnetic Waves ==

The electromagnetic spectrum is a family of waves that share the following properties:

* They are able to transmit through a vacuum. &lt;Br&gt;
* They all travel at the same speed in a vacuum (3×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;Br&gt;
* They are all transverse waves consisting of magnetic and electric fields oscillating at right angles to each other. &lt;Br&gt;
* They all transfer energy as photons (the higher the frequency  of a particular radiation the greater the energy contained in each photon. &lt;Br&gt;
* They can all be reflected, refracted, diffracted and create interference patterns. &lt;Br&gt;
* Properties of these waves change with their frequency / wavelength so they are divided into seven sub groups which are radio wave, microwaves, infra red waves, visible light, ultraviolet, x rays and gamma rays. &lt;Br&gt;


'''Radio Waves'''

Radio waves are used mainly in communication over short or long distances.  Shorter wavelengths are used for television and FM radio while longer wavelengths are used for AM radio. &lt;Br&gt;

Long Wave Wavelength = 1*10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;m &lt;Br&gt;
Medium Wave Wavelength = 1*10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;m &lt;Br&gt;
Short Wave Wavelength = 1*10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;m &lt;Br&gt;

'''Microwaves'''

Some microwaves pass easily through Earths atmosphere and are used for communications with satellites and or mobile phones. &lt;P&gt;

Microwaves are also commonly used for cooking with the aid of a microwave oven. &lt;P&gt;

Typical Values are as follows:&lt;Br&gt;
Wavelength (m) = 3*10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;Br&gt;
Frequency (Hz) = 1*10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;Br&gt; &lt;Br&gt;

'''Definitions''' &lt;Br&gt; 

&lt;B&gt;Transverse Wave&lt;/B&gt; &lt;Br&gt;
The direction of energy transfer is at 90 degrees to the direction of the vibrating particles. &lt;Br&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Longitudinal Wave&lt;/B&gt; &lt;Br&gt;
The particles vibrate backwards and forwards  along the line of the direction of the energy transfer in the wave. &lt;Br&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Amplitude&lt;/B&gt; &lt;Br&gt;
The greatest displacement of the wave. &lt;Br&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Period (T)&lt;/B&gt; &lt;Br&gt;
Is the time taken (in seconds) for one complete cycle of the wave. &lt;Br&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Frequency (f)&lt;/B&gt; &lt;Br&gt;
The number of cycles of the wave per second. &lt;Br&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Wavelength (λ) &lt;/B&gt; &lt;Br&gt;
The shortest distance between 2 particles on the wave with the same phase. &lt;Br&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Speed of wave&lt;/B&gt; &lt;Br&gt;
Distance travelled by the wave in one time period. (λ/T)&lt;Br&gt;

'''Curry &amp; Honey Chicken''' - This dish was an idea I got out of nowhere, and turned out to be an unbelievable delicacy. Due to the experimental birth of this recipe, the measures given are very vague and approximate and can be altered freely. The almonds can be omitted and if you make your rice a little more interesting (I tried flavouring it with Mexican-ish tomato soup, tasted great), then you can leave out the vegetable mix altogether.

==Ingredients==
* 4 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts
* 1 handful of [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Curry Powder|curry powder]]
* 3 tablespoons of [[cookbook:honey|honey]] ([[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]] has even better results, if you can get it)
* 1/2 or 1 cup (120ml or 240ml) [[cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]] or [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* vegetable mix - I recommend 1 [[cookbook:onion|onion]] (can be substituted with [[cookbook:leek|leek]]), 1 [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|red pepper]], 2-4 [[cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es, 1-3 [[cookbook:celery|celery]] greens (if you add more, they can dominate the mix - interesting for a change), 1 [[cookbook:zucchini|zucchini]] or [[cookbook:eggplant|eggplant]], and you can add a lot more.
* For special occasions, cherry tomatoes will make the meal very interesting (due to the contrast between the sweet chicken, bitter celery and sour tomatoes).
* What also makes the meal a lot better is adding cubes of [[cookbook:mango|mango]] to the meat just before it's done (and frying them a bit - you need to put salt on them, and don't hesitate, it tastes great when it's stronger). [[Cookbook:Kiwifruit|Kiwifruit]] works too, but not as well. Any sour-ish hard [[cookbook:fruit|fruit]] should do the trick. [[cookbook:banana|Banana]] is good too, but doesn't offer the same contrast.
* [[cookbook:Rice|rice]]

==Preparation==
#[[cookbook:Marinating|Marinate]] chicken at least 6 hours before preparing the meal. 24 hours is best. Marinate in honey (or maple syrup), curry, oil, salt (1 heaping teaspoon per kilogram of chicken works very well). Adding parsley, celery leaves or something similar adds a fine taste.
#Peel almonds ([[cookbook:boil|boil]] in small amount of water for a minute or two, let cool, squeeze out of peeling)

==Procedure==
#Chop onion/leek finely and fry lightly on a large [[cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] with a bit of oil.
#Add vegetables, roughly in the order you find logical (i.e., tomatoes don't take long, zucchini (courgette) can be in the pan from the start of cooking)
#Add salt, about 1/2 teaspoon, add more if the taste doesn't seem right. The salt will extract water from the vegetables and make them 'stew' faster. You can cover the pan if it goes slowly - once again, this slows the evaporation and allows the vegetables to cook in the water they lose.
#Dump the vegetables into a bowl or a small pot to keep them warm and use the remaining oil to fry the cherry tomatoes, if you have those - once done, keep them separate from the other vegetables.
#Fry almonds gently on the pan.
#Add chicken meat, fry on high temperature quickly - when it looks done, cut the largest piece open to see if it is done inside as well. The pieces should be lightly browned. Don't worry, this is the sugar in the honey turning to caramel.
#Serve: Keep rice / vegetables / meat separate on plate, add cherry tomatoes in the center, about 2-4 a dish.

== Proposed move ==

This book only consists of one page.  Thus, I propose moving it to [[Card Games/Hearts]], in line with the other games detailed in that book.  That is, unless this topic is expected to be significantly expanded. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:15, 8 January 2011 (UTC)
:Hi, actually I was intending to split the sections up into sub-pages and expand the strategy section over the next few days. I'm not sure what's the custom regarding grouping card games (?), but it seems more logical to me to have it separate (but I'm not well-acquainted with Wikibooks policies). [[User talk:Tempodivalse#top|'''''Tempodivalse''''']] 03:21, 8 January 2011 (UTC)

::No policy on it.  Theoretically all the subpages of [[Card Games]] could be separate books if they were each expanded enough. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 04:40, 8 January 2011 (UTC)

The readiness or preparedness to give an explanation or justification to relevant others (stakeholders) for one's judgments, intentions, acts and omissions when appropriately called upon to do so.
#'''Altruism.''' The satisfaction that comes from knowing that your responsibilities and work have a beneficial affect on others.
#'''Ambivert.''' One who is not strongly inclined towards the characteristics of an extrovert or introvert.  Rather, an ambivert tends to transition between the two personality types depending on the setting at hand.

Sometimes conformity is distinguished by type: compliance, conforming only publicly, but keeping one's own views in private; identification, conforming while a group member, publicly and privately, but not after leaving the group; and internalization, conforming publicly and privately, during and after group membership. Sociologists believe that compliance is conformity that is usually a result of a direct order while internalization is conformity that comes from one's total and utter belief in one's act.
#'''Consensus with qualification.''' When every member of a team discuss a problem or idea and after certain time can't have an agreedment and the final decision is make by a CEO involved.
#'''Constructive Feedback.''' Communication which alerts an individual to an area in which his/her performance could improve. Constructive feedback is not criticism; it is descriptive and should always be directed to the action, not the person.
#'''Core Competency.''' This is working knowledge. It is comprised of our experience to do the job and having the essential problem-solving skills needed to overcome obstacles.
#'''Counterattack.''' When we feel that we need to be defensive and fight about something that we believe is important to us.
#'''Convergent thinking.''' Thought process often adopted by groups in which the group brings together similar information focused on finding a single best answer to bring closure to and resulting in feelings of security about a question, discussion or project. Convergent thinking is characterized by the need or intent to find one solution or answer to a problem. In other words, the group &quot;converges&quot; on an answer.
#'''Cross Functional Team.''' A cross-functional team consists of a group of people working toward a common goal and made of people with different functional expertise. It could include people from finance, marketing, operations, and human resources departments. Typically it also includes employees from all levels of an organization. Members may also come from outside an organization (in particular, from suppliers, key customers, or consultants).
#'''Cross-functional teams.''' It is the team that has the mission to work on specific problem, issue or task with the goal of improve production.
#'''Culture.''' Culture refers to the standards of social interaction, values, and beliefs from a given group of people.  Cultural issues can affect team interactions through different understandings of communication, family, and can appear to be an excuse for preferential treatment.
#'''Divergent thinking.''' Divergent thinking is characterized by the production of as many ideas as possible, avoiding repetition or convergence.
#'''Diversity.''' Team Diversity is the uniqueness of each individual on a team. This should not only include the usual diverse selections such as religion, sex, age, and race, but also additional unique personality characteristics such as introverts and extroverts, liberals and conservatives, etc.
#'''Dud-Person{{ref|any_name02}}:''' A person on the team who does not have the skills they claimed to have to get on the team, or that their manager thought they had when they were assigned to the team.

#[[w:Extrovert|Extrovert.]] Extroverts tend to be energetic, enthusiastic, action-oriented, talkative, assertive, gregarious and unreserved. Therefore, an extroverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone. While extraversion is associated with high levels of warmth, and also with enjoyment of thrills and strong sensations, it is common also for people to have divergent levels of extraversion at this micro or &quot;facet&quot; level of the trait - for instance, preferring moderate group-sizes, but relishing excitement. They view team meetings as productive and energizing. A venue for essential thought provoking discussions and a place to surcease any problems that may arise.
#'''Facilitator.''' A person whose job it is to make sure that meetings run well and achieve the goal they are seeking.
#'''Feedback.'''  Communication to a person or a team of people regarding the effect their behavior is having on another person, the organization, the customer, or the team.

#'''Group Potency.''' The spiritual energy of a team. Often referred to the team’s ability to believe in themselves.
#'''Group success.''' Success in groups is hard to define. The most obvious and commonly used measure of success is performance in the task (e.g., productivity). In addition, however, others (notably Hackman, 1986) have suggested the need to incorporate additional dimensions. Hackman suggests two dimensions that must be accounted for, the ability of group members to work together again (viability) and the growth of individuals participating in the team (learning). The ability of group members to work together again attempts to show that, even if a group performs its task well, it is not successful if the relationships between members are destroyed. Similarly, unless the individual growth objectives of group members are met through their participation in a group, the group cannot be considered a complete success. Although this expansion of notions of group success is valuable, the research literature on groups does not have a uniform or universal understanding of what constitutes group success.
#'''Groupthink.''' Process where members of a group start thinking alike and there are less individual ideas and creativity.
#'''Guided Experience.'''  Process by which agencies can tap into the knowledge of their employees by using a coach to expedite the process and create a database of shared insights and knowledge.
#'''Halo Effect.''' The halo effect is our tendency to assume that if one is excellent in some dimensions that will be excel in others even though they are not related in nature.
#'''Heterogeneous Group.'''  The people who join this kind of group usually have differente knowdlege, education, values, etc.  This group usually are very competitive.
#'''Homogeneous Group.'''   The people who join this group have similar experience, feelings, values, etc.  This group usually are very supportive.
#'''Homosocial reproduction.''' The tendency of workplaces to promote according to social identification and individuals moving in the &quot;right&quot; social circles.  For example, in a male-oriented workplace, corporate executives and managers may provide greater weight to the activities and interests of other men, thereby favoring them (sometimes unconsciously), giving them greater opportunity and greater access to promotions.
#'''Infrastructure.''' The underlying base or foundation for the group or team.  This could take the form of the various roles within the team/group or the policies and procedures that exist for the team.
#'''Integration.''' The combining efforts of various departments, personnel, and social classes to promote diversity, collaboration and education in a safe and productive environment with the purpose of achieving a higher understanding and knowledge of any particular problem or solution.
#'''Introvert.''' One who's thoughts and interests are directed inwardly rather than outwardly toward others.  In groups and teams introverts may be inclined to take a back seat role rather than assert their opinions or views to the other group members.
#'''Interface.''' A point where certain groups or teams can interact. This could be in the form of a certain person that acts as a liaison for multiple groups, or it could be a medium, such as teleconference or some other technology.
#[[w:Ingroup|In-group.]] (from Wikipedia) In sociology, an ingroup is a social group towards which an individual feels loyalty and respect, usually due to membership in the group. This loyalty often manifests itself as an ingroup bias. Commonly encountered ingroups include family members, people of the same race or religion, and so on.

Members of outgroups may be subject to outgroup homogeneity biases, and generally people tend to privilege ingroup members over outgroup members in many situations.
#'''Passive Conspiracy.'''A way of avoiding confrontation by dysfunction. It is an evolved group norm and results in an agreement to accept the condition rather than deal with it openly.
#'''Peacekeeper.''' Person who avoids conflict at all cost, to the point of detrimental behavior.
#'''Peacemaker.''' Recognize conflict; attempt to resolve rather than avoid.
#'''Personal agendas.''' A dysfunctional group dynamic that undermines the group objectives.

Self-serving bias also results in a statistical bias resulting from people thinking that they perform better than average in areas important to their self esteem.3
#'''Social biases.''' Social biases are “shortcuts” that we, as individuals, use to make sense of the world. As people, we make systematic mistakes in the way we see the world. Social Psychology and other disciplines have worked to identify those biases and to understand how they can affect our behavior in social situations. Social biases are always related to the way in which we see and/or understand other people and their actions. They are broad, involving everything from how we form and use first impressions of others, to how we construct histories and motivations for the actions of others.
#'''Social Loafing.'''The tendency of individual group members to reduce their work effort as groups increase in size as displayed by the inclination to &quot;goof off&quot; when performance is needed in a group, miss meetings, show up late, or fail to start or complete individual tasks.
#'''Social processes.''' A social process is present in any situation where an individual is relating him- or herself to others.

#[[w:Stereotype|Stereotype]] (from Wikipedia). We build stereotypes to simplify the world by putting people into categories, and then fitting individuals into the stereotype of that category.  For example, if doctors are all X, and you are a doctor, then you must also be X.  Stereotypes are beliefs that all members of specific groups share similar traits and are likely to behave in the same way.  In most cases, the characteristics described by a stereotype tend to be negative (e.g., all engineers are eggheads who can’t relate to people), although occasionally stereotypes involve positive attributes (e.g., accountants are very careful and precise).  The problem is that individuals never conform to an exact stereotype, given that individual differences outweigh similarities with others in a group.
#'''Strategy.''' A plan of action resulting from strategy or intended to accomplish a specific goal. The art or skill of using stratagems in endeavors such as politics and business.
#'''Superordinate Goal.''' Goal for the team, that takes precedence over each team member’s individual goal.
#'''Supportive.''' Used specially in teams. Be a good member of the team, help each other and always looking for ways to help other members of the team to succeed.
#'''Synergy.'''
#'''Tangled.''' When a situation, problem or issue is confusing or complicated.
#'''Team Contract.''' A team document that clearly and specifically outlines the expectations for  performance, productivity, quality and quantity of work, and efficiency for each team member.
#[[w:Team|Team]] (from Wikipedia)
#'''teamwork''' When two or more people get together to achieve a specific goal. The succeed of the team is responsibility of all members.
#'''Veteran.''' A veteran in a group is an individual who has longer tenure within the group, who has a history with other members in the group context. 	
#[[w:Virtual team|Virtual Team]] (from Wikipedia). A Virtual Team is a group of individuals who work across time, space, and organizational boundaries with links strengthened by webs of communication technology. Like other teams, they have complementary skills and are committed to a common purpose, have interdependent performance goals, and share an approach to work for which they hold themselves mutually accountable. Geographically dispersed teams allow organizations to hire and retain the best people regardless of location.

Please read the '''[[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]'''. As you started a new book, subpages-chapters should use a slash, like [[My very own Calculus textbook/Differentiation|My very own Calculus textbook&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;'''/'''&lt;/span&gt;Differentiation]]. I moved the Differentiation chapter; if you start more chapters please use a slash. Thanks for contributing to Wikibooks, --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:11, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Elementary Calculus]] ==

Hi, Mmmooonnnsssttteeerrr. I'm curious as to why you have decided to start up another Calculus textbook when everything in this book seems to be already being covered in [[Calculus]]. If two books cover the same subject and target the same audience, they should be merged. By the way, you should generally only sign talk page comments, not book pages. Best of luck on your projects! Thanks in advance, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 09:22, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

Hi, Hagindaz. I started Elementary Calculus because it will only deal with contents up to calculus with one variable. Multivariable calculus may similarly be dealt with in separate book, in my opinion.--[[User:Mmmooonnnsssttteeerrr|Mmmooonnnsssttteeerrr]] 09:26, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

: But isn't this book reproducing the first five chapters of [[Calculus]]? I don't want your time and energy to be wasted redoing content we already have. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 09:35, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
:: OK. I will work on it for a while then somebody can merge information that are not in Calculus book from this one. --[[User:Mmmooonnnsssttteeerrr|Mmmooonnnsssttteeerrr]] 09:38, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">DWT is a port of the Eclipse/SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit) GUI library from Java to D.

You can write the code similar to SWT. For example:

 import dwt.all;
 
 void main(char[][] args)
 {
     Display display = new Display();
     Shell shell = new Shell(display);
     Label label = new Label(shell, DWT.NONE);
     label.setText(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
     label.pack();
     shell.pack();
     shell.open();
     while (!shell.isDisposed())
     {
         if (!display.readAndDispatch())
             display.sleep();
     }
     display.dispose();
 }

Hi, if you'd like to help out with this manual, great!  Why not sign the talk page and let us know which chapters you will be contributing too.  If you think the sections need changing or new chapters should be added, discuss them here.  Looking forward to a great collaboration!

== Splitting content ==

The main page [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A_Beginner%27s_Guide_to_Rock_Climbing&amp;oldid=1481811 currently] splits non-bouldering up between sport- and trad climbing. As this book is aimed at beginners, I suggest that it be better to split it up between top-roping and lead-climbing as the former is useful to be covered on it's own. Leading might be best covered in a more advanced text, and/or seperatly as sport-leading and trad-leading. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:55, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Cookbook help page}}

The '''seasonality''' of an ingredient refers to the period in which the ingredient is available or is at its best. Some ingredients, such as [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], are only available several months of the year whereas others, such as [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbages]] or [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]] are available fresh all year long.

These days, there are many ways to get ingredients out of season. Some ingredients, like [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]], will simply keep for a very long time, without much extra effort. Others, such as [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]], can be frozen directly after harvest to make them available all year round. Other options include growing vegetables and fruit in greenhouses to simulate seasonal conditions or flying produce in from parts of the world where the seasons are reversed (ie. the season for asparagus on the southern hemisphere is six months later than on the northern hemisphere).

== Seasonal Eating ==

Because of the measures that are taken to increase availability of ingredients out of season, buying ingredients according to their season has some advantages:

;Flavour: Fresh in-season ingredients are generally considered to taste better than those that are stored, frozen or grown out of season.
;Nutrition: Research has shown that most produce has a higher nutritional value in-season
;Price: In-season ingredients grown locally will usually be cheaper than those flown in from other parts of the world or grown in greenhouses.
;Environmental concerns: Some methods of producing ingredients out of season, such as flying it in from another hemisphere, or artificial heating of greenhouses can take their toll on the environment.

==Seasonality Tables== 

The following tables show the seasonality per ingredient for each month.

As the seasonality of ingredients depends greatly on the climate in which they're produced, these tables are intended to be used as a loose guideline. Depending on the location, the season may be longer or shorter. 

When buying ingredients, check the country of origin if possible. Locally produced vegetables that are far out of season are likely to have been grown in greenhouses.

===Vegetables===

&lt;!-- NOTE: to add information to this table, use the str template.
It's first and second arguments are the ingredient name and the wikipage to link to.
The last twelve are seasonality grades per month (1=not in season, 2=not at it's best, 3=in season)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Jurgen Habermas==

[[File:JuergenHabermas.jpg|thumbnail|left|Jurgen Habermas at a discussion in Munich, 2007]]

Jurgen Habermas is a philosopher, social scientist, and communication theorist whose ideas have shaped the way contemporary society thinks about citizenship and government. Habermas was born in Dusseldorf, Germany in 1929. He lived through the Second World War and witnesses firsthand the nazi-ization of his homeland, and when he was 15 he joined the Hitler Youth. His country was taken over by a manipulative government, that influenced many, including Habermas’s father who was a Nazi sympathizer. After the war, as many of his contemporaries did, Habermas devoted his thoughts to preventing the mass manipulation the happened in WWII &lt;ref&gt;Foss, S. K., Foss, K. A., &amp; Trapp, R. (2002). Contemporary perspectives on rhetoric / Sonja K.  Foss, Karen A. Foss, Robert Trapp. Prospect Heights, Ill. : Waveland Press, c2002.  &lt;/ref&gt;. He postulated what led people to accept the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. From his German background, Habermas created his political theories. 

Habermasian theory of the public sphere was born directly out of enlightenment ideas that were present in the 17th century and in the American and French revolution &lt;ref&gt;Kellner, D. (2000). Habermas, the public sphere, and democracy: a critical intervention.  Perspectives On Habermas, 259-87.  &lt;/ref&gt;. The ideals of the enlightenment perpetuated by the great 17th century philosophers like Rousseau excited Habermas. The ideal that reason was the ultimate goal of citizens extended past its 17th century roots, and forever colored the political, social, and communicative ideals of Habermas. Drawing upon his love for enlightenment ideals, he articulated the idea of the contemporary public sphere, and is responsible for our modern understanding of the public sphere. Habermas argues that the public sphere is what allowed the thinkers and people of the enlightenment period to question and change the role of government. Because of the strong public sphere, enlightenment ideas were constructed, promoted, and implemented. 

When considering the work of Habermas, it is important to keep in mind not only the politics of the past that shaped his work, but also the contemporary circumstances under which he published his book The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere. He published the book in the 20th century as state and monopoly capitalism began to emerge. These forms of government began to overshadow the liberal capitalist government of the 19th century. The Frankfurt School, where Habermas was employed, supported the idea of state and monopoly capitalism &lt;ref&gt;Kellner, D. (2000). Habermas, the public sphere, and democracy: a critical intervention.  Perspectives On Habermas, 259-87.  &lt;/ref&gt;. Thus Habermas’s views were developed in line with this notion. Habermas believed that a pure public sphere could only exist in a Marxist society &lt;ref&gt;Wang, J. (2010). The notion of Habermas’ ‘public sphere’ and its relevance to interrogations of  women’s empowerment and leadership in Muslim contexts. Geografia : Malaysian  Journal Of Society And Space, (1), 13. &lt;/ref&gt;. Habermas was living in a society that was withered, broken and still coping with the consequences of WWII. One of the products of the war was the sentiment that authoritative governments were better apt to govern nations &lt;ref&gt;Kellner, D. (2000). Habermas, the public sphere, and democracy: a critical intervention.  Perspectives On Habermas, 259-87.  &lt;/ref&gt;. While Habermas argues that the public sphere is best suited for a Marxist society incapable of flourishing in a liberal capitalist democracy, the public sphere can and does embolden democracy. It is the link that allows capitalism and democracy to function properly in tandem. 

=== What is the Public Sphere?===

The public sphere is not a tangible location, but a space that exists in discourse. For Habermas the public sphere in its best and most pure form existed in the 1700’s with the advent of the enlightenment. Habermas labeled this public sphere the “bourgeois public sphere”. This space of discourse existed at the crossroads of private, family life and the government. Habermas believed the public sphere of the 1700’s to be the ideal of political participation. In his words it is a, “network for communicating information and points of view . . . the streams of communication are, in the process, filtered and synthesized in such a way that they coalesce into bundles of topically specified public opinions”&lt;ref&gt;WorldBank.(nd). The public sphere. Communication for Governance &amp; Accountablity Program.  Retrieved from:  http://sitereources.worldbank.org/EXTGOVACC/Resources/PubSphereweb.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. The public sphere is where citizen discuss what they want their government to be, and therefore where public opinion is created. 

Habermas believed Marxism provides the best conditions for citizens to participate in the public sphere. He believed that capitalism could not support a public sphere. He identifies problems with Marxism and its capacity to enable its citizens to communicate in the realm between the social and the political, but finds it to be a better alternative to capitalism. In his opinion, capitalism is too controlled by big business and big government. In a capitalist society big business and government take over the public sphere, rendering the people voiceless in their democracy. Marxism is dominated by the idea the each citizen is equal, and there is no big business to steal the voice of the people. 

Habermas argues that in a liberal capitalistic society these huge entities control public opinion. His concerns are legitimate, in the United States there are many large and powerful entities that attempt to control public opinion and manipulate the masses. However, Habermas underestimated that power of citizens to reason. Because citizens have to capacity, and exercise that capacity, to reason the public sphere fits perfectly in a capitalist democracy. The public sphere is what mediates between capitalism and democracy. It polices between the two entities and thus produces democracy and capitalism that benefits citizens. Each would suffer without the public sphere, especially the democracy. Without the public sphere in a capitalist society democracy would die. They are three inseparable entities the public sphere, capitalism, and democracy. 

The public sphere is a place of debate, a forum where the public can grapple with ideals concerning the role of government, the actions of government, people's responsibility in the government, and to evaluate the performance of governmental leaders. It is where debate creates public opinion. Where after deep thought and discussion, reasonable ideals rise to the top and will be implemented by the government, as dictated by the governed. It is supposed to function as a check on the government.

===The Public Sphere In the United States: A Liberal Capitalist Democracy===

As it applies to the United States, the public sphere can be considered the fourth branch of government. It is the branch that is meant to regulate and insure that the government is acting in accordance to the reasonable thoughts of the people. In the public sphere only rational reasoned discourse has a place. When the discourse become manipulated by fear, money, or authorities, the public sphere is tainted, and cannot function &lt;ref&gt;Gore, A. (2007). The assault on reason / Al Gore. New York : Penguin Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;. People, individuals acting and thinking out of their own free will, can create and maintain a democracy. A democracy cannot exist without a public sphere.

Habermas argues that citizens of a liberal capitalist democracy are merely spectators not players in the game of politics. Habermas sees this a degradation of the public sphere, and uses this to evidence the inadequacies of a liberal capitalistic democracy. Reason is what Habermas underestimates: people will remain reasonable.  With the birth of new technologies, like the Internet, the ability of the public sphere has grown to be larger than Habermas could have predicted. These new technology will increase the freedom that people have to express their opinion. 

Wikipedia is an example of a technology that helps to maintain the public sphere. It does not accept solicits from advertisers and does not take government funding. It is information written by the people for the people and edited by the people. Also the easy access to blogging has empowered the average person to become a journalist. Technology emboldens the public sphere. With increased access to the Internet participation in the public sphere is easier for larger groups of people. 

Democracy provides the freedom and platform that is essential to the public sphere. Democracies are defined by their commitment to equality. Thus those that did not have a voice in the “perfect” public sphere of the enlightenment have a voice in democratic societies. In the enlightenment women, the working class, and the poor did not have a voice. However, today in the liberal capitalist democracy that is the United States, technologies enable everyone to participate in the public discussion.

==The Evolution of the Public Sphere in Europe==
With the rise of mercantilism and the emergence of a new bourgeois merchant class, there was a redefined relationship between those who ruled and those who were being ruled.  These changes contributed to the transition from a feudal system into a state.  As a result, the public sphere began to emerge in society; it acted as the connecting link between the intimate sphere of the family and the authority of the state.

In the beginning, the feudal system was a system that placed great emphasis on royal power. The king not only represented the public, but he was the public. Under his sovereign control, there were no negotiations or any form of public discussions. The ruling aristocracy also blurred with the idea of divine authority, and therefore public religion influenced private life.  

However, this began to change when a new economic system was introduced: mercantilism.  This new economic system gave rise to small and specialized trade which promoted a group of people called merchants.  Forming trades and new businesses, the merchants became less dependent on the feudal lord and the aristocrats.  Eventually, the new economic system supported a new class called the bourgeois, or merchant/middle class.  The bourgeois created a new space for economic discussions, which was the basis of the public sphere.  At these discussions, the bourgeois could publicly voice and protect their rights and interests.

==The Stages of the Public Sphere==
In the process of developing the public sphere, there are three stages:  the mercantile stage, the administrative stage, and the public stage.  The mercantile stage deals with more internal and specific information.  It is a narrow and exclusive public sphere that is limited to only a few elites.  Its technical nature emphasizes analysis before action.  As for the administrative stage, it is still conducted in the private realm, and its goal is to seek protections for its members from the public authority.  Compared to the mercantile stage, it is more inclusive and less narrow.  It has a practical purpose and encourages social interactions.  However, the public stage is the most inclusive and broad public sphere.  It provides both general and specific information to all people.  This stage recognizes societal problems and uses the public sphere as a source of connection, information, opinion, and decision for all people.  This is the most ideal public sphere because it is open to discourse among all people.

==Private vs. Public spheres==
As Craig Calhoun has emphasized, the public sphere is greatly dependent upon the quality of discourse and the quantity of participation. Unlike the private sphere, the public sphere consists of a wide range of participants within a society that can engage in critical and rational discourse. It is a platform for societal integration; it sets oppositions and issues between the state and society. Also, the public sphere does not have the tendency to be uniform and promote only one particular interest or idea like the private sphere. Instead, the public sphere is open to all opinions and interest groups. It is not static and is, therefore, often accepting of changes. Hence, the differences and the inequalities within a society become the basis for discussion and action. This open communication among people is the initial stage of a public sphere.  

The press, in print and other mediums like electronic sources, developed in three stages:

# The first stage consists primarily of a small group of people. Mostly, the merchants and big traders had a voice. The elite are really the only ones who participate in the public domain.
# The second stage becomes more political. The press is trying to educate/unite the public on policy, etc. The press is more of a puppet of the public leaders and is used to inform the public of laws and policies that the pubic is to support and follow.
# The third stage is where the open and genuine public sphere emerges. The press must serve the society that is in a state of discourse and debate. This is the stage where the public is finally allowed to communicate its worries and opinions to the state authority, using the press as the means to give voice to their ideas.

==The Evolution of Print Media==

The political functions of the emerging public sphere first started in Europe as a reaction to the ruling aristocracy, which attempted to squelch public opinion. Europe definitely had a hierarchy as the idea of press and public sphere begins to develop. In literature, art, and culture, politics were generally avoided. The intellectual, the educated, and the literate formed the foundation of the public sphere.   

The US had no ruling aristocracy—a system obviously rejected by the Declaration of Independence and the Revolution.  There was no belief in divine authority and religion was and is considered a private matter.  There emerged a foundation for the public sphere with farmer, doctor, scholar, and laborer being the basis.  There was little attention to class. 

However, in both Europe and the US, you could only participate if you were a free laborer.  This would exclude women, slaves, and indentured servants.

The United States developed its public sphere quite differently than Europe did, at least according to philosopher and author of ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' Jürgen Habermas. No ruling aristocracy existed in the United States. We decided to make a democracy. In order to establish that democracy, many voices were needed to speak and run the nation.  So we had the Founding Fathers who debated with each other over the best path. In England as previously mentioned, only the ruling class spoke.  
	
World religions have many times founded the governments of countries. The United States first non-native inhabitants were Protestant. Protestants do not have a religious hierarchy. Most of the other Christian religions do have hierarchies—the Pope, Bishop, Cardinal. The Protestants founded the United States and therefore did not have a hierarchy system.  
	
The United States also had a different motto than Europe.  We were founded by the people for the people. The US was not created to protect anyone or make money; it was founded to be a haven for people, where they could be free. For people to enjoy this freedom, the citizens had to talk. What did they want out of their freedom? What types of laws should everyone follow? The Founding Fathers wanted to make sure that no one felt belittled or silenced.  
	
This goal of universal happiness needed the average citizen’s opinions in order to work. The average citizen spoke up and said what they felt. They talked amongst each other and developed a government that would allow for the free expression of opinion.  
	
People also needed to talk more because they needed to establish systems in the US. Here, unlike England, no roads yet existed. No towns or methods of transportation were in place. The environment was completely wild. So people had to discuss how to promote transportation and trade and how to develop the land. People needed to communicate effectively to be able to survive.  
	
In the US you didn’t have to be educated to participate in discussion. Illiterate people could be a part of the public sphere. The only people who could not participate in the public sphere were women, blacks, and indentured servants. That did not really change until the mid 1900’s.  
	
From the beginning of the US until the mid 1900’s, the focus of public discussion was on the survival system, transportation, politics, trade, war. During the fifties and sixties, discussion focused on letting everyone into the public sphere. The civil rights movement and women’s liberation occurred. Also Vietnam happened. But after these tumultuous decades, things settled down a bit. People began to become more focused on entertainment. These days, people discuss their favorite TV shows and celebrities with each other.
	
Another view of the development of the US public sphere comes from Burton Bledstein. He wrote a book called ''The Culture of Professionalism''. In this book, Bledstein discusses America's &quot;professional&quot; culture. The US culture developed “rigid barriers” that did not exist in Europe.  
	
In America, your future was not planned out. People that were peasants in Europe could be business tycoons in the US. That meant that young men could determine what they wanted to do in life. It gave them choices. The US began to develop universities to train people to be successful. The universities taught students the discipline to achieve their goals. However, Bernstein notes that this also led to a decrease in the degree of creativity people had. Universities led to people trusting an authority and lowering their own notions of themselves. Students are taught that they are not correct. The teacher is correct. Because of this, America developed at a quick pace. People began to work for a majority of the day so that they could accomplish more. Life in America moved at a very fast pace. But people were also reaping the benefits. Some were striking it rich. And that became the American Dream. Every worker in America strives to achieve the American Dream. Wealth became the ultimate goal of the Victorians. The middle class soon came to dominate American culture.  
	
The pace that America set for itself led to psychological issues. People began to be nervous and frustrated. They would get tired and violent. By trying so diligently to be free, people realized their own limitations. They began to find that they could not accomplish everything. This was especially true for women. They were confined to being housewives and caring for the children.  
	
Victorians also developed the difference between public and private places. They developed what should be considered private and what could occur in public spaces. Before this time, private was a negative word. Now it is mainstream. Locks and alarms became normal, as did personal space.
	
Victorians not only divided up private and personal space, they categorized almost everything and everyone. Every space came to have a purpose—a breakfast nook, a dining room, a dressing room. People also began to associate certain meals with certain times of the day. People in America began to only eat cereal, eggs, and other “breakfast” foods at breakfast time. Before, there was no distinction between foods. You could eat mashed potatoes any time of the day. Breakfast also began to be associated with being clean and getting a fresh start to the day.  
	
In Victorian society, everyone had to follow these new rules of culture to be considered “in.” As a result of the desire to fit in, magazines and other cultural instruction manuals began to be published. These taught the reader how to fit in just as today’s magazines do.  
	
Another cultural aspect that began to appear was the use of space to determine power. The more space you took up, the more power you had. Houses began to sprawl bigger and bigger. Railroad cars were built so that people had more personal space, if they could afford to pay for it. At this time, the rich, poor, and middle class became separated. 

=Gore's Take on the Public Sphere=


[[File:Al gore nobel.jpg|thumbnail|left|Al Gore winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007]]

Former Vice President Al Gore believes that American society has undergone a “dramatic and fundamental change in the way we communicate.”&lt;ref&gt; Gore, Albert. The Assault on Reason. New York: Penguin, 2007. 15&lt;/ref&gt; He is referring to the way that Americans have adopted television culture, with the average American watching 2.8 hours of broadcast television every day, according to the most recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Gore, the shift among the general population from reading printed texts to watching television has been a main factor in the decline of the public sphere, which he refers to with his own term, the “marketplace of ideas.”&lt;ref&gt;Gore, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gore claimed that the three most important characteristics of the “marketplace of ideas” are that: 

&lt;big&gt;•&lt;/big&gt;	It is open for everyone to participate, with the only barrier to entry being literacy.

&lt;big&gt;•&lt;/big&gt;	Individual contributions are judged based on whatever merit the marketplace recognizes.

&lt;big&gt;•&lt;/big&gt;	Finally, it is assumed that the participants see it as their duty to search for general agreement, the ultimate goal of democratic conversation. &lt;ref&gt;13&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Assault on Reason'', Gore explains that because television is a one-way medium, the average citizen in a TV society loses the ability to contribute meaningfully to the political conversation.&lt;ref&gt; 16&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, we sit in front of the television and absorb its messages, with very little opportunity to respond or make our voices heard in any meaningful or consistent way.  This is in contrast to American society of the past, when media centered on the printing press, newspapers, pamphlets and the like.  When the printed word and local and national newspapers were the way that citizens became informed, letters to the editor, and the ability to self publish made the printed word a powerful and two-way channel of communication.  Even television sources that used to be effective channels for information in the past have been debased.  In Gore’s book Dan Rather deplores the current condition of network news, describing it as “dumbed down and tarted up.”  When citizens are unable to participate, or don’t care to, and their voices are not being heard, there is no way for a alarm to be sounded when corruption is uncovered, when illogic rears its ugly head in the offices and high places of our government. 

Television fails to meet any of the qualifications that Gore set forth as essential ingredients for a “marketplace of ideas.”  While television does feature some small amount of user-generated content, the vast majority of programming is controlled by the wealthy few, and the costs associated with starting a network or broadcast service are so astronomically high that only a wealthy few have the funds to participate.  

News articles are often no longer judged by the utility of the information that they present to the American public.  Who wants to talk about the merits or demerits of a Congressional budget when you can find out what is going on with the Kardashian sisters, or a horrible scandal involving [fill in blank] having sex with [fill in blank].

The expansion of television channels with the advent of cable and satellite television means that individual networks are being forced to differentiate themselves in an effort to grab onto some fragment of growing population of television watchers.  This has resulted in an ideological split in broadcast journalism.  In the past, news journalists at least made the attempt to bring you both sides of a story.  Today, you have to consciously choose to watch media coverage from the liberal left and the conservative right to get an unclear understanding of both sides of increasingly complex issues.  We no longer seem bent on capturing that mythical beast, the “general agreement.”

Another point which Gore only lightly touches upon is the impact that having exponentially fewer avenues of information may have had in forming a more cohesive and responsive public sphere, in the days of yore before television.  When everyone on the east coast got their news from the New York Times, it became a common cultural experience, and water cooler conversations could start with the assumption that everyone involved had read the same paper.  This commonality of experience would allow more people to engage in meaningful debate about the issues of the day, as presented in the news, leading to an incredibly vigorous public discourse.  In a keynote speech Gore gave at the We Media Convention in 2005, he explains the value of a healthy “marketplace of ideas” to the democratic ideal:

:''“It is the destruction of that marketplace of ideas that accounts for the &quot;strangeness&quot; that now continually haunts our efforts to reason together about the choices we must make as a nation. Whether it is called a Public Forum, or a &quot;Public Sphere&quot; or a marketplace of ideas, the reality of open and free public discussion and debate was considered central to the operation of our democracy in America's earliest decades.”''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alternet.org/story/26494/al_gore%27s_code_red&lt;/ref&gt;


====The Virtual Public Sphere====
Gore feels quite optimistic about the power of the internet to reinvigorate the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Gore, Chapter Nine&lt;/ref&gt; While participating online and using all the features of Web 2.0 might add another barrier to entry in the future—that of techno-literacy as well as the linguistic ability to create a sophisticated argument—many aspects of our society already demand these abilities, so why shouldn’t our government join the bandwagon?

There have been many technological developments in the five years since Gore published his book. At the time that he published, Facebook was fairly new and MySpace was still a hot item.&lt;ref&gt;273.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since publishing this book, new forms of social media have evolved, such as the tweet by Twitter, and Youtube. Since 2005 Youtube has become a huge website now owned by Google that primarily hosts user-created content, and has been the second largest search engine on earth since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics&lt;/ref&gt;
Luckily for democracy, there are people out there producing a plethora of material for us as citizens to consume.  According to Youtube’s page of press statistics, over seventy two hours of content are being uploaded every minute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics &lt;/ref&gt;  Twitter users in 2012 are now sending 175 million tweets a day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/twitter-statistics-2012_b18914&lt;/ref&gt;  That is good news for those shy people who don’t like to publish their own opinions online, who don’t like to give out anything so personal as their close-held political views.  Someone else is already out there, making the material.  The real question is, what percentage of those tweets, those video uploads, the billions of text messages, blog posts, and Facebook status updates, contribute to the “marketplace of ideas?”  For every bit we can raise that most valuable of percentages, our society and government can regain vitality, and the power of the people which has lately been sadly diminished.  The trick is to find it, comment about it, anonymously if you must.  Start a conversation; respond to a question, correct someone who got his or her facts wrong.  Whether you are Internet savvy or not, it is not difficult to make your voice heard and your contributions felt.

Critics of the potential for the internet to create a thriving public sphere point to the &quot;lack of solid commitment&quot; as the number one drawback to real investment by online participants.&lt;ref&gt;Papacharissi, Zizi. &quot;The Virtual Public Sphere: The Internet as a Public Sphere.&quot; ''New Media and Society'' 4.9 (2002): 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, it is up to us as citizens of the United States to realize how valuable participation is to the democratic process.  Voting once every four years is enough to barely keep our democratic government alive.  To thrive, it needs us as citizens to care about our country.  Care enough to find out what the issues are.  Care enough to vote in local elections.  Care enough to contribute to the great democratic conversation that makes the United States what it is.  If you won’t write a letter to your congressman, at least let your opinion be known on the comment section of the article, video, or podcast where you came across this person with whom you either violently disagree, devotedly follow, or don’t know from Adam.  Don’t just be a consumer of user-generated content, be a producer.  Who knows, you may end up with a million views or a thousand followers, and your voice will no longer be a piccolo in the midst of an orchestra.  You can become a mighty organ of change in society, if only you let yourself out there.

==The Tea Party Movement==

===History===
[[File:Tea Party Protest, Hartford, Connecticut, 15 April 2009 - 032.jpg|thumb|Tea Party Protest: Hartford, Connecticut 15 April 2009]] 
Thanks to social media websites like Facebook and Twitter, since the late 1990s we have witnessed the emergence and development of a grassroots movement known as the Tea Party. &lt;ref name=&quot;teapartyplatform&quot;&gt;http://www.teaparty-platform.com/Tea_Party_Movement_P9MG.html&lt;/ref&gt; Advocating a conservative interpretation of the Constitution, reduced taxes, minimized government spending, and protection of individual liberties, the Tea Party aims to keep political leaders in check, demanding that the government be run “by the true owners of the United States: We the People.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teaparty.org/about.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for their anti-tax demonstrations, the Tea Party’s name is derived from the Boston Tea Party and is also an acronym for &quot;Taxed Enough Already.&quot; This populist movement first developed because of numerous Tax Day protests throughout the 90s; however, it wasn’t until 2009 that the Tea Party Movement began to implement widespread public protests. The first large scale protest occurred on January 24, 2009 in New York. Chairman of the Young Americans for Liberty, Trevor Leach, organized the Tea Party to protest the obesity tax proposed by New York Governor David Paterson. Protesters were also speaking out against various Federal laws, including health care reform. &lt;ref name=&quot;teapartyplatform&quot;/&gt;

Similarly, on February 16, 2009, Keli Carender—a blogger and Conservative activist—organized a “Porkulus Protest” in Seattle to protest President Obama’s stimulus bill. To gain support, Carender contacted a wide variety of people, including Fox News contributor Michelle Malkin who publicly supported the Porkulus Protest. Carender held a similar protest on February 27, 2009 which more the doubled the number of attendees compared to the first protest. &lt;ref name=&quot;teapartyplatform&quot;/&gt;

Gradually, the Tea Party Movement began to engage with the public sphere on a national scale. Broadcasting live from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on February 19, 2009, CNBC news editor Rick Santelli publicly criticized the governmental plan to  offer aid to homeowners allowing them to refinance their mortgages in order to avoid foreclosure. Santelli openly endorsed the need for a new tea party that would give Americans an outlet to voice their discontent with the government’s irresponsible fiscal ventures—his outburst was eventually uploaded onto the internet and went viral practically overnight. Websites like ChicagoTeaParty.com and reTeaParty.com were created to help organize numerous protests for July 4, 2009. Ultimately, Rick Santelli’s televised rant became the spark that ignited the Tea Party movement, bringing the grassroots organization to the forefront of the public sphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;teapartyplatform&quot;/&gt;

One of the largest Tea Party protests to date was the September 12, 2009 March on Washington. Organized by FreedomWorks—a group created by former Republican House Majority Speaker Dick Armey—those in attendance numbered in the tens of thousands. Gathered on the lawn of the Capitol building, the protesters spent the day waving flags and signs while chanting a strong opposition of health care reform and even stronger support for smaller government and lowered taxes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/us/politics/13protestweb.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because of demonstrations like this, the Tea Party Movement has forced the nation to take notice.

===Support===
Based on the April, 2010 CBS/Times National Survey of Tea Party Supporters, the 18 percent of Americans who identify as Tea Partiers are white, married, male Republicans over the age of 45.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSNYPoll&quot;&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html?_r=1&amp;src=me&amp;ref=general)&lt;/ref&gt; On average, Tea Party supporters are also wealthier and more educated than the general public.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSNYPoll&quot;/&gt;
Based on the poll, the typical supporter of the Tea Party Movement truly seems like the average American citizen. Most of the respondents send their children to public school, believe that the taxes from the previous year were “fair” and can see the worth in both Social Security and Medicare. &lt;ref name=&quot;CBSNYPoll&quot;/&gt;

Some famous supporters of the Tea Party Movement are Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain, and Michelle Bachmann. Two of the biggest political figures in the Tea Party Movement are Ron Paul—considered to be the “intellectual godfather” of the movement—and Sarah Palin, who is considered the cultural icon for the Tea Party. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/the-tea-party-8217-s-brain/8280/1/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Since their emergence, the Tea Party Movement has been accused of “astroturfing”—a term that refers to a self-proclaimed grassroots movement that is actually funded by either large corporations or a few prominent benefactors. Mostly, the accusers are claiming that one of the Tea Parties with the strongest backbone—Americans for Prosperity—has been manipulated by the deep pockets of a select few, making the so-called grass seem a little more like Astroturf.  

Most of the critics concede that the Tea Party Movement is not strictly Astroturf, but more of a blend between the real grassroots and the synthetic. Many of the supporters truly are average Americans who are fed up with the government’s big spending and disregard for the wants of the nation’s citizens. However, the influence of the billionaires Charles and David Koch, founders of the Americans for Prosperity group, have many questioning the validity of the title &quot;grassroots&quot; and calling foul. The situation worsened after Venable—a political operative for many of the Koch-funded political groups—revealed that the role of Americans for Prosperity is to educate Tea Partiers on policy details and provide the most effective plan-of-action.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker&quot;&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all&lt;/ref&gt; By giving Americans for Prosperity the funding to educate, support, and organize the Tea Party protestors, the Kochs are able to influence the group’s agenda while hiding behind the grassroots title to avoid any public backlash. 
And this is not the first time the Koch brothers have pulled off such a scheme.  In 1984, the Kochs helped to create Citizens for a Sound Economy, an organization that also claimed to be a grassroots movement but proved to be largely funded by the Kochs who provided $7.9 billion dollars between 1986 and 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker&quot;/&gt; Participants of this movement admitted that the Koch brothers were extremely controlling of all facets of the Citizens for a Sound Economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker&quot;/&gt; Considering their track record, those on the left feel that the Kochs are providing much more than money to the Americans for Prosperity organization, suggesting that the billionaires control all parts of the agenda—from the planning to the actual protests, some think the Kochs control it all.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/25/tea-party-koch-brothers&lt;/ref&gt; 

In actuality, the brothers have been funding the Americans for Prosperity group since its creation and they make sure that the money they donate is always working for them. David Koch was once quoted saying, “If we’re going to give a lot of money, we’ll make darn sure they spend it in a way that goes along with our intent. And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we don’t agree with, we withdraw funding.” &lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;/&gt;

And this has been the case in almost every venture the brothers have endorsed, making many on the left wonder just how much influence the “average American” actually has in the Tea Party Movement. Considering the Koch’s track record, many are beginning to feel that the brothers are providing much more than just money to the Americans for Prosperity organization, suggesting that the billionaires control all parts of the agenda—from the planning to the protests, some think the Kochs control it all. And this can be detrimental to the true grassroots elements of the Tea Party Movement. The big corporations are looking to advance their own agendas, their own tax cuts, and protecting themselves from the big government regulations. Once these corporations get what they want, the real Tea Partiers might get trampled and left behind by the big businesses. 

The problem with fake grassroots organizations is that they claim to be about the average citizen, but in actuality these Astroturf groups are mostly about the rich people behind the scenes. If the Tea Party Movement truly wants access to the public sphere, it must enter the conversation looking to participate in an exchange with other citizens and then work toward a compromise on various political matters with the hope of influencing the political agenda for the good of everyone—not just those who provide the funding for the various Tea Party groups. There is no room for market relations in the public sphere—it must be about the individuals banding together to influence society as a whole.

===Conclusion===
The Tea Party Movement has made quite an impact on the political arena—especially in the 2010 midterm elections. In the November elections, the House gained 60 Republican seats, 28 of which were endorsed by the Tea Party Movement. &lt;ref&gt;http://truth-out.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=4417:the-tea-party-movement-more-hype-than-reality&lt;/ref&gt; The success and the national attention that has been given to the Tea Party Movement is rather remarkable and will hopefully incite other Americans to participate in the public sphere. The supporters of the Tea Party Movement understand that change will not happen overnight, but are willing to join arms against a government who they believe are taking advantage of Americans. The Founding Fathers would be proud. 

While the Tea Party Movement can be used as a model for future political activists groups, there are many flaws that alienate the Tea Party Movement, preventing full participation in the public sphere. One of the biggest concerns that most Americans and politicians have with the Tea Party Movement is the group’s overly ideological stance. At times, many perceive the demands of the Tea Party Movement as too unrealistic—and if the Tea Partiers are too strict or too unyielding in their beliefs, they will accomplish nothing. The public sphere must be an area for compromise—it cannot only be about some individuals, the focus must be on betterment for all citizens (not just the white middle class, or the wealthy). 

And again, there are the Astroturf attacks. If the Tea Party Movement wants to be successful, the claim of being a grassroots organization must prove true. Otherwise, there is no place for the movement within the public sphere. If big corporations are providing the funding and setting the agendas for the Tea Party Movements, then they will fail in the eyes of the general public. As Al Gore points out, “Greed and wealth now allocate power in our society, and that power is used in turn to further increase and concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few” (99). If the Tea Parties are being controlled by the power of the purse, then they can be manipulated to push an agenda that may not be a direct reflection of what the average American wants. And while this may not be what supporters of the Tea Party Movement want, if the groups are being controlled by a few prominent figures, then that is exactly what is being done, possibly unbeknownst to those on the front-line. 

Because of these concerns and some internal feuds, the Tea Party Movement has begun to fizzle out. A recent ABC news poll found that 6 out of 10 respondents are uninterested in more information about the Tea Party movement and just 9% are very interested in the movement. Overall, 41% (a drop from 47%) of Americans support the movement while 45% oppose it; 14% have no interest. &lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/tea-party-movement-looks-stalled-half-like-it-less-as-they-hear-more/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the Tea Party Movement should be applauded, even if their views aren’t universal for every American. Regardless of their ideology, the Tea Partiers are attempting change—and that takes guts. Based on the CBS/Times poll, 90% of Tea Party supporters think that the country is heading in the wrong direction—and they are taking action to change that. This is exactly what our Founding Fathers wanted: politically active, informed, and empowered citizens holding the politicians who run our government accountable for their actions (or lack thereof). The Tea Party Movement reminds us of the importance of political activism and protecting the liberties that the Founding Fathers gave us. We the People should control the government, not the other way around.

==The Feminist Movement==
[[File:Woman-power emblem.svg|thumbnail|right|The iconic feminist movement symbol]]Feminism is described as the movement or series of movements, mostly within the United States and designed to promote equality for women economically, politically, socially, and religiously. Feminism began in the mid-19th century as a call for suffrage, then evolved into a complex and broad social and political movement. Women around the nation rallied together to push for the passage of women’s rights legislation originally, then the movement evolved into an intricate and massive network of change, and continues to inspire and motivate women to push for equality. While feminism led to much legal and political equality for women, it also sparked a separate, anti-feminist movement that is continuing to hinder economic and social equality today.

===History===
The feminist movement has come in waves since the 19th century, each push focusing on a particular issue for women’s rights, beginning with general equality ideas and suffrage, then expanding to various related social, political, and economic topics.

=====Late 1800s - early 1900s=====
* Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention
* Suffrage Movement
* Landmark: Passage of 19th Amendment (1920)

=====1960s - 1980s=====
* Women's Liberation Movement
* Women's Health Movement
* Landmarks: Equal Employment Opportunity Act (1972), Equal Opportunity in Science and Engineering Act (1980)

=====1990s=====
* Hill-Thomas Hearings
* Landmark: Freedom Ride (1992)

===Impact on the Public Sphere===
[[File:VirginiaWoolf.jpg|thumbnail|right|Virginia Woolf]]The theoretical springboard from which the feminist movement launched was Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia. A Room of One's Own. Web ed. Adelaide, South Australia: eBooks@Adelaide, 2012. The University of Adelaide Library. &lt;http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/index.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;, an extended essay she wrote stemming from the thesis that “a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia. A Room of One's Own. Web ed. Adelaide, South Australia: eBooks@Adelaide, 2012. The University of Adelaide Library. &lt;http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/index.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Woolf wrote the essay upon being invited to lecture on the topic of “Women and Fiction” in 1928 at Newnham College and Girton College, two women’s colleges associated with Cambridge University. Woolf’s essay is designed to follow her own train of thought from the point of view of a fictional woman. “My own  suggestion is a little fantastic, I admit;” she says in her essay, “I prefer, therefore, to put it in the form of fiction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia. A Room of One's Own. Web ed. Adelaide, South Australia: eBooks@Adelaide, 2012. The University of Adelaide Library. &lt;http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/index.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Her suggestion can be taken both literally and figuratively: it “…refers not only to the physical space necessary for creating art but also to the hitherto ungranted space within the canon for women artists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D'arcy, Chantal C. &quot;'A Room of One's Own’? Cultural Studies' relationship to institutionalization and disciplinarity in Spain. “Cultural Studies 23.5-6 (2009): 855-72. EBSCOhost. &lt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09502380903208015&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia Woolf was really the pioneer of feminism in the public sphere, as she brought attention to a much larger issue within her argument that women should be given just as much acclaim as men in literature. The feminist movement really expanded Woolf’s idea to blanket all women’s rights issues and propelled itself into the heart of the public sphere.

The Seneca Falls Women’s Rights Convention was held in Seneca Falls, New York in July 1848. All but one of the women present were Quakers, members of the Religious Society of Friends, a split from the Church of England and a relatively liberal group for the time with regards to women’s rights. The convention birthed the Declaration of Sentiments, a list of eighteen wrongs committed against women by men, and eleven resolutions detailing women’s natural right to equality.

[[File:1912 Suffrage Parade.jpg|thumbnail|left|A suffrage parade in Washington, 1919]]
The most notable resolution in the Declaration of Sentiments is the ninth, which stated that it was “the duty of women to secure for themselves the right to vote.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Seneca Falls Convention.&quot; The National Portrait Gallery. Smithsonian, 2012. Web. &lt;http://www.npg.si.edu/col/seneca/senfalls1.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact this resolution had on the feminist movement was so strong, it led to the suffrage movement, which was closely tied in with feminism and successful in the passage of the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution. With this amendment came a whole new wave of political campaigns and ads devoted to securing women’s votes, as the influx of potential voters was massive – that’s roughly half of the population of the United States just added to the pool of age 18+ citizens once consisting of only men. With this shift of focus came an almost patronizing attitude among politicians towards women, where many women believed that politicians appeal to only chauvinistic stereotypes. However, with recent legislation has come a shift of focus by Congress to equality in the workplace with the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, 1/29/09&lt;http://www.lillyledbetter.com/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of the 1960s-80s feminist movement was a phrase coined by Carol Hanisch, “The Personal is Political.” The idea was to interpret “political” in more than one sense of the word, in that political could mean social encounters and relationships in situations of power, not just electoral politics. With this “wave” of feminism came a new awareness of the imbalance of power in the workplace, and inequalities between men and women in social contexts. As a result, “bra burning” protests were popularized among women feeling suffocated by their social inferiority to men, uniting those women by the public sphere, and setting a new tone for social encounters among men and women. However, this spawned a new age of discrimination against women by those who were opposed to social change, and the female gender’s newfound power in many social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Hanisch, Carol. The Personal is Political. 2009. Web. &lt;http://www.carolhanisch.org/CHwritings/PIP.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another event that occurred during the second “wave” of the feminist movement was the reproductive rights movement, which led to the precedent-setting case Roe v. Wade (1973) that deemed anti-abortion laws unconstitutional, guaranteeing women 1st trimester abortions federally. All other details of reproductive laws are left up to the state, allowing for constant debate and controversy surrounding the issue. The continuation of the debate on abortion perpetuates social and potential legal inequalities, those who are pro-life disagreeing with the right, in one sense, for a woman to make her own medical decisions. It’s a thinly veiled brand of sexism that shoves further the wedge into the social divide between men and women.

The Freedom Ride of 1992 was a voter registration drive to rally minority lower-class voters, as part of the third “wave” of feminism, which highlighted racial discrepancies among women, a problem which previous feminist movement hadn’t really covered.
In addition to the Freedom Ride, the Hill-Thomas Hearings, while not legally significant, provided a springboard for public outcry against sexual harassment and other lingering social inequalities. As a result, women voters were much more motivated during the 1992 Congressional elections, raising the voter turnout rate for the gender and setting a new precedent for women in national and federal elections.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, Vanessa. &quot;Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas Hearings.&quot; The Museum of Broadcast Communications. Web. &lt;http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/H/htmlH/hill-thomash/hill-thomas.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ultimate change in the public sphere was the life expectancy increase in women since the inception of the feminist movement, as well as lowered birth rates and more women in the workplace. The enormous wave of women into the public sphere as a result of the feminist movement certainly made a large impact on the demographic of the public sphere.

A powerful tool for the feminist movement is the Women’s Media Center. The WMC, a non-profit organization, was formed in 2005 by feminists Gloria Steinem, Jane Fonda, and Robin Morgan, and is designed to find and counter sexism in the media. You can read more about the WMC and its impact on the public sphere in Chapter 3 of this Wikibook. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Writing_in_the_Public_Sphere:_An_Introduction/The_Media_and_the_Public_Sphere&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===
Groups that support the feminist movement include pro-feminists, the National Organization for Women (NOW) and the Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF), activist organizations that confront violence and social stigmas against women in rape and pornography, and align with the feminist movement pretty closely.

NOW is an institution founded to support socially and financially the advancement of women, and therefore is directly involved in the feminist movement.

FMF is a non-profit organization designed to advocate non-violence, reproductive choice, and general equality for women. It is therefore directly associated with feminism but serves more to push the passage of women’s rights legislation rather than support the movement financially.

Pro-feminists are different from feminist organizations as they provide support for feminism while remaining detached from the official movement.

===Criticism===
One criticism of the “first wave” of the feminist movement is that it catered to middle-class, educated Caucasian women, which sparked other multicultural or ethnicity-specific feminist movements.

There is opposition within feminism toward the de-politicization of many feminist objectives. The problem fundamentalist feminists have with this phenomenon is that it serves to focus more on simply promoting female politicians regardless of party, as opposed to siding with one party and focusing on passing legislation to secure women’s rights throughout the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Truitt, Jos. &quot;Naomi Wolf argues for de-politicized feminism.&quot; Feministing. N.p., 2 Aug. 2011. Web. &lt;http://feministing.com/2011/08/02/naomi-wolf-argues-for-de-politicized-feminism/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion===
The feminist movement has inadvertently sparked an anti-feminist rhetoric that continues today, because although we have accomplished suffrage and much economic and medical equality, social inequalities run rampart, making life for both genders sometimes a hassle. This is a result of the anti-feminist movement creating anti-female bitterness in some men and anti-male resent in some women. And as evidenced by phenomena like terrorism and cults, extremists perpetuate such otherwise unpopular beliefs, so sexism continues today.

We must come to a state of social equality before equality in the workplace can be secured, but total social equality cannot occur until both feminist and anti-feminist extremists come to a neutral, middle ground.

=Censorship &amp; The Public Sphere=

==Overview==
Our country’s public sphere is based on the premise of freedom.  Having the freedom to say whatever you want to say, whenever you want to say it is a powerful tool.  Censorship exists to limit the freedoms of speech and forms of communication that may be considered harmful by a government or body of people&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Censorship.&quot; Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation. Web. 1 May 2012. &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Censorship is a tool of suppression that has no place in the public sphere.  It’s very simple for some governments and controlling bodies to censor released information, but much more difficult for others.  There are several different types of censorship including: political, educational, religious, creative, internet and self-censorship.  Recently, the American government has become interested in limiting the amount of online trafficking of copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Stop Online Piracy Act.&quot; Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation. Web. 1 May 2012. &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  This has caused alarm for many citizens, who are claiming these proposed acts violate their First Amendment rights.  Internet censorship is one of the most prevalent forms of censorship today, and is becoming more and more controversial by the minute.  

==Modern Censorship==
In today’s society, the largest examples of censorship involve the internet.  The main problem governments have with internet use is the incredible amount of illegal file-sharing and other matters considered to be ‘online piracy.’ In the past year, the American government has postponed votes on two bills: the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act (PIPA).  The objective of both was to crack down on all the illegal file-sharing and make it safer for legitimate websites to run smoothly.  However, protest was inevitable, and the public petitioned that both acts would be violations of the First Amendment.

===SOPA===
The brainchild of U.S. Representative Lamar Smith, the Stop Online Piracy Act, is geared toward increasing the online security of intellectual property.  Dedicated to removing illegal file-sharing, SOPA was calling for ad networks, search engines, and internet service providers to sever ties with infringing websites&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Stop Online Piracy Act.&quot; Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation. Web. 1 May 2012. &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Typically, there was widespread protest in America over the seemingly First Amendment violating bill.  One of the most questionable pieces of this bill is the link to other prominent sites using digital file sharing.  Companies such as Google, Twitter and Facebook claim that disallowing the ability to link files and sites would be detrimental to the idea of an open, free internet experience&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Ned. &quot;'Internet Censorship'? Would Websites Go Dark Battling Hollywood?&quot; ABC News. ABC News Network, 09 Jan. 2012. Web. 29 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/internet-censorship-sopa-pipa-bills-congress-websites-dark/story?id=15309498&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

===PIPA===
The PROTECT IP Act differs slightly from SOPA, but not in an extraordinary way.  One of the more troubling issues popular sites like Google and Wikipedia have with these bills is the ability copyright owners would have to take control over web domains.  PIPA would allow the government to shut down websites instantly after discovery of even minor instances of copyright infringement&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mark. &quot;SOPA Blackout: The Day the Web Went Dark.&quot; Detroit Free Press. Gannet, 18 Jan. 2012. Web. 30 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.freep.com/article/20120118/COL41/120118005/SOPA-PIPA-protest-Wikipedia-Google&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Large sites such as Wikipedia dedicate hours a day to combating the constant infringement seen on the site.  Despite this, the site would still have a great deal of trouble maintain the legality of the site within such parameters.  Youtube is another great example of a company standing to lose a lot from the bill.  Under PIPA, should any user post copyrighted material on the site, the entire Youtube site would be seized.  This poses a great deal of concern for all well-known sites taking advantage of file sharing.  It also explains the enormous amount of protest surrounding both SOPA and PIPA. 

===Protest===
[[File:SeaMonkey 1.1.19 -- SOPA blackout.png|thumb|Wikipedia home page on January 18, 2012]]Both SOPA and PIPA were proposed in 2011, but the public really didn’t start rallying against the bills until early 2012.  With voting on the bills scheduled to take place early on in 2012, companies against both acts commiserated to participate in the censoring of a large group of websites.  Involved websites included Wikipedia, Google, Wired.com and many others.  In order to educate more of the public about SOPA and PIPA most of the sites posted information regarding the argument against both acts&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Ned. &quot;SOPA Blackout: Wikipedia, Google, Wired Protest 'Internet Censorship'&quot; ABC News. ABC News Network, 18 Jan. 2012. Web. 30 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/01/sopa-blackout-wikipedia-google-wired-join-protest-against-internet-censorship/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Wikipedia shut down for 24 hours, posted a black page with a message urging users to learn more about the bills.  Google didn’t do anything quite so drastic but offered another means for the public to get involved.  On their main page Google posted a link to an online petition that anyone could sign and voice their participation&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mark. &quot;SOPA Blackout: The Day the Web Went Dark.&quot; Detroit Free Press. Gannet, 18 Jan. 2012. Web. 30 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.freep.com/article/20120118/COL41/120118005/SOPA-PIPA-protest-Wikipedia-Google&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  After the strong showing of protest amongst the people, the government chose to postpone the vote for both bills.  Inevitably, after more information is gathered on the subject and some issues are resolved the vote will come again.  However, the public proved that they are strongly against the passing of both acts and that fact will remain prevalent in the mind of voters.

==Traditional Censorship==
Censorship was occurring long before the internet existed, and obviously not in the type of forum it occurs in today.  In 17th century England you weren’t heard unless you had the ear of the king, or were a noble or some other type of respected citizen.  This absence of a public sphere is something we as a people could never understand today.  The internet allows for everyone to make their presence known one way or another.  Another way of communicating in 17th century England was through the theater.  One of the few forms of entertainment constantly in demand, playwrights had a certain amount of control over their admirers.  The problem was that the King could censor any material he felt didn’t agree with his administration&lt;ref&gt;Reinheimer, David A. &quot;The Roman Actor, Censorship, And Dramatic Autonomy.&quot; Studies In English Literature (Rice) 38.2 (1998): 317. Humanities International Complete. Web. 2 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In 1626, Phillip Massinger the newly appointed head playwright of the King’s Men introduced a new play titled, The Roman Actor.  The play was created as a way of protesting the widespread censorship in theater during the time.  The key message in The Roman Actor was that censorship is destructive rather than helpful&lt;ref&gt;Reinheimer, David A. &quot;The Roman Actor, Censorship, And Dramatic Autonomy.&quot; Studies In English Literature (Rice) 38.2 (1998): 317. Humanities International Complete. Web. 2 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Thankfully, the public need not go to such extents to be heard nowadays.

==Self-Censorship==
Found frequently in conversations every day, self-censorship is one of the more common forms of censorship.  It involves the purposeful censoring of information for a specific reason, and is used with the discretion of the supplier of information.  Self-censorship shouldn’t be viewed as a good or a bad device, but just as a means of restricting information&lt;ref&gt;Horton, John. &quot;Self-Censorship.&quot; Res Publica (13564765) 17.1 (2011): 91-106. Humanities International Complete. Web. 2 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Normally being used for the greater good, such as an officer withholding information from an important investigation, self-censorship can definitely be used for shadier intentions.  For instance, trying to conceal a crime or other indiscretions is certainly a more nefarious application of self-censorship.  However, the biggest cause for concern is the lack of autonomy the practice promotes, not just for the users themselves, but also for those experiencing the censoring&lt;ref&gt;Horton, John. &quot;Self-Censorship.&quot; Res Publica (13564765) 17.1 (2011): 91-106. Humanities International Complete. Web. 2 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Self-censorship must be undertaken with care, and utilized properly to avoid problems with those being censored.    

==Pro-Censorship==
There are certainly merits of censorship with regards to the youth in our society.  Children shouldn’t be able to surf the internet and find pornography websites or other explicit content.  The main argument in favor of censorship is often child protection.  Brought up as the reason for restrictions, there is little physical evidence that children need these limitations in place&lt;ref&gt;Grossberg, M. 2002, Does censorship really protect children?. Federal Communications Law Journal, Los Angeles; May; Vol. 54, Iss. 3; pp. 591-597.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Using the children as an excuse for censorship is wrong, and many researchers have found that it inhibits child learning.  They argue that withholding information from kids is detrimental to their growth, and insulting to their intelligence and competence&lt;ref&gt;Grossberg, M. 2002, Does censorship really protect children?. Federal Communications Law Journal, Los Angeles; May; Vol. 54, Iss. 3; pp. 591-597.&lt;/ref&gt;.  By placing children in the forefront of censorship debates, those in favor of censorship play on the emotions of those with young kids.  The best method for protecting children is not government sanctioned censorship, but the censorship parents apply to their children’s media usage.  

==Effect on the Public Sphere==
Censorship has a profound effect on the public sphere, and not in a good sense.  The public sphere is a forum dedicated to allowing the public a place to discuss societal problems and find constructive ways to fix them&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Public Sphere.&quot; Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation. Web. 1 May 2012. &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Most commonly, the internet is the public sphere that everyone communicates through. People fear nothing more than limitations or infringements of their First Amendment rights, and many forms of censorship can be seen as violations of the First Amendment.  In the instance of SOPA and PIPA, which are certainly infringing on those rights, the public sphere itself is being limited, not just the public’s access to it.  Censorship is bad for the public sphere, for trying to restrict the public seemingly without probable cause doesn’t make much sense.  By censoring information, the government directly contributes to weakening our public sphere.  The public sphere must remain a place where people have the freedom to discuss what they want, whenever they want.  With increasing censorship in the media and legislative acts (SOPA, PIPA) trying to crack down, our freedom in the public sphere is quickly deteriorating.

name=Room of Requirement|
location=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], seventh floor|

== General Overview ==

'''''The Room of Requirement''''' is a room on the seventh floor of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts Castle]] that appears when someone is in very great need of it, and contains what that individual needs at that time.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Room of Requirement is located on Hogwarts' seventh floor, across from the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy.

To &quot;open it&quot; you must walk past the area of the door three times, thinking of what you need. For example: Say you need a place to study. You would walk past the area of the door three times thinking, &quot;I need a place to study.&quot; After the third pass, the door will appear and you may enter to find everything you need inside, books, a study surface, and possibly your choice of studying music. 

The Room first appears in a passing comment by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 23|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. He mentions that he had once found a room full of chamber pots, but has been unable to find it again since. Having learned how the Room works, we may safely assume that he had been walking back and forth in that hall, in need of a bathroom.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] needs a secret place for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] to meet, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby the house elf]] tells him about this room, describing it as, &quot;A room that a person can only enter when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker's needs.&quot; Dobby also called it the &quot;Come and Go Room.&quot; Dobby said he had used it as a place to let [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]] sleep off the effects of Butterbeer. Harry proposed using it as a meeting place for Dumbledore's Army in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], exaggerating Dumbledore's earlier mention of it as a way of quieting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s worries about its suitability. All Hermione's fears are allayed when she actually enters the room, and finds it equipped with a complete library of anti-Jinx textbooks. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] see it, they comment that they had used to hide from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]], but it had then been no larger than a broom closet. Harry, and we readers, know that the Room took that aspect because that was what the Twins had needed at the time.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] uses this room to repair the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]]. Harry unknowingly uses the same aspect of the room to hide his potions book. Draco's secret activities are discovered when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], who has been using it to hide her sherry, finds it already occupied by someone who roughly throws her back out into the hallway. The repaired cabinet is used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], who are entering Hogwarts with Draco's guidance to provide cover, while Draco tries to murder Dumbledore at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s orders.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], the revived Dumbledore's Army are using the Room of Requirement as a hiding place. It ends up being quite comfortable, and even, when required, creates a tunnel that ends in an upstairs room at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head Inn]]. Additionally, at Neville's request, it changes its entry point at random, so that guerrilla missions issuing from the Room of Requirement don't always start at the same point in the castle.

Near the end of Book 7, Harry causes the room to revert to its junk warehouse state in order to locate and reclaim [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw's]] lost diadem, which has been made into a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. He is ambushed in that room by Draco, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. During their battle, Crabbe sets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fiendfyre|Fiendfyre]], which consumes the contents of the room, almost including Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], Hermione, Draco, and Goyle, and does consume Crabbe.

== Analysis ==

Initially it appears that this room could be all things to all people, always having exactly what is needed for the efforts of the day. It appears, though, that it has a number of standard configurations, as Professor Trelawney (who wants to hide her sherry), Harry (who needs a place to hide his textbook), and Draco (who needs a place to hide while he works on the vanishing cabinet), all end up in the same room, a vast warehouse of broken and hidden stuff. This is actually to be expected; for it to be useful as a meeting place, everyone who wants to meet there must be able to enter the same room, which they do by wanting the same sort of thing. The reason that Harry is unable to enter the room when Draco is in there working is that Draco, being in the room, has locked it into its &quot;junk warehouse&quot; state, and as Harry does not think he is looking for a junk warehouse, he is never able to enter it while Draco is there.

It should be noted that this room is not static; when Harry is first leading class there, he discovers that what he really needs is a whistle, and immediately discovers one on the shelf beside him. In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], then resident in the Room of Requirement, is able to convince it to provide him a great deal of creature comforts, though it is unable to produce food; this is why it creates a tunnel to the Hog's Head, to allow Neville to get the food he needs from there. The requirement to think of what you need three times apparently only extends to the door of the room; once within the room, a single thought, if expressed urgently enough, seems to be sufficient. Neville, we are told, is a master at expressing these thoughts.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

One thing that is mentioned in our discussion of this room, in the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 27|chapter 27 of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], is how Draco came to be aware of the existence of this room. It is certain that he would never have learned of its existence from the House Elves, as Harry did, and it is unlikely that he would be wandering around the Seventh Floor looking to hide something, so was unlikely to stumble over it accidentally. While this is never confirmed in the books, it is most likely that Draco was told how to get into the Room of Requirement by Voldemort. Voldemort clearly knew about the junk warehouse aspect of the Room, as he hid a Horcrux, Ravenclaw's Diadem, there. It is this same aspect of the Room that Draco used to work on his Vanishing Cabinet. If Draco had wanted a place to be his workshop, and if he had been aware of the multiple nature of the Room, he would have asked for, and gotten, a well-equipped magical workshop and as a result would have been able to complete his task much more quickly. This is why it is critical to the story of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] that it be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy]], rather than Draco, who retrieves the membership list of Dumbledore's Army from the room in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''; if Draco had been made aware of the multi-aspect nature of the Room, by seeing it first as a Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom and later as a junk warehouse, he very likely would have understood that it could be better matched to what he needed. As it was, the fact that he only uses the junk warehouse aspect of it would indicate that he received word of it from someone who only knew about that aspect, likely Voldemort.

The many interconnections within the story are a hallmark of this author's work. We note that the Room of Requirement was first mentioned in book 4, and played major roles in each successive book; we also note that the nature of the Room, and its ability to be only one thing at a time, were major plot points in book 6. From this, we believe that the author must have worked out the nature of the Room in significant detail by the beginning of her writing of book 5, so as to not accidentally prevent its use by Draco in book 6 or Neville and Harry in book 7.

As mentioned, the Junk Warehouse aspect of the Room of Requirement is destroyed near the end of Book 7 by Fiendfyre. It is possible that this completely destroys all aspects of the Room, but we cannot be certain as no character attempts to re-enter the room once it has been closed on the Fiendfyre. It is safe to assume that all the material hidden in the junk warehouse has been destroyed, and that the warehouse, as a result, would be much smaller if it were re-opened. It is equally safe to assume that any artifacts left in the warehouse, and previously appearing in other aspects of the Room, are now also lost. Whether the Fiendfyre, which we are told is extraordinary magic, being one of only a handful of things that are capable of destroying Horcruxes, would affect the operation of the Room of Requirement, must remain uncertain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tebbel and Zuckerman Reading: The Magazine in America ==

===Chapter 1===

Like any other product, the printed word has been subject to the supply-and-demand of the public.  First came books, next came newspapers, and last came magazines.  Like the English, the American public reserved magazine reading as a mostly a pastime of the upper class.

Credit for the creation of the first magazine is often given to Benjamin Franklin, who titled his periodical The General Magazine.  However, three days before Franklin pulled his off the printing press, his rival Andrew Bradford came out with his own magazine entitled American Magazine.

The early magazine printers set the tone for future endeavors in magazine publishing.  However, at the time there was little need a barely an audience for this new medium.  

The early entrepreneurs of the magazine industry had no intention of creating an entirely new American product.  They merely set out to copy popular British magazines.  Then, with a rising feeling of patriotism in America came an urge to prove to the British that the colonists were not uncivilized barbarians.  However, many early attempts failed due to a lack of funds.  Bradford’s first magazine folded in three months and Franklin’s went under in six.  

On the eve of the Revolution, a magazine emerged that better represented America.  Royal American was produced by the master publisher Isaiah Thomas, who was already famous in the newspaper and book industries.  Thomas’s magazine was the first periodical to use illustrations freely.

Tebbel and Zuckerman considered the best periodical of the Revolutionary age to be H.E. Brackenridge’s United States Magazine.  Brackenridge was an accomplished writer and contributed a lot of the magazine’s material, which was distinctively American in character.  

Between 1741 and 1794, there were never more than three magazines in the country at a time.  Despite the small amount of publications, publishers were already finding more specialized audiences within the American public.  These early magazines typically covered topics such as manners, fashion, social life, religion, morals, and politics.  

However, the earliest magazines never included long fiction.  Instead, the periodicals featured “character sketches” or “fragments”, which later evolved into the short story we know today.  They sought to reinforce the patriarchal moral values of American society.  The most popular subject of the time was women, which men explored from every angle.  Other, more controversial topics were covered also, such as education and slavery.  

In terms of content, the line between magazines and newspapers was still blurred well into the late eighteenth century.  However, from the beginning magazines held up the mirror to national life.

===Chapter 2===

Between 1800 and 1825, there was a huge surge in the number of American magazines.  This was due to the invention of the cylinder press (a technological breakthrough in printing) as well as the growth of a more literate American public.  Although specialized audiences also grew, the biggest rise was in general magazines.  During this rise of the general magazines, political issues began to get more attention than literature.  One of the most notable magazines was Joseph Dennie’s weekly magazine, Port Folio.  The magazine’s success was mostly due to the popularity and charisma of its publisher, Joseph Dennie.  

However, an obstacle to the growth of the magazine industry was its struggle with postal regulations.  Thanks to the Post Office Act of 1794, postmasters general were given the power to accept or refuse any magazine without having to give a reason.  Most of them disliked magazines because they felt the periodicals crowded their mail sacks.  However, overtime postmasters became more accepting of magazines.  By 1825, the number of magazines in circulation in America grew from a dozen to nearly a hundred.  One magazine that stood out was the Saturday Evening Post, which evolved from Benjamin Franklin’s newspaper Pennsylvania Gazette.  The appearance of fiction in magazines was still rare.  Also rare was writers receiving payment for their work.  In 1824, the Monthly became the first magazine to promise payment to contributing writers.  Editors typically made more money than writers, but their payment was dependent on how much money the magazine was making at the time.  

After 1825, the magazine industry began to change rapidly in an age of upheaval around the world.  This period was termed as the “Golden Age of Magazines”.  It was an age where magazines were truly realizing their potential as a medium.  Between 1825 and 1850, there was an explosion of the number of magazines being published in America.  The number of magazines grew from roughly one hundred to about six hundred.  However, there were thousands of starter magazines during this period, those periodicals with an average life of two years.  While weeklies fell to the background, general monthly magazines took center stage during this time.  These magazines were created by different kinds of entrepreneurs, such as George R. Graham.  His Graham’s Magazine grew steadily and eventually became a sort of roll call of the best American writers and poets.  Graham became the first publisher to pay his writers well.  He understood that there would never be a short supply of great writers if you paid them well for their contributions.  
The two magazines of this time period with the greatest longevity were the North American Review and the Youth’s Companion, which sought to entertain as well as instruct children.  A major ingredient of the magazine’s success was its ability to appeal not only to children, but to the whole family.  During this time magazines also began using an increasing amount of illustrations, employing the method in which the pictures are engraved on copper and steel.  

By the 1850s, the magazine industry had acquired many of the features that still characterize it today.  American magazines were giving readers a glimpse of national life during the 1850s.

===Chapter 15===

The Saturday Evening Post, published by the infamous George Horace Lorimer, was one of the most popular periodicals of its time.  

The magazine’s trademark was undoubtedly its covers, which were illustrated by Norman Rockwell.  The covers were upbeat, everyday scenes that the American public could easily identify with.  However, in the 1930s, Rockwell’s work became more complex.  He no longer simply painted figures against a white field but began to use the whole canvas.  Throughout this time, Rockwell’s covers stood out more and more from other magazines.  Rockwell was considered the master of idealization and was able to hit the pulse of the American public time and time again.  His technique was especially reflected through one of his characters, Willie Gillis, who embodied the everyman in uniform.  However, Rockwell’s covers reflected the changing times rather than the actual content of the Post.  Even so, Rockwell was able to achieve what no other magazine cover artist could.

Characteristics of the Post like the Rockwell covers reflected the true genius of George Horace Lorimer.  Even if he didn’t personally believe in the content he was printing (such as feminist issues), he understood that he needed to roll with the times.  For example, the magazine was the first publication to print a picture of a woman smoking a cigarette.  Lorimer would simply ask himself if his audience would like it when he was considering accepting material for each issue of the Post.  Although the magazine was typically aimed at middle-class interests, the publisher understood that he had to include the entire spectrum of the American public.  Lorimer’s instinct was nearly foolproof.  He had a knack for knowing what his audience would consider acceptable and unacceptable.  

There were few articles in the Post that had any other purpose than to entertain.  However, the magazine also sought to teach the public through biographies.  The magazine’s articles were divided into political and nonpolitical, although the political pieces were typically the most effective.  The publication even featured articles by presidents.  Many of the Post’s articles resembled fiction.  They were faithful representations of what the average American public were thinking and talking about.
As with other businesses, the major factor in creating change in the magazine industry was the shift in the national mood from the expansiveness and optimism of the 1920s to the traditionalism and conservatism of the 1930s.  

Lorimer’s method with the Post was to transform old formulas employed in the publication time and time again.  Dewitt Wallace took a different approach when he created Reader’s Digest, which is considered another revolutionary magazine of the time.  Wallace’s major ingredient for success was to make an art out of standard publishing practice of shortening copy.  He would preserve the main point of the article but trim off any commercial ornamentation.  However, Wallace still demanded that all of the articles met three criteria; applicability, lasting interest, and constructiveness.  Another element of the magazine’s success was that Wallace condensed articles from other popular publications and offered them at a bargain price.  However, along the way, Reader’s Digest began developing its own articles.  By mid 1969, approximately 65 percent of the periodical was original work.  Despite these fundamental changes, the circulation of Wallace’s magazine grew and grew.  

Another popular magazine of the time was David Smart’s Esquire.  However, this periodical was quite different from its predecessors.  It offered an array of risqué cartoons and more intellectual articles of fiction and nonfiction.  Later, Esquire Inc. developed another new magazine known as Ken.  It was overly liberal and soon became the magazine that everybody loved to hate.  While Esquire celebrated the good life, Ken sought to fight against the fascists of the world.  However, despite the publisher’s best efforts, Ken soon faded into oblivion like so many other magazines.  

With the exception of Esquire and Ken, most magazine of this time used basically the same formula, with the Saturday Evening Post as their template.  In the course of one issue each magazine sought to provide information, entertainment, escape, opinions, a reinforcement of moral values, and a growing consumer’s showcase through advertising.  

Then came the birth of the family magazine.  Today, looking back at these periodicals gives an accurate social history of the times.  Family magazines were able to establish a solid rapport with their audiences that was difficult for other publications to match.  The leader of the family magazines was E.T. Meredith’s Better Homes and Gardens.  Meredith wanted to appeal to both men and women of average incomes who could benefit from suggestions on how to improve their homes.  Meredith’s publication was one of the few magazines of the time that didn’t include fiction, fashion, or sex.  And yet it still thrives today.  Unfortunately, Meredith died shortly before the Great Depression and the magazine was in the hands of a new editor, Elmer T. Peterson.  He steered the magazine towards providing readers with information they could apply during hard times.  Amazingly, Better Homes and Gardens survived the Great Depression in fairly good shape and entered the postwar period in better condition than most magazines.

The entrepreneur Bernarr Macfadden then introduced a completely different area of the mass market.  His publications grew from his idea to make magazines out of the two biggest mass-market ingredients, physical culture and sex.  Macfadden created the confession magazine and greatly improved the crime magazine by transforming it into the true-detective periodical.  At their peak in 1935, Macfadden’s magazines had a combined circulation of more than 7 million people, which was more than any other publisher at the time.  

Another addition to the magazine industry was the pulp Western.  It was a twentieth-century expression of the American public’s great love affair with the Great West.  The pulp Western could be divided into two broad categories, the super-hero magazine and the love-story Western.  The golden age of Western pulp fiction was between the mid-1920s and the mid-1940s, but this era came to an end by the early 1950s.  The pulp Western was unique than other categories of magazines developed for the mass market.  It established a closer relationship to its readers than any other type except for women’s magazines.

===Motts Reading===

====Chapter 25: The Established Leaders of the New York Press====
In this chapter, Motts chronicles the growth of New York City’s earliest newspaper press successes.  By the end of the nineteenth-century, there were more than 10,000 newspapers in the U.S.  The American newspaper press was booming.

One of the biggest changes of the time was journalism’s emergence from the domination of political parties.  This change brought objectivity to reporters and took responsibility from politicians.  The nation’s widespread relaxation of party bonds also contributed to the newspaper industry’s newfound independence.  This meant that reporters now had the freedom to criticize political leaders and their policies within their own political party.  Freedom of the press had truly taken effect.  The newspapers that exercised this new freedom typically found more success.  Many newspaper editors believed that readers disliked being manipulated into one political party or the other.  However, a majority of the newspapers were still under party discipline.  But when newspapers did exercise this freedom, the race to cover political crusades against municipal misgovernment usually replaced the old partisan activities.  

After his father’s death, James Gordon Bennett, Jr. took over the New York Herald.  Under Bennett’s management, the newspaper found initial success with his many expeditions to make news if he wasn’t able to find it.  The most famous of the publisher’s travels was the expedition of Henry M. Stanley to the heart of Africa to find the missionary and explorer David Livingstone.  However, Bennett’s only real contribution to the industry was this idea of wealthy newspapers sponsoring large-scale expeditions.  

Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the New York Herald and the New York Sun were in a close race in terms of circulation.  However, it was during this time that the Sun’s (which was also considered an independent newspaper) popularity peaked, and it was unable to sustain this momentum.  Greeley’s New York Tribune also hit hard times in the late 1800s when its circulation dropped by almost half.  However, the city’s Evening Post remained one of the most distinguished newspapers throughout the period.

The New York Times and its editor George Jones also fought a rapid decline in circulation and popularity in the late 1800s.  Unfortunately, when Joseph Pulitzer bought the World and began transforming New York journalism, he left out the Times because it was nearly free from sensationalism.  However, eventually later editors of the Times were able recover and prove the resiliency of the newspaper industry.

== Infamous Scribblers (a summary of Eric Burns piece)==

Though the early years of American journalism created great documents, these formative years led to a great deal of muckraking gossip columns as well.  Some may argue that although controversial, it was this type of reporting that made this period an important time in shaping American journalism.  

Many of the colonists that traveled to America were well-educated and seeking independence.  They set up school systems, such as Dame Schools taught by single widows in the neighborhood to guarantee their children the ability to read and write.   This education prepared them for advanced work in the major universities such as Harvard, William &amp; Mary, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and Rutgers.  The upper class of this time period, both men and women appreciated music, art, dancing and literature.  However, the portrait they painted of themselves was far more glamorous in comparison to their behavior.  Early Americans were well-kept, well-informed, and well-mannered. This was true for the majority of upper-class citizens, but the lower-class citizens gambled, drank, fought and were disorderly.  It was the rich aristocracy who had the financial ability to afford printing presses and publish the “news”.  This influenced the reporting of this time period a great deal.  “There was no tradition at the time of an impartial press, either in the colonies or in Europe.  In fact, insofar as there was a tradition in journalism at all, it favored bias; newspapers were printed either to indulge the whims of the owner or to serve the political causes with which he had aligned himself.”  As a result of this, there was less of a feeling by the publisher to provide a civic duty.  

Another reason for the harshness found in the print of the time period was likely due to the underlying intensity between Americans and Europeans.  Although usually bound by the status quo, print was a place to release feelings about the events taking place.  One quote that summarizes the journalistic style of this time period most fittingly is that if a group of colonists read the newspapers of today “they would be startled by, and perhaps not altogether approving of, the extent to which we have tamed the wildly inglorious impulses of their journalism.”    

===John Campbell- “Boston’s sour-faced Scottish postmaster”===

Campbell’s job in a post office allowed him to listen to customers as they sent out letters.  He encouraged them to stay and talk more, asking questions as they went along.  He started taking notes and turned those into a newsletter.  By 1704, four years after beginning his newsletter, Campbell found that he needed more space for all of the information he was acquiring.  Campbell found himself a printing press started the “Boston News-Letter”.  This newsletter was described as “sluggish but trustworthy”.  However, the “Boston News-Letter” was invaluable for its reporting of events such as the Molasses Act, the Stamp Act, the Townshend Acts, the Intolerable Acts, the Boston Massacre, and the Boston Tea Party.  

Since journalism of this type was still a novelty, the newsletter at its peak reached three hundred subscriptions.  However, advertisers realized that although there were only three hundred subscribers, many people were reading the publication and realized that this new form of media was an outlet for advertising.  Advertisements would include the purchase of slaves, searching for missing slaves, as well as other issues of concern.  

Paper in the early American journalism era was pricey and difficult to obtain.  The paper was made out of linen rags that were donated by the women readers.  Furthermore, it was difficult to find ink, especially large quantities, as needed for newspapers.  The ink smelled awful and was very thick.  The last obstacle a printer had to overcome was finding type.  Whether it be having enough money to buy a new type set with larger letters or replacing the worn out letters, this was a hassle.  A final problem was finding news to put in the paper.  There were no reporters to assist Campbell and as a result sometimes news was difficult to obtain, or was reported much later.  

Parting from problems in production, the printers had a problem with their audience.  Although many were interested in the paper, few people could speak English and few could afford to purchase a newspaper.  Distribution was difficult due to the poor infrastructure system available at the time.  However, by the mid-1600s, a mail delivery service had become prevalent and this assisted in the distribution of newspapers.  The Boston Post Road opened and it similar to a UPS service.  It delivered parcels and letters.

===Benjamin Harris===

Harris started the newspaper “Publick Occurrences both Foreign and Domestic”.  The paper began in Boston.  Due to Boston’s growing population, as well as urban setting, it was the ideal place to create a paper.  Harris became the first publisher in North America.  Due to the papers efficient use of paper, there was no wasted space; it would “be the style of virtually all American journals during the colonial era.” 

In this paper the first two or three pages contained the news articles and the last page was blank so readers could make their own assumptions and comments before passing it along to another reader.  The style was very concise and condensed, getting the most information as possible into each paper.  Harris was not looked favorably upon in the public eye, being called a racist and crude.  He failed to get the proper license for his paper and its circulation was shutdown.

===The Courant===

This was the fourth newspaper in Boston, as well as the fourth in America.  It was published by James Franklin, the cousin of Benjamin Franklin.  This paper was the first to employ reporters on its staff.  Because the paper could not pay a staff, these reporters were volunteers.  Franklin was the first “crusading journalist”.  He crusaded against inoculation; for fear that it would spread small pox instead of curing it.  Later, ironically, James nephew would die of small pox from lack of inoculation.  
James Franklin criticized the government as well.  These actions eventually led James to be placed in jail.  After being placed in jail, James eventually handed his publication over to his apprentice and younger brother, Benjamin Franklin.  

===John Fenno===

Fenno attended Holbrook’s Writing School in Boston and became a publisher who devoted himself to federalism, particularly the ideas of Alexander Hamilton.  Little is known about Fenno and he was once referred to as the “historical John Doe.”  He started the “Gazette of the United States”.  This paper was the first federal journal that had influence in the United States.  His motto was “He that is not for us, is against us” and that became the same motto as the Gazette.  Alexander Hamilton was the primary contributor to this paper, giving it articles, thoughts, and sometimes funds.

===Thomas Jefferson &amp; Philip Freneau===

Upset at what was being printed in the papers, Jefferson decided to create a paper of his own for republicans called the “National Gazette”.  Philip Freneau, a recognized writer and poet became the editor of the “National Gazette” after receiving a great deal of pressure from both Jefferson and James Madison.  James Madison thought high of Freneau’s work and intellect.  Madison often contributed to this paper as we

== Joseph Pulitzer’s Influence on New Journalism ==

“There is room in this great and growing city for a journal that is not only cheap but bright, not only bright but large, not only large but truly democratic.” – Joseph Pulitzer

Born wealthy and with education from the best private schools, Joseph Pulitzer’s future looked bright from the start.  He joined the American army have many traumatic events took place in his life.  The death of his father and the crumbling of his immediate family shortly after left Pulitzer wanting to leave and find his own path in life.  When he moved to St. Louis later in his life, he had a very dramatic welcome with rain and sleet falling on his head.

St. Louis helped Pulitzer find more direction in his career and he ended up working with German youth.  After finding more friends and networking, Pulitzer was hired in his first reporter job in the Mid-West.  He was unpolished and naïve but stuck with the journalism trade.  His youthful nickname, Joey, did not do his journalistic abilities justice and many of his peers were instructed by editors to be like him.

After he rose in the journalism industry he was elected as a state legislature.  This hate suited him well and he dove into it in St. Louis.  He started looking over the local newspaper situation.  After settling in his career, he married and sought after other opportunities in the trade.

Pulitzer took over much of the newspaper world.  He acquired a list of newspapers that he bought after his many successes and he improved on them.  The St. Louis Dispatch was one of his most demanding purchases.  It became very profitable however in 1882 a libel controversy ended in tragedy as the conflict ended in death in the Dispatch offices.  Pulitzer also had The Union, The Post, and New York World under his belt of purchased papers.  He thrived on hard-work and accepted nothing less from each publication.

Colonel Cokerill, the new publisher assigned to New York World, got new staff and taught them new ways of journalism.  This and many other reasons are what gave him the nickname of the “Father of New Journalism”.  He wanted no more “gossip” and more “human-interest”.  Other changes were adopted in a neater typography and smaller headlines.  At this time the use of “ears” began at the end of nameplates.

From all of this journalistic development came a sixfold program for New Journalism.  This program was implemented in the New York World.

# A modern news policy formed that focused on finding stories that are legitimate and would interest the public.  The use of cable was increased and all types (serious and novelty stories) began to be reported more.
# Crusades and stunts were largely important to this program.  Setting up news stories and making a big deal of things that would not be without media attention was this steps main focus.
# The editorial page had to have high character.  Pulitzer considered this the “heart of the paper and the chief reason for its existence.”
# Adding more pages and more stories for less money was of high importance to this program.  With more pages came more opportunity for audience interest and this would cause the audience to grow.
# Illustration in newspapers was lead by the “World”.  The more illustration in a paper, the more it sold.
# Promotions were implemented by coupons and voting contest.  This added customer involvement and brought in money.

After contributing so much to the newspaper and governmental society, Pulitzer had a breakdown and never fully recovered.  He over-worked himself.  He still followed progress in the World and tried hard to emphasize the importance of accuracy.  Unfortunately, sensationalism had already began to rise and take over.  Sensationalism can be defined as the detailed newspaper treatment of crimes, disasters, sex scandals, and monstrosities.

The use of stunts brought media attention and news stories became commodities.  This is still happening.  The coverage of sports also rose as entertainment news rose in popularity.  With the rise in entertainment news, gossip and sensationalized celebrities became news commodities and are still under constant scrutiny.

== Chapter One ==
First Newspapers in “The New England”

When newspapers began emerging in the “New England”, as the United States was referred to when colonists originally came over, many things guided the style of these new publications.  First, newspapers were patterned like the newspapers of England, because the newspapers from England were still being sent over to the new settlers by relatives still living in England.  A second factor pushing the concept of a newspaper in the New World was the colonist’s immediate fascination with the other colonists scattered along the east coast.  

Despite the desire for newspapers, it was difficult to begin a successful paper at the beginning of colonial time.  There were many other things the colonists need to focus their efforts on, “they had few luxuries and, since the frontier is by its very nature always undersupplied with labor, they had no leisure for the cultivation of aesthetic and purely intellectual values.”  However, eventually newspaper publications began in the colonies.

In 1638, Harvard received the first printing press that the colonies had seen.  Although the printing press was a new advantage, the government was weary of the press, because the government was aware of the power of the press to reach the masses.  At this time period, free speech as well as freedom of the press had not been established as a luxury in the colonies.

In time news developed.  At first news was disseminated through letters written to merchants or correspondence between friends.  Meeting places such as courts and taverns were often locations where news was exchanged as well.  

The first American newspaper was “Publick Occurrences”, published by Benjamin Harris.  “Publick Occurrences” was three pages, with a blank fourth page attached for readers to add their thoughts before they passed the paper on to the next reader.  Topics included the King of France as well as the French and Indian War.  Unfortunately, the government stopped the publishing of “Publick Occurrences” after only one issue.  The government claimed the paper had been published “without the least privity or countenance of authority.”    

Fourteen years following Harris, Campbell created his newspaper, the “Boston News-Letter”.  Campbell was the head of post and heard a great deal of the news that was occurring and took notes on the events.  These notes eventually led to the creation of the “Boston News-Letter”.  Although Campbell was criticized for being dull, his publication offered a great deal of news.  Campbell had many correspondents telling him of news, but sometimes it took a great deal of time for the news to be published.  However, Campbell felt that it did not matter when news was reported “so long as important events were recorded in due time.”  Newspapers became a luxury during this time period.  One report claims that men would present ladies they were courting with copies of the newspaper as a gift, rather than things such as candy.  The newspaper perished at the beginning of the American Revolution, but had an impressive run of seventy-two years.  

The “Boston Gazette” was created by William Brooker.  The “Boston Gazette” was similar to the “News-Letter”, but the printing and the quality of writing had greatly improved.  The publication became one of the most famous papers of the American Revolution.

The “New-England Courant” was started by James Franklin.  The paper lasted five in and half years, but is considered “one of the most brilliant and interesting of the eighteenth century American newspapers.”  The Courant was more for entertainment and did not claim to be published by an Authority like the other papers of this time period.  The Courant garnered fame after publishing a great deal of opposition about the small pox vaccination.  The paper was used to campaign against the idea of inoculation and as a result “won the attention of the town, gave a one-sided story, and built circulation, and it made the paper bitter enemies.”  James Franklin’s younger brother Benjamin was his apprentice. Benjamin set type for the paper as well as anonymously contributed a set of essays known as the “Dogwood Papers”.  Unfortunately, when James Franklin targeted the governor in his paper, the governor did not find this amusing and James was placed in jail.  Although released, the Courant became tamer than before and eventually was discontinued.  

There were a few other newspapers worth mentioning in Boston during this time period.  Samuel Kneeland’s “New-England Weekly Journal” was considered the successor of the “New-England Courant”.  Although the newspaper printed a great deal of news, much of the paper focused on entertainment.  Many considered this paper equal or superior to any newspapers seen in the colonies by that time period.  Eventually the Journal bought out the Gazette and formed one large paper.  

The “Evening-Post” was another newspaper during this time period.  It was created by a young lawyer named Jeremy Gridley.  Gridley quickly passed the paper over to a printer named Thomas Fleet who eventually made the “Evening-Post” the best and most popular newspaper in Boston.

== Chapter 3 ==
Newspapers more so started devoting themselves to coverage of the news after the 1835 advent of the New York Herald. Before that, they were propaganda organs to political parties on which they were dependent. Magazines became forums for public opinion because they offered more variety and provided more of an intellectual sounding board than newspapers. However, it was hard to draw a line between the two.

Reforms, such as slavery became a preoccupation of magazine editors. Anti-slavery magazines were religious and sentimental, as well as humanitarian. The problem with these magazines was that they were single-issue periodicals, so they were overshadowed by more popular publications.

Although much of the magazine business shunned politics in their magazines, there was a rapid increase in publication of political papers and periodical magazines between 1850 and 1860. It went from 1,630 publications in existence in 1850, to 3,242 in 1860. Major general magazines, such as Harper’s and Graham’s, remained afloat without the presence of politics in their publications through the tumultuousness and violence of the 1850’s. Upon war, however, these magazines all became embroiled in politics in one way or another.

Magazines became a place to debate serious issues or partisan salvos. They discussed a broad variety of topics from slavery to views on controversial national issues to presidential debate. The slavery debate helped to narrow the difference between newspaper and magazines. Both had partisan views, but newspapers worried less about the consequences of publishing them.  The pace of the abolitionist movement picked up with the publication of anti-slavery magazines. The Panic of 1857, however, interrupted this because economic problems implied a resulting war. 

In 1855, U.S. picture periodicals began with Frank Leslie and his Leslie’s Weekly. They contained large pictures and short stories covering news, music, art and book reviews. Leslie’s Weekly found competition in 1957 with the publication of Harper’s Weekly, and as a result dropped the price of each issue to six cents, or two dollars for a year. This upped Leslie’s circulation, making him unstoppable. From this, Frank Leslie established a publishing empire with the publication of Frank Leslie’s New Family Magazine in 1857, Frank Leslie’s Budget of Fun, and even more after the war. He was on a crusade to fight injustice even though most of his stories were sensationalized.

Harper’s New Monthly, published in June of 1850, contained 144 pages, costing twenty five cents an issue, or three dollars a year. This magazine was intended for the educated and upper class who were politically minded. It became a forum for the governing class, and upon becoming the leading national monthly, was described as “a mirror of American life and ideas.” In 1857, Harper’s Weekly was launched; it claimed to have a greater accent on politics, and even further fuzzied the line between newspapers and magazines. Also published in 1857, the Atlantic Monthly emerged as Harper’s Monthly’s greatest rival, with contributions and support from some of America’s most talented writers.

== Chapter 10 ==
From 1895 to 1915, the goal of the muckrakers was to reform print, a system they saw as corrupt and economically unbalanced. These reformist magazines were politically influential. Politicians were compelled to respond to the expression of populist demand for reform in these major reformist magazines.

Low-priced magazines were nothing new but became revolutionary in magazine publishing and reading at the end of the century. The arrival of the half tone was a major factor in this revitalization. It provided economic motivation to the masses through its making rich color available at the same low price.

The popularity of these ten cent magazines was due to the ability to reach out to the less educated and less wealthy middle class. In these publications they received fiction and non-fiction stories, learned of new developments in science and transportation, and read about railroading and exploration. Many social reforms resulted in part from investigative reporting by muckrakers in these ten cent magazines. These muckrakers were a national media voice, in which the common theme of their stories was betrayal.

McClure’s magazine led the way in terms of muckraking by creating a pattern of scandalous revelations, combined with the concern for serious social issues. In 1892, Ida Tarbell was hired to expose the monopoly on the oil industry and Standard Oil’s operations, and as a result was considered the first great muckraker. Her investigative reporting helped to break up Standard Oil’s power in 1910 with the help of a Supreme Court decision. She also inspired antitrust suits in twenty states.

Corporations fought back at these accusations brought about by the muckrakers. In 1906, Senator John F. Dryden, president of Prudential Insurance Company, used his power while campaigning to persuade the editors of Cosmopolitan to remove negative articles pertaining to him. He also flooded magazines with self-serving propaganda by buying ad space and filling the ad spaces with these positive articles written about him by famous and greedy muckraking journalists.

The decline of the muckraking movement began with the publication of “The Treason of the Senate” by David Graham Phillips in Cosmopolitan. The story proved to be too bitter and resulted in President Teddy Roosevelt himself denouncing muckraker journalism. Many began to see that the truths the muckrakers were unearthing were not as bad as they had been portrayed.

In 1906, the talented and well-known writers of McClure’s, along with some editors resigned from the magazine. They bought Leslie’s Monthly Magazine and renamed it American Magazine, with the promise of being uplifting and positive. Soon it was as if there was nothing left to “rake,” for journalists had left no issues unturned. A flaw found in muckraking journalism was that these journalists had no solution for that which they had uncovered. In 1912, muckraking seemed to have worn out its welcome, and as a result, magazines responded to this loss of interest by rapidly changing their format. 

The abandonment of muckraking left remaining radicalism in the hands of three publications: the Nation, the New Republic, and the Masses. The Nation was modeled after London’s Spectator and Saturday Review. It had many famous and not-so-famous contributors, but all were published as anonymous. For its modest circulation, it had much influence with its intellectual content. It remained a low-circulation publication, but had a trickle down influence on large numbers of people.

The advent of the Nation’s rival came in 1914 with the founding of the New Republic by Herbert Croly. His influential first book, “The Promise of American Life,” indirectly led to the founding of this publication.

The Masses, founded in 1911 by Piet Flag differed from the Nation and the New Republic in that its staff and contributors were working class people. This publication was considered Socialist, and all worked for no pay and made all decisions collectively. In order to survive in the United States’ capitalist society, some writers wrote for the Metropolitan, a monthly magazine that had opened its pages to socialist writers. The Masses found serious socialist rivals in the Comrade and the International Socialist Review, so they had to raise money to keep the publication afloat. The staff of the Masses was able to make it a free publication for the next five years until the Associate Press filed a criminal libel suit against them in 1916. Internal strife between the publication’s editors Eastman and Dell, and the resignation of its writers and artists resulted in the loss of its artistic and expressionistic spark. In December of 1917, the Masses gave up after being deemed unmailable by the Espionage Act, and then soon after losing its 2nd-class privileges.

==Watergate an Investigative Journalism==
===Introduction and History===

Contrary to what the movie Forrest Gump portrays, Forrest himself did not discover the Watergate scandal. It was actually the Washington Post that ran the story, specifically written by reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who broke the Watergate scandal. Watergate was discovered on June 17, 1972, with a burglary in the Watergate building, the home of the Democratic National Committee. A security guard named Frank Wills discovered the burglars. The five burglars, Virgilio González, Bernard Barker, James W. McCord, Jr., Eugenio Martínez, and Frank Sturgis, were linked to presidential candidate Richard Nixon, were all convicted of conspiracy, burglary, and violation of federal wiretapping laws. They all went on to serve lengthy jail times. As a result, on July 30, 1974, Nixon became the first president to resign from his position. Although Watergate happened in 1972, it has had a lasting impact on the decades succeeding, such as presidential and governmental standards and the role of investigative journalism. People think that investigative journalism often pry into their personal life, however, investigative journalism helps protect them from scandal.

The people that were involved in the scandal had various benefits to gain. Even though the Watergate scandal was discovered Nixon still became president. However, the burglars involved could have had great political gains at stake. On the opposite side, the journalists also had much to gain. With the reporting of the Watergate scandal, Woodward and Bernstein created the story of lifetime. The public learned of them about the scandal and were drawn into the whole process of the investigation. 

There are many theories about why the Democratic National Committee's office was burglarized, ranging from Nixon's apparent ties to the mafia and to the possible killing of Fidel Castro. The most likely reason according to J. Anthony Lucas of the New York Times, The Nixon forces were trying to determine what Lawrence F. O'Brien, the chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, knew about some shady dealings between Nixon and Howard Hughes, particularly $100,000 passed from the multimillionaire to the President's friend Charles (Bebe) Rebozo, part of which was appaently later spent on furnishings and jewelry for the President and his family. &lt;ref&gt;Lukas, J. Anthony Lukas; J. Anthony Lukas Is Author Of A Book On Watergate That Was Published In 1976 And Is To Be Reissued Next. &quot;Why the Watergate Break-In?&quot; The New York Times. The New York Times, 30 Nov. 1987. Web. 14 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no motive has ever been confirmed for the burglary as far as I know, logically, people  thought that the break in had something to do with the Republican committee trying to get the edge on the Democratic committee.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
With the President of the United States uttering the famous line, &quot;I am not a crook&quot;, Nixon also stated, &quot;You must pursue this investigation of Watergate even if it leads to the president. I am innocent. You have to believe I am innocent. If you don't, take my job.&quot; Nixon tried to deny all involvement with the scandal. Once acknowledging his role in the scandal, the country was questioning the role of the president. How could someone cheat while trying to run for the most powerful position in the United States? How could someone be so dishonest with the citizens of his county? The truth is simple: Nixon wanted to win and he would do practically anything to make that dream a reality. The people involved in the crime had a lot to gain, as well as the people reporting on it. Nixon would become president, the five burglars probably all had something to gain being a part of the Nixon staff, and the reporters found a once in-a-lifetime story.

===Impact of Watergate on Investigative Journalism===
With the resignation of Nixon, many people lost faith in their government. As a result, according to Christopher Cacace, &quot;Several new laws were drafted to prevent further campaign-funded scandals from happening, laws such as the Freedom of Information Act of 1976, which granted exposure of previously disclosed government documents and files.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cacace, Christopher. &quot;History of Watergate and Its Lasting Effects on Investigative Journalism.&quot; Yahoo! Contributor Network. N.p., 27 May 2009. Web. 7 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; After the next election, the country was put into the hands of Jimmy Carter, a democrat, who would later have to face the Soviets in the Cold War. In other words, with the unrest between the American citizens and the Republican Party, a Democrat would take over the White House. Also as part of the Freedom of Information Act, the president was given less power. People were now able to view record and evidence that were previous not available to them, although, Nixon never released those now infamous Watergate tapes to the public. This allows people in society to become more knowledgeable about a person. In addition, along with citizens being able to gain knowledge, newspaper reports could easily build more interesting and intriguing stories. 

Along with American politics changing, the role of journalism changed as well in a number of ways. First, journalism became a media &quot;watchdog&quot;. According to Christopher Cacace, &quot;Journalists more than ever were now responsible for being a &quot;watch dog&quot; to government actions and acting as a &quot;check and balance&quot; to keep government actions in order. A new wave of journalism started which resulted in a more in-depth look at the lives of people in positions of power, a change that was welcomed by the public, as current journalists are able to catch scandals and illegalities, which they previously were not ready for. This means that people of substantial power are put under a spotlight where their every move is followed and critiqued by the press and by the public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cacace, Christopher. &quot;History of Watergate and Its Lasting Effects on Investigative Journalism.&quot; Yahoo! Contributor Network. N.p., 27 May 2009. Web. 7 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kellner explains, &quot;The Press was conceived in this system as the &quot;fourth estate&quot; and freedom of the press was provided by most Western democracies as a fundamental right and as a key institution within a constitutional order based on separation of powers in which the media would serve as a check against corruption and excessive power in the other institutions.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Kellner, Douglas. &quot;Habermas, the Public Sphere, and Democracy: A Critical Intervention&quot;. n.p. Web. April 14, 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;In other words, these ideas, both the &quot;media watchdog&quot; and the media being described as the fourth estate assist in helping the public gain knowledge to make important decisions about their government. Knowledge is power for those who know what is going on inside their government, and action can be taken if change is thought to be needed. Media gives knowledge to people by giving them the facts they need to be informed. 

The mainstream media went to task in discovering the truth about what happened during Watergate. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein worked relentlessly to uncover the
[[File:Carl bernstein 2007.jpg|thumbnail|right|Carl Bernstein]]
[[File:Bob Woodward.jpg|thumbnail|right|Bob Woodward]]
facts for the public. However, Nixon would be throwing a curve ball into all of this. According to Carl Bergetz, &quot;The mainstream media at the time may have won the battle against Nixon, but Nixonian politics won the war… Nixon understood that politics could be theater. They developed a media plan focused on emotion and impression, not reason&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bergetz, Carl. &quot;It's Not Funny 'Cause It's True&quot;. n.p. Web. April 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;. Nevertheless, in the end, Nixon still came out as the bad person. He misplaced the trust of the people and the people choose a different man and party for the next President of the United States. With Woodward and Bernstein attending the hearings of the Watergate scandal, they provided valuable information to the masses. The Washington Post reporters were able to relay information to the people who could not be present at the hearings. By providing this information to the public, people were able to educate themselves on the topic and were later able to make informative decisions for their country.

Another way that investigative journalism advanced is the high-profile use of anonymous sources. Woodward and Bernstein used an anonymous person to gain insider information on the scandal. This journalistic anonymous source was named &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent known as Mark Felt. According to David Von Drehle of the Washington Post, &quot;As the bureau’s second- and third-ranking official during a period when the FBI was battling for its independence against the administration of President Richard M. Nixon, Felt had the means and the motive to help uncover the web of internal spies, secret surveillance, dirty tricks and cover-ups that led to Nixon’s unprecedented resignation on Aug. 9, 1974, and to prison sentences for some of Nixon’s highest-ranking aides.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Von Drehle, David. &quot;FBI’s No. 2 Was ‘Deep Throat’: Mark Felt Ends 30-Year Mystery of The Post’s Watergate Source.&quot; Washington Post. The Washington Post, 06 June 2012. Web. 20 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, anonymous sources have become more widely used by journalists today they help aid in their investigations. It took Mark Felt thirty years to acknowledge that he is in fact, the journalistic &quot;Deep Throat&quot; of the Watergate scandal. Insider information is valuable in changing opinion because it beings more information to the people that may influence their views.

===Conclusion===
Throughout history, the Watergate scandal has left its mark on the government, as well as investigative journalism. Through Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's hard work and dedication, they proved that no crime goes unpunished, even if the person at fault held the highest position in the land. Nixon thought he could get away with it, all in the goal of winning the presidential election. However, through strategies such as anonymous informants and the &quot;fourth estate&quot;, the truth eventually prevailed. Investigative journalism led to the people being able to make informative decisions on their own when they are presented with the truth, reaffirming once again that knowledge is power. With knowledge being used as power, if enough people educate themselves, change can happen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter Three: The Impact of Technology in the Public Sphere==

Print technology increasingly plays a central role in the mediation of social networks. Any socially grounded theory of the public sphere will have to take into account these social network structures and the communications systems that bind them.

Habermas discusses how the “public sphere” emerged in bourgeois society in the 18th century. He sees the public sphere as a kind of mediator between society and state, between public and private interests, through which the public can categorize its opinion. Therefore, the public sphere is a forum in which people are “unrestricted” in what they say and are guaranteed freedom of expression in all of its forms. The new public sphere permitted people (for the first time) to shape public opinion. The public could make their private concerns known through several means, but print became extremely imperative. During the periods of the American and French revolutions, Habermas observed that people were fast to gather and grab newspapers as political tools. Upon allocation, the more private publications showed an unbelievably loud voice of the public in response to the state publications. Karl Bucher describes the situation that unfolded as an outcome of the changing press, “Newspapers changed from mere institutions for the publication of news into bearers and leaders of public opinion – weapons of party politics. This transformed the newspaper business. A new element emerged between the gathering and publication of news: the editorial staff. But for the newspaper publisher it meant that he changed from vendor recent news to a dealer in public opinion.” 

The state of newspapers described by Bucher seems ideal, because it is a forum that is open to and certainly created by the joint voices of the public. Yet, this state of journalism was brief. “Although the liberal model of the public sphere is still instructive today with respect to the normative claim that information be accessible to the public, it cannot be applied to the actual conditions of an industrially advanced mass democracy organized in the form of the social welfare state.” Habermas continues with, “Because of the diffusion of press and propaganda,” the public sphere lost its voice. Groups of people have had to alter their voice and their stances in order to obtain any voice at all in the media. If their plan doesn’t please the political authorities (which are closely connected to media supervisors), then it’s just not fit to print.

==Developmental Milestones in Print Technology and how they relate to the Development of the Public Sphere==

The creation of the Printing Press is observed as the formal beginnings of mass media.  Often referred to as the bridging of “The Great Divide,” its creation in 1440 by Johannes Gutenberg opened up the possibilities of a public sphere in a way that never before existed.  With increasingly fasted creation and distribution of ideas and information, the public not only had an increase in material, but also an incentive to become literate, and the public sphere owes its existence to a literate population.

Jurgen Habermas, leading scholor on the emergence of the public sphere explains that the development of the press allows the public to become more active and critical, to more easily express its acceptance or rejection of policies and laws.  This process came about in three main stages:

* Stage 1- The press first supported the needs of large merchants and traders, protecting their economic interests.
* Stage 2- Later, the press became responsible for informing the public of policies and laws, and was used by the public authority to communicate with the general population.
* Stage 3- Finally, the press became a voice that allows the public to communicate its concerns with the state.  This development allows for discourse between parties.  The initial forms for this communication were (and continue to be) newspapers, gazettes, and pamphlets which resulted in social interaction, connections, the formation of opinions, and reflection.

Following the progression of the above stages, the first newspapers were more closely related to today’s catalogues, than to contemporary newspapers.  They were used to advertise products, and simple announcements.  The continuing decades would see the emergence of local news, and then national and world news. 

The emergence of magazines as a part of the public sphere grew to target several audiences.  General audiences were targeted for news regarding entertainment, special interests, news, and shopping.  Specialized audiences were reached through journals, serving a particular, targeted audience who shared a specific field of interest, occupation, or political affiliation.
In the era of the printing press, before the invention of more advanced media via radio and television, idea were processed in a linear fashion.  Of utmost importance was the standardization of the written word.  Therefore, uniformity was dictated by the creation of dictionaries, thesauri, and grammar books which popularized standard spelling, punctuation, and abbreviations.

The extent of the written word contributed to its linearity, with a plot and natural progression, and a continuality of ideas.

Among the many developmental milestones in the creation of the developing newspaper and magazine is the decade of the 1930’s, which prided itself on representing life as it really was lived, with faults, and recreation.  Also popular of the time was the explosion of “how to” articles, greater informing the public on standard living.  This idea continues today as greater variety emerged in the following centuries with the creation of the confessions magazine and a greater focus on sex and politics for entertainment’s sake.  A more detailed progression of magazine journalism follows below:

==The Impact of Developments in Print Technology on Journalism==

Today, magazines, in their secular context tend to report on current events, trends, issues, and prominent people in society and around the world.  However, the progression up to this point is complicated and full of its own trends. 
After the invention of the printing press, the first newspapers followed in the years 1605-1690.  A half century later, the public demand rose, and their prominence in the public sphere has not lost its weight.

The beginning of the 1700’s was paired with an increased interest in the arts, as a higher class grew in America.  Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Bradford were the editors and creators of the first prominent magazines in their areas of the country.  Although most of the population was occupied with work and could not give their attention to the emerging science, medical, and agricultural magazines being published, their popularity exploded in what is known as the Golden Age of Magazines, when it became profitable to write.  10 cent magazines of the 1890’s emerged, well illustrated, colored, and supported by a rise in advertising.  The less educated middle class became a targeted audience, as the idea of self-improvement raged, and national events gave way to Muckraking.  McClure’s magazine from 1903-1912 employed writers Ida Tarbell and Lincoln Steffins, among others, and magazines became the national media voice of the time.  The magazine became the weapon of political struggle as corruption was reported for the public, and investigative journalism began.  

As the Muckrakers completed their purpose, and the American public felt that the issues were addressed politically through Progressivism and the election of Wilson, magazines went back to publishing personal interest stories, fiction, and romance.  However, the Muckrickers had set the stage for a continuing tradition of radicalism in the public sphere, and made an easy transition to new forms of journalism.  Magazines became the carriers of mass popular culture, although today’s special interest journals have taken on the radical nature of radical journalism, while popular magazines today are the carriers of mass popular culture.  

==Digital Technologies==

===The Impact of digital technology on the public sphere===

We have thus far seen the impact of technology on print media as well as radio and television media.  The changes seen in these fields are followed in the realm of digital media, which is used to define a &quot;system is one that uses discrete numbers, especially binary numbers, for input, processing, transmission, storage, or display, rather than a continuous spectrum of values (an analog system) or non-numeric symbols such as letters or icons,&quot; according to Wikipedia.com.  The prevalence of digital technologies has become greater and greater over time; the origin of this movement lies in the digital revolution of the last half of the 20th century.

===Digital Revolution===

The impact of digital technology on the public sphere first became palpable towards the latter half of the 20th century.  At the revolutions' center was the rapid drop in costs and improvement in digital devices such as the computer.  This facilitated the development of devices that were previously unthinkable, such as the World Wide Web (WWW, or Internet).  The WWW now is a central characteristic of the contemporary public sphere.  Indeed, one of the greatest benefits of the WWW has been the ease with which people can gain access to information.  As many writers studied in class would say, the public sphere is built on information and information accessibility.

Digital technologies stemming from the digital revolution have also raised concerns.  One such concern is that digital code is very easy to create and very difficult to get rid of.  Thus, the potential to pirate information is improved and increased.  From a historical perspective, digital technology enables the manipulation of data not possible in previous times (for example, the U.S. Constitution was not written on a Dell laptop in Microsoft Word to be edited, but rather on paper where its effect would be permanent).

===The impact of digital technology on journalism===

In specific regard to the impact on journalism that digital technology has had, it is accurate to say that many fields -- journalism not being a exception -- have been affected by the digital revolution.  The field of journalism and the duration of the news cycle have been most seriously affected.  Digital technology has allowed for instant transmission of news from across the globe.  Additionally, the same benefits and concerns expressed over the digital revolution parlay into the journalism field.  In a rush to be first to present news or information, important facts and details can be left out, misrepresented, or simply be false.  

McLuhan would argue that this allows for a corporatization of the media to the end that news business can be &quot;make-or-break&quot; by being the first to break a particular story.  Digital technology provides news media with an avenue to do their jobs better, and this technology is used to make their business more profitable.

However, big news media are not the only entities that profit.  Many argue that bloggers and investigative websites stand to benefit the most from digital technology due to resources that the WWW and other digital technologies provide.  Bloggers, who lack &quot;journalisitic integrity&quot;, deserve mention because they have an impact on the journalism field.  The Dan Rather/George Bush incident and TheSmokingGun.com/James Frey revelation reveal the effect that bloggers and investigative websites can have on the public sphere.

==Conclusions==

While a basic snapshot of the impact of digital technologies on the public sphere and on journalism in particular, it is clear that the future will hold more of the same as the beginning of the 21st century.  Technologies will continue to develop that enable information sharing and access while also exposing questions in the factual basis of what we read.  The authors we have read point out these integrity issues and highlight developments in the digital world that have forever changed our concept of the public sphere.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The News as Spectacle==
McLuhan and Compton provide the most interesting evidence about the development of the media and its drastic effect on the public sphere.  McLuhan explores the inherent value of technology and how new technologies continuously effect the pace of human function, and therefore changes human function  itself.  In class, we discussed the example of the microwave.  According to McLuhan’s understanding of the media, the microwave can be considered an extension of us.  As a technology, the microwave changes the pace of cooking and the patterns of cooking; therefore, the patterns of eating and the scale of cooking are also changed.  This view of technology has changed the way I view the new inventions that emerging everyday.  New cell phone technology, internet technology, and technology in household appliances are changing the pace of our lives and the way in which younger generations are learning and learning how to communicate.  The question remains: will these fast paced changes in technology lead to conflicts among generations as time moves on?

As time moves on, technology remains a constant factor in our lives.  However, the presence of the media is also becoming one of the most influential factors on the public sphere.  Compton discusses the effects of the media in his book The Integrated News Spectacle: A Political Economy of Cultural Performance.  Compton investigates the media’s control over news and the way in which it is presented to us through the public sphere.  The manipulation of factual information shapes the way in which society receives this information and the way we then shape our opinions about the world.  In Chapter 2 of The Integrated News Spectacle, Compton discusses the “promotional fulcrum”, promotion to increase public interest in the reported events.  Compton uses the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal as an example: “the scandal was a story that was rationally constructed and administered by individuals and organizations concerned with promoting their own interests and who did so by using the logic of promotion-the wheels of the media machine are greased by creating a commodity-sign that can be used as a site of promotion for disparate interests, whether they be personal, political, or commercial” (Compton 50).  Although the scandal was a serious and historical event in Clinton’s presidency, the event transpired into a career launcher and publicity stunt for Monica Lewinsky.  She became the center point for the story’s public appeal, making appearances on television shows and becoming famous for her blue dress.  Her involvement in the presidential scandal led to a rise in fame and an increase in popularity within the entertainment industry.  In actuality, the story between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky was not actually about sex, “but about the honesty and integrity of the president” (Compton 49).  However, the media’s manipulation of the story forced the coverage into the realm of Lewinsky’s story and the sex appeal of the entire incident.

Compton also discusses the area of “spectacular storytelling” and “flexible production”.  These terms mean that the stories are flexible enough to provide full time coverage and the importance of these full coverage stories are integral to the success of the media.  Spectcular stories provide the material for 24-hour news stations such as, MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News.  The media manipulates these news stories by incorporating popular culture into what the audience sees and understands.  Compton provides three main reasons why spectacular stories are essential to journalism: transposibility, efficiency, and anchors for broader strategies of capital accumulation.  Transposibility refers to the spectacular stories flowing easily within the news format because these stories usually contain related themes and events.  For example, “the tragic loss of a mother, the plight of a terrorized young boy, and the infidelity of a husband resonate easily and powerfully across cultural, class, and demographic boundaries”(Compton 54).  Efficiency then refers to the different possibilities in coverage, news specials, and publicity that each story offers.  These spectacular stories are also easy to use within different forms of media and presentation.  Finally, these spectacular stories act as anchors for broader strategies of capital accumulation because they are able to “repurpose” the information.  The regeneration of information presents prime subjects for 24-hour news coverage.  A recent example of this media manipulation is the Natalee Holloway disappearance.  When the teenager disappeared from Aruba last May, the media coverage immediately took off.  Networks such as CNN and MSNBC featured hours and hours of continuous coverage on the “story” when in reality, there was no progression in the case.  However, headlines, interviews with experts on kidnapping, and stories of Natalee Holloway’s life provided more than enough material for continuous coverage of the disappearance.  Soon, the coverage was manipulated into a manhunt and the search for those responsible for the disappearance.  Because the story was made so spectacular, the focus began to switch to several topics stemming from the disappearance, and the media was able to manipulate the story to cover hours of on-air time.

The effects of this type of media manipulation are present everyday.  Our attention to celebrities and our news presentation are just minor examples of the effects that technology will have on our ability to receive “real news”.  Compton and McLuhan both provide interesting interpretations of these progressions in technology.

''Censored 2006'' by Project Censored is a valuable resource to consult when studying the corporatization of mass media.  Two specific chapters of relevance include chapter five, titled &quot;Junk Food News and News Abuse&quot; and chapter six, titled &quot;Corporate Media is Corporate America.&quot;  “Junk Food News and News Abuse” presents the top ten “over-reported, empty-calorie news stories&quot; from 2005.  Instead of discussing news stories being reported incorrectly, this chapter focuses on frivolous stories about celebrities taking the forefront in news.  The authors discuss the change in television and radio moving from education to entertainment, and the shift from providing a service to being obsessed with ratings.  Television and radio were originally intended to “keep people informed of politics and events that affect their lives.&quot;  The authors attribute this shift to people “hiding from the real and inescapable issues that can only get worse.”  They also think that the acceptance of the current media coverage is due to “our expectation of news [having been] reconstructed by the media to advance ratings and corporate profits.”  The chapter goes on to critique the news coverage of the top ten “Junk Food News stories of the year.”  Following this section is a critique of various forms of News Abuse that occurred in mainstream reporting in 2004 and 2005.  Chapter six, titled &quot;Corporate Media is Corporate America,&quot; has listings of &quot;big media interlocks with corporate america and broadcast news media ownership empires.&quot;  ''Censored 2006'' is Project Censored's newest publication, but even more up-to-date information is continually posted on their website at www.projectcensored.org.

      <comment>/* Using the Python/C API */ Rough explanation and its need of apt-get and alternative way for openSUSE</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|HTTP Tools|Extending with C++}}

This gives a minimal Example on how to Extend Python with C. Linux is used for building (feel free to extend it for other Platforms). If you have any problems, please report them (e.g. on the dicussion page), I will check back in a while and try to sort them out.

==Using the Python/C API==
On an Ubuntu system, you might need to run
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev
&lt;/source&gt;
This command installs you the python developement package and ensures that you can use the line &lt;code&gt;#include &lt;Python.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the C source code. On other systems like openSUSE the needed package calls &lt;code&gt;python-devel&lt;/code&gt; and can be installed by using &lt;code&gt;zypper&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ sudo zypper install python-devel
&lt;/source&gt;

* https://docs.python.org/2/extending/index.html
* https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/index.html

===A minimal example===
The minimal example we will create now is very similar in behaviour to the following python snippet:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 def say_hello(name):
     &quot;Greet somebody.&quot;
     print &quot;Hello %s!&quot; % name
&lt;/source&gt;
====The C source code (&lt;tt&gt;hellomodule.c&lt;/tt&gt;)====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

static PyObject*
say_hello(PyObject* self, PyObject* args)
{
    const char* name;

    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, &quot;s&quot;, &amp;name))
        return NULL;

    printf(&quot;Hello %s!\n&quot;, name);

    Py_RETURN_NONE;
}

static PyMethodDef HelloMethods[] =
{
     {&quot;say_hello&quot;, say_hello, METH_VARARGS, &quot;Greet somebody.&quot;},
     {NULL, NULL, 0, NULL}
};

PyMODINIT_FUNC
inithello(void)
{
     (void) Py_InitModule(&quot;hello&quot;, HelloMethods);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Building the extension module with GCC for Linux====
To build our extension module we create the file &lt;tt&gt;setup.py&lt;/tt&gt; like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from distutils.core import setup, Extension

module1 = Extension('hello', sources = ['hellomodule.c'])

setup (name = 'PackageName',
        version = '1.0',
        description = 'This is a demo package',
        ext_modules = [module1])
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can build our module with
 python setup.py build

The module &lt;tt&gt;hello.so&lt;/tt&gt; will end up in &lt;tt&gt;build/lib.linux-i686-''x''.''y''&lt;/tt&gt;.

====Building the extension module with GCC for Microsoft Windows====

Microsoft Windows users can use [[w:MinGW|MinGW]] to compile this from &lt;tt&gt;[[w:cmd.exe|cmd.exe]]&lt;/tt&gt; using a similar method to Linux user, as shown above. Assuming &lt;tt&gt;gcc&lt;/tt&gt; is in the &lt;tt&gt;PATH&lt;/tt&gt; environment variable, type:
 python setup.py build -cmingw32

The module &lt;tt&gt;hello.pyd&lt;/tt&gt; will end up in &lt;tt&gt;build\lib.win32-''x''.''y''&lt;/tt&gt;, which is a Python Dynamic Module (similar to a &lt;tt&gt;DLL&lt;/tt&gt;).

An alternate way of building the module in Windows is to build a DLL. (This method does not need an extension module file). From &lt;tt&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/tt&gt;, type:
 gcc -c  hellomodule.c -I/Python''XY''/include
 gcc -shared hellomodule.o -L/Python''XY''/libs -lpython''XY'' -o hello.dll
where ''XY'' represents the version of Python, such as &quot;24&quot; for version 2.4.

====Building the extension module using Microsoft Visual C++====
With VC8 distutils is broken. We will use cl.exe from a command prompt instead:

 cl /LD hellomodule.c /Ic:\Python24\include c:\Python24\libs\python24.lib /link/out:hello.dll

====Using the extension module====
Change to the subdirectory where the file `hello.so` resides. In an interactive python session you can use the module as follows.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import hello
 &gt;&gt;&gt; hello.say_hello(&quot;World&quot;)
 Hello World!

===A module for calculating fibonacci numbers===
====The C source code (fibmodule.c)====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

int
_fib(int n)
{
    if (n &lt; 2)
        return n;
    else
        return _fib(n-1) + _fib(n-2);
}

static PyObject*
fib(PyObject* self, PyObject* args)
{
    int n;

    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, &quot;i&quot;, &amp;n))
        return NULL;

    return Py_BuildValue(&quot;i&quot;, _fib(n));
}

static PyMethodDef FibMethods[] = {
    {&quot;fib&quot;, fib, METH_VARARGS, &quot;Calculate the Fibonacci numbers.&quot;},
    {NULL, NULL, 0, NULL}
};

PyMODINIT_FUNC
initfib(void)
{
    (void) Py_InitModule(&quot;fib&quot;, FibMethods);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====The build script (setup.py)====
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from distutils.core import setup, Extension

module1 = Extension('fib', sources = ['fibmodule.c'])

setup (name = 'PackageName',
        version = '1.0',
        description = 'This is a demo package',
        ext_modules = [module1])
&lt;/source&gt;

====How to use it?====
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import fib
 &gt;&gt;&gt; fib.fib(10)
 55

==Using SWIG==
Creating the previous example using SWIG is much more straight forward.
To follow this path you need to get [http://www.swig.org/ SWIG] up and running first. 
To install it on an Ubuntu system, you might need to run the following commands
 $ sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev 
 $ sudo apt-get install python-dev
After that create two files.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/*hellomodule.c*/

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void say_hello(const char* name) {
    printf(&quot;Hello %s!\n&quot;, name);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/*hello.i*/

%module hello
extern void say_hello(const char* name);
&lt;/source&gt;

Now comes the more difficult part, gluing it all together.

First we need to let SWIG do its work.
 swig -python hello.i

This gives us the files `hello.py` and `hello_wrap.c`.

The next step is compiling (substitute /usr/include/python2.4/ with the correct path for your setup!).
 gcc -fpic -c hellomodule.c hello_wrap.c -I/usr/include/python2.4/

Now linking and we are done!
 gcc -shared hellomodule.o hello_wrap.o -o _hello.so

The module is used in the following way.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import hello
 &gt;&gt;&gt; hello.say_hello(&quot;World&quot;)
 Hello World!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note:  In mathematics, there is no field called &quot;Residue Theory&quot;. There is only a &quot;Calculus of Residues&quot;, belonging to the field of &quot;Complex Analysis&quot;.

Residue Theory is fairly short, with only a few methods; and is basically a glorified way of saying, &quot;Finding the coefficients when expanding fractions.&quot;  Although this small subject blossoms into other areas of mathematics, particularly in simplifying integrals, and in analyzing singularities in limits, the real-number system, or the complex number system.

Knowing the following ideas is more-or-less required:

*Power/Taylor/Laurent Series
*Limits/Derivatives/Integrals

And for the more advanced techniques in sections 3 and 4:

*Complex Number Algebra
*Line Integrals in the complex plane
*Cauchy's Integral Formula

{{cquote|The people can have anything they want. The trouble is, they do not want anything. At least they vote that way on election day.|20px|20px|Eugene V. Debs}}
==No Incumbent==

As a result of the 22nd Amendment to the constitution, George W. Bush is ineligible to run for a third term as President. Also, Vice-President Dick Cheney has announced that he has no intention of seeking the presidency in 2008. Thus, for the first time since 1928, there is no one who is incumbent from either major party running in the presidential election. The public campaign began quite early, with a wide field of candidates jockeying for position for the primaries during 2007, while the Democratic and Republican parties pressured various states to move up the dates of their primary elections, due to the fact of the very early Iowa primary on January 3, 2008.

==Primary Season==
===Republican Primary===
Several candidates entered the field in hopes of gaining the Republican Party's nomination for President. Early favorites included New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson. Other candidates, including former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, U.S. Representative Ron Paul of Texas, Arizona Senator John McCain, and U.S. Representative Duncan Hunter of California, received less media attention during the early stages of the race.

The symbolic Iowa caucus resulted in a victory for Governor Huckabee, polling 30% and winning in most Iowa counties. Romney polled a close second, while Senators McCain and Thompson tied for a distant third. In the New Hampshire primary five days later, McCain pulled an upset over Giuliani and Romney, who had until just before the election been favored to poll higher in the contest. Giuliani found that many of his would-be supporters had defected to the McCain camp, forcing him into a disappointing fourth place in New Hampshire. After losing the Florida primary (on which he staked his campaign) to McCain, Giuliani dropped out of the race and endorsed McCain.

As the contenders withdrew their candidacies one by one, the race came down between an increasingly-popular John McCain, Mitt Romney, and a persistent Mike Huckabee. Ron Paul remained in the race until June, but ceased to receive a comparable amount of media attention. Senator McCain eventually edged out all competition, securing enough delegates for the nomination on March 4.

====John McCain====
[[Image:John McCain official portrait with alternative background.jpg|thumb|Arizona Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee.]]
John Sidney McCain III (born August 29, 1936) is the senior United States Senator from Arizona, and a candidate for the Republican Party nomination in the 2008 presidential election. Both McCain's grandfather and his father were Admirals in the United States Navy. McCain graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1958, becoming a naval aviator, flying attack aircraft from carriers during the Vietnam War. On his twenty-third bombing mission over North Vietnam later in 1967, he was shot down and badly injured. He then endured five and a half years as a prisoner of war, including periods of torture, before he was released following the Paris Peace Accords in 1973.

Retiring from the Navy in 1981 and moving to Arizona, McCain entered politics. In 1982 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona's 1st congressional district. After serving two terms, he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986. He was re-elected in 1992, 1998, and 2004. While generally adhering to American conservatism, McCain established a reputation as a political maverick for his willingness to defy Republican orthodoxy on several issues. Surviving the Keating Five scandal of the 1980s, he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns, which eventually led to the passing of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002.
=====Sarah Palin=====
[[Image:McCainPalin1.jpg|thumb]]
Sarah Louise Heath Palin is the current Governor of Alaska and the 2008 Republican candidate for Vice President of the United States. She became the first female Vice Presidential candidate representing the Republican Party and the second female Vice Presidential candidate representing a major political party.

Palin was born in Idaho and raised in Alaska. In 1984, she was the runner-up in the Miss Alaska pageant, receiving a scholarship that allowed her to attend the University of Idaho, where she received a degree in journalism. After working as a sports reporter at an Anchorage television station, Palin served two terms on the Wasilla, Alaska, City Council from 1992 to 1996, was elected mayor of Wasilla (population 5,470 in 2000) in 1996, and ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor in 2002.

Palin was elected Governor of Alaska in 2006 on the theme of governmental reform, defeating incumbent governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary and former Democratic Alaskan governor Tony Knowles in the general election. She gained attention for publicizing ethical violations by state Republican Party leaders.


====&quot;Not My Princess&quot;====
On the 28th of October, 2008, McCain proclaimed, &quot;There are many who claim that I cannot lead, and that Sarah Palin is my princess. Well, friends, today I have come to tell you that I can lead, and that Sarah Palin is not my princess!&quot;

===Democratic Primary===
With an unpopular Republican in the White House, many Democrats were eager to pursue the presidency. Early front-runners included New York Senator Hillary Clinton, former North Carolina Senator John Edwards, and Illinois Senator Barack Obama. Others such as Delaware Senator Joe Biden, Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd, U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel, and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson also pursued the nomination.

The Democratic Primary featured much more controversy and complexity than that of the Republicans. The Democratic Convention features unelected &quot;superdelegates,&quot; who are party officials who may cast their vote for the candidate of their choice. In the early stages of the race, Senator Clinton held an overwhelming lead among superdelegates, while Senator Obama led the popular vote. This disparity, and the possibility that unelected officials could decide the outcome of the nomination was a point of contention among Democrats.

Additionally, the Democratic National Committee penalized the states of Michigan and Florida for changing their primary dates to be ahead of schedule. The DNC decided that the delegates from these states would not be seated at the Convention, effectively nullifying the votes of these states. Senator Clinton (who coincidentally won both states' vote) was a constant proponent of reversing this decision and allowing the delegates to be seated. Eventually a compromise was reached, and all of each states' delegates were allowed to vote, but they were only allowed half a vote each.

As the primary season wore on, the difference between the delegate count of Senators Obama and Clinton changed little. As other candidates dropped out and endorsed one of the two, it became clear that this primary would be a historic one- whether it be the first nomination of an African-American or a woman by a major party for the office of President of the United States. In the end, Senator Obama garnered enough delegates to secure the historic nomination, and he chose Senator Biden to be his running mate.
====Joe Biden====
Joe Biden has represented the state of Delaware in the United States Senate since 1972, when he was elected at the age of twenty-nine. Senator Biden is recognized as a leader in foreign policy, as well as one of the nation's most influential voices on terrorism, drug policy, and crime. Nationally, Senator Biden has earned a reputation for working on a bipartisan basis with Republican colleagues and bringing real results that matter to Americans.

Throughout Senator Biden's career in public service, the people of Delaware have remained his first priority. From preserving White Clay Creek and miles of Delaware's coastline, to putting hundreds more cops on the state's streets, to fighting to cover healthcare costs for all of Delaware's children, Senator Biden is working to improve the lives of Delawareans.

==Election Controversy==
The issues of caging lists and other techniques of voter suppression which gave rise to many 2004 United States election voting controversies have not been addressed by further legislation or a regulatory crackdown, and are predicted by Greg Palast (a reporter who has investigated these controversies) to recur to the extent that they could swing the result.

Voter list purges using unlawful criteria threaten election integrity in at least six swing states: Colorado, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina.

On October 5, 2008 the Republican Lt. Governor of Montana, John Bohlinger, accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge 6,000 voters from three counties which trend Democratic. These purges included decorated war veterans and active duty soldiers.

An allegation that the Republican Party in Michigan plans to challenge the eligibility of voters based on lists of foreclosed homes has led to a lawsuit from the Obama campaign and a letter from the House Judiciary Committee to the Department of Justice calling for an investigation.

Libertarian candidate Bob Barr filed a lawsuit in Texas petitioning to have Obama and McCain removed from the ballot in that state. The suit alleged that both the Republicans and Democrats missed the deadline to file, and were present on the ballot contrary to Texas election law. The Texas Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit without giving an explanation.
===[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_FcH_stLgvzo/SRBnoBxlzuI/AAAAAAAAAKA/rCpaIZ2Plk0/s1600-h/Obama+voting.jpg Underage Voters]===
One could see from the newscasts that some of the voters going to the polls were clearly underage. Nickeloden kids poll that finished with Obama 51% and McCain 49% with something like 2.2 million presumably child voters. So far 1,492 fraudulent voter registrations have been identified, some from dead and others for underage voters who were not aware they had been registered by ACORN. The Wall Street Journal noted:“In Ohio in 2004, a worker for one affiliate was given crack cocaine in exchange for fraudulent registrations that included underage voters, dead voters and pillars of the community named Mary Poppins, Dick Tracy and Jive Turkey. During a congressional hearing in Ohio in the aftermath of the 2004 election, officials from several counties in the state explained ACORN’s practice of dumping thousands of registration forms in their lap on the submission deadline, even though the forms had been collected months earlier.”
{{Commonscat|United States presidential election, 2008}}

==Obama wins==
On November 4, with 364 Electoral votes, Obama won the White House.

Barack Obama did more than thump John McCain in the Electoral College tally; he also handily won the popular vote and redrew the great divide between red states and blue states.

Riding a Democratic tide that bolstered the party's presence in both houses of Congress, Obama snared about 63 million votes to McCain's 55.8 million, according to early totals.

According to exit polls, Obama crushed McCain among women voters (56 percent to 43 percent); voters under 30 (66 percent to 32 percent); African-American voters (95 percent to 4 percent); Latino voters (66 percent to 32 percent); first-time voters (68 percent to 31 percent); and voters making less than $100,000 a year (55 percent to 43 percent).

&quot;I think this is the passing of an old order,&quot; CNN senior political analyst David Gergen said as the results rolled in Tuesday night and the outcome became increasingly evident.

&quot;I think what we see ... is a new coalition, a new order emerging. It isn't quite there, but with Barack Obama, for the first time, it's won. It is the Latino vote we just heard about. It is the bigger black vote that came out. Very importantly, it's the youth vote, the 18-to-29-year-old,&quot; said the Harvard University professor and former presidential adviser.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[US History/Contents/2008 Vote]] ==

I see in [[US History/Contents/2008 Vote]] you listed a bunch of potential candidates who might run in the 2008 presidential election.  My guess is that Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania has 2008 aspirations.  My guess is that his chances are not good (fortunately, given my political views), but that he's at least as likely to try as some of the others you've mentioned.  Also, you might create links to Wikipedia pages for these characters.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JMRyan|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/JMRyan|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:51, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

Subjects such as [[US History:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] and E3 are not notable enough to be included in a survey course of US history. You should not just copy encyclopedic entries from Wikipedia, but write a ''textbook'' on US history. Things like the  Internet, which had a great cultural and societal impact, and the Space Race, which had important political ramifications would gladly be accepted. --[[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 14:34, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is with the excessive single quotes/apostraphes in the code examples where they are not needed? This for example:

&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;'''your_database_host'''&quot;, &quot;'''your_user_name'''&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Does not need to have so much, why not stick with &quot;your_db_host&quot; as the example? It's also inconsistant as some places have 2 single quotes and others have 3.

I suggest someone clean this up.

It seems that the whole page up to the 'putting it all together' section uses mysqli_* functions, whilst everything after it uses mysql_* functions. Is it supposed to be this way? --[[User:W-dueck|W-dueck]] ([[User talk:W-dueck|talk]]) 22:19, 21 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Soups|Soups]]

'''Mexican Tomato Soup''' - a very simple dish, can be made hot if wanted. Very nutritious for a soup too.

==Ingredients==
* About 1/2 litre tomato sauce/purée or similar. Pure is good - don't use ketchup, or only very good ketchup. I used bio purée.
* 2 large onions or equivalent
* 2 red peppers
* 2 tomatoes
* Some greens. Onion greens work, leek does as well.
* 1 can of sweet corn
* 1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable/olive oil, salt, sugar
* More vegetables according to your taste

==Procedure==
#Cut onion fine and fry lightly in a large sauce pan with a bit of oil.
#Add vegetables, roughly in the order you find logical (ie, tomatoes don't take long, peppers can be there from the start).
#Add salt, about 1/2 teaspoon, and add if the taste doesn't feel right. The salt will extract water from the vegetables and make them 'stew' faster. You can cover the pot if it goes slowly - once again, this slows the evaporation and allows the vegetables to cook in the water they lose themselves.
#Add tomato sauce and corn.
#Add salt, sugar to taste. Be bold, tomato sauce takes a '''lot''' of salt and at least a heaping teaspoon of sugar to taste right. If unsure, separate a small amount and try adding more salt - you will see the tastes changes significantly.
#Serve with tortilla chips, or toasted bread if not available.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Everyone reasons. Humans are reasoning animals, if not always ''reasonable''. Further, we ''homo sapiens'' are unique in that we reason with words and symbols that make thoughts and ideas that lead to anticipation, imagination, and the very making of human history. 

To reason is to use evidence and thought to come to some conclusion. Reasoning can be done alone or in groups, but most effectively, working in groups but reflecting in private. 

Unfortunately, merely being human does not provide any assurance that any of us that we will reason effectively. Reasoning does not have to produce particularly useful results, however productive reasoning is an art that requires some technical skill. Just as graphic artists have to learn about draftsmanship paint and brushwork to make paintings, so too do thinkers need some understanding of logic, language and reliable projection if they are to become leaders and help make history. 

We hope to present here information that will allow almost anyone to develop both the skill and the knowledge to reason effectively, to imagine new worlds and to get things done: Somewhere between ''paralysis via analysis'' and ''activity instead of progress'' 

Particularly, this Wikibook discusses informal reasoning, which includes some formal methods and some traditional approaches together with more recent philosophical and neurological understanding of effective reasoning techniques. For a complete study, take a look  also at the related reference works mentioned as well as associated Wikibooks such as [[Introduction to Moral Reasoning]] and [[Formal Logic]].

Although I've gone through a lot of course work in this area and engaged in many debates (both formal and informal) I am still in the learning process, so I hope to teach and be taught.

I also plan to generate an argument (with participant knowledge and permission) to use as an example in the procedings).

== [[Algebra]] ==

I was trying to do a large rewrite of the algebra books, and I went so far as to create an outline for the books [[User:Whiteknight/Algebra|HERE on my user page]]. Because of school and work (I work at school, ironically), I have very little time leftover to single-handedly manage a project that large. If you want to help with this, it would be great! A few other users have expressed some interest in making this happen, maybe we can all work together. post your two cents on my outline, so we are all on the same page, and then we can start work ASAP!. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:54, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chemistry as a science has benefited greatly from the development of physics. Physics has provided to chemistry many direct observations of ideas that were only previously theorized. For example, Avogadro's number was directly calculated by the observation of the decay of radioactive elements. The understanding of the fundamental reasons for the structure of the periodic table were understood with the development of quantum mechanics. Linus Pauling's seminal work ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond'' solved complex chemical bonds using quantum mechanics.  Many of the powerful tools that chemistry uses to probe the nature of matter rely on the application of physics principles. The richness of chemistry can only be appreciated as one comes to understand the foundations that it inherited from physics and the power these ideas have in pushing chemistry forward as it tries to solve problem in both the physical and biological worlds.

Since chemistry and physics have some many things in common the skills and techniques that are learned in the study of each discipline compliment each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Using Laptops for Education ==

Integrating technology into education can be daunting. However, schools and school around the world are exploring the benefits and challenges of what happens when every student has a laptop computer. So far, there have been a number of programmes around the world that have looked at the use of laptops in education. There are variations in how these laptop programmes are designed, funded, and implemented, but the basic structure of a laptop programme is that each student has a laptop to use, and with the falling prices of laptops, more and more schools and colleges are considering initiating laptop programs. 

If we look at the results from such existing programmes, a number of research groups have been studying the use of laptops in education and the conclusions are clear. According to the paper “A more complex picture: Laptop use and impact in the context of changing home and school access” (Rockman et al. 2000). There is a consistent and substantive impact on teaching and learning, and that computers are powerful interventions for both students and teachers, providing that they are implemented and used correctly. 
A study closer to home also showed that in pilot studies, lower-achieving children's national curriculum test scores rose half a grade in one term, which was attributed to students being inspired to learn by having the technology available at home as well as at school. (BBC News, March 2006)


The introduction of laptops for all students is a considerable change in the average classroom. In a laptop classroom, there is less lecturing and more individual and group project work. Teachers no longer have to provide all the information as students can gather much of what is needed from the Internet, they can work on their own more, or work in small groups to undertake projects. Students can do more work on their own and at their own pace, and the teachers can act more as consultants to them, offering individualized suggestions, mid-course corrections, and more frequent assessments of individual and group progress. 


In a laptop classroom, there is much more independent learning since students now have access to powerful tools for accomplishing it. As independent learners, they also have to take on more responsibility for their learning, by working independently they have to monitor their own progress, identify the tools and resources they need to use, and know when to seek help.   Developing the ability to learn independently, collaborate with peers to accomplish work, and communicate the conclusions of your work are the core of 21st-century skills, and a highly valued set of competencies in the world outside of school.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== User Preferences ==
I found the description of how to access the User Preferences pane rather difficult to follow at first. I'll try and think of a better way of putting it. [[User:TimTim|TimTim]] 09:41, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

== Question about Window headers section (moved from inline comment to this discussion page) ==

''Each of the windows we have discussed so far has a &quot;header&quot; that can optionally be displayed at the top or bottom of its window, or hidden altogether.  The header area of the 3D Viewport, for example, shows the &quot;View&quot;, &quot;Select&quot;, and &quot;Object&quot; menus, as well as a variety of buttons and other controls.  '''RMB''' in the header area, and a popup menu will appear, allowing you to change the location where the header is drawn, or whether it is drawn at all.  As we have discussed, when Blender first starts up (using its default interface layout), the Blender screen is divided into 3 separate sections/windows: the 3D Viewport, User Preferences, and the Buttons Window.  The topmost is the &quot;User Preferences&quot; window with its header (showing the &quot;File&quot; menu, among other controls) at the bottom but the bulk of its area &quot;off screen&quot; above the header.  The 3D Viewport, on the other hand, has its header shown at the bottom.  The Buttons Window has its header at the top of its area, so that it is adjacent to that of the 3D Viewport.''

''If you turn off a header and later wish to make it reappear, '''RMB''' on the edge of the window in question and select &quot;Add Header&quot;.''

'''[Clarification requested: If you click the mouse on an edge shared by two windows. If neither has a header, which window is the header added to? (Similarly, if on an adjoining edge, and no header is chosen, which window is the header removed from?)]'''

''It is common for an edge to be shared by two windows.  To select a specific window first move the cursor to the one that is to be operated on.  No button is needed to be pressed at this time.  Next move the cursor to the edge of the window and press the RMB to select the operation.  Be careful not to allow the cursor to enter to far into the adjacent window.  If you need to cancel the operation, press ESC. (drafted by hkb)''

== Full-screen confusion. ==

As a total NooB, I first brought up this wikibook, and then installed and ran blender for the very first time. I'm a Linux user. Blender immediately ranm in full-screen mode, and there is no intuitive way to resize or minimize it to permit me to read the next step in the tutorial. This should be mentioned on this, the very first page that tempts a user to run blender for the first time. -[[Special:Contributions/68.110.230.28|68.110.230.28]] ([[User talk:68.110.230.28|talk]])
:  OK, I researched this and added a section. Will an experienced editor please review this? -[[Special:Contributions/68.110.230.28|68.110.230.28]] ([[User talk:68.110.230.28|talk]]) 00:00, 24 May 2008 (UTC)
::Done a major rewrite to avoid confusion between operating systems. Hope it helps.

== section: Before you begin ==

''You can use OS keyboard shortcuts to switch between applications: ALT+TAB (Linux&amp;Windows) CMD+TAB (Mac); or to bring your desktop: CTRL+ALT+D (Linux), CMD+D (Windows), F3/F11 (Mac), but they show non-productive in short term.''

This sentence is very poorly phrased, I'd suggest something like: You can use keyboard shortcuts for your operating system to switch between applications: .... or to return to your desktop / bring up your desktop ...

I'd probably scrap the last part of the sentence entirely. [[Special:Contributions/121.222.155.117|121.222.155.117]] ([[User talk:121.222.155.117|talk]]) 05:39, 24 September 2008 (UTC)

== Red and Blue Boxes in diagrams ==

For the most other sections on this page, the boxes are close enough, but on the image dealing with a red and blue box outlining the command lines, the boxes are showing up on my screen as being too big, and are overlapping by half.  The Red box surrounds both command lines, and the Blue surrounds part of the lower command line, and the button-box headers.

I knew it was a mistake (likely caused by my computer settings) when I saw it, and was able to determine what was happening by the text in the article section, but I figured I'd point out that the graphic should probably have the red and blue highlights incorporated into the graphic itself, instead of counting on everyone's browser displaying the overlay boxes the same way over the graphic over various platforms.

This computer is using IE-6 on Windows 2000, with the resolution set to 1280 by 1024 pixels, and Display font size set to &quot;Small Fonts.&quot; I know it's outdated, it's my secondary computer, allowing me to keep doing other stuff while my primary machine is busy rendering, or.. as in this case, I can read the website tutorials fullscreen in one montior, and run Blender fullscreen in the other monitor.

== Desktop Switching / Fullscreen issue ==
At least with Linux, there are as many ways to bring up windows or switch virtual desktops as there are desktop environment solutions, which are available in abundance. Switching between two adjacent virtual desktops would be an ideal way to go for this particular problem. For shortcuts to move between desktops, I like a CTRL+arrow keys kind of setup.

== Outdated ==

The info on this page is written for version 2.49 and older. The only reason I came here was because I need to figure out how to use the 2.5x windowing system. It's not a big deal when a technique oriented tutorial doesn't get updated, since technique is the same even if the tools are different. But something as simple and fundamental as how to manipulate windows ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE KEPT UP TO DATE.

== Buttons Window ? ==

I have the newest Version of Blender, and also just started using it. I'm confused about the step with the &quot;Buttons Window&quot; Menu. Was this menu replaced elsewhere, or am i just to blind to see it? Hope you can help me!

: No, you're not blind; the '''Buttons''' window simply doesn't exist in the 2.5* version, that's why you can't find it. It used to exist in the 2.4* version. I've switched the Buttons to '''Timeline''' window; by doing this, i noticed that it is not mentioned that the header for the 3D View and Timeline window is at the BOTTOM of its window instead at the top as the name &quot;Header&quot; implies. Currently figuring out where to mention this. [[User:Kerina yin|Kerina yin]] ([[User talk:Kerina yin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kerina yin|contribs]]) 07:58, 6 October 2011 (UTC)

Specific compilers may (in a non-standard compliant mode) also treat some other words as keywords, including &lt;code&gt;'''cdecl'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'''far'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'''fortran'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'''huge'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'''interrupt'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'''near'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'''pascal'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'''typeof'''&lt;/code&gt;. Old compilers may recognize the &lt;code&gt;'''overload'''&lt;/code&gt; keyword, an anachronism that has been removed from the language.

The current revision of C++, known as C++11, added some keywords:
{|
 |
* &lt;code&gt;'''alignas'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''alignof'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''char16_t'''&lt;/code&gt;
 |
* &lt;code&gt;'''char32_t'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''constexpr'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''decltype'''&lt;/code&gt;
 |
* &lt;code&gt;'''noexcept'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''nullptr'''&lt;/code&gt;
 |
* &lt;code&gt;'''static_assert'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''thread_local'''&lt;/code&gt;
|}

C++11 also added two special words which act like keywords in some contexts, but can be used as ordinary identifiers most of the time:
* &lt;code&gt;'''final'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''override'''&lt;/code&gt;
It would be bad practice to use these as identifiers when writing new code.

The C++98 keywords '''auto''', '''default''', '''delete''' and '''using''' have additional or changed uses in C++11.

Some old C++98 compilers may not recognize some or all of the following keywords:
{|
 |
* &lt;code&gt;'''and'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''and_eq'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''bitand'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''bitor'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''bool'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''catch'''&lt;/code&gt;

* {{C++ Programming/kw|const_cast}}
 |
* {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}}
* &lt;code&gt;'''explicit'''&lt;/code&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;'''mutable'''&lt;/code&gt;
* {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}
* &lt;code&gt;'''not'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''not_eq'''&lt;/code&gt;

=== C++ reserved identifiers ===

Some &quot;nonstandard&quot; identifiers are reserved for distinct uses, to avoid conflicts on the naming of identifiers by vendors, library creators and users in general.

Reserved identifiers include keywords with two consecutive underscores (__), all that start with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter and some other categories of reserved identifiers carried over from the C library specification.

A list of C reserved identifiers can be found at the Internet Wayback Machine archived page:

== NPOV ==

This article states that afrikaans is a european language. This does not follow the rules of the no point of view policy, since many people consider afrikaans to be an indigenous african language. It is simply a matter of opinion.--[[User:100%RSA|100%RSA]] 14:09, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
:[[w:WP:BB|WP:BB]]. Hope that's not too rude, but you can be bold and change it yourself. [[User:Icelandic Hurricane|Icelandic Hurricane]] 21:11, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

::Let me join this debate, the reason is that Afrikaans is a Indo-European language, and also it almost be identifical to Dutch, which they are colonized the South Africa before the Boer War (I think I'm wrong but I'm not sure...). [[User:Rakuten06|Rakuten06]] 23:25, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

Germanic languages are European. Afrikaans is classified as Germanic. Look up Afrikaans on http://www.ethnologue.com, http://www.omniglot.com and http://www.nvtc.gov. Saying that Afrikaans' status as a European language is &quot;a matter of opinion&quot; is somewhat absurd. Even the English Wikipedia article on Afrikaans classifies the language as European. It may be reasonably argued that Afrikaans is both European in nature and indigenous to Africa, a point which is addressed in the book. [[User:Delano|Delano]] 05:26, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

Wouldn't it technically be an African language, but in the Indo-European group? [[User:Icelandic Hurricane|Icelandic Hurricane]] 22:40, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

== NOT a phrase book! ==

Why did [[User:Rakuten06]] creat lessons 2 to 4 and just stuff the pages with phrases lifted from various sources on the 'net? Please, this is NOT a phrase book! The point is to provide a source for people to learn to read, write, speak and understand Afrikaans; in other words, a complete language course. What's the point of simply repeating things found elsewhere on the 'net? Also, if you're going to create lessons, please follow the format of the previous lessons... you've just pasted text with little regard for formatting or readability.

Future plans of [[Russian]] Wikibook (please feel free to add anything you think needs to be done here, or suggest something in the discussion page of this module):

*&lt;strike&gt;Improve Navigation template (maybe a pretty box, like the [[French]] Wikibook)&lt;/strike&gt;
*Create appendix, including:
**declinations of nouns and adjectives(in a table, similar to what you would see in the back of a dictionary)
**declinations of personal pronouns and этот, кто, что, etc...
**conjugation of verbs
**Russian-English, English-Russian dictionary
**index
*Create a plan for lessons that include grammar, exercises, vocabulary, and dialogue. There are already some good pages on grammar, but I think it would be more useful to explain grammar in lessons, as is necessary to do corresponding exercises. Likewise, dialogues using the grammar just learned would be in each lesson, with a list of vocabulary at the end of the lesson. Any grammar used as a reference (for example, lists of verbs that take instrumental case) could be put in the index. All the grammar pages were written by a native Russian, and are great resources, and should be put in the lessons.
*once a plan for lessons is created, start making the lessons, and try to recruit help from Russian Wikibooks or Wikipedia
*list of cognates in appendix

      <comment>/* Elementary Set Operations */ fixed file links</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The review of set theory contained herein adopts a naive point of view.
We assume that the meaning of a set as a collection of objects is intuitively clear.
A rigorous analysis of the concept belongs to the foundations of mathematics and mathematical logic.
Although we shall not initiate a study of these fields, the rules we follow in dealing with sets are derived from them.
A ''set'' is a collection of objects, which are the ''elements'' of the set.

[[File:basicset.png]]

If an element x belongs to a set S, we express this fact by writing &lt;math&gt;x \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
If x does not belong to S, we write &lt;math&gt;x \notin S&lt;/math&gt;.
We use the equality symbol to denote ''logical identity''.
For instance, x = y means that x and y are symbols denoting the same object.
Similarly, the equation S = T states that S and T are two symbols for the same set.
In particular, the sets S and T contain precisely the same elements.
If x and y are different objects then we write &lt;math&gt;x \neq y&lt;/math&gt;.
Also, we can express the fact that S and T are different sets by writing &lt;math&gt;S \neq T&lt;/math&gt;.

A set S is a ''subset'' of T if every element of S is also contained in T.
We express this relation by writing &lt;math&gt;S \subset T&lt;/math&gt;.
Note that this definition does not require S to be different from T.
In fact, S = T if and only if &lt;math&gt;S \subset T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T \subset S&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;S \subset T&lt;/math&gt; and S is different from T, then S is a ''proper subset'' of T and we write &lt;math&gt;S \subsetneq T&lt;/math&gt;.

There are many ways to specify a set.
If the set contains only a few elements, one can simply list the objects in the set;

&lt;math&gt;
S = \{ x_1, x_2, x_3 \} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The content of a set can also be enumerated whenever S has a countable number of elements,

&lt;math&gt;
S = \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots \} .
&lt;/math&gt;

Usually, the way to specify a set is to take some collection S of objects and some property that elements of S may or may not possess, and to form the set consisting of all elements of S having that property.
For example, starting with the integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, we can form the subset of S consisting of all even numbers

&lt;math&gt;
S = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} | x \mbox{ is an even number} \}.
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, we denote the set of all elements that have a certain property P by

&lt;math&gt;
S = \{ x | x \mbox{ satisfies } P \} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The braces are to be read as the words &quot;the set of&quot; whereas the symbol | stands for the words &quot;such that.&quot;

It is convenient to introduce two special sets.
The ''empty set'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, is a set that contains no elements.
The ''universal set'' is the collection of all objects of interest in a particular context, and it is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.
Once a universal set &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is specified, we need only consider sets that are subsets of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.
In the context of probability, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is often called the ''sample space''.

The ''complement'' of a set S, with respect to the universal set &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, is the collection of all objects in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; that do not belong to S,

&lt;math&gt;
S^c = \{ x \in \Omega | x \notin S \}.
&lt;/math&gt;

We note that &lt;math&gt;\Omega^c = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.


==Elementary Set Operations==

Probability theory makes extensive use of elementary set operations.
Below, we review the ideas of set theory, and establish the basic terminology and notation.
Consider two sets, S and T.

[[File:Sets.png]]

The ''union'' of sets S and T is the collection of all elements that belong to S or T (or both), and it is denoted by &lt;math&gt;
S \cup T&lt;/math&gt;.
Formally, we define the union of these two sets by

&lt;math&gt;
S \cup T = \{ x | x \in S \mbox{ or } x \in T \} .
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Set Union.png]]

The ''intersection'' of sets S and T is the collection of all elements that belong to S and T.
It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;S \cap T&lt;/math&gt;, and it can be expressed mathematically as

&lt;math&gt;
S \cap T = \{ x | x \in S \mbox{ and } x \in T \} .
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Set Intersection.png]]

When S and T have no elements in common, we write &lt;math&gt;S \cap T = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
We also express this fact by saying that S and T are ''disjoint''.
More generally, a collection of sets is said to be disjoint if no two sets have a common element.
A collection of sets is said to form a ''partition'' of S if the sets in the collection are disjoint and their union is S.

[[File:Set Partition.png]]

The ''difference'' of two sets, denoted by S - T, is defined as the set consisting of those elements of S that are not in T,

&lt;math&gt;
S - T = \{ x | x \in S \mbox{ and } x \notin T \} .
&lt;/math&gt;

This set is sometimes called the complement of T relative to S, or the complement of T in S.

[[File:Set Difference.png]]

We have already looked at the definition of the union and the intersection of two sets.
We can also form the union or the intersection of arbitrarily many sets.
This is defined in the obvious way,

&lt;math&gt;
\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha}
= \{ x | x \in S_{\alpha} \mbox{ for some } \alpha \in I \}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\bigcap_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha}
= \{ x | x \in S_{\alpha} \mbox{ for all } \alpha \in I \} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The index set I can be finite or even infinite.

==Rules of Set Theory==

Given a collection of sets, it is possible to form new ones by applying elementary set operations to them.
As in algebra, one uses parentheses to indicate precedence.
For instance, &lt;math&gt;R \cup (S \cap T)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the union of two sets R and &lt;math&gt;S \cap T&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;(R \cup S) \cap T&lt;/math&gt; represents the intersection of two sets &lt;math&gt;R \cup S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.
The sets thus formed are quite different.

[[Image:triple.png]]

Sometimes different combinations of operations lead to the same set.
For instance, we have the two distributive laws

&lt;math&gt;
R \cap (S \cup T) = (R \cap S) \cup (R \cap T)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
R \cup (S \cap T) = (R \cup S) \cap (R \cup T).
&lt;/math&gt;

Two particularly useful equivalent combinations of operations are given by ''De Morgan's laws'', which state that

&lt;math&gt;
R - (S \cup T) = (R - S) \cap (R - T)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
R - (S \cap T) = (R - S) \cup (R - T).
&lt;/math&gt;

These two laws can be generalized to

&lt;math&gt;
\left( \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha} \right)^c
= \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha}^c
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\left( \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha} \right)^c
= \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha}^c
&lt;/math&gt;

when multiple sets are involved.
To establish the first equality, suppose that x belongs to &lt;math&gt;\left( \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha} \right)^c&lt;/math&gt;.
Then x is not contained in &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, x is not an element of &lt;math&gt;S_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in I&lt;/math&gt;.
This implies that x belongs to &lt;math&gt;S_{\alpha}^c&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in I&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore &lt;math&gt;x \in \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha}^c&lt;/math&gt;.
We have shown that &lt;math&gt;\left( \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha} \right)^c \subset \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha}^c&lt;/math&gt;.
The converse inclusion is obtained by reversing the above argument.
The second law can be obtained in a similar fashion.


==Cartesian Products==

There is yet another way to create new sets form existing ones.
It involves the notion of an ''ordered pair'' of objects.
Given sets S and T, the ''cartesian product'' S x T is the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) for which x is an element of S and y is an element of T,

&lt;math&gt;
S \times T = \{ (x, y) | x \in S \mbox{ and } y \in T \} .

== Summary of Probability &amp; Set Theory ==
*A = P(A) ∑[0, 1]
*NOT A = P(A') = 1 – P(A)
*A OR B = P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A∩B) = P(A) + P(B) [*if and only if A and B are mutually exclusive]
*A AND B = P(A∩B) = P(A/B)*P(B) = P(A)*P(B) [* if and only if A and B are independent]
*A GIVEN B = P(A|B) = P(A∩b)/P(B) [*conditional]

'''Basic Set Theory'''

'''UNION:''' combined area of set A and B, known as AUB. The set of all items which are members of either A or B
*Union of A and B are added together
*Some basic properties of unions:
*AUB = BUA
*AU(BUC) = (AUB)UC
*A c (AUB)
*AUA = A
*AU0 = A, where 0 = null, empty set
*A c B, if and only if AUB = B

'''INTERSECTION''': area where both A and B overlap, known as A∩B. It represents which members the two sets A and B have in common
*If A∩B = 0, then A and B are said to be '''DISJOINT'''. 
*Some basic properties of intersections:
*A∩B = B∩A
*A∩(B∩C) = (A∩B)∩C
*A∩B cA
*A∩A = A
*A∩0 = 0
*A cB, if and only if A∩B = A
*UNIVERSAL SET: space of all things possible, which contains ALL of the elements or elementary events.
*U/A is called the absolute complement of A

'''Complement (set)''': 2 sets can be subtracted. The relative complement (set theoretic difference of B and A). Denoted by B/A (or B – A) is the set of all elements which are members of B, but not members of A

Some basic properties of complements (~A, or A'):
*AUA' = U
*A∩A' = 0
*(A')' = A
*A/A = 0
*U' = 0, and 0 = U
*A/B = 'A∩B'

'''Summary'''
*Intersection (A∩B) --&gt; AND – both events occur together at the same time
*Union (AUB) --&gt; OR – everything about both events, A and B
*Complement (~A) --&gt; NOT A – everything else except A (or the event in question)
*AU~A = S (sample space)
*A∩~A = 0 (impossible event)

Union and Intersection are:

'''Commutative:'''
*AUB = BUA
*A∩B = B∩A

'''Associative:'''
*AU(BUC) = (AUB)UC
*A∩(B∩C) = (A∩B)∩C

'''Distributive:'''
*AU(B∩C) = (AUB)∩(AUC)
*A∩(BUC) = (A∩B)U(A∩C)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thanks for your offer of help. I suggest that you read [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikiversity/Modified_project_proposal the draft proposal] that needs to be sent to the Board of Directors. In my view, there are two things that need to be done at this time:

1) Finish drafting the proposal. I think what it still needs is something like a timeline with a description of what can be done in the short-term to get the project started and a discussion of where the project might go in the long run. The issue of courses and their role in Wikiversity has become a matter of conflict. I think that conflict can be resolved by making explicit what sorts of activities make sense for the immediate launch of the project and what goals need to be thought of as long-term possibilities for the community to work towards.

2) I think we should start work on a &quot;demonstration project&quot; without waiting for the Board to act. I think that the obvious place to start is with a project that would work to improve the process of citing sources within Wikipedia and which would also be related to an existing Wikibook project. Such a Wikiversity project would demonstrate how Wikiversity can function in an integrated fashion with other Wikimedia projects, would start to attract Wikiversity editors, and would be a starting point for building the Wikiversity infrastructure that will be needed to support scholarly learning projects in wiki format. The  [http://education.wikia.com/wiki/Wikiversity#Wikiversity_Core_Courses_Initiative demo project] I previously started attracted no attention. I suspect we need to pick a controversial topic that appeals to the interests of many people. An alternative would be to to construct a new main Wikiversity page at Meta, list a large number of topics for potential learning projects and let the community decide which one(s) to start with. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 15:37, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

== And now? ==

I went through and read the proposal as well as the various pages on discussion regarding wikiversity and its current stage.  I am a little unclear however, on where it is in its development.  Sometimes it seemed like it was faltering as far as becoming its own wiki and on other discussions it was apprently meeting approval and ready to be launched.  Clearly, since we are still on wikibooks, it has not met with some final approval and requires some fine tuning.  I am more than happy to help on any part that requires help.  What stage do you feel the second part of the proposal is in?  Is it just the beginning phases or is it near completion?  Would it be helpful to begin work on another course to offer the board more examples as to what wikiversity has to offer?  Feel free to point me in a direction and I am happy to work on that part.  I just don't feel knowledgable enough yet regarding wikiversity past and present to offer concrete thoughts on what needs to be accomplished.  Thanks

:It is always good to have a new set of eyes look at something. A major problem faced by Wikiversity is that it does not yet have a home and pages about it are scattered all over the place. We are trying to satisfy the requirements set by the Board:

:&quot;Wikiversity proposal (http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikiversity) not approved, but we will approve it if some changes are made and if the community seems joyful about it, which may or may not require another vote. The board recommend rewriting the proposal to exclude credentials, exclude online-courses and clarify the concept of elearning platform. to be rewritten to exclude credntials and to clarify concept of e-learning.&quot;

In my view, the major remaining problem is the requirement that &quot;the community seems joyful&quot; with the changes requested by the Board. Everyone's first impulse is to imagine Wikiversity as a collection of courses. I think that the Board realized a fundamental truth: most wiki editors are not going to have the time or ability to put courses online, and even if they did, conventional courses will not work well in a wiki environment. Another way of saying this is that a wiki cannot compete directly with conventional universities that pay people to put their conventional courses online and where students pay to take the courses. We need to start Wikiversity with an e-learning plan that makes sense for a wiki environment. I think that the new Wikiversity project proposal is okay, but it does not solve the problem of bringing joy to members of the community who think that the Board is wrong about the role of courses in Wikiversity. I think the new proposal needs an introduction that includes something like a timeline which would provide a logical path by which wiki editors could gradually build towards the possibility of wiki-based courses. This is analagous to the way that Wikipedia articles gradually mature. Wikiversity needs to start with basic e-learning projects that will attract participants and might gradually mature into things that are wikified courses. Of course, I am imagining something that the world has never seen, so it is rather hard to create a short and compelling way to &quot;bring joy&quot; to people who think the Board is wrong. I would never deflect anyone from starting a new Wikiversity course, but I think we need to get creative and step outside of &quot;course think&quot;. We need to initiate new types of wiki learning projects that will attract participants and create an environment in which wiki format courses might eventually become a reality....while leaving ope to the community to discover and decide what really works best for wiki-based learning. My hunch is that conventional courses will never really flourish in a wiki and we will have to discover new learning formats that are better suited for the wiki format. The only way this is ever really going to happen is to launch the project and jump into it. I think we need to construct a system for getting people to let go of the natural tendency to think only in terms of conventional courses. I suspect we will be able to create/find new wiki-based learning systems that will actually be better than conventional courses. However, many people just fly into a rage when told to think in terms other than courses. I think we need some creativity and brain storming to get us over the hump and get the project launched. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 04:08, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

I really like and I think I understand the direction that you want to take this.  I can see how many people would be turned off from the traditional course flow being placed into the world of wiki since it does not jive with the established idea of how something that is wiki-based grows and matures.  I like your idea of getting away from that and moving to a new way of seeing learning through not so much a course as e-learning.  I think the big difference between the two is that a course is guided by a teacher and e-learning, at least to me, is more of a free flow type of learning that is based on the students interest and their own pace that they have set for themselves.  I like the wikiversity idea because it can be a mesh of the two.  Instead of designing courses that are taught our use traditional course ideas, it is more of a guide to offer students the steps they need to take to become knowledgable in a certain area.  However, it is still based on a wiki-idea of learning where become knowledgable about a subject means researching and providing something new inherent to that topic. 

So, to apply this to your idea of how to solve the &quot;joyful&quot; component, is there a way to word or a way to come up with an idea that embodies what the community wants, some place where there is a structured or partially guided learning environment but to tailor to wiki-based growth so that both the community feels that they are getting what they want and at the same time the board feels that this is a worthwhile endeavor that enhances the wiki name and offers something unique?

If the community offered the board something of this nature, would it be possible just to get the site up so that the community could decide how the best way for the Wikiversity to grow is?  It just seems like there is a lot of fine tuning going on even before the wikiversity is &quot;born&quot; and the board is trying to halt it because they don't know how it will grow.  Are we in the same idea range, is this something I should maybe add a new section to the proposal and see how people feel and edit?  Thoughts? [[User:Ferralangel|Ferralangel]] 20:44, 19 April 2006 (UTC)ferralangel

:It sounds like you have a fairly good grasp of the situation. Over the past few months my efforts to &quot;bring joy&quot; to the disenchanted members of the community have failed. My personal problem is that the more I say along these lines the more I just seem to piss people off....I have given up trying because I seem to do more harm than good. I think we are at the point where we need soemone who can cut the Gordian Knot and get the project proposl once again before the Board. Maybe a new voice could say what needs to be said without provoking another automatic rejection from members of the community who can only think in terms of, &quot;I want my free courses, dang it, get to it!&quot; So, if you could take a crack at adding something to the new draft of the [[m:Wikiversity/Modified project proposal#Part 2: Modified proposal|Wikiversity project proposal]], that would be great. I think you could explicitly say that you are trying to find a way of satisfy both &lt;BR&gt;
:1) the Board's desire that the Wikiversity proposal respect the realities of wiki (and, hence, have a reasonable chance of thriving)&lt;BR&gt;
and&lt;BR&gt;
:2) and the members of the community who see courses as the only possible goal for Wikiversity.&lt;BR&gt;
:I've tried to make the argument that we could satisfy these two goals by thinking in terms of the short-term need to attract editors and launch the project and long-term goals that will ultimately only be constrained by what the community can accomplish. That argument does not seem to satisfy people. If you have any other thoughts, feel free to try them out. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 23:17, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is one of the shortest topics in this module. The other being Group VII elements.

Let's get started.

At the end of this topic, you will know the following information about Group II elements:

# Trends in properties
# Redox reactions
# Reactions with oxygen, water and hydrochloric acid
# Thermal decomposition of the carbonates
# Uses of Group II compounds

== Trends in properties ==

=== Introduction ===
The Group II elements are powerful reducing agents. 

A reducing agent is the compound that gets oxidised in the reaction and, therefore, loses electrons.

M = Mg, Ca, Sr,Ba --&gt; I will be using 'M' as the general symbol for a Group II element in this topic.

e.g.

As I said earlier, they are powerful reducing agents.
M&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; ----&gt;  M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

A reducing agent 'loses electrons'.

Another term for Group II elements are '''Alkaline Earth Metals'''

All Group II elements have 2 electrons in their outer shell. They generally lose these two outershell electrons in order to react and, by doing so, they form M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.

=== Properties ===

These are the properties you will have to know for your exam

As you go down the Group:

# Atomic radius increases
# First ionisation energy decreases
# Chemical reactivity increases
# Electronegativity decreases

You need to be able to explain these properties in the exam.

; Why does atomic radius increase? 
: This happens because as you go down the Group, the elements have more electrons and therefore, need more orbitals in which to store these electrons. These orbitals get filled up gradually by the usual method: &quot;1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; etc etc...
: These orbitals surround the nucleus. As you go down the Group, you get more orbitals surrounding the nucleus (remember, all the orbitals are 'stacked' on top of each other) and therefore, the size of the atom increases.
: Also, the further an orbital gets from the nucleus, the even more further it gets because of the sudden decrease in nuclear attraction from the nucleus.

; Why does first ionisation energy decrease? 
: This happens because as you go down the Group, the number of orbitals increases and they get further away from the nucleus. This decreases the nuclear attraction between the orbital and the nucleus so it makes it easier for another element to remove an electron from the outer orbital as the outer orbital is hardly attracted to the nucleus.
: Also, another reason the first ionisation energy decreases is because, of the shielding effect. All orbitals are filled up with electrons and these electrons are constantly repelling each other. The further out an orbital is from the nucleus, the greater the shielding effect on it and the lower the nuclear charge. Therefore, it's easier to remove an electron.
:; Exam tip
:: Whenever you are asked a question about explaining ionisation energies, always include the following 3 points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
::# Distance from nucleus
::# Shielding effect
::# Proton:Electron Ratio

; Why does chemical reactivity increase? : This happens because the ionisation energy decreases. All chemical reactions take place due to the transfer of electrons. Ionisation energy is the energy required to remove one electron from each atom in a one mole sample of gaseous atoms to form one mole of gaseous unipositive atoms.
Therefore, if its easier to remove an electron, then it should mean the it will be easier to react.

; Why does electronegativity decrease? : The ability of M to attract the electrons in a bonding pair decreases as you go down the group because the bonding orbitals are further from the nuclear charge and shielded by the inner shells.  Note that group II metals form mostly ionic compounds because the electronegativities are significantly lower than elements such as oxygen and chlorine.  Beryllium has the highest electronegativity in Group II and, as you might predict, it forms the chloride with most covalent character.

== Redox reactions ==

A Redox reaction is a reaction in which Oxidation and Reduction take place at the same time.
Originally Oxdation was defined as the gaining of oxygen by an element and Reduction as the loss of oxygen.However, now Oxidation is defined as the loss of Electrons and Reduction as the gain of electrons.

==== Oil Rig ====

A simple way of remembering oxidation and reduction is '''OILRIG'''

'''O'''xidation '''i'''s '''l'''oss of electrons

'''R'''eduction '''i'''s '''g'''ain of electrons

== Reactions with oxygen, water and hydrochloric acid ==
A reaction can only be regarded as a redox reaction if oxidation and reduction occurs &lt;u&gt;&lt;u&gt;simultaneously&lt;/u&gt;&lt;{{subject|A-level_Chemistry/OCR/Foundation/Group_II_Elements_and_Their_Compounds}}

==  Thermal decomposition of the carbonates ==
Carbonates of group II metals decompose on heating to give carbon dioxide.

MCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; -----------------&gt;   MO + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This is used to convert chalk (calcium carbonate) to quicklime, calcium oxide.  Quicklime can be used to make a simple mortar for building so historically lime kilns and small quarries were to be found all over England. When roasted with clay quicklime is used to make cement. 

The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by this reaction is also used to manufacture Sodium Carbonate (see Solway process).

Quicklime reacts vigorously with water to form Calcium Hydroxide (slaked lime).  This is a very exothermic reaction.

CaO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  ---------------&gt; Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Slaked lime can purchased in garden centres as a soil conditioner, farmers spread it on the land to reduce acidity.

== Uses of Group II compounds ==

[[Category:A-level Chemistry|Group II Elements and Their Compounds]]

Thermal decomposition of the carbonates
The carbonates of the group two metals decompose when heated to produce CO2. This is then used to change chalk to calcium oxide, which is also known as quicklime.
The reaction to create the CO2 is:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
MCO3 -----------------&gt; MO + CO2

This calcium oxide is used in construction for very simple mortar. If it is roasted with clay, it creates cement.

The CO2 produced by this reaction is also used to manufacture Sodium Carbonate (see Solway process).
Quicklime reacts vigrously with water to form Calcium Hydroxide (slaked lime). This is a very exothermic reaction.
CaO + H2O ---------------&gt; Ca(OH)2
Slaked lime can purchased in garden centers as a soil conditioner, farmers spread it on the land to reduce acidity.

Summary
The Group II elements are powerful reducing agents.
A reducing agent 'loses electrons'.
Another term for Group II elements are Alkaline Earth Metals
All Group II elements have 2 electrons in their outer shell.</text>

      <comment>/* Essential Singularity */ f(x) = sin(1/z) x --&gt; z</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is a residue?==

When we say we want a '''Residue''' of a function at a point, we mean that we want the coefficients of the term of the expanded function with a simple pole (something that gives a zero in the denominator) at that point.  For example, the residue of the function:

&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \frac{3}{x + 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

About &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; is 3.

And similarly for:

&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \frac{3}{x + 1} + \frac{3}{x + 2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Is also 3, for the second term isn't a pole at -1.

Of course, the functions we will be dealing with will be much more complicated, some may have quadratics on the denominator, some may not be well defined like &lt;math&gt;\sin (\frac{1}{z})&lt;/math&gt;; and according to the type of function, there are different ''types'' of what's called '''isolated singularities''' that we'll run across.  Of course, such things need to be well defined to include possible conflicts before we continue.  Also because our method of finding the residue varies with the type of the singularity!  This is probably the most important point in this chapter.

==Isolated Singularities==

There are three types:

1)  '''Removable Singularities'''

2)  '''Poles of order ''m'''''

3)  '''Essential Singularites'''

Which we will cover in detail one-by-one.

===Removable Singularities===

The rigorous definition is a function such that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{z \rightarrow z_0} f(z) = k&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is some constant value (you may have to use L'Hopital's Rule to come to this conclusion).

In layman's terms, this is a function that has a similar term multiplied on the numerator and denominator that can be cancelled.

For example, the following function:

&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \frac{3(x + 1)}{x + 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

has a removable singularity at &lt;math&gt;z_0 = -1&lt;/math&gt;.

as for what this has to do with residues, with the rigorous definition, this means that the function's residue at that point is considered to be 0.  If after cancellation some of the same terms are left over, like in the following function:

&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \frac{3(x + 1)}{(x + 1)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Poles of order ''m''===

Again, the rigorous definition is a function f has a pole at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\lim_{z \rightarrow z_0} ||f(z)|| = \infin &lt;/math&gt;, we classify the order ''m'' by the highest power of the pole in the Laurent series (in more layman's terms, the number of the power after it has been cancelled).  Another way of say this would be:
::The order of a pole at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is the least integer m such that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{z \to z_0}(z - z_0)^mf(z)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded.

Example:

&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \frac{3}{x + 1} + \frac{3}{(x + 1)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

has a 2nd order pole about &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;.  This could be said to follow from the fact that:
&lt;math&gt;
(x+1)^2f(x) = 3(x+1) + 3&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; not equal to &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; and thus
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -1}(x+1)^2f(x) = 3 &lt; \infin&lt;/math&gt;

===Essential Singularity===

The rigorous definition is a function such that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{z \rightarrow z_0} f(z)&lt;/math&gt; is neither bounded nor infinite, like the limit being undefined.  A good example of such a function is a typical example from 1st semester Calculus classes:

&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \sin(1/z)&lt;/math&gt;

about &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is an essential singularity.

What typically happens with these functions is when the Laurent (or in the case for the function above, Taylor) series is examined, it turns out that the order ''m'' is infinite (there are an infinite number of poles).  Keeping along the lines of our example, if we perform a Taylor series expansion we obtain:

&lt;math&gt;
f(z) = \sin(1/z) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infin} \frac{(-1)^{n+1} n!}{z^n}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which shows our infinite number of poles.

This is the only type of isolated singularity where the only way known to determine the residue (the power of that 1/z term) is to manually create the Laurent series and read off the coefficient.

Also, but beyond the scope of this book, is an interesting theorem regarding functions with essential singularities called Picard's Theorem, which states that a function with an essential singularity approaches every value except possibly one around a neighborhood about the singularity.

It is an edit by a non-logged in user who, 5 minutes later, apparently vandalized [[Serbian:Alphabet]] (the apparent vandalism being [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Serbian:Alphabet&amp;diff=432755&amp;oldid=432754 here]).

**&gt;18,000 pts with survival &gt;5 yrs. 
**1490 second cancers, of which 850 estimated to be excess. 30 yr risk for solid cancer 18%(men)/26%(women) for pts diagnosed at age 30, vs 7%/9% general population. 
**Risk of SC associated with younger age at HD diagnosis. Largest risk for breast (RR=6), other supradiaphragmatic sites (RR=6), infradiaphragmatic (RR=3.7), malignant mesothelioma (RR=20).

**Registry study. Childhood Cancer Survivor Study participants, 1230 female, chest irradiation
**Outcome: Low dose radiation (median 14 Gy) to large volume (whole-lung) breast cancer risk standardized incidence ration 43.6 (SS); high dose of radiation to mantle field/Hodgkin, standardized incidence ratio 24. Cummulative incidence of breast cancer by age to was 30%, comparable between both groups. Breast cancer specific mortality at 5 years 12%, at 10 years 19%
**Conclusion: Whole-lung irradiation confers greater risk of breast cancer than previously recognized; with substantial breast cancer mortality

**8 centers. 253 women with breast cancer after RT for HL were matched to 741 women with sporadic breast cancer.
**Median time from HL to breast cancer diagnosis was 18 yrs; median age at BC diagnosis, 42 y. Was more likely to be diagnosed by screening, more likely to be early stage, and more likely to be bilateral at diagnosis. Increased risk of metachronous contralateral breast cancer and increased risk of death from any cause. Breast cancer specific mortality was increased (but not S.S.)
**Conclusion: &quot;In women with a history of RT for HL, breast cancer is diagnosed at an earlier stage, but these women are at greater risk for bilateral disease and are more likely to die as a result of causes other than breast cancer. Our findings support close follow-up for contralateral tumors in these patients and ongoing primary care to manage comorbid conditions.&quot;

**SEER study. Compared 298 HD survivors who developed breast cancer to 400,000+ women with first breast cancers.
**OS survival inferior for HD pts with breast cancer, 15-yr OS 48% vs 69% (for localized BC) or 33% vs 43% (regional or distant BC). Increased 7-fold risk of death from other cancers. Increased heart dsease mortality. 10-yr BC CSS was similar for pts with regional/distant disease but was inferior for HD pts with localized BC.
**Conclusion: Women with HL may survive a subsequent diagnosis of BC, only to experience significant excesses of death from other primary cancers and cardiac disease. Greater awareness of screening for cardiac disease and subsequent primary cancers in patients with HL-BC is warranted.

Radiation was used routinely for the treatment of AS from the 1930s through the 1950s. It has since been largely abandoned due to the concern for secondary malignancies.

Treatment can be by EBRT, Radium-224, or Samarium-153.

Everyone reasons. Humans are reasoning animals. Further, humans reason with words and symbols. 

To reason is to use thought to come to some conclusion. Reasoning can be done alone or in groups. 

Unfortunately, being human does not assure any of us that we will reason effectively. In other words, reasoning does not have to produce particularly useful results. Productive reasoning is both an art and a science.

I hope to present here information that will allow most to develop both the skill and the knowledge to reason effectively.

Particularly, I will be discussing informal reasoning. For a complete exposition of effective reasoning, see, also, the Wikibooks [[Introduction to Moral Reasoning]], [[Formal Logic]], and [[Systems of Logic]].

==Informal and Formal Reasoning==

Formal reasoning is concerned only with the forms of arguments. Certain forms of arguments have been identified which are valid. In other words, if the original statements (or premises) in those arguments are true, then the conclusions must necessarily be true also. Therefore, the form:

All marbles are red.
All red things are bright.
Therefore, all marbles are bright.

is a valid form.

The truth of the first two statements is not of interest. But, assuming that they are true, the last statement must necessarily be true.

Formal reasoning is deductive in nature. In other words, as said above, the conclusion of a valid formal argument follows necessarily from the premises. Notice that deductive reasoning produces no new information. It simply rearranges what is already known into a new statement of the same information.

Notice also that deductive or formal reasoning does not require any reference to external reality. It can be completely divorced from external reality. Therefore:

All unicorns are white.
All white things are virtuous.
Therefore, all unicorns are virtuous.

is a perfectly good and valid deductive argument.

Formal reasoning is addressed in other Wikibooks - &quot;Formal Logic&quot;, and &quot;Systems of Logic&quot;.

Informal reasoning includes formal reasoning but it also is concerned with all the other elements of reasoning. It addresses the probability of truth of premises and conclusions. Informal reasoning is common, every-day reasoning.

Flowers present an exciting field of study to people of all ages.  Though young boys may dismiss the study of flowers as something too &quot;girly,&quot; they will soon discover that flowering plants are a truly fascinating subject.  There are thousands of species of flowering plants all around us.  Most have flowers for only a short time, and most are inconspicuous - not what most people would even call a flower, but would be quick to call a weed.  If the student of nature is willing to expand the definition of &quot;flower&quot; to include any plant that produces flowers, a whole new world of flowers will be opened.  

An example would be a plant known as ''loosestrife''.  Loosestrife is not a plant that most gardeners would consider cultivating - it looks very much like a weed.  But upon close examination, the careful observer will find much about the plant to take delight in.  Some species of loosestrife have yellow flowers, others have purple ones.  The flowers themselves are on the smallish side, but they are quite beautiful.  They attract bees, ants, and other insects.  Being able to identify a &quot;weed&quot; can be very satisfying and requires careful attention to detail.   I personally hunt out weeds whenever I am out for a walk - indeed, sometimes finding a new &quot;weed&quot; is the whole point of the walk.  When I see one I do not know, I take a careful look.  What color is the flower?  How many petals does it have?  Do the leaves grow from the stem in pairs, opposite one another, or do they take turns, growing alternately?  Are the veins in the leaves branched or parallel?  Does the leaf grow directly from the stem, or is it attached by a small stem of its own?  Is the stem hairy?  square?  All of these questions are important clues to a plant's identity.  When my walk is over, I turn to a field guide or to one of many sites on the Internet and try to identify the plant I have discovered.  It is a thrill to me when I finally figure out what it is, and then I read everything I can about this new species in my arsenal.  Is it a native plant, or was it introduced?  Does it have edible parts?  Does it have a medicinal use?  What is peculiar about it?  Why does it have the name it has?  The answers to these questions are almost invariably fascinating!  I invite you to study God's world through the flowers He created!

==1. Draw or photograph 35 kinds of flowers and identify them correctly.==
This website http://www.realtimerendering.com/flowers/flowers.html can help you identify flowers by entering in the answers to several questions.  It would be a good idea to print out the form and take copies with you into the field.  Some of the questions are difficult to answer unless you have the plant right in front of you.

[[Image:Petal-sepal.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Petals and sepals]]
[[Image:Kievitsbloem.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The '''pistil''' is the green stem with the fork at the end.  The '''stamens''' are the green stems with the yellow heads at the tips]].
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==3. Name six flower families and their distinguishing characteristics.  Name at least two flowers in each family.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Flower families}}

==4. Describe the life history of a particular flower, including the part played by insects or wind in pollination.==
*A seed needs warmth and water to grow roots. 
*The flower sprouts up and down at the same time, send a shoot upwards, and a root downwards.
*The flowers grow more leaves. 
*The blossoms open.
*Bees and other insects pollinate the flowers.
*The flowers form seeds. 
*The seeds are dispersed and take root.
*The cycle repeats.

==5. Name at least two plants that are poisonous to touch, and state which, if any, are found in your locality.==
{|border=0

|[[File:Toxicodendron radicans.jpg|thumb|300px|Poison ivy]]
|[[File:Poisonoak.jpg|thumb|300px|Poison oak]]
|-
|[[File:Toxicodendron vernix.jpg|thumb|300px|Poison sumac]]
|[[File:Pastinaca sativa Blüten.jpg|thumb|300px|Wild parsnip ''(Pastinaca sativa)'']]
|}
'''Poison Ivy, Poison Oak, and Poison Sumac''' all fall into this category.  Poison ivy grows all over North America, and is most fond of disturbed areas such as stream banks and roadsides.  Poison oak grows primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, and the Southeastern and Western United States.  Poison Sumac is found in subtropical and warm temperate regions throughout the world, with the highest diversity in southern Africa.

Another plant to watch out for is the''' wild parsnip''' ''(Pastinaca sativa)''.  This plant has an edible tuber, and indeed was cultivated for this for centuries.  But if contact with the plant is made with wet (or sweaty) skin, followed by exposure to sunlight, it can cause a purple rash that can last several weeks. In some cases, the discoloration caused by the rash can be permanent.
{{clear}}

==6. Do three of the following:==
===a.  Arrange, draw or photograph a series of at least six flowers showing in order the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.===
It is sometimes difficult to assign a color to a flower.  Some varieties of a flower in a given species will have blossoms in one color, while another variety will have them in another.  Some flowers are difficult to call blue or violet, as the color lies somewhere in between.  Red and violet flowers can also be in between.  Use your best judgment to meet this requirement.  We present a few possibilities here, so do not feel constrained by this list.

===b.  Submit fresh, pressed or dried flowers which have:  five petals, four petals, three petals, no petals.===

===c.  Distinguish and name two out of five wild or cultivated flowers by their odor, while blindfolded.===
This requirement is a fun activity that your Pathfinders are sure to enjoy.  Select the flowers carefully, either from your garden (or one you have permission to &quot;raid&quot;), or from a store that sells flowers (a florist or a grocery store).  Smell them to be sure they each have a discernible odor, and then determine their identities (you can use a key to do this). Cultivated flowers will generally have a stronger aroma than wild flowers.  Allow each Pathfinder to sniff all the flowers without blindfolds so they can learn the smells.  When a Pathfinder is ready, apply the blindfold, and hold the flower near the nose.  Allow each flower to be sniffed and have the Pathfinder announce its supposed identity.  If the Pathfinder cannot get two out of five in the first, try, allow him (or her) to smell them again without the blindfold and be sure the flower can be identified ''without'' the blindfold.  Then try again.

===d.  List flowers that you have observed being visited for food by the following:===
*'''1. Birds:'''
*'''2. Honeybees:''' 
*'''3. Bumblebees:'''
*'''4. Butterflies:'''
*'''5. Moths:'''
It may be necessary to use a pair of binoculars for this requirement, as birds are highly unlikely to visit any flower a Pathfinder is hovering over.  Hummingbirds are the most likely avian visitors you will see visiting a flower for food.  Bumblebees can be distinguished from honey bees by their size (bumblebees are two or three times larger).

===e.  Watch a flower for at least ten minutes in the sunshine, and at least ten minutes after dusk, and report on insect visitors.  State the number and kind of visitors and name of flower.===
This can be an excellent activity for a campout.  The post-dusk observations are quite suitable as a vespers activity, and the daytime observations work well during the Sabbath morning services.

Compare this requirement with requirement 7 of the [[../Shrubs|Shrubs]] honor.

      <comment>/* Informal Reasoning */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Reason is what makes us human human! It is our USP (unique survival process)

Naturally, the human animal is weak, slow and lacking strong jaws or sharp claws. Yet somehow our species has come to dominate the world and everything in it, short of Mother Nature herself. How did this happen? 

==Evolutionary Philosophy==
This is a controversial topic which proposes that, like our cousins, the great apes, we were once a forest dwelling species that abandoned or was excluded  from &quot;the Garden of Eden&quot; and had to survive by eating grass and carrion, which somehow transmuted into wheat, rice and bread along with fishing animal hunting and herding.

The key to this transformation was (allegedly) the mastery of fire and weaponry, both of which are highly dangerous to a social species such as ''homo sapiens''. Learning to make controllable fire and reliable tools requires high levels of communication, so emotional responses developed so that language and reason emerged.  

To discover more on this, try first the work of the polymath Noam Chomsky, a professor  in the Department of Linguistics &amp; Philosophy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) USA. He is a linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, logician, historian, political critic, and publisher of some very controversial critiques of the modern world.

==Formal reasoning==
Formal reasoning is concerned only with the forms of arguments. Certain forms of arguments have been identified which are valid. In other words, if the original statements (or premises) in those arguments are true, then the conclusions must necessarily be true also. Therefore, the form:

All marbles are red.
All red things are bright.
Therefore, all marbles are bright.

is a valid form.

The truth of the first two statements is not of interest. But, assuming that they are true, the last statement must necessarily be true.

Formal reasoning is deductive in nature. In other words, as said above, the conclusion of a valid formal argument follows necessarily from the premises. Notice that deductive reasoning produces no new information. It simply rearranges what is already known into a new statement of the same information.

Notice also that deductive or formal reasoning does not require any reference to external reality. It can be completely divorced from external reality. Therefore:

All unicorns are white.
All white things are virtuous.
Therefore, all unicorns are virtuous.

is a perfectly good and valid deductive argument.

Formal reasoning is addressed in other Wikibooks - [[Formal Logic]], and [[Systems of Logic]].
==Informal Reasoning==
Informal reasoning includes formal reasoning but it also is concerned with all the other elements of reasoning. It addresses the probability of truth of premises and conclusions. Informal reasoning is common, every-day reasoning.

==Truth==
Truth seems obvious enough - we learn to tell the truth at an early age. Unfortunately, one of the features of language is it enables us to imagine future scenarios which are fanciful (which is what fiction writers do). In short it enables us to be untruthful to ourselves as well as others.

Emotionally, we react to situations. Emotions are primitive, quick and dirty survival tools - the sort of thing that makes one jump away from a flame or lash out at an attacker. We could not survive without such tactical tools. 

We humans can - uniquely, and because of language  - make up stories about what might happen if we did this or that, and so predict the effect of our actions. These are the long-term strategic tools that have made mankind master of the earth.

Our reports and predictions fall along a scale: they may be entirely true, partly true, false or disastrous. Reason draws us to the positive end of this scale. thoughtless blind obedience, stupidity and madness lead to errors, some of which may literally be fatal errors. Effective reasoning is our only hope of survival today and tomorrow (just as it has been for some three million years or whenever it was that our species first emerged) 

==Leadership==
Individuals who get these stories of the future approximately right (reasonable models, accurate projections), and can marshal available resources become leaders. Those who get it radically wrong are considered mad or insane. Most of us are sometimes leaders and sometimes followers - but this is a recent innovation.

For much of human history human society has been hierarchical: people were raised from infancy to believe that they belonged to an immutable  social group such as 'royalty' nobility' or 'serfdom' The Hindu caste system is perhaps the most structured, but it happened (and still happens) everywhere. Director, manager  or employee; pope, cardinal or priest; Officer, NCO or private soldier, and so on.
==Thinking allowed==
The reformation, the enlightenment and above all the twentieth century wars in Europe came about through reason. Better educated people talking together, writing treatises and printing books broke the shackles of the old order.

The age of reason is accelerating through radio, television, the Internet and mobile phone technologies. It is not important that most of the material is simply entertaining, what matters is that it gives us food for thought. We can use these toys to imagine new products, services, social orders. If human  imagination is reasonable, we humans should enjoy happy and fulfilled lives. If not, then crisis, recession and chaos might ensue, so that even medieval lunatic asylums might start to look like attractive places to live!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Noch ein Review fuer den letzten Schliff. So weit ihr den Text schon hier im Wikibook stehen habt, ist er schon sehr nett. 
Nur ein paar kleine Anmerkungen: Benutzt nicht so oft die Woerter 'because' and 'which'. Es gibt z.B. viele Alternativen fuer 'because' (since, as , due to, ...). Ich habe die meisten im Text schon umgeschrieben (hatte mich nicht eingeloggt, daher bloss die Computernummer), denkt nur in Zukunft auch daran.
Einen Teil, den ich nicht ueberzeugend fand, ist der Teil ueber 'Schema', man versteht den Teil wenn man schon mal Psychology hatte, aber nicht wenn man noch Anfaenger ist. 
Ansonsten ist das Englisch Ueberdurchschnittlich gut so wie die Uebergaenge von einem Unterthema ins naechste.
Wenn ihr noch etwas zu Consciousness findet wollt (auch wenn es nicht besonders auf Evolution aus ist) dann schaut doch einmal auf Christof Koch's Homepage nach. Sehr interessantes paper.

Hi Pbenner,

I tried the link of the ISBN number of the probsolv book and there was no match at all... So I googled a second and found a link which may be interresting to be posted as reference:

http://cerium.raunvis.hi.is/~tpr/papers/eps.pdf

Grüße, merlin.

Hi ihr alle,

ein paar Kommentare zu eurem Text:
1) habt ihr noch zu wenig Worte (nur 275Stück); es sollten um die 500 sein.
2)der Text ist in der richtigen Buchform geschrieben, trotzdem würde ich noch einmal an manchen Stellen die Formulierungen überarbeiten.
3)das Beispiel von den Türmen von Hanoi könnt ihr nicht einfach so ins internet stellen, es sei denn ihr habt es von einer anderen freien Quelle. Ansonsten bestehen rechtliche Probleme und das Buch kann so nicht veröffentlicht werden.
4)bei weiteren Fragen fragt mich....
LG iroewer

: Hey sweetheart ;p
: zu 3. Die Türme habe ich reingestellt und kommen von Wikipedia, sind also freie Inhalte. In die History gucken udn so ;)
: zu 2. Kannst du ein Beispiel geben? Ich finde das schon recht gelungen. Auf jeden Fall kann man damit weiter arbeiten.
: bye, --[[User:Aschoeke|Aschoeke]] 21:57, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

Clicking on the image in the chain puzzle doesn't give the correct answer.  However, clicking on the thumbnail expansion icon works without problem. Is it possible to fix that, or is it a Wiki limitation? --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 23:33, 22 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

==Image Copyright Problem: [[:Image:Taj-Mahal.jpeg]]==
&lt;!-- If the top of this page says &quot;Editing Template:Image copyright&quot;, then you are modifying the master copy of this template, and not your user talk page. To edit your talk page, just:
1. Click the back button in your web browser.
2. Click the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top. --&gt;

Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Taj-Mahal.jpeg]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in [[Wikibooks]] because of [[w:copyright law|copyright law]]. We need you to specify two things on the [[:Image:Taj-Mahal.jpeg|image description page]]:
* The copyright holder, and
* The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder.  If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikibooks, we've sorted them using [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags|image copyright tags]]. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TAGHERE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  

There are 2 basic ways to licence an image on Wikibooks:
#An [[w:open content|open content]] licence
#[[w:public domain|Public Domain]]

*The copyright holder gets the best protection of his work by licencing their work under an [[w:open content|open content]] license like the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike] licence.  If you have the '''express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence''', use the image copyright tag: {{tl|cc-by-sa-2.5}}.  The [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] is another choice for licencing one's work.  Again, if you have the '''express permission''' of the copyright holder, use the tag: {{tl|GFDL}}.

*The copyright holder can also release his work into the [[w:public domain|public domain]], see [[Wikibooks:Image_copyright_tags#Public_domain_dedications|here]] for images released into the public domain.
**Images from certain sources are automatically release into the [[w:public domain|Public Domain]].  This is true for most governments like the federal United States government. However not all governments release their work into the public domain, such as the UK government .  Non-free licence governments are listed [[w:Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags#Non-free_UK_Government_licenses|here]]. 

For any other sources of for more information see [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]].  Please remember that if you don't tag your images, they will be deleted.

::''P.S.  If you have uploaded other images without including copyright tags, please go back and tag them.  Also, please tag all images that you upload in the future.''

If you have any questions, just leave a message on my talk page. Thanks again. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:22, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Image Copyright Problem: [[:Image:Flaming lam.jpg]]==
&lt;!-- If the top of this page says &quot;Editing Template:Image copyright&quot;, then you are modifying the master copy of this template, and not your user talk page. To edit your talk page, just:
1. Click the back button in your web browser.
2. Click the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top. --&gt;

Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Flaming lam.jpg]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in [[Wikibooks]] because of [[w:copyright law|copyright law]]. We need you to specify two things on the [[:Image:Flaming lam.jpg|image description page]]:
* The copyright holder, and
* The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder.  If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikibooks, we've sorted them using [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags|image copyright tags]]. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TAGHERE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  

There are 2 basic ways to licence an image on Wikibooks:
#An [[w:open content|open content]] licence
#[[w:public domain|Public Domain]]

*The copyright holder gets the best protection of his work by licencing their work under an [[w:open content|open content]] license like the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike] licence.  If you have the '''express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence''', use the image copyright tag: {{tl|cc-by-sa-2.5}}.  The [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] is another choice for licencing one's work.  Again, if you have the '''express permission''' of the copyright holder, use the tag: {{tl|GFDL}}.

*The copyright holder can also release his work into the [[w:public domain|public domain]], see [[Wikibooks:Image_copyright_tags#Public_domain_dedications|here]] for images released into the public domain.
**Images from certain sources are automatically release into the [[w:public domain|Public Domain]].  This is true for most governments like the federal United States government. However not all governments release their work into the public domain, such as the UK government .  Non-free licence governments are listed [[w:Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags#Non-free_UK_Government_licenses|here]]. 

For any other sources of for more information see [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]].  Please remember that if you don't tag your images, they will be deleted.

::''P.S.  If you have uploaded other images without including copyright tags, please go back and tag them.  Also, please tag all images that you upload in the future.''

If you have any questions, just leave a message on my talk page. Thanks again. [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:25, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

= Satisfaction =

The rules for assigning truth to sentences of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; should say, in effect, that

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha\, \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is true if and only if &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true of every object in the domain.  There are two problems.  First, &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; will normally have free variables.  In particular, it will normally have free &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  But formulae with free variables are not sentences and do not have a truth value.  Second, we do not yet have a precise way of saying that &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true of every object in the domain.  The solution to these problems comes in two parts.  

* We will need an assignment of objects from the domain to the variables.

* We will need to say that a model satisfies (or does not satisfy) a formula with a variable assignment.

We can then define truth in a model in terms of satisfaction.

== Variable assignment ==

Given model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, a ''variable assignment'' &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a function assigning each variable of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; a member of &lt;math&gt;|\mathfrak{M}|\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  The function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all variables of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, so each one is assigned a member of the domain.

Okay, we have assignments of domain members to variables.  We also have an assignment of domain members to constant symbols&amp;mdash;this achieved by the model's interpretation function.  Now we need to use this information to generate assignments of domain members to arbitrary terms including, in addition to constant symbols and variables, complex terms formed by using ''n''-place operation letters where ''n'' is greater than 0.  This is accomplished by an ''extended variable assignment'' &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathrm{s}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; defined below.  Remember that &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the interpretation function of model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  It assigns semantic values to the operation letters and predicate letters of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

An extended variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathrm{s}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a function making assignments as follows.

: If &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a '''variable''', then:
:: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathrm{s}}(\alpha)\ =\ \mathrm{s}(\alpha)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: If &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a '''constant symbol''' (i.e., a 0-place operation letter), then:
:: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathrm{s}}(\alpha)\ =\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\alpha)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:  If &lt;math&gt;\zeta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is an ''n''-place operation letter (''n'' greater than 0) and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1,\ \alpha_2,\ \ldots,\ \alpha_n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are '''terms''', then:

:: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathrm{s}}(\,\zeta(\alpha_1,\, \alpha_2,\, \ldots,\, \alpha_n)\,)\ = \ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\zeta)\,(\ \overline{\mathrm{s}}(\,\alpha_1),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(\alpha_2),\, \ldots,\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(\alpha_n)\ )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Some examples may help.  Suppose we have model &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; where:

: &lt;math&gt;|\mathfrak{M}|\ =\ \{1,\, 2,\, 3\}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(a^0_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(b^0_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(f^2_0)\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0\ \mbox{such that:} \quad \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 0) = 2,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 1)\ =\ 1,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 2) = 0,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::::: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 0) = 1,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 1)\ =\ 0,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 2) = 2,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 0) = 0,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::::: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 1) = 2,\ \mbox{and}\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 2) = 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

On the [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|previous page]], it was noted that we want the following result:

: &lt;math&gt;f(a, b)\ \mbox{resolves to}\ 1\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We now have achieved this because we have for any &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; defined on &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathrm{s}}(f(a, b))
\ =\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(f)\,(\ \overline{\mathrm{s}}(a),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\ )
\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(\ \overline{\mathrm{s}}(a),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\ )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;=\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(a),\, I_{\mathfrak{M}}(b)\ )
\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 1)
\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose we also have a variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; where:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(x_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(y_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then we get:

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathrm{s}}(f(x, y))
\ =\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(f)\,(\ \overline{\mathrm{s}}(x),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(y)\ )
\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(\ \overline{\mathrm{s}}(x),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(y)\ )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;=\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(f)\,(\ \mathrm{s}(x),\, \mathrm{s}(y)\ )
\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 1)
\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Satisfaction ==

A model, together with a variable assignment, can ''satisfy'' (or fail to satisfy) a formula.  Then we will use the notion of satisfaction with a variable assignment to define truth of a sentence in a model.  We can use the following convenient notation to say that the interpretaion &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; satisfies (or does not satisfy) &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash\, \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We now define ''satisfaction of a formula by a model with a variable assignment''.  In the following, 'iff' is used to mean 'if and only if'.

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{i.} \quad \mbox{For}\ \sigma\ \mbox{a sentence letter:}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \sigma \quad \mbox{iff} \quad I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\sigma)\ =\ \mathrm{True}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{ii.} \quad \mbox{For}\ \pi\ \mbox{an}\ n\mbox{--place predicate letter and for}\ \alpha_0,\, \alpha_1,\, \ldots,\, \alpha_n\ \mbox{any terms:}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \pi(\alpha_0,\, \alpha_1,\, \ldots,\, \alpha_n) \quad \mbox{iff} \ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(\alpha_0),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(\alpha_1),\, \ldots,\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(\alpha_n)\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\pi)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{iii.} \quad \mbox{For}\ \varphi\ \mbox{a formula:}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \lnot \varphi \quad \mbox{iff} \ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \varphi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{iv.} \quad \mbox{For}\ \varphi\ \mbox{and}\ \psi\ \mbox{formulae:}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash (\varphi \land \psi) \quad \mbox{iff} \ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\ \ \mbox{and}\ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \psi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{v.} \quad \mbox{For}\ \varphi\ \mbox{and}\ \psi\ \mbox{formulae:}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash (\varphi \lor \psi) \quad \mbox{iff} \ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\ \ \mbox{or}\ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \psi\ \mbox{(or both)}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{vi.} \quad \mbox{For}\ \varphi\ \mbox{and}\ \psi\ \mbox{formulae:}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash (\varphi \rightarrow \psi) \quad \mbox{iff} \ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \varphi\ \ \mbox{or}\ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \psi\ \mbox{(or both)}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{vii.} \quad \mbox{For}\ \varphi\ \mbox{and}\ \psi\ \mbox{formulae:}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash (\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi) \quad \mbox{iff} \ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash (\varphi \land \psi)\ \ \mbox{or}\ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash (\lnot \varphi \land \lnot \psi)\ \mbox{(or both)}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{viii.} \quad \mbox{For}\ \varphi\ \mbox{a formula and}\ \alpha\ \mbox{a variable:}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \forall \alpha\, \varphi \quad \mbox{iff}\ \ \mbox{for every}\ \mathrm{d}\ \in |\mathfrak{M}|,  \ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s[\alpha\!:\, d]}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{where}\ \mathrm{s[\alpha\!:\, d]}\ \mbox{differs from}\ \mathrm{s}\ \mbox{only in assigning}\ \mathrm{d}\ \mbox{to}\ \alpha\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{ix.} \quad \mbox{For}\ \varphi\ \mbox{a formula and}\ \alpha\ \mbox{a variable:}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \exists \alpha\, \varphi \quad \mbox{iff}\ \ \mbox{for at least one}\ \mathrm{d} \in |\mathfrak{M}|,  \ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s[\alpha\!:\, d]}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{where}\ \mathrm{s[\alpha\!:\, d]}\ \mbox{differs from}\ \mathrm{s}\ \mbox{only in assigning}\ \mathrm{d}\ \mbox{to}\ \alpha\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==

The following continue the examples used when describing extended variable assignments above.  They are based on the examples of [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|the previous page]].

=== A model and variable assignment for examples ===

Suppose we have model &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; where

: &lt;math&gt;|\mathfrak{M}|\ =\ \{1,\, 2,\, 3\}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(a^0_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(b^0_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(c^0_0)\ =\ 2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(f^2_0)\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0\ \mbox{such that:} \quad \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 0) = 2,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 1)\ =\ 1,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 2) = 0,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::::: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 0) = 1,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 1)\ =\ 0,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 2) = 2,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 0) = 0,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::::: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 1) = 2,\ \mbox{and}\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 2) = 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F^2_0})\ =\ \{&lt;\!0,\ 1\!&gt;,\ &lt;\!1,\ 2\!&gt;,\ &lt;\!2,\ 1\!&gt;\}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose further we have a variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; where:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(x_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(y_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(z_0)\ =\ 2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


We already saw that both of the following resove to 1:

: &lt;math&gt;f(a, b)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Examples without quantifiers ===

Given model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|the previous page]] noted the following further goals:

: &lt;math&gt;(1) \quad \mathrm{F}(a, b),\ \mathrm{F}(b, c),\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ \mbox{are True in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(2) \quad \mathrm{F}(a, a)\ \mbox{is False in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(3) \quad \mathrm{F}(a, f(a, b))\ \mbox{is True in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(4) \quad \mathrm{F}(f(a, b), a)\ \mbox{is False in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(5) \quad \mathrm{F}(c, b) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ \mbox{is True in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(6) \quad \mathrm{F}(c, b) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(b, a)\ \mbox{is False in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We are not yet ready to evaluate for truth or falsity, but we can take a step in that direction by seeing that these sentences are satisfied by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  Indeed, the details of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; will not figure in dertermining which of these are satisfied.  Thus   
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; satisfies (or fails to satisfy) them with any variable assignment.  As we will see on the next page, that is the criterion for truth (or falsity) in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.


Corresponding to (1),

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(a, b),\ \mathrm{F}(b, c),\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In particular:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(a),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!0,\, 1\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(b, c)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(b),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(c)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!1,\, 2\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(c),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!2,\, 1\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Corresponding to (2) through (6) respectively:

As noted above, the details of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; were not relevant to these evaluations.  But for similar formulae using free variables instead of constant symbols, the details or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; do become relevant.  Examples based the above are:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(x, y)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(x),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(y)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!0,\, 1\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(y, z)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(y),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(z)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!1,\, 2\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(z, y)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(z),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(y)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!2,\, 1\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(x, x))\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(x),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(x)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!0,\, 0\!&gt;\ \notin\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(x, f(x, y))\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(x),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(f(x, y))\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!0,\, 1\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(f(x, y), x)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(f(x, y),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(x)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!1,\, 0\!&gt;\ \notin\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(z, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(x, y)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(x, y)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(z, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(z, y)\ \mbox{but}\ &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(y, x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Examples with quantifiers ===

Given model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|the previous page]] also noted the following further goals:

:&lt;math&gt;(7) \quad \forall x\, \forall y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x))\ \mbox{is false in }\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(8) \quad \exists x\, \exists y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x))\ \mbox{is true in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Again, we are not yet ready to evaluate for truth or falsity, but again we can take a step in that direction by seeing that the sentence in (7) is and the sentence in (8) is not satisfied by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Corresponding to (7):

: &lt;math&gt;(9) \quad &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \forall x\, \forall y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is true if and only if at least one of the following is true:

: &lt;math&gt;(10) \quad &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 0]\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \forall y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(11) \quad &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 1]\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \forall y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(12) \quad &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 2]\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \forall y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The formula of (7) and (9) is satisfied by &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is satified by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with each of the modified variable assignments.  Turn this around, and we get the formula failing to be satisfied by &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it fails to be satisfied by the model with at least one of the three modified variable assignments as per (10) through (12).  Similarly, (10) is true if and only if at least one of the following are true:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 0,\ y\!:\, 0]\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 0,\ y\!:\, 1]\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 0,\ y\!:\, 2]\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed, the middle one of these is true.  This is because

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!0,\, 1\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \mbox{but}\, &lt;\!1,\, 0\!&gt;\ \not\in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus (9) is true.


Corresponding to (8),

: &lt;math&gt;(13) \quad &lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \exists x\, \exists y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is true if and only if at least one of the following is true:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 0]\!&gt;\ \vDash \exists y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 1]\!&gt;\ \vDash \exists y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 2]\!&gt;\ \vDash \exists y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The middle of these is true if and only if at least one of the following are true:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 1,\ y\!:\, 0]\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 1,\ y\!:\, 1]\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, 1,\ y\!:\, 2]\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed, the last of these is true.  This is because:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!1,\, 2\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \mbox{and}\, &lt;\!2,\, 1\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus (13) is true.</text>

Penia is a sweet bread of Italian origin which is traditionally made at Easter time.

==Ingredients==
* 6 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/2  [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120g) of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] melted
* 1.5  [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] cakes (or 3 packs of dried yeast, use 2 when making 6 eggs)
* 1/4  [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120ml) of warm water 
* Juice and zest of 2 lemons OR
* 1  [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbl]] lemon extract 
* 1  [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fl oz]] anise extract (1 small bottle) 
* 6  [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbl]] anise seed (1 bottle)
* 1  [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 5-6  [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (enough to feel right)

==Procedure==
# Dissolve the yeast cakes (yeast cakes seem to work better than dry yeast) in the warm water and set aside
# Beat eggs until fluffy
# Add sugar and beat
# Add melted butter and beat--add salt
# Add the juices and spices next
# Next add the water-yeast mix and stir until well blended
# Add flour, mix until ready for kneading
# Knead thoroughly (until dough springs back when finger-poked)
# Allow dough to rise overnight, 12 hours or doubled in size 
# Shape the 7 or so portions into round loaves or into the shape of dolls
# Allow to rise for 2 to 3 hours
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] at 275°-300° F (around 140 - 160c) for 15-20 minutes

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Alternately it is shaped into a couple of large rings with shell-on hard boiled eggs embedded in the dough at the cardinal points. The eggs were a symbol of resurrection and the four directions the sign of the cross.

Don't forget the sweet glaze; 1lb (450g) of [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|confectioners' sugar]] enough water to make it spreadable. Spread on each loaf and cover generously with colorful sprinkles!

'''Motor Vehicle Accidents'''

----
It seems driving a car is ease to learn and difficult to master.  In fact the environment of  a modern automobile with emphasis on comfort and quiet smooth ride and with numerous opportunities for quelling what is usually a tedious experience of careening along a well constructed modern highway at high speed.  Inattention then to the potential hazard close at hand which can result from the rapid unexpected deceleration of the vehicle in the face of a collision.  Safety improvements have also accompanied the evolution of the automobile to be sure  beginning with seat belts then air  bags and evolving toward collision warning and driver consciousness monitoring, perhaps including measures to prevent a drunk from becoming a drunk driver. Some of these advances may make serious collisions more survivable thus increasing the volume of high energy extremity fractures to be treated.   Regulation of driving with speed limits and video surveillance and public awareness measures pointing out the statistical relatedness of young drivers accidents and distractions, number of passengers, radio, eating cell phones, night driving.  Legislation pits interest groups in ways which lead to compromise which do not always lead to a priority on safety but rather a balance of safety and commerce.  Even the evolution of community planning which may lessen commuting negate the motivation for larger vehicles which offer some protection but more of a false sense of security and in some cases longer break time, and inferior collision avoidance capability.  Roads and communities that do not pit drivers against heavy truck traffic may offer solutions.  

While we wait for these social and technological advances we contend with injuries sustained from motor vehicle related trauma on our highways.  We continue to develop new ways to meet our need for speed in our recreational activities, through ATV's,  snowmobiles, personal watercraft and aircraft.  The issues are largely the same from an orthopedic standpoint once a living victim has arrived at the emergency department.  Injury prevention issues surrounding technological advances and regulation sometimes fueled by litigation continue to change our habits balancing our desires for safety and thrill.

Speed limits.

The issue of maximum speed limits is controversial. The argument in favor of a 55 mile per hour limit was based of safety. Today the same safety argument can lead to increasing the allowed speed limit when it is recognized that the ambient rate of speed is well in excess of the posted limit fewer accidents may occur by increasing the speed limit. This approach would seem to reflect a more nuanced understanding of driving habit. There are drivers who observe the posted limit no matter what, and then there are drivers who drive at what they believe to be a safe speed, when the posted limit seems too slow.  This second category can be distinguished from a group that routinely drives at a reckless rate of speed well above the posted limit and in fact, well in excess of the ambient flow of traffic. The lowest rate of accidents may be achieved by matching the limit to what a reasonable driver is likely to feel is a safe rate of travel for a given road.  

Driving Age.

The rite of passage we associate with the coming of age 16 is being reconsidered in view of statistics recognizing automotive deaths as the leading cause of death among 16 to 20 year olds accounting for twice the fatalities of the next category which is homocide according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  

Over the last 10 years there has been a 12% drop in the licensure rates of 16 year olds such that presently 30% of 16 year olds hold licenses. This trend has accompanied a 26% drop in fatalities, in 16 year old drivers and their passengers. The costs of insuring a 16 year old may be partly motivating this trend as adding a 16 year old to a policy will generally double the premium, and when they are the primary driver of the vehicle, it triples the premium.

'''Interpersonal violence'''

----
Understanding the social context of our patients with trauma can only help us deliver effective care. Interpersonal violence is seemingly a legacy of our evolution as it is prevalent in chimpazees and in neanderthal remains.  Patterns of interpersonal violence seem to be set early in life and relate in all cases to concern for social status, thus stratification within society with regard to economic and social privilege.  

The natural man has only two primal passions, to get and to beget.
William Osler 

With this quote in mind we consider the thinking of Edward O. Wilson (EdwinWilson) who points out that our planet will be reaching what may be a Malthusian limit of 8 billion individuals within the next two decades.  It will increasingly be the tendency for all to want the overconsumption of resources that we in the western enclave have come to expect.  In view of these facts we can expect that interpersonal violence with increasing sophistication will continue to evolve, terrorism being its most dramatic manifestation;  interpersonal violence writ large.

Society begins with the desire for personal security derived from association with a group.  Efficiencies are gained such that the individual is free to function productively without the burden of attending to their personal security and that of their family, at least under ideal circumstances.   

A collective defense in the form of a military and police  establishes an effective monopoly on purposeful violence. The power of this need to live free of the fear of random violence means a willingness at times to accept the potential for a tyrrany imposed by the government.  While no system of government is fail safe in this regard, system of government must include provision for the will of the people to be made known and for the mantle of authority to change hands in a peaceful and orderly fashion that reflects that will.  Where that right is abridged one can expect the eventual degradation of the government, individual and collective violence against the government which appears to be imposing a tyrrany.  Our own government employes a system of checks and balances dividing power between coequal branches 

The practice of a collective effort for mutual protection  then provides template for  all other collective efforts yielding the bulk of what we have come to enjoy as the accoutrements of life in modern society.  Little can be achieved by an individual acting alone without the direct or indirect support of others.  The shared interests of the group which function in a coordinated fashion towards a mutually agreed end it thereby actuated.

Reseach in the area of cognitive neuroscience is leading to a greater understanding of the neurological mechanisms that are the underpinnings of our sense of justice and morality.  It seems that some aspects are innate and others a function of socialization. Most of our thoughts in a given day are indeed devoted to contemplating interactions with our fellow humans, either retrospectively or prospectively, so our thinking mechanisms are largely employed most of the time towards the analysis or at least contemplation of such matters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Under [[Programming:PHP:sessions#Using Sessions|Using Sessions]], the first example of registering a session name (second code box) uses 
 session_register(&quot;example&quot;);
Shouldn't this be
 session_register($example);
I'm new to PHP (which is why I'm reading the guide, of course), but it seems as though keeping it how it's printed would set the session name to &quot;example,&quot; not &quot;Test.&quot;

(of course it goes on to say that session_register is deprecated, so this suddenly becomes a moot point)

--[[User:Sigafoos|Sigafoos]]


A quick visit to http://nl3.php.net/session_register learns us that the parameter for session_register should be a string and not a (as what i suspect you mean) reference to a variable.

so in short: it should be
 session_register(&quot;example&quot;);</text>

[[Image:Margarita.jpg|thumb|150px|Margarita]]

The '''margarita''' is the most common of all tequila-based [[Bartending/Cocktails|cocktails]]. There are three main ingredients in a margarita: Tequila, Triple Sec, and lime juice. The traditional recipe is 3:2:1 – three parts Tequila, two parts Triple Sec and one part lime juice; however, the IBA standard is 7:4:3 = (50% tequila, 29% Triple Sec, 21% fresh lime or lemon juice), which keeps 50% tequila, but uses slightly less Triple Sec and correspondingly slightly more lime juice.

Other orange flavored liqueurs are frequently substituted for Triple Sec; Cointreau is most common, but there are many alternatives.

The rim of the glass is often, but not always, salted.

Traditional tequilas are dry, and served without ice; however, one may prepare sweet tequilas, often with other fruit juices such as pineapple, or serve over ice, or even blended. These sweet and iced variants are looked down upon by traditionalists, and despised as “party drinks”, but frequently served at parties.

==Brief Recipe==
* salt rim of cocktail glass
* mix tequila, triple sec, and lime juice (3:2:1)
* shake, strain

==General Recipe==
===Ingredients===
* Tequila – or mezcal, or [[w:sotol|sotol]]
*:Blanco (unaged) is most common and recommended, but reposado (aged under 1 year) is also often used, and añejo (aged 1 to 3 years) is sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/481452  Margarita - Blanco or Reposado], Chowhound&lt;/ref&gt; The issue is that tequila is the focus of the drink, and conversely the margarita is the most common tequila cocktail. Blanco is most assertive, and the purest expression of agave, while reposado is gentler and with somewhat less agave and a little wood (from oak); añejo has less agave taste and makes a very gentle margarita.
*:100% agave is recommended, as it is the focus; mixto (less than 100% agave) is significantly cheaper, but of inferior quality. If cost is an issue or if very sugary, mixto may prove acceptable, though one should compare with 100% agave before serving.
*:Widely varying grades of tequila are used in margaritas, from the cheapest grade to the fanciest. This significantly affects the quality and the cost, and comparison is strongly recommended.
* Orange liqueur
*:[[w:Triple sec|Triple sec]] is most common, and cheap; brands vary in quality and price. Cointreau is a common substitute, and significantly more expensive, but considered by many to be far superior to triple sec. Grand Marnier is another well-respected orange liqueur, of similar quality and price to Cointreau, while Patrón Citrónge is a more recent addition, somewhat cheaper than both, and Gran Gala is an Italian version that is again somewhat cheaper. There are ''many'' alternatives for orange liqueur, some little-known and little-advertised; [[w:Curaçao liqueur|curaçaos]] may also be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohgo.sh/archive/orange-liqueur-showdown/ The Great Oh Gosh! Orange Liqueur Showdown], part of [http://ohgo.sh/category/cocktails/orange-liqueur-showdown/ Orange Liqueur Showdown series]; see especially [http://ohgo.sh/archive/orange-liqueur-awards/ Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;
*:Issues to consider in orange liqueur include: alcohol content – orange liqueurs vary in alcohol content from 15% to 40% (30 to 80 proof); neutral spirits base (such as Cointreau) or brandy base (such as Grand Marnier) – this affects taste and color; and price – generic triple sec adds negligibly to the price of a margarita (compared to tequila), while name brands can double the price.
* Citrus juice – or other fruit juice
*:Most often fresh lime juice, ideally from [[w:key lime|key limes]]; Persian limes are most common in stores, however. One can also use other citrus such as lemon, or even others such as grapefruit, though this is properly a variant. One may even use other fruit juices (as is common in [[Bartending/Cocktails/Daquiri|daquiris]]), though this should be flagged.
*:''Fresh'' lime juice is strongly recommended, and considered a ''defining characteristic;'' one may use Rose’s lime juice or [[Cookbook:Sour mix|sour mix]], but this yields a ''significantly'' sweeter drink due to added sugar, and is considered deeply inferior.
* Salt
*:Generally coarse salt is used; one may also use fine salt, or various flavored salts or sugar (of various fineness) instead.
* Simple syrup
*:Some serve ''sweet'' tequilas; this is most easily accomplished by using simple syrup, sour mix or pre-packaged “tequila mixes”. Sweet margaritas are looked down upon as “party drinks”, and subtle details of the tequila or orange liqueur tend to be masked by the overwhelming sugar flavor, but they are widely served at parties.
[[File:Margarita glass 300x441.jpg|thumb|upright|The margarita glass may be used, particularly when serving a blended fruit margarita.]]
* Glass
*:Most formally a cocktail glass is used, as the classic margarita is a classic drink. Alternatively one may use an old-fashioned glass, particularly if serving on the rocks, or serve in a specialized [[w:margarita glass|margarita glass]], particularly when serving with a blended fruit margarita.

===Ratios===
Ratios vary; they almost universally adhere to the order of tequila, triple sec, lime: the focus is tequila, and extra lime would yield a very sour drink.
*'''2:1:1''' = 6:3:3 (50% tequila, 25% Triple Sec, 25% lime).
*'''3:2:1''' = 6:4:2 (50% tequila, 33% Triple Sec, 17% lime).
*'''3:1:1''' = 6:2:2 (60% tequila, 20% Triple Sec, 20% lime).
*'''1:1:1''' = 6:6:6 (33% tequila, 33% Triple Sec, 33% lime) – a very sour variant.
*IBA standard: 7:4:3 = (50% tequila, 29% Triple Sec, 21% lime),
*:in the amounts of 35 ml (seven parts) tequila; 20 ml (four parts) Cointreau or Triple Sec; and 15 ml (three parts) lemon or lime juice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iba-world.com/english/cocktails/margar.php IBA – Margarita]&lt;/ref&gt;

For overall amounts, one often uses 1.5 oz. or 2 oz. of tequila; the juice of half a lime is then enough. A cocktail glass, in which a margarita is generally served, can hold 2 such margaritas (assuming no ice), as reflected in the IBA standard quantities, and margaritas are mostly alcohol, so a full cocktail glass of margarita is a significant amount of alcohol.

===Procedure===
#''(Optional)'' Salt the rim – rub the rim of a cocktail glass with a lime wedge (or half) or paper towel, dip in coarse salt.
#:One often takes care to coat only the ''outside'' of the rim by only rubbing the outside with the lime or towel, and rotating the outside of the rim through a salt dish (rather than dipping the entire rim into a dish of salt), and then shaking (after a brief pause for drying), so that the salt does not fall into the drink.
#:One may also salt half the rim, or salt most of the rim but leave a gap, allowing the drinker the option of a salted or unsalted rim.
#:More simply, one may ''ask'' the drinker their preference.
#:Salt may be omitted as interfering with the flavor of the tequila, or used to mask the flavor of an inferior tequila.
#:Alternatively, for sweet tequilas one may use ''sugar'' instead on the rim.
#:One may pre-salt glasses, as this is time-consuming and there is little loss from doing so ahead of time.
# Mix tequila, orange liqueur, and citrus juice.
# Shake (over ice)
#:One may alternatively ''stir,'' but shaking is preferred for mixing with fruit juices, and the tequila is a strong drink, so the ice shards of shaking are of little consequence or even a benefit.
# Strain
#:Some serve tequila on the rocks, though more purely it is served strained.
#''(Optional)'' Garnish with a lime wedge or slice.

===Sample amounts===
3:2:1:
*1.5 ozs. tequila
*1 oz. orange liqueur
*.5 oz. lime juice

2:1:1:
*2 ozs. tequila 
*1 oz. orange liqueur
*1 oz. lime juice

(Optional): salt for rim

==Variations==
===Pre-Mixed Margarita===
*2/3 cup margarita mix
*1/3 cup generic tequila.
 
Serve in a sugar or salt rimmed glass, on the rocks or with crushed ice.

===Ice-blended Margarita===
[[Image:Blended Margarita.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A Blended Margarita]]
&lt;br&gt;
*1 ½ oz. Tequila
*½ oz. orange liqueur
*½ oz. lime juice plus 1 lime wedges
*1 ½ cups ice cubes
&lt;br&gt;
====Procedure====
#In a blender, combine the ingredients and blend until slushy. 
#Pour into prepared margarita glass and serve with a lime wedge.
&lt;br&gt;

===Fruit Juice===
Fruit juices can also be added to a Margarita. Examples of such combinations that go well are:
*Lime juice with raspberry.
*Strawberry or peach, with lemon juice.

Note, however, that fruit Margaritas are not recognised as part of the standard Margarita repertoire.

===Prickly Pear Margarita===
=====Ingredients:=====
*2 1/2 oz Prickly Pear Infused Tequila (Voodoo Tiki Desert Rose) &lt;br&gt;
*1/2 oz triple sec &lt;br&gt;
*2 oz sour mix &lt;br&gt;
*1/2 oz orange juice&lt;br&gt; 
*dash of grenadine to color&lt;br&gt; 
*sugar coated lime wheel for garnish&lt;br&gt; 
*salt or sugar for rimming&lt;br&gt;
=====Preparation:=====
#Pour the ingredients into a cocktail shaker with ice.
#Shake well.
#Strain into a chilled margarita glass with a sugar or salt rim.
#Garnish with a sugar coated lime wheel.

==1. Name at least three kinds of bases upon which paper models may be shaped.==
[[Image:Papier mache.jpg|thumb|right|Papier-mâché around a form such as a balloon to create a pig. The balloon is popped when the glue hardens.]]
When wet, paper maché has very little form and will not hold its shape.  So the first step in making a paper maché project is to make a base onto which the paper maché is applied.  Bases can be made from many different items, including:
#'''Balloons:''' Inflate a balloon and tape other items onto it, such as paper cups, toilet paper rolls, or other items.  
#'''Plastic bottles:''' Attach golf tees for legs to turn a plastic bottle into an animal (such as a pig).
#'''Aluminum Foil:''' Press the foil around a person's face to get an image of it.  If the subject wears glasses, leave them on.  Carefully remove the foil and place crumpled newspaper into it to help hold the shape.
#'''Paper Plates:''' These make an excellent base for constructing a mask.
#'''Cardboard Boxes:''' Use small cardboard boxes such as those in which many food items are packaged.
#'''Wire and Wire Mesh:''' Form wire into the desired shape.  Especially useful for this is fencing wire (such as chicken wire) and gutter guard mesh.  Hardware cloth is a little too stiff to work with.

==2. There are two main types of paper maché:==
===a. Know how to prepare successful pulp===
Pulp is paper which has been shredded into tiny pieces.  First tear the paper (newsprint works well) into small pieces.  In some instances, this will be good enough, but if you need finer pulp, throw the paper into a blender with some water.  You can also get good raw material from an office paper shredder.  When the pulp is as fine as you desire, add white glue and wallpaper paste.  Amounts are not given here - you need to experiment to find a consistency that works well for what you are tring to do.  Once it's mixed with glue, the pulp can be shaped like clay, or you can layer it onto a base.

===b. Know how to prepare the glue===
* 6 cups water
* 1 cup flour
Mix the flour into the water thoroughly with your hands, being sure to break up all the lumps.  You might try heating the mixture too, but do not let it come to a boil.  You can vary the amount of flour or water to make the glue thicker or thinner.  Experiment to find what works best for you.  

You can also add a few tablespoons of bleach to retard the growth of mold, but make sure everyone who is going to use the paste knows that you did this - after all, flour and water are the same ingredients that you use to make bread, and you don't want your Pathfinders performing any taste-tests on a bleach-laden batch of glue!

Glue is used with strips of paper which are layered onto the base.  When the glue dries, the paper stays in place and binds together forming a (hopefully) beautiful sculpture.

==3. Be familiar with all ingredients and know why they are used.==

:Here are some thoughts on the paste from Wikipedia: [[w:Paper maché|Paper Maché]]

:Paper-mâché paste is the substance that holds the paper together. The traditional method of making paper-mâché paste is to add one part water to one part flour. Some artists prefer to boil the paste, saying that it makes the consistency smoother. Water to flour ratio is changed to five parts water to one part flour in this case. Other artists use a three to one or a one to one ratio of water and Polyvinyl acetate (PVA glue). Still others say that starch makes a fine paste. Adding a dash of cinnamon to the mixture gives the paste a pleasant smell; adding a dash of salt reduces the chances of the product developing mold.

==5. Make, paint and varnish at least two articles from paste and paper strips.==
==6. Submit articles to examiner and have workmanship approved.==

As the instructor, you will be responsible for judging the workmanship of the projects.  The most important consideration is that you apply a fair standard and not show favoritism.  Pathfinders are quickly able to detect unfairness, as it is an extremely important concept to them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">MATLAB offers incomparable control over the way you can add details to your plot. From inserting text at the right positions to labelling the axes, MATLAB from the command line offers you an easy way to create publication style graphics. With support for Encapsulated PostScript and Adobe Illustrator output. Complex figures with several axes and conveying large amounts of information can be created.

==Concept of a handle==

Most operations on figures generate objects with a set of properties. Users familiar with object-oriented programming would realize that the functions and the data are encapsulated into the object. A typical figure would contain at least half a dozen objects. These objects are called handles. A very tacky analogy would be like handles to several different refrigerators with several different contents. To provide an intuitive feel. I have listed out the properties from a text handle.

== Finding a handle ==
Various commands provide required handles, for example:
 h = gcf; % Get current figure
 h = gca; % Get current axis

==Examples==
=== Axis Label ===
xlabel labels the x-axis of the current plot.

&lt;pre&gt;&gt;&gt;xlabel('string')
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can display text on two lines or insert the value of variables

&lt;pre&gt;&gt;&gt;xlabel({['First Line or line n° ',int2str(a)],['Second Line or line n°',int2str(b)]})
&lt;/pre&gt;

ylabel labels the y-axis of the current plot. It works in same way of xlabel, but the output is vertical in 2D plots.

=== Documenting a Maximum Value ===
 % Previous code set the x value of the peak data point into x_peak
 plot(lags(1:1000:end),abs_cs(1:1000:end));
 ptitle = 'UUT and Source Correlation Score Magnitude';
 xlabel('Lag');
 ylabel('Correlation Magnitude');
 title(ptitle);
 yloc = max(get(gca,'YLim')); % Put at top of plot
 text(lags(x_peak),yloc,[' \leftarrow ' num2str(x_peak) 'ns']);
 lstr{1} = sprintf(' Test %d', TESTNUM);
 lstr{2} = sprintf(' Unit %d%s', UNITNUM, comparestr);
 text(lags(1),mean(get(gca,'YLim')),lstr);

Ingredients that are available all year. Some of these ingredients may have a specific season, when their quality or production is highest, but they can be produced naturally all year round. For more detailed information on seasonality, consult the [[Cookbook:Seasonality|seasonality]] page or the relevant paragraph on the ingredient page.

There are different ways to extend Python:
* In plain C, using Python.h
* Using Swig
* Using Boost.Python, optionally with Py++ preprocessing
* Using Cython.

This page describes [http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/ Boost.Python]. Before the emergence of Cython, it was the most comfortable way of writing [[C++]] extension modules.

Boost.Python comes bundled with the [http://www.boost.org/ Boost C++ Libraries]. To install it on an Ubuntu system, you might need to run the following commands
 $ sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev 
 $ sudo apt-get install python-dev

==A Hello World Example==
===The C++ source code (hellomodule.cpp)===
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

void say_hello(const char* name) {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello &quot; &lt;&lt;  name &lt;&lt; &quot;!\n&quot;;
}

#include &lt;boost/python/module.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/python/def.hpp&gt;
using namespace boost::python;

BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(hello)
{
    def(&quot;say_hello&quot;, say_hello);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===setup.py===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python

from distutils.core import setup
from distutils.extension import Extension

setup(name=&quot;PackageName&quot;,
    ext_modules=[
        Extension(&quot;hello&quot;, [&quot;hellomodule.cpp&quot;],
        libraries = [&quot;boost_python&quot;])
    ])
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can build our module with

 python setup.py build

The module `hello.so` will end up in e.g `build/lib.linux-i686-2.4`.

===Using the extension module===
Change to the subdirectory where the file `hello.so` resides. In an interactive python session you can use the module as follows.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import hello
 &gt;&gt;&gt; hello.say_hello(&quot;World&quot;)
 Hello World!

== An example with CGAL ==
Some, but not all, functions of the CGAL library have already Python bindings. Here an example is provided for a case without such a binding and how it might be implemented. The example is taken from the [http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.3/doc_html/cgal_manual/SearchStructures/Chapter_main.html#Subsection_46.5.1 CGAL Documentation].

&lt;source lang=&quot;Cpp&quot;&gt;
// test.cpp
using namespace std;

/* PYTHON */
#include &lt;boost/python.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/python/module.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/python/def.hpp&gt;
namespace python = boost::python;

/* CGAL */
#include &lt;CGAL/Cartesian.h&gt;
#include &lt;CGAL/Range_segment_tree_traits.h&gt;
#include &lt;CGAL/Range_tree_k.h&gt;

typedef CGAL::Cartesian&lt;double&gt; K;
typedef CGAL::Range_tree_map_traits_2&lt;K, char&gt; Traits;
typedef CGAL::Range_tree_2&lt;Traits&gt; Range_tree_2_type;

typedef Traits::Key Key;
typedef Traits::Interval Interval;

Range_tree_2_type *Range_tree_2 = new Range_tree_2_type;

void create_tree()   {

  typedef Traits::Key Key;                
  typedef Traits::Interval Interval;    

  std::vector&lt;Key&gt; InputList, OutputList;
  InputList.push_back(Key(K::Point_2(8,5.1), 'a'));
  InputList.push_back(Key(K::Point_2(1.0,1.1), 'b'));
  InputList.push_back(Key(K::Point_2(3,2.1), 'c'));

  Range_tree_2-&gt;make_tree(InputList.begin(),InputList.end());
  Interval win(Interval(K::Point_2(1,2.1),K::Point_2(8.1,8.2)));
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n Window Query:\n&quot;;
  Range_tree_2-&gt;window_query(win, std::back_inserter(OutputList));
  std::vector&lt;Key&gt;::iterator current=OutputList.begin();
  while(current!=OutputList.end()){
      std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;  &quot; &lt;&lt; (*current).first.x() &lt;&lt; &quot;,&quot; &lt;&lt; (*current).first.y()
           &lt;&lt; &quot;:&quot; &lt;&lt; (*current).second &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      current++;
    }
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n Done\n&quot;;
}

void initcreate_tree() {;}

using namespace boost::python;
BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(test)
{
    def(&quot;create_tree&quot;, create_tree, &quot;&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;Cpp&quot;&gt;
// setup.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
 
from distutils.core import setup
from distutils.extension import Extension
 
setup(name=&quot;PackageName&quot;,
    ext_modules=[
        Extension(&quot;test&quot;, [&quot;test.cpp&quot;],
        libraries = [&quot;boost_python&quot;])
    ])
&lt;/source&gt;

We then compile and run the module as follows:
 $ python setup.py build
 $ cd build/lib*
 $ python
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import test
 &gt;&gt;&gt; test.create_tree()
 Window Query:
  3,2.1:c
  8,5.1:a
 Done
 &gt;&gt;&gt;

== Handling Python objects and errors ==
One can also handle more complex data, e.g. Python objects like lists. The attributes are accessed with the extract function executed on the objects &quot;attr&quot; function output. We can also throw errors by telling the library that an error has occurred and returning. In the following case, we have written a C++ function called &quot;afunction&quot; which we want to call. The function takes an integer N and a vector of length N as input, we have to convert the python list to a vector of strings before calling the function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;Cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
using namespace std;

void _afunction_wrapper(int N, boost::python::list mapping) {

    int mapping_length = boost::python::extract&lt;int&gt;(mapping.attr(&quot;__len__&quot;)());
    //Do Error checking, the mapping needs to be at least as long as N 
    if (mapping_length &lt; N) {
        PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ValueError,
            &quot;The string mapping must be at least of length N&quot;);
        boost::python::throw_error_already_set();
        return;
    }

    vector&lt;string&gt; mystrings(mapping_length);
    for (int i=0; i&lt;mapping_length; i++) {
        mystrings[i] = boost::python::extract&lt;char const *&gt;(mapping[i]);
    }

   //now call our C++ function
   _afunction(N, mystrings);

}

using namespace boost::python;
BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(c_afunction)
{
    def(&quot;afunction&quot;, _afunction_wrapper);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

!style=&quot;background:#ffe080&quot;|The requirements listed for this honor are those proposed to the NAD.  The NAD has accepted the honor, but has not yet released the '''official''' requirements.  It is not known whether the official requirements differ from the proposed requirements, but once that information is available, this page will be updated.&lt;p&gt;
The NAD has recently adopted the practice of not releasing the official requirements (and answers) until after the honor patches have been received by Advent''Source''.  This takes several months, so we expect to see the official documentation sometime in the summer of {{{1}}}.  Releasing the information sooner (as has been done in the past) causes an undue burden on Advent''Source'', because they receive many phone calls asking about the tokens.

== THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH UMBRACO VERSION 3 OR 4 ==

By Claus Nedergaard – Nedergaard Design &amp; Marketing, Denmark.

A guide to the First time Installation of

* IIS 5.1
* .Net Framework 
* MSDE 2000
* Database Manager
* Umbraco CMS 2.1.1 
* additional copies of Umbraco CMS 2.1.1

on Windows XP Professional

=== Install IIS 5.1 on Win XP Pro ===

* Choose Control Panel -&gt; Add Programs.
* Choose Add/Remove Windows components – then pick IIS and press next. ( You need the XP Pro cd for this). And then Finish.
* Now you have the Inetpub folder on your root directory – C:\inetpub. It contains the web, mail, ftp folders

=== Install .NET Framework on Win XP Pro ===

* Autorun the Win XP Pro cd. From the menu choose install .Net Framework. Follow the onscreen instructions
- or -
* Download the .NET Framework 1.1 from [http://www.microsoft.com/ Microsoft] and install it

* Restart the computer

=== Install MSDE on Win XP Pro ===

* Download and run MSDE200A installer from Microsoft
* Follow the on screen advice/commands. (unpacks files in c:\msde2000a
* Open DOS command prompt.
* Type -&gt; cd c:\msdeRelA
* Type-&gt; setup SAPWD=”YOURCHOISEOFPASSWORD” securitymode=SQL   –&gt; press enter  ( The default installation of msde uses windows authentication by default).
* Restart the computer

=== Install MSDE Manager on Win XP Pro ===

* Download and run Setup_DbaMgr2k
* Follow the onscreen instructions.

=== Install Umbraco 2.1.1 ===

* Create folder for website in c:\inetpub\wwwroot\’website name’
* Copy all files from the Umbraco21.zip folder to that folder.
* Change permissions for the ‘data, media, css, xslt,user controls’ folders. But first change the default file permissions for win xp. See below.

=== Change default file permissions for Win XP ===

* Pick Start -&gt; This Computer. 
* In the top menu choose Functions -&gt; Folder options. 
* Choose Show (Vis). 
* Uncheck the ‘Simple file sharing’ box.
* Now you can change the permissions. Pick all 5 folders (css, media, data, xslt, user controls) – right click and choose Properties.
* Pick Security tab. Pick Add..
* Type aspnet in the text box and click Ok.
* Check Modify (Redigering) to allow modify and write permission to aspnet account.

=== Create Website ===

* Open IIS and right click Default Site (Standardwebsted) -&gt; New -&gt; Virtual Folder.
* Follow the onscreen guide  -  Type website name and copy it.
* Choose folder (c:\inetpub\wwwroot\’website name’)
* Give read access and permission to run scripts (ASP). Finish the guide
* Cut the umbraco_client folder out of your webfolder and place it in the Default Site folder so it is at the same node (gren) as the website itself. (This seems silly but nevertheless necessary to make umbraco run in XP Pro).
* Right click the webfolder if necessary and make the root folder your websitefolder.

=== Create new database ===

* Create new database – Open Database Manager
* Choose databases -&gt; right click and pick ‘New Database’
* Enter database name and choose path for the database (c:\inetpub\wwwroot\’website name’\data\database_name)
* Save and close window
* Open Logins and type a Name and a Password in the ‘General tab’. In the ‘Default connection information’ you pick the database to attach the Login to.
* Pick the ‘Database access’ tab.  Choose your database by marking it. In the ‘Database roles’ you pick db_owner, db_datareader, db_datawriter. Save and close window
* Open database and right click on Users – pick New User. Type the login and Name that was created under Logins.  Check db_owner, db_reader, db_writer.

=== Edit Web.Config file ===

* Open with Wordpad. Go to the bottom where it says …&lt;appSettings&gt;
* Change the path name in these lines. Usually you have to add in the website name.

Default:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoReservedUrls&quot; value=&quot;,/umbracoTextGen.aspx,&quot;/&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoReservedPaths&quot; value=&quot;/umbraco/,/install&quot;/&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoContentXML&quot; value=&quot;/data/umbraco.xml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoStorageDirectory&quot; value=&quot;/data&quot;/&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoPath&quot; value=&quot;/umbraco&quot; /&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoDbDSN&quot; value=&quot;Server=127.0.0.1;
	Database=YOUR_DATABASE;User ID=YOUR_USER;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;
	Trusted_Connection=False&quot;/&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoSmtpServer&quot; value=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Edited:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoReservedUrls&quot; value=&quot;,/Website_name/umbracoTextGen.aspx,&quot;/&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoReservedPaths&quot; value=&quot;/Website_name/umbraco/,/Website_name/install&quot;/&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoContentXML&quot; value=&quot;/Website_name/data/umbraco.xml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoStorageDirectory&quot; value=&quot;/Website_name/data&quot;/&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoPath&quot; value=&quot;/Website_name/umbraco&quot; /&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoDbDSN&quot; value=&quot;Server=YourServerName;
	Database=YOUR_DATABASE;User ID=YOUR_USER;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;
	Trusted_Connection=False&quot;/&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoSmtpServer&quot; value=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Save and close the file.

=== Install Umbraco 2.1.1 ===

* Open Umbraco Interface in IE by typing your localhost and path – &quot;http://localhost/UmbracoDemo1/install/default.aspx&quot;
* In the Umbraco 2.1 Configuration Wizard first window press Next.
* Click Install and then Next.
* You should now be looking at a page saying…’Your permission settings are perfect!’ – Click Next.
* You might be asked to change your password. Change it!
* Open the Web.Config file. Go to the bottom and find this line…

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoConfigurationDone&quot; value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now you add 211 to that line…

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;add key=&quot;umbracoConfigurationDone&quot; value=&quot;211&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Save and close file. 
* Click Next. Download the WebSiteWizard package.
* Delete the install folder ’c:\inetpub\wwwroot\’website_name’\install’ 
* Login to Umbraco ‘http://localhost/website_name/umbraco’ and enter Username and Password. Username is always ‘umbraco’ as default. Password is what you chose in the configuration when you were asked to change it.
* Install sample website -  Go to ‘Developer’ section. Right click on ‘Macros’ -&gt; choose ‘Import Package’
* Follow onscreen instructions to configure sample website

===Getting the websiteWizard .umb package to work on your new Umbraco site===

If you have followed these instructions and put your copy of Unbraco in a subdirectory under your root directory (wwwroot\yoursite) then you will need to make some changes to the CSS and Template files of the websiteWizard.umb package after you install it if you want to see the site properly. After installing the websiteWizard package:

* open the template folder and edit the Main template. Add your path information to the CSS includes so that they are used to render the page. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/yoursite/css/wizard.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
* add your path information to the URLs for the header image and top background image. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/yoursite/&quot; title=&quot;Back to front page&quot; id=&quot;header&quot; style=&quot;background: 
url(/yoursite&lt;?UMBRACO_GETITEM field=&quot;headerImage&quot; recursive=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src='/include/emotions/wink.gif'/&gt;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
* open the Wizard CSS file and add your path information to the pullBackground.png reference so the graphic can be found.
&lt;pre&gt;
background: url(/yoursite/css/wizard/pullBackground.png);
&lt;/pre&gt;
At this point your Wizard based site should render as expected. Many thanks to Thomas Höhler for this tip. - Cecil Thornhill, USA

      <text xml:space="preserve">As a teacher nearing the end of my first year, I have learned so much!  A few things you can definitely expect:  

'''Everything you think you know will probably change  '''From what you expect from your students to your homework policy down to your lesson plans, you will discover things that work wonderfully and some things not at all.  My classroom has not been the most organized or most efficiently run this year.  So, I have already begun new plans for next year.  The biggest thing I am changing is my homework policy.  I did a really terrible job of getting my students to turn their work in on time, mostly because there was no accountability, but next year things are going to be different.  I am also changing the structure of my classroom.  Well, maybe I should say I am putting a firmer structure into place.  I have learned structure is everything!

'''Students will test you  '''As a new teacher, the students will try to get everything by you.  They want to see what they will be able to get away with.  You must begin being firm from the very start and let them know that you are in charge.

'''Lesson plans always change  '''It is difficult planning lessons too far in advance because inevitably something will happen that will put you behind.  Just learn to go with the flow, be flexible, and don't let it stress you out.

'''Spring is extremely busy  '''When other teachers tell you this, BELIEVE them.  I knew that the spring would be busy, but I had no idea it would be crazy.  Make sure during the fall semester that you are using your time wisely and covering as much information as possible, especially if you teach a TAKS subject.  When spring rolls around, you can expect lots of absent students for extracurricular activities and lots of catch-up work.  Just be prepared.

These are only a few things you should probably know before going into your first year; there are countless others.  Hopefully this will help!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

I am new with this but see that it really has a great potential for teaching and learning and would like to join.
Being a Math teacher I am involved with a program that also teaches Basic Math to people who have no idea about Math.
I saw the numbers Unit and realized that there could be useful addition to that because the basic numbers 
0,1,2...9  are just the basic symbols.  The next step is to explain the placement value notation and one can use this opportunity to tie it with different number bases (binary for example).

How do I go by adding a module?  Is it reviewed by others before it is being added?

I will appreciate if I could Email to ask specific questions for example:

what does this mean:  Place comments that start a new topic at the bottom of the page and give them == A Descriptive Header ==.

Historically, environmental issues in conflict with human growth and development, Green Politics pre-date the Agrarian Revolution. The individual's and group's survival often determined the direction of decision making based upon material needs. Thus, the individual and the group's needs were bound in the environmental security of all as well as the creation of a sustainable population. Political structures reflected the group's material needs.

Currently expressed in popular terms by corporate media and others as a &quot;political party,&quot; ''Green Politics'' has a much broader, deeper meaning. One significant example of the growth of Green Politics in the 20th Century occurred as environment, women, nuclear, and other like-minded groups joined together under the banner of Green Politics:

Green Politics - the four pillars of Green politics: ecology, nonviolence, social justice, and grassroots democracy. 

Green politics grew from a linking of social and environmental movements in response to the nation-states' cold war MAD (mutually assured destruction) nuclear policies, general environmental degradation worldwide, war, patriarchal top-down power structures, and civil liberties' issues. &quot;Green&quot; represents the color of the greatest mass of life on earth, and an easy umbrella with applicable connotations to help unify these diverse movements. Ecology's life focus and implications quickly became a central organizing principle.

Additionally, from a Green perspective, the cold war nations' economic systems of socialism, communism, and capitalism represent growth economies incompatible with human and non-human nature. For example, the Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA) advocated nuclear fusion research and development as do many Democrats and Republicans. Generalizing from an ecologically informed perspective, such developments are irresponsible and environmentally unethical. One soon sees how Green politics develops from the idea that ecology is the &quot;subversive&quot; science because its implications undermine the intellectual, ethical, and moral standing of previous political and economic ideologies. 

One &quot;lives&quot; Green politics to some degree. For Greens, applying the lessons of ecology to individual and social responsibility issues within the context of holistic thinking and action creates an obvious need for participatory democracy. &quot;Politics&quot; in this sense becomes a daily activity, series of choices, and continuing social and life sciences education. Moreover, individual and social responsibility within an ecological context require this bottom-up approach to decision making. Noteworthy, although the most publicized, electoral politics under the Green umbrella represents but &quot;one leg&quot;of Green politics. (See Green Parties of the ASGP for an application of Green Politics in electoral politics.) 

Goals: Greens think that the dominant political and economic system will collapse (as it is ecologically) while ecological and political crises grow. Greens hope to create a Green society &quot;parallel&quot; to the dominant society and thereby mitigate the damages of collapsing ecological, economic, and political systems. (See The Ten Key Green Values and &quot;A Green Political Philosophy&quot; for more) The idea is to peacefully overgrow governments, the corporate state, and ruling ideologies in a peaceful, ecological manner. Greens are inherently pacifist.

&quot; In Green politics, we practice tenderness in relations with others; in caring for ideas, art, language, and culture; and in cherishing and protecting the Earth. To think Green is to build solidarity with those working for social justice and human rights everywhere, not bound by ideologies. -Petra Kelly&quot;(return to What Greens Think)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Green Politics and Technology'''

Green Politics posits the need for ''appropriate technology'' in the context of ecological relationships for the human species as well as all other native species-populations. 

Technology - Many Greens perceive technology as a way to liberate humanity from the drudgery and boring grind of physical labor. In this sense, technologies have a liberating destiny for humanity. Greens still question technology ruthlessly, because technology is either appropriate or inappropriate. 

Also, science, technology, and production are now fused in an attempt to continually increase production and consumption. As a result, inapproprite technologies flourish as this insatiable appetite for growth expands. Inappropriate technologies spread like plagues World-wide while commercial propaganda replaces vital information to extend inappropriate technologies.

Here's one way to understand inappropriate technologies: Firing a canon ball to ring a doorbell is an inappropriate use of technology, not so unlike using nuclear energy to produce electricity. The canon in this example also represents an inappropriate technology, many Greens will argue. &quot;Its destiny is implied by its design.&quot; 

Be that as it may, the canon's influence ends at the doorbell. However, the technologies of genetic engineering, for another example, alter life forms. Like the canon, genetic engineering has a destiny in its design; unlike the cannon, genetic engineering's destiny influences human and non-human nature well beyond the perceivable future. Ecological problems will probably grow exponentially because one in five non-indigenous (not native born) species, when introduced into a new habitat, dislodge indigenous (native born) species-populations.

Consequently, future generations may choose to ignore the canon's destiny and deny it a place in their society. But, they cannot choose to ignore genetic engineering's destiny or deny it a place in their society, since our generation embedded altered life-forrms in non-human nature. Ecological collapse will most likely occur if humanity fails to change its attitude toward nature. The same reasoning applies to other inappropriate technologies that risk life's ecological security, like nuclear energy.

==History of the camera==

The Red One Digital Cinema Camera was unveiled at the NAB Exhibition 2006 in Las Vegas. An &quot;Ultra-High-Definition&quot; digital camera, it has a custom Bayer Pattern sensor array (the &quot;Mysterium&quot;) with a resolution of 4900x2580 (4700x2540 active image area, 4520x2540 maximum recordable image area). It was designed as a replacement for traditional 35mm film cameras and has a number of recording resolutions including 2540p, 4k, 2k, 1080p, 1080i and 720p, though production models are limited to recording in 4k, 4k 16:9, QHD, 3k, and 2k, through sensor windowing. It is targeted specifically at the retail market and has a base price (without lenses or recorder) of $17,500. A number of RED accessories were simultaneously revealed, including two initial lenses, a 300mm prime and a 18-85mm zoom (though the camera will take standard PL and B4 mount lenses).  Recording is done through a mirrored RAID-0 array of 160 GB hard drives, totalling 320 GB, through a 128 GB Solid-State Drive, or through a Compact Flash Module, which records to 8 or 16 GB cards produced to RED's specifications.

The RED One records in a compressed RAW Bayer format which the company claims to be visually lossless, though filmmakers have discovered certain reproducible artifacts of the encoding mechanism.  While this allows the camera hardware to be produced at a reduced cost, comparable to other digital camcorders, which encode video onboard to an easily usable format, it also significantly complicates and extends post-production.  Native support of Redcode in Non-linear Editors is not widespread, or mature, so RED's post-production workflow relies on company provided software for online editing, such as Redcine, and Red Alert, to encode to a digital intermediate format, such as ProRes, or DNxHD.

*First 4k footage of the camera was shown at IBC 2006 in Amsterdam [http://ibc.org/cgi-bin/displaypage.cgi?pageref=1134]
*A provisional date of early 2007 was announced for retail to the public.

David Stump ASC has tested a &quot;Red&quot; lab prototype for exposure and on a greenscreen[http://www.cinematography.net/Red/red-greenscreen.html] but as of January 2007 development is not complete, and no stand-alone Red cameras exist yet. Many dp's that have invested in this technology have yet to figure out how they are going to edit with camera.

''The above information is outdated; the Red camera has since been released and several movies were shot using [[w:Red_Digital_Cinema_Camera_Company#List_of_films_shot_on_Red_One_cameras|Red camera]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Georgia Planning Act of 1989, [http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-2-8 O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8]'''

==General Description==
The Act gives the Georgia Department of Natural Resources the authority to establish minimum standards necessary to protect natural resources, including water resources.  The minimum standards relating to water include the following topics:  (1) watershed protection, including buffers and development density; (2) groundwater protection, including land use activities; (3) wetland protection, including land use and alteration of wetlands; (4) protection of river corridors; and (5) mountain protection, including regulation of wells and septic tanks.  The Department can adopt different standards for different areas of the state depending on the specifics of that area.

==Specific Protections==
Perennial river corridors are to be protected by a minimum 100 foot buffer on both sides, measured from the stream bank.  There is an exception for single-family homes, though any septic tank drainfield must be outside the buffer.  There is also an exception for roads and utilities under some circumstances. 

==Local and Regional Planning==
The statue requires local and regional governments to identify and map river corridors in conjunction with developing land use plans.  The statute then lists considerations that local land use plans must address.

      <text xml:space="preserve">it is important tu use double the amount of water then rice, to ensure that sushi nori can be rolled!

==Sake?==
Several recipes call for sake.  Is this a bad idea?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] ([[User talk:Jade Knight|talk]]) 14:16, 5 June 2008 (UTC)
: Someone has removed sake from this recipe a while ago. I've put it back. Don't see anything wrong with the idea, especially since it's optional here. --[[User:Alexey Feldgendler|X-Man]] ([[User talk:Alexey Feldgendler|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Alexey Feldgendler|contribs]]) 11:50, 16 January 2011 (UTC)

== Huge Unit Problem! ==

There's something wrong with the rice measurement.  1.5 cups does not equal 200 ml!  Which measure is correct?  The 1.5 cups or the 200 ml?

200 ml is about 0.85 cups

==Measurement Issues==

I've just altered this article to fix the problems with the incorrect measurements. I've also used traditional Japanese and metric measurements to reflect the Japanese origins of this recipe. [[User:Yukenoujo|Yukenoujo]] ([[User talk:Yukenoujo|talk]]) 00:19, 9 June 2009 (GMT)

== Amount of water ==

The amount of water in this recipe seems to have been fluctuating, and the edit summaries in the history are not helpful. In March 2010, I cooked sushi rice according to the then-latest version of the recipe [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Sushi_Rice&amp;oldid=1616924] (with 400 mL of water), and that was successful. Over the course of 2010, the amount of water changed to 350 mL [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Sushi_Rice&amp;diff=1754216&amp;oldid=1753647], then to 300 mL [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Sushi_Rice&amp;diff=1887809&amp;oldid=1870042], and finally to 320 mL [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Sushi_Rice&amp;diff=1928038&amp;oldid=1887810]. In January 2011, I cooked it again according to the newest revision, which this time called for 320 mL of water, and it was clearly not enough. I've changed the amount of water back to 400 mL now, since this worked for me and 320 mL didn't. The amounts of sugar and salt have been fluctuating, too, see difference between March 2010 and now [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook%3ASushi_Rice&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=2018207&amp;oldid=1616924]. I've changed them to the somewhat more precise older versions. --[[User:Alexey Feldgendler|X-Man]] ([[User talk:Alexey Feldgendler|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Alexey Feldgendler|contribs]]) 15:58, 13 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The '''''Triwizard Tournament''''' is a recently revived competition pitting three major European wizarding schools against one other, although it is also meant to foster magical cooperation.  The schools, listed below, share the responsibility of hosting the tournament, and the heads of the schools sit on the judging panel.

From ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', pg. 187 (US Edition), pg. 165 (UK edition) the exact description of this tournament was:

'A very exciting event, an event that has not been held for over a century ... was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turn to host the Tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities - until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the Tournament was discontinued.'

== Event Details ==

The tournament was introduced some 700 years ago. After being banned for many years due to the increasingly dangerous tasks, the Triwizard Tournament has been revived.

As mentioned in the overview, there are three schools participating:

*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]]
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang Institute]]

Judges grade the champions' performance on each task. The Heads of the three participating schools are customarily judges; Hermione reads this in a history book about the Tournament, and that all three school Headmasters were injured in a Tournament task mishap involving a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Cockatrice|Cockatrice]]. In the book ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', the judges were:

*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludovic Bagman]] ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], Department of Magical Games and Sports)
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch, Sr.]] (Ministry of Magic, Department of International Magical Cooperation)
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] (headmaster of Hogwarts)
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] (headmaster of Durmstrang)
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Olympe Maxime]] (headmistress of Beauxbatons)

The selection of the champions from each participating school is done through a magical object called the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]. The Goblet is a large, roughly hewn wooden cup, brimming with dancing blue flames. The selection process is described by Dumbledore:

''&quot;Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet. Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow night, Hallowe'en, the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete. To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation, I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line... I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end. The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become a champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet.&quot;''

The term ''champion'' does not mean the winner of the tournament. It instead refers to a contestant; this is an ancient usage, dating back to the days of chivalry. An army, or a king, could choose a champion who would fight for them; that champion would then meet an opposing champion, and the contest would be decided by single combat between the two. In this context, then, the Goblet is selecting the champion who will do battle to protect the school's good name.

Traditionally, there are three champions, as the tournament's name implied. Somehow, a fourth Champion was chosen.

*Beauxbatons Champion - [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]]
*Durmstrang Champion - [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]]
*Hogwarts Champion - [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hufflepuff House|Hufflepuff]])
*Hogwarts Champion - [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gryffindor House|Gryffindor]])

It is unknown initially how Harry's name was entered into the Goblet, or how he was selected; Dumbledore asks whether he had put his own name into the Goblet or had an older student do it for him, and Harry stated that he had not. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] suggests that Harry's name could have been submitted as the sole contender for a non-existent fourth school, but it would take a powerful wizard who could hoodwink the Goblet into believing that there were, in fact, four schools.

Before the tournament begins, the Weighing of the Wands takes place to examine each Champion's wand to ensure that it is in proper working order. The Champions will, of course, be depending on their wands as their sole tool in the Tasks, and so it is necessary to ensure that each is in perfect working order. The Wands Weighing was performed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]], expert wand-maker and owner of ''Ollivander's Fine Wands'' in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]].

*Cedric Diggory - 12 1/4 inches, ash, pleasantly springy, containing a single hair from the tail of a male [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|unicorn]]
*Fleur Delacour - 9 1/2 inches, inflexible, rosewood, containing a hair from the head of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veela|veela]] (her grandmother)
*Harry Potter - 11 inches, holly, containing a feather from the tail of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|phoenix]]
*Viktor Krum - Gregorovitch creation. 10 1/4 inches, hornbeam and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]] heartstring, quite rigid

The Tournament has three Tasks. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]] takes place on 24 November. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]] is on 24 February, and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] on 24 June. Additionally, the Triwizard Champions are expected to lead off the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], which Harry, who had never danced before, considered a fourth and unexpected task.

== Notable Consequences ==

It is uncertain exactly why this happens, but having been forced into the Tournament, Harry determines that he must not only compete, but attempt to win, against wizards significantly his senior. Harry's attempt to win the Tournament becomes the driving force for almost all of the book.

Harry's being entered into the Tournament is part of the reason that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] returns to England. This also proves a concern for Harry, as he believes himself responsible for Sirius' decision, and his putting himself at risk. This does not stop Harry periodically asking Sirius for help with the Tasks, help which Sirius is largely unable to provide.

Harry becoming a Champion is totally unexpected; initially at least, nobody is sure how this is done. Harry's championship leads to a certain amount of friction between the Heads of the three schools involved; Madame Maxime and Igor Karkaroff both seem to believe that it was done deliberately, and that Albus Dumbledore had some hand in it. At the very least, they suspect him of having failed to draw the Age Line correctly, as that should have prevented Harry, who was then underage, from putting his name in. Moody is the only one who seems to have recognized that the Goblet would have had to be bewitched to issue a fourth name.

Initially, only two people, possibly four, at Hogwarts believe that Harry did not put his own name into the Goblet. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], the morning following the selection of the Champions, brings Harry toast and offers to walk around the lake with him, understanding that he does not want to brave either the Great Hall or the Common Room. While they are walking around the lake, Hermione says that she could tell by the look on Harry's face when his name was announced that he had not put his own name in the Goblet. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] also says that the look on Harry's face showed that it was a total surprise to him that he was picked. Professor Dumbledore may believe that Harry had no intention of entering; his questions as to whether Harry had someone else put his name into the Goblet seem &quot;pro forma&quot;, more to satisfy any question the other Judges might have. And Professor Moody seems to accept Harry's story immediately, but the others there present discount Moody because of his well-known paranoia. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] seems to be reserving judgement. Among those who don't believe Harry's innocence are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] and, most troubling to Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]. Harry is discouraged by the discovery that Ron can believe Harry is lying to him. This, coupled with a campaign of disparagement headed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], will make Harry's life miserable for a large part of the book.

The attention outside Hogwarts caused by his selection as Champion is also unwelcome to Harry. Not only does he have to deal with members of Hufflepuff house who feel he is acting to steal some of their glory, and with those in other houses and amongst the teachers who feel that he is trying to seek out yet more fame for himself, he has attracted the attention of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], who seems to delight in writing scurrilous pieces about anyone who will sit still for her, and many who won't. Over the course of the story, Rita will write a horrible story about Harry, another about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], and a third about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]. All three stories, appearing either in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|''Witch Weekly'']], will have serious ill-effects on their subjects and their relationship with others.

== Analysis ==

An interesting note is that cheating, while not officially condoned, is widely considered a traditional part of the tournament.

The reader should pay particular attention to Bartemius Crouch in the first meeting with the four Champions. We note that by the interpretation of the rules that Mr. Crouch provides, anyone could be entered into the Tournament against their will. It will be instructive to compare Mr. Crouch's interpretation with Dumbledore's speech of the night before.

We should note that the Wand Weighing Ceremony does not actually involve determining how much each wand weighs. The term likely was chosen for its assonance, coupled with a more arcane use of the word. A dictionary definition of the word &quot;weigh&quot; includes the definition: &quot;to evaluate in the mind; consider carefully in order to reach an opinion, decision, or choice: ''to weigh the facts; to weigh a proposal''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/weigh http://www.dictionary.com, 3 June 2007, definition 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Tournament is a competition, it was also revived to help foster international magical cooperation. The three schools, Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang, are culturally and academically unique, and they have little interaction with one another in the usual course of affairs. Whether the tentative bonds that have been established are a strong enough alliance to unite them in the fight against Voldemort remains to be seen, although individual friendships, and a few romances, have been formed.

As mentioned, Harry does accept that he must compete in the Tournament. We note that it is never explained why Harry decides that, more than simply entering the Tournament, he must try to win against wizards senior to him. It is well worth studying how the author limns the personalities of the three other Champions, and has their characters play off Harry's to build the determination in him to show them what he is made of. This is particularly of interest because it is never mentioned, but is simply absorbed by the reader, until by the time of the First Task, the reader simply accepts that Harry is going to do his level best to win, because he has no other choice.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The Weighing of Wands, which seems to be a minor event in the Triwizard Tournament, actually gives Harry a clue in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'': he has a vision of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] searching for something, and he has been uttering Gregorovitch's name. At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]]'s wedding he is reminded by Viktor Krum, another wedding guest, that Gregorovitch is a wand maker, a fact that had come out at the Weighing. From this he deduces, incorrectly as it turns out, that Voldemort might wish to have another wand commissioned. His later determination that Voldemort wants a specific wand that Gregorovitch knew about is, however, accurate.

As mentioned, Harry's being selected as a Champion causes an estrangement between Harry and Ron. This will continue until the end of the First Task, when Ron will discover the magnitude of the tasks that Harry is facing, and will conclude that Harry did not want to enter the Tournament and risk his life. At the same time, the campaign of belittlement that Draco had started will taper off, though we will never be sure whether it is because of the exceptionally fine showing by Harry in the First Task, or whether Cedric Diggory has requested that his followers stop harassing Harry.

Bill and Fleur's wedding is another consequence of the Tournament: they meet when Bill and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|his mother]] visit Harry before the Third Task, and that leads to a romance that ends in the wedding.

Another notable consequence is that Cedric Diggory is murdered during the third task. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] is brought back to full life; it becomes apparent that the course of the Tournament has been subverted to bring Harry to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]] so that his blood can be used in the potion that restored Voldemort. Minister for Magic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], believing that releasing this news will result in his own downfall, dismisses this news. This becomes the official Ministry platform, and we are told later that the Ministry has stated that Cedric accidentally died due to carelessness. This in turn will set up a large part of the next book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], as the Ministry paints Harry and Dumbledore as untrustworthy, in order to devalue any information they might release.

Interestingly, perhaps, it is through the Ministry that the Tournament has been subverted. We will learn that Bartemius Crouch had been placed under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]] and was acting in Voldemort's interests in the early part of the year. This explains his unwell appearance in the Hallowe'en meeting with the Champions, and explains also his interpretation of the rule book that seems designed to force Harry to enter the Tournament against his will. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch, Jr.]] had been brought into Hogwarts to monitor the situation, quite possibly was the agent who hoodwinked the Goblet, and ends up murdering his own father and concealing the body. 

While this does not come out until the end of the book, Harry's becoming a Champion will be seen as a godsend by Ludo Bagman. Ludo, being on the wrong end of a number of bets he had made on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup match]], will bet on Harry to win the tournament with his creditors, mostly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblins]]. We will see Ludo clumsily offering to help Harry with the Tasks, help which Harry will refuse, and we will see that Ludo consistently gives Harry full points at the completion of a Task. However, as Harry and Cedric touch the Cup at the same instant, the Goblins will claim that Harry and Cedric tied for the win, and Ludo will decamp as he does not have funds to pay his new debts either.

Harry will be deemed to have won the Tournament, in the end, but as it resulted in the death of Cedric, Harry will not want the prize money. He will instead give it to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]], who will use it to fund their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|magical joke shop]]. Products of the joke shop will be useful to Harry in the fifth, sixth, and seventh books.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The milling of the malted barley is a very important step. Milling is done to better allow the mashing liquor to access the centre of the barley. This allows the enzymes secreted by the aleurone layer to act upon the starchy endosperm (see Figure).It is important that the grain husk remain intact, as the husks are used to form a filter bed during lautering, the process where the sweet wort (pronounced wert) is run off from the mashed grains. [[Image:barleystructurelrh.jpg|thumb|300px|Barley grain structure]] 

At the end of milling, the brewer should be left with a range of fragments of barley, but no whole grains, and largely intact husks. There should be little flour, as this leads to haze in the final beer and is poorly retained by the husk bed in the lautering process. It is also important that most of the endosperm is broken up, as this aids enzymatic action due to exposure of a greater surface area of endosperm, and leads to better conversion of the starch to sugars.

Large diameter (8&quot;) smooth rollers running at different speeds are preferred. Smaller grain mills can be made with slotted or knurled rollers but the mill gap must be set wider to avoid crushing the husks. Typical hobby grain mills have rollers with a diameter of 1.5 inches. These rollers are knurled so the small rollers will pull the grain through. Because of the smaller area of contact between the rollers and the grain the gap between the rollers must be closer than larger rollers. Also the knurling on the rollers will shread the husks more than larger rollers.

It is also quite possible to mill barley in a kitchen mortar and pestle - although this is exceptionally tedious. A typical kitchen mortar and pestle can handle about 150g of grain at a time, and a typical 5% alcohol beer might take 6kg of malt to make 19 litres.  However, the mortar and pestle approach allows a home brewer to experiment with grain mashing, without the expense of a mill.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why medical school? ==


Quite simply, because you must first learn in order to teach.

Just before my ten-year high school reunion I felt a bit listless.  Six years in U.S. Army Intelligence as an Arabic linguist and computer specialist had not been what I had always imagined they would be.  Intelligence and the world of espionage consist of long hours of tedium interrupted by short bouts of panic.  Although I have very few interesting stories to share, it is unfortunately necessary that I not share them at all.  Suffice it to say, Army Intelligence wasn't what I was after.

Leaving the military I made a halfhearted attempt at getting my undergraduate degree, but I was still adrift and had no idea what to study.  I took a stab at a communications degree at the Metropolitan State College of Denver, but my heart wasn't in it.  Instead I was swept up into the Dot-Com boom, and I was suddenly working sixty to eighty hour weeks designing web front-ends for distributed training applications.  (People who used Dell's &quot;Educate-U&quot; software from about 2000-2002 may have seen some of my handiwork.)  When the bubble burst, I moved on, still drifting listlessly through a half-lived life.

I was living in Alabama when I got out of computers.  My company laid me off so that they could hire someone else for $20,000 a year less (desperate programmers were the bitterest fruit of the Dot-Com aftermath) but they gave me a nice severance and I wasn't very upset.  During the process of looking for a new job I realized that I had hated my old one.  I despised the constant criticisms, their ignorance of the field -- I was disgusted by the industry and disillusioned completely.  It was time to move on.

After briefly considering law school, I ruled it out.  No one who knew me well could see someone with my personality as a lawyer, but everyone who knew me could definitely see me as a teacher.  I love to learn, and I am really good at sharing my knowledge with others.  I'm bright, inquisitive, cheerful and sociable.  Even my twin sister -- already a teacher herself -- agreed that I would make an outstanding educator of young minds.

It was with this in mind -- the plan to finally return to college and finish my degree to become a teacher -- that I went to my ten-year reunion.  Since I was living in Alabama, and the reunion was in Illinois, I stayed the night at my older brother's apartment in Indianapolis the day before the reunion.

What a great thing that ended up being for my family.

While I was there I discussed my plans with my brother.  He agreed that I would make an excellent teacher, but he worried, what would I do with students who didn't want to learn?  How would I handle public school kids who had no interest in gaining knowledge themselves, but plenty of interest in disrupting other kids' educations?  I didn't have an answer for him, but he had one for me: he said that I should teach students who really, ''really'' want to learn.

Why not be a medical school professor?

The cost of medical school wasn't an issue, because MD/PhD students get free tuition.  My abilities and intelligence were not in question, because I'm (almost) as smart as he is and he was already doing it (his MD/PhD).  The only question was, would I sacrifice and study and perservere long enough (more than a DECADE) in order to teach the best and brightest, most ambitious and hardworking students in the nation (or even in the world)?  The answer was, and still is, HECK YEAH!

It's been a few years, and I can't even begin to compare the quality of the experiences I've had to any other part of my life.  I've learned so much, and yet I've learned there is so much more to learn.  I've had the chance to actually help write a laboratory manual for freshman biology students, and this summer I'll be working in a hospital.  Next fall I'll be doing research -- real, meaningful, ''active'' research -- in a biomedical research laboratory.  Assuming my MCAT comes out okay I'll be a med student in a year and a PhD student two years after that.  Best of all, I will be the second medical student in our family but not the last -- my twin sister has decided to quit her job as a junior high school teacher and become a doctor, too!

I believe in Wikipedia and in Wikibooks, and I'm glad to contribute to projects here.  Long before I was a contributor I was a user, and I'm glad to do so because it helps me practice the vital skill of explaining complicated things in an understandable way.  I'm also glad that what I write down will be available for others to use for their own edification, because I see Wikibooks as a great way for me to pass on what I've learned -- as little as that has been up to this point -- to whomever needs it whenever they need it (provided they have an Internet connection).

If my story or anything I've written in Wikibooks or Wikipedia has helped you in any way, I'd like to say thank you for letting me be a (very, very, ''very'' small) part of your education and your life.

Cheers! ~ Justin

''(BTW, If you are wondering if I'm the same person as username:JustinJohnson -- yes, I am, but I had account issues...)''

UPDATE: The MCAT came out just fine!  Instead of a hospital, I'm volunteering in a clinic, and instead of waiting for fall to do real research I've started this summer.  It's a lot of fun and even kind of exciting, though I'll bet not everyone would feel that way.  Happy third birthday, Wikibooks!</text>

'''David Clarkson McJonathan-Swarm''' likes to think of himself an Edwardian in his eclecticism and eccentricity and his interests reflect this. Technically 'retired' and collecting a pension following the physically disabling injuries sustained from the impact of a tractor trailer to his Mazda RX-7 in 1991. His wife alleges that &quot;he is busier now than when he worked full-time and we had five sons at home.&quot; To many he is known simply as &quot;Mack&quot; or &quot;Doc.&quot;

Fascinated by history his entire life, a medical researcher, photographer, and biographer he started writing bios for some of the 'famous' listings at Find A Grave which he discovered from a Google search on Erik Rhodes. Finding many persons that he had known, socially and through broadcasting in New York City listed, he started to submit 'Better Bios' on the Find A Grave Forums thread. Many times his reference searches would bring up Wikipedia which finally led to his presence here. After his friend and partner Robert Denning's obituary appeared in The New York Times and on AP wire feed it was included in recent deaths on Wikipedia, but the lack of a biography was noted for both him and their common mentor Edgar de Evia. These were his first new articles.

Most of his new pages are persons he has known or of whom he has personal knowledge, that would not otherwise be available, and which can be added to the research of public information. His interest in obsession with both Find A Grave and now Wikipedia are driven by the desire to see that the past be remembered and its lessons learned.

Shouldn't the fourth binyan, Reflexive, be &quot;to eat him/herself&quot; instead of &quot;to be digested&quot; if it's the verb &quot;to eat&quot; applied on the subject, by the subject? [[User:84.50.168.227|84.50.168.227]] 00:42, 21 April 2006 (UTC)
::This system of verb templates has many inconsistencies, particularly in the template-to-meaning correspondence. Therefore, &quot;hit'akkel&quot; (הִתְאַכֵּל) does not mean &quot;he ate himself&quot; or &quot;it ate itself&quot; as expected, but rather &quot;it was digested&quot;. BTW, in this case the spelling הִתְעַכֵּל with Ayin is much more popular. [[User:88.155.194.120|88.155.194.120]] 21:04, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

== Gramer mistakes ==

As a native Hebrew speeker, I feel obligated to inform you that there are many mistakes in this article. the main one is that the writer chose to demanstrate benianym in this way: to eat= pa'al פעל, which is wrong. in Hebrew, a word only has a binyan if it has זמן וגוף. to eat, However would be translated to לאכול which is a שם פעולה mining that it has no binyan. sorry for the bad explation.

== Comments ==
This article could use a lot of improvement.

a) Binyanim are word formation rules.  Except for Pual and Hufal, a verb's binyan provides useful hints as to what a word might mean, but it does not determine it.  Pual is always the passive of Piel with the same root.  Hufal is always the passive of Hifil with the same root.  Otherwise you really need to look the word up in the dictionary.  You can't use the buinyan to guess the meaning any more than you can redict that the verb &quot;nationalize&quot; in &quot;France nationalized the airline industry&quot; means that the government is taking over ownership and management of the airline industry from private owners.  For that you need a dictionary and maybe a history lesson. 

More often than not the word is only loosely related to the core idea of it root. There is no particular reason why the Pa-al of the root פתח means &quot;to physically open something&quot; but &quot;the piel means to develop something&quot;.  Or another example: the Paal of יצא means to physically go out from a location but the Piel means to commercially export a product.  

Personally, I question the wisdom of making binyanim your starting point.  The drivers of verb inflection are rules for adding suffixes and prefixes that cut across all binyanim.   All binyanim follow the same rules.  Most of these rules are purely phonetic.  The few that are not have to do with properties that are shared across many binyanim, e.g. whether or not the first letter counts as a prefix letter or part of the root.

Binyanim don't help all that much in generating the principal parts of a verb either, that is, the uninflected stems.  Most of the rules that govern the inflection have to do with verbal features that cut across binyanim.  For example, any verb that has an מ prefix in the present, makes its future by replacing the מ with the future prefix letter.  That rule applies simultaneously to hifil, hufal, piel, pual, and hitpael.  Memorizing one rule is a lot easier than learning five identical rules one for each binyan.  Even though the rules are identical the student doesn't know why.  Since they don't know why they think they have to memorize the rule five times rather than just check for an מ on the present that either is dropped or changes the ה in the past.

b) Verbs with weak letters.  The only letters that ever get dropped from verb roots are ל י נ ה ו and in some cases the third root letter when the last two root letters are the same.  The gutterals you list are classified as weak letters due to a slew of vowel changes that need to take place to account for the the special phonetic qualities of gutterals.  The letters אעח never drop out (unless you include Mishnaic Hebrew's sometimes treatment of final א as final ה ) [[Special:Contributions/84.229.127.135|84.229.127.135]] ([[User talk:84.229.127.135|discuss]]) 15:56, 20 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Israel|Israeli Cuisine]]

Charcoal grilled squid, prawn and fish kebabs in Zhoug sauce (a spicy dipping sauce that can be used in a variety of different ways). The original recipe called for octopus, but I've expanded it with good results. Also, note that the original recipe didn't call for white wine in the marinade.

==Ingredients==

'''Kebabs'''

* ½ kg large prawns / [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], peeled and deveined
* ½ kg fish fillets, cut into 2½ cm (1 in) cubes
* ½ kg [[Cookbook:Squid|squid]], cleaned and cut into 2½ cm (1 in) pieces

'''Marinade'''

* 5 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], peeled and finely chopped
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeños]], seeded and finely chopped
* 1 cup (240ml) lemon juice
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* ¾ cup (180ml) [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|extra virgin olive oil]]
* ¾ cup (180ml) dry white wine

'''Zhoug sauce'''

* 1 cup (240g) [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]], washed, dried and chopped 
* 1 cup (240g) [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], washed, dried and chopped
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway]] seeds
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds
* 1½ tsp [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] seeds
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorns]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
* 8 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed
* 8 [[Cookbook:Jalapeno|jalapeños]], seeded and chopped (adjust the quantity according to your heat tolerance)
* ¼ cup (60ml) [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|extra virgin olive oil]]

==Procedure==
#Combine all the marinade ingredients in a nonreactive (glass or ceramic) mixing bowl. Add the seafood and mix to coat well. Refrigerate overnight.
#Dry roast the cumin, caraway and cardamom seeds for two or three minutes in a cast iron skillet or wok over low heat. Cool, then add the peppercorns and pound in a mortar and pestle to a fine powder.
#In a blender or food processor, blend the coriander, parsley, spices, garlic, chilli peppers and olive oil together with half a cup of water until a thick, smooth paste is formed.
#Transfer the paste into a sauce pan, heat until it starts bubbling, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring constantly, until the water is evaporated. Cool, transfer to an airtight container and chill.
#Remove the seafood from the marinade and drain in a colander. Save the marinade for basting the kebabs later. Thread the seafood onto skewers or satay sticks.
#Char-grill the kebabs over hot coals, basting and turning every few minutes. It should take about ten minutes to cook.
#When eating, use the zhoug sauce as a dipping sauce.

      <comment>/* Scope of method parameters */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Displaytitle|title=Scope}}
{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Packages|next=Arrays}}
{{Java Programming/LanguageFundamentalsTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Scope==
The scope of a class, a variable or a method is its visibility and its accessibility. The visibility or accessibility means that you can use the item from a given place.

=== Scope of method parameters ===
A method parameter is visible inside of the entire method but not visible outside the method.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-14&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.14: Scope.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4-6&quot;&gt;
public class Scope {

    public void method1(int i) {
        i = i++;
        method2();
        int j = i * 2;
    }

    public void method2() {
        int k = 20;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        method1(10);
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In [[#code-listing-14|code listing 3.14]], &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is visible within the entire &lt;code&gt;method1&lt;/code&gt; method but not in the &lt;code&gt;method2&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; methods.

=== Scope of local variables ===
A local variable is visible after its declaration until the end of the block in which the local variable has been created.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.50: Local variables.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;6-12&quot;&gt;
{
...
     // myNumber is NOT visible
  {
     // myNumber is NOT visible
     int myNumber;
     // myNumber is visible
    {
      ...
       // myNumber is visible
    }
       // myNumber is visible
  }
     // myNumber is NOT visible
...
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Access modifiers ==
You surely would have noticed by now, the words {{java:public}}, {{java:protected}} and {{java:private}} at the beginning of class's method declarations used in this book. These keywords are called the '''access modifiers''' in the Java language syntax, and they define the scope of a given item.

=== For a class ===
* If a class has '''public''' visibility, the class can be referenced by anywhere in the program.
* If a class has '''package''' visibility, the class can be referenced only in the package where the class is defined.
* If a class has '''private''' visibility, (it can happen only if the class is defined nested in an other class) the class can be accessed only in the outer class.

=== For a variable ===
* If a variable is defined in a '''public''' class and it has '''public''' visibility, the variable can be referenced anywhere in the application through the class it is defined in.
* If a variable has '''protected''' visibility, the variable can be referenced only in the sub-classes and in the same package through the class it is defined in.
* If a variable has '''package''' visibility, the variable can be referenced only in the same package through the class it is defined in.
* If a variable has '''private''' visibility, the variable can be accessed only in the class it is defined in.

=== For a method ===
* If a method is defined in a '''public''' class and it has '''public''' visibility, the method can be called anywhere in the application through the class it is defined in.
* If a method has '''protected''' visibility, the method can be called only in the sub-classes and in the same package through the class it is defined in.
* If a method has '''package''' visibility, the method can be called only in the same package through the class it is defined in.
* If a method has '''private''' visibility, the method can be called only in the class it is defined in.

=== For an interface ===
The interface methods and interfaces are always {{java:public}}. You do not need to specify the access modifier. It will default to {{java:public}}. For clarity it is considered a good practice to put the {{java:public}} keyword.

The same way all member variables defined in the Interface by default will become {{java:static}} {{java:final}} once inherited in a class.

=== Summary ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|-

! Nested class
! Method, or Member variable
! Interface
! Interface method signature

''The cases in bold are the default.''

== Utility ==
A general guideline for visibilities is to only make a member as visible as it needs to be. Don't make a member public if it only needs to be private.

Doing so, you can rewrite a class and change all the private members without making compilation errors, even you don't know all the classes that will use your class as long as you do not change the signature of the public members.

== Field encapsulation ==
Generally, it is best to make data private or protected.  Access to the data is controlled by ''setter'' and ''getter'' methods.  This lets the programmer control access to data, allowing him/her to check for and handle invalid data.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-51&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.51: Encapsulation.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private String name;

/**
 * This is an getter method because it accesses data from the object.
 */
public String getName() {
  return name;
}

/**
 * This is a setter method because it changes data in the object.
 */
public boolean setName(String newName) {
  if (newName == null) {
    return false;
  } else {
    name = newName;
    return true;
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the [[#code-section-51|code section 3.51]], the &lt;code&gt;setName()&lt;/code&gt; method will only change the value of &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; if the new name is not null.  Because &lt;code&gt;setName()&lt;/code&gt; is conditionally changing name, it is wise to return a boolean to let the program know if the change was successful.

{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Test your knowledge}}
'''Question 3.15''': Consider the following class.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-15&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.15: Question15.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class Question15 {

    public static final int QKQKQKQK_MULTIPLIER = 2;

    public int ijijijijijijijijijAwfulName = 20;

    private int unununununununununCrummyName = 10;

    private void mememememememeUglyName(int i) {
        i = i++;
        tltltltltltltltltlBadName();
        int j = i * QKQKQKQK_MULTIPLIER;
    }

    public void tltltltltltltltltlBadName() {
        int k = ijijijijijijijijijAwfulName;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        mememememememeUglyName(unununununununununCrummyName);
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

List the fields and methods of this class that can be renamed without changing or even knowing the client classes.
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}

# &lt;code&gt;unununununununununCrummyName&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;mememememememeUglyName()&lt;/code&gt;

Every field or method that is public can be directly called by a client class so this class would return a compile error if the field or the method has a new name.

==1. Identify the parts of a bow.==

Handle, riser, arrow rest, upper limb, lower limb, belly, back, window, recurve, bow nock, string loop, string, serving, kisser button, nocking point, brace height or fist mele, sight, sling.

==2. Identify the parts of an arrow.==


Nock, index, index or &quot;cock&quot; feather, hen feathers, shaft, spine, crest, point-tip-pile.

==3. Name and explain the safety rules for archery.==
*Don't shoot straight up.
*Never run on the archery range.
*Approach the target from the side, not the front so you don't get poked by the arrows sticking out of the target.
*Be sure your equipment is in good working order.
*Be aware of who is around you at all times.
*Don't &quot;hide&quot; behind the target.
*Don't walk in front of another archer.
*Don't talk on the shooting line.
*While loading your bow be sure that the arrows are always pointing toward the target.

==4. Correctly and safely string a bow.==
There are three basic ways of stringing and unstringing a bow.  Two of them are safe, and one is not.  The unsafe method is also presented because it is very commonly practiced.  It is presented here so that you can recognize when another person is using it, and by so doing, placing himself at risk. If you see someone using this method, please educate them.

=== 1. Bow Stringer===
[[Image:Bow Stringer.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Another Bow Stringer]] 
A bowstringer is a device that makes it safe and easy to string a bow.  The archer steps on the bow stringer and then pulls the bow upward causing it to flex.  This brings the tips of the bow closer together, and the string can then be looped over the string notch.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

=== 2. Step through===
In this method; the archer begins by placing one end of the string into the string notch on the lower limb of the bow.  The archer then &quot;steps into&quot; the bow by placing the right leg between the bow and the string, locking the bottom limb of the bow around the right calf and foot.  The bow's belly should be to the archer's left, and the bottom tip should rest against the left side of the archer's right foot.  The outside of the right knee will then be in a position to brace the bow near its handle. As the right hand is used to flex the bow and the left hand is used to loop the string around the upper string notch.  This method can damage your bow if done incorrectly.  This is the least favored way of the 3 stringing options.

=== &lt;s&gt;Push Pull&lt;/s&gt;===
[[Image:GAPalmettoStringingBow.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The &quot;Push Pull&quot; method]]

Though the push pull method of stringing is safe for your bow and has been popularized for that reason, it is '''very dangerous''' to the archer since, as you can see in the photo, the top limb is directly aligned with your head, and any slip while using this method can result in permanent eye damage and even death, especially from recurve bows since the back of a recurved limb creates a point which acts as a force multiplier. Children should never be taught this method of stringing a bow and even experienced professional bow technicians have been injured through its use{{ref|push_pull}}. We present the method here so that if you see someone using it, you can educate them.  '''Do not use this method to string a bow.'''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
The bow is placed as shown in the picture.  The bottom &quot;bow nock&quot; will be up against the instep of the shoe.  By pushing with the palm of the top hand and pulling with the bottom hand the bow is bent.  The fingers of the top hand pluck the string on or off.

===Always Check the String===
[[Image:Checking the string.jpg|frame|Checking the String]]
When you have strung the bow, turn it away from you 180 degrees to check the string.  That way if the string slips off, the bow will kick out away from you.  Whichever method for stringing a bow is selected, it is important to check ''both'' ends of the bow to ensure that is has been strung properly.  Do this whether you have strung it yourself or if someone else has strung it for you.  The string on an improperly strung bow can come off when the bow is drawn, potentially causing injury.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==5. Describe and show how to use the following:==
===a. Arm guard===
[[Image:Archery arm guard.JPG|thumb|Armguard]]
Hitting your arm is one of the unpleasantries of archery.  You can protect yourself with an armguard while learning how not to hit your arm.  A leather or plastic armguard with elastic bands should be placed on the inside of your forearm just below your elbow.  If you have a slight hyperextension to your elbow you can purchase a long armguard which will cover the inside of your entire bow arm.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===b. Finger tab or glove===
[[Image:Fingertab.jpg|thumb|Finger tab]]
The purpose of a finger tab or glove is to protect the archer's finger from the string.  

There are several types of finger tabs available.  The &quot;Marshall&quot; style has one hole and the &quot;Western&quot; style has two holes.  Either one works fine.  They should be trimmed to fit the archer.

The &quot;archers glove&quot; covers the finger tips and secures around the archer's wrist.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===c. Quiver===
A quiver by definition is &quot;anything that holds arrows&quot;.  There are several types of quivers including:
* The side quiver which hangs from a belt
* The back quiver which hangs from the shoulder.
* The side quiver which hooks onto a pocket.
* The pocket quiver.
* The ground quiver which sits on the ground.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===d. Bow sling===
The purpose of a bow sling is to keep you from dropping your bow.  There are two types of bow slings: the wrist sling and the finger sling.

A '''wrist sling''' is a strap that is connected to your bow for you to put your hand through while gripping your bow.

A '''finger sling''' is a 2 inch string with a loop at each end. After gripping your bow the loops go over the thumb and your index finger.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===e. String kisser===
The string &quot;kisser&quot; is a point on the string that touches your lip or corner of your mouth.

If you are using a &quot;center draw&quot; (see, Anchor) the string is in the middle or your chin and the middle of your nose.  A &quot;kisser&quot; would be a small disc on the string that would touch your lip.  This assures a vertical alignment of your bow.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

Creative Idea: Use a foldable to record / organize this information. Go here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6K0RnlNM7E to learn how.

==6. Demonstrate the following shooting techniques:==
===a. The stance===
[[Image:Archery (PSF) colored.png|thumb|300px|Proper archery stance]]
The stance is the position the feet and body assume when addressing the target.

Setting your feet is the first step in setting up a good shot.  A good foundation is important in anything, especially in archery.

First, lay an arrow pointing toward your target and perpendicular to the shooting line.  Second, place your feet straddling the shooting line with your toes slightly touching the arrow.

Your feet should be placed approximately the same distance apart as your shoulders as a starting point.  Once you find a comfortable stance it is important to remember where to put your feet each time you return to the shooting line.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===b. Nocking the arrow===
To place an arrow on the bowstring.  The attachment to the rear of an arrow which is placed on the bowstring and holds the arrow on the string.

There are two ways to put and arrow on the string.  One is right and one is wrong.  The index feather or &quot;cock&quot; feather should point away from the bow.  This feather is usually a different color than the other two which are also known as &quot;hen&quot; feathers.  Doing this allows the hen feathers to gracefully clear the bow.  If the &quot;index&quot; feather is pointed toward the bow it will kick out away from the bow as it tries to clear the bow during the shot.

The picture shows the most common way of placing the fingers on the string.  The thumb and small finger should not be involved in the shot in any way or fashion.  they should be relaxed and folded down as if you were saying &quot;I'm THREE years old&quot;.

After nocking the arrow, place three fingers on the string.  Two under the arrow and 1 over the arrow then slide them together, lightly touching the arrow.  The string should be at the first joint near the end of your fingers.  This is a starting point.  Competitive archers try to get the string at the very end of their fingers for a quicker release but this takes years of training.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
===c. The draw===
This is the act of pulling the string back.  The archer should start with the bow arm pointed directly at the target '''before''' pulling the string.  Some young archers like to pull the string while raising their bows but this is a waste of energy and creates fatigue while shooting.  Be very deliberate with little wasted motion.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
===d. The anchor===
[[image:Side_draw.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Side Draw]]
[[image:Archer_02.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Center Draw]]&lt;br&gt;
The &quot;anchor&quot; is a combination of points to which the bowstring and/or the index finger of the drawing hand are drawn to on the face and neck.  There are multiple ways of &quot;Anchoring&quot; the string after you have drawn the bow.  I will give you the two most common ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''The Side Draw:'''  Hunter or Field Style - Pull the string back so the index finger of your string hand touches the corner of your mouth.  This places the arrow directly beneath the eye that you are aiming with.  This is recommended for all beginners.  As archers continue to progress and put an aiming device on their bow they can progress to the next one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''The Center Draw:'''  Target or Olympic Style - Pull the string hand under your jaw so the string is in the middle and in front of the chin.  The string should also touch the nose.  The string hand is in line with and directly under the jaw bone.  The above picture is my oldest son Mark, Jr who is currently training for the Olympics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Remember that anchoring in the same place and the same way '''every''' time is critical no matter how you choose to anchor.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===e. The hold and aim===
[[image:Archery_hold_and_aim.jpg|thumb|right|frame|Hold and Aim]]
To superimpose a sight pin on the center of a target or, when not using a sight, the placement of the tip of the arrow on a particular point for a given distance.&lt;br&gt;
Hold means to get everything locked into place and be sure that you are ready to release the arrow.  There should be a straight line from the back elbow right through the arrow to the back of the bow (see photo).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Aim is the process of deciding when to let go of the string.  An archer without a sight uses an &quot;instinctive&quot; method or guessing how high or low to aim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A sight is a reference point for aiming but is only useful if the archers shoots the same way '''every''' time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An archer without a sight can use a sighting method called &quot;point of aim&quot;.  Contact me at West's Archery and I can teach you how to use this.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===f. The release===
[[image:Archer_after_release.jpg|300px|thumb|The Release]]

The release is the act of allowing the string to leave the fingers.

The release is the most important part of the shot.  It is when everything comes together in a fraction of a second.  The best way to perform the release is to just relax the fingers.  As the arrow goes toward the target, the string hand should go in exactly the opposite direction.  My Youngest son, Aaron, is demonstrating this in the photo.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===g. The follow-through===
[[image:Archer_Mark_West_outdoor.JPG|400px|left|thumb|Follow-through]]
&quot;Follow through&quot; refers to the movement of the drawing hand and arm after the release.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once the archer has released the arrow, '''nothing''' should move.  The archer must give the arrow time to clear the bow.  To insure this, instruct your archers to wait until the arrow hits the target before moving at all.  In the picture you can see that my release hand goes in the exact opposite direction as the arrow.  Making sure that your shoulders don't collapse is very important.  Also, notice that I am still aiming, long after the arrow is gone.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==7. Why is it necessary to have an arrow &quot;nocking point&quot; properly positioned on the bow string?==
If the nocking point is too high, the arrow will be pointed &quot;down&quot; and come out of the bow low.

If the nocking point is too low, the arrow will be pointed &quot;up&quot; and come out of the bow high.

Nock rings can be placed on the bow to allow for consistency.  A bow square and nock pliers can be used to set the nocking point properly.

==8. Using a standard (Olympic bow) score one of the following: &lt;br&gt;a. Indoors: 30 arrows (5 rounds) at 18 meters score 50 points on a 60 cm. target. &lt;br&gt;b. Outdoors: 30 arrows (5 rounds) at 25 meters score 170 points on a 122 cm. target. ==

{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problematic requirement
|The requirements as listed in the NAD's AY Honors Manual differ from those listed by the General Conference (GC).  We have gone with the requirements as set forth by the GC.  The NAD Honors Manual incorrectly converts meters to feet, and specifies distances and scores that are extremely difficult for the novice to achieve.
|Using a recurve bow shoot 30 arrows (5 rounds) at one of the following, and add up your score:&lt;br&gt;a. Indoors: from 18 meters at a 60 cm target.&lt;br&gt;b. Outdoors: from 25 meters at a 122 cm target.
}}

----
A standard &quot;Olympic Bow&quot; is a recurve (not compound) bow with no more than 3 stabilizer extensions, a sight, and a clicker.  An archer must use fingers and not a mechanical release and may not have a string peep sight or magnified aiming device.

We have recommended that the NAD waive the scoring requirements for the &quot;Beginning&quot; archery honor.  Everyone should be able to get this honor regardless of athletic skills.  We have been given approval to grant the honors this way.  That is what allowed us to teach over 1,000 pathfinders this honor at the ''Faith on Fire'' Pathfinder Camporee in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in 2004.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==9. Know and practice the archery safety rules.==
*Don't shoot straight up.
*Never run on the archery range.
*Approach the target from the side, not the front so you don't get poked by the arrows sticking out of the target.
*Be sure your equipment is in good working order.
*Be aware of who is around you at all times.
*Don't &quot;hide&quot; behind the target.
*Don't walk in front of another archer.
*Don't talk on the shooting line.
*While loading your bow be sure that the arrows are always pointing toward the target.

==1. Have the Archery Honor.==
{{ay prerequisite|Recreation|Archery}}

==2. Explain the advantages to be found by the target archer in making use of the following equipment:==
===a. Aluminum shaft target arrows===
Aluminum can be made straighter than wood because it does not have a grain and is more durable.  However, at the time this honor was written, carbon arrows had not hit the archery scene.  Carbon is considered to be more durable than aluminum.  

There are 4 types of arrow shafts: Wood, fiberglass, aluminum, carbon.

The carbon arrows are preferred by top archers for their ability to stay straight to .001% straightness.  Aluminum arrows were considered best until the mid 1980's.

===b. Bow level===

[[image:Level_sight.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bow Level]]
A bow level is like any other level.  It is a bubble telling you when you have reached a complete vertical or horizontal plane.  Bow levels were designed to let the archer know when the bow was straight up and down.  These, however, are not allowed in Olympic competition.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===c. Bow sight===
This is a mechanical device that allows you to aim.  It has the ability to adjust for windage (left and right) or elevation (up and down).  It is only effective if the archer is shooting the same way every single time.  Otherwise, it is useless.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===d. Bow sling===
The purpose of a bow sling is to keep you from dropping your bow.  There are two types of bow slings: the wrist sling and the finger sling.

A '''wrist sling''' is a strap that is connected to your bow for you to put your hand through while gripping your bow.

A '''finger sling''' is a 2 inch string with a loop at each end. After gripping your bow the loops go over the thumb and your index finger.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===e. Bow square===
This is a tool that clips onto the string and aligns with the arrow rest to allow you to place the nocking point on the correct spot on the sting.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===f. Bow stabilizer(s)===
This is a rod or combination of rods that extend out from the bow to be used for the elimination of torque.  They vary in length and weight.  While most stabilizers all do the same thing, each archer has their preference based on the stability of the shot.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===g. Clicker===
A mechanical device, usually metal, mounted on the window of the bow used to tell the archer that they are at a full draw by making a &quot;click&quot; sound.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===h. Flexible arrow plate===
This is an arrow rest which can be adjusted further or closer to the bow, further or closer to the archer and moves out of the way as the arrow passes through the bow allowing for a cleaner shot.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===i. Kisser button===
[[image:String_kisser.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Kisser button visible in front of the archer's lip]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
A string kisser is a small protrusion placed on the bowstring as an additional reference point.  It touches the archers lips, teeth or nose at full draw.

The string &quot;kisser&quot; is a point on the string that touches your lip or corner of your mouth.

If you are using a &quot;center draw&quot; (see, Anchor) the string is in the middle or your chin and the middle of your nose.  A &quot;kisser&quot; would be a small disc on the string that would touch your lip.  This assures a vertical alignment of your bow.

===j. Plastic arrow fletching===
Although nothing flies like the feather God created, plastic feathers or &quot;vanes&quot; can be made exactly the same because they are made from a mold.  Getting feathers to match by weight and size is difficult on one arrow and even harder to match a dozen.  Vanes are more durable and not susceptible to weather conditions.

===k. String peep===
An aperture in a small round piece of plastic or metal which is set between the strands of a string above the nocking point to sight through and in line with the bow sight.

This is small ring or loop mounted on the string for the eye to look through while sighting.  This is one of the items not allowed in Olympic competition.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==3. Explain what is meant by arrow spine.==
[[Image:Spine Testing Meter.jpg|250px|right]]

The arrow's resistance to bending classified by hanging a 2lb weight at the center of an arrow resting on two supporting points 26&quot; apart, and measuring the amount of the bend.

&quot;Spine&quot; refers to the weight and flexibility of the shaft and it's relationship to the weight of the bow.  

The arrow spine should be matched to the weight of the bow.  Spines that are too heavy come out of the bow sluggishly when shot by a light weight bow.  Spines that are too weak come out flexing and tweaking as they leave a bow that is too strong.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==4. Read the following chapters in The National Archery Association Instructor's Manual:==
*'''a. Problem Correction'''
This chapter covers problems such as hitting your arm, incorrect stress on the release fingers, etc.
*'''b. Advanced Shooting'''
This chapter provides tips on how to achieve absolute stillness from the point of release to arrow clearance and the effect body alignment has on this process.
*'''c. Bow Tuning'''
This chapter shows how to adjust the arrow rest, pressure button, string height and nocking point height to achieve good arrow flight out of the bow.

It also describes how the arrow clears the bow, eliminating &quot;nock high&quot;, &quot;nock low&quot;, left or right clearance problems.

Reading these chapters is lengthy but worthwhile to perfect your shooting.  The book was published in 1974, but you may be able to find a used copy at [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBY9XY/sr=8-1/qid=1148396326/ref=sr_1_1/002-2285711-0488834?%5Fencoding=UTF8 Amazon.com] or other online booksellers.

==5. Using a standard (Olympic bow) score one of the following: &lt;br&gt;a. Indoors: 30 arrows (5 rounds) at 70.8 feet (18 meters) score 200 points on a 23.6 inch (60 cm) target. &lt;br&gt;b. Outdoors: 30 arrows (5 rounds) at 196.8 feet (50 meters) score 200 points on 48 inch (122 cm) target.==

{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problematic requirement
|The requirements as listed in the AY Honors Manual differ from those listed in the official AY Honors Answer Book by Leland Davis.  The Honors Manual incorrectly converts meters to feet, but it also erroneously suggests that a compound bow qualifies as a &quot;Standard Olympic bow&quot; which it does not.  In the proposal below, we have corrected the metric conversions, eliminated the compound bow option, and have gone with the easier scoring requirements as specified in the official AY Answer Book.
|Using a standard (Olympic bow) score one of the following: &lt;br&gt;a. Indoor: 30 arrows (5 rounds) at 18 meters (59 feet) score 100 points on a 23.6 inch (60 cm) target. &lt;br&gt;b. Outdoor: 30 arrows (5 rounds) at 30 meters (98 feet 5 inches) score 190 points on 48 inch (122 cm) target.

----
A standard &quot;Olympic Bow&quot; is a recurve (not compound) bow with no more than 3 stabilizer extensions, a sight, and a clicker. An archer must use fingers and not a mechanical release and may not have a string peep sight or magnified aiming device.

==6. Review and practice the archery safety rules.==
*Don't shoot straight up.
*Never run on the archery range.
*Approach the target from the side, not the front so you don't get poked by the arrows sticking out of the target.
*Be sure your equipment is in good working order.
*Be aware of who is around you at all times.
*Don't &quot;hide&quot; behind the target.
*Don't walk in front of another archer.
*Don't talk on the shooting line.
*While loading your bow be sure that the arrows are always pointing toward the target.

Good to know (and to be reflected in text):
* ''pierogie'' is incorrect name of that meal &amp;#8212; the proper one is ''pierogi'',
* ''pierogi'' name is in fact spoken in Polish like ''pierogie'' and in that what should that name be read,
* ''pierogi'' is the name of that meal and '''it's plural''', so there is no need to use plural in English,
* ''pieróg'' is singular name for one item of this meal.


So the name of that meal should be ''pierogi'' (better) or ''pierógs'' (v. not recommended) in English.

[[User:193.0.96.15|193.0.96.15]] 12:08, 21 April 2006 (UTC) Konrad


The main wikipedia article is titled properly as ''pierogi'', so why are the recipies spelled the improper way? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:74.122.4.148|74.122.4.148]] ([[User talk:74.122.4.148|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/74.122.4.148|contribs]]) 2007-07-05T04:33:18.&lt;/small&gt;

:Fixed. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:04, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

== Add-Ons ==
Pierogi with cottage cheese filling are delicious with cream or plain yoghurt (may be sweeted).

The dish with potato filling (''ruskie pierogi'' - Russish pierogi) or with sauerkraut filling are often served with the onion, little amount (we can say: only for decoration ;]) of meat (may be [[Cookbook:Wiejska|kiełbasa wiejska]] or other kiełbasa) and a 1-2 spoons of oil (grease, fat?) from pan where onion and kiełbasa was fried.

== help requested ==
I have recently finished to write a book on [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]] in Russian wikibook [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]]. I want to find somebody to translate it to English. Can you help me with this?
P.S. I am interesting to write some books on math and computer science. On math I am currently working on [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]] and on computer science on [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] and [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (all this is on currently on hold). In my English texts I have a lot of grammar mistakes, so I need somebody to correct one. I want that all that I am writing will be on English. It can be translating of written on another language text or original text. 

P.P.S. I have some material on math in Hebrew. Also hebrew wikibook has some material. It can be nice, while not mandatory, if you will know Hebrew too.

Я недавно закончил писать книгу в русском викиучебнике  [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]] . Я хотел бы найти кого-то ктобы перевёл бы его на английский [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]]. Не могли бы вы мне в этом помочь? 
P.S. Я хочу написать пару книг по математике и компьютерным наукам (программированию). По математике я начал работать над [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]], а по компьютерным наукам над  [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] и [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (пока я оставил это). Я пишу на английском со многими грамматическими ошибками, мне нужен кто-то, чтобы их исправлять. Я хочу, чтобы все мои книги были на английском. Это может быть как перевода с другого языка, так и оригинальный, изначально написанный на английском текст.
P.P.S. По математике, у меня часть материала на иврите, да и в ивритском викиучебнике можно взять. Было бы прекрасно, если бы вы владели также ивритом. Но вовсе не обязательно. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 16:01, 26 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

This soup should be named ''zupa ogórkowa'' (small-caps, unless the names of the meals are written in such way in English ;]).

[[User:193.0.96.15|193.0.96.15]] 12:21, 21 April 2006 (UTC) Konrad

Yes, for an article heading we would indeed capitalize this in English, just like Chicken Noodle (rosol z kury), or Tomato (pomidorowa), soup. Yuk, yogurt in Zupa Ogorkowa, even sour cream is rarely, rarely added. Next some &quot;chef&quot;, will suggest adding [[catsup]], (optionally of course).[[User:Dr. Dan|Dr. Dan]] 01:45, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

==Ingredients==

Rice anyone? Had Zupa ogórkowa, in a nice Polish restaurant in Chicago, recently. Instead of potatoes, they used rice. I like the potato variety better, but the rice version wasn't all that bad. [[User:Dr. Dan|Dr. Dan]] 22:43, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Ingredients==
* 3/4 fresh human [[Cookbook:Placenta|placenta]]
* 1 potato
* 4 tablespoons fresh parsley
* 2 carrots
* 3 celery
* 1 zucchini (courgette)
* 1 tomato
* 1 onion

==Procedure==
# Chop up the ingredients.
# Roll the placenta in a mix of one table spoon flour, one teaspoon salt, a half teaspoon powdered paprika, some ground clove, some ground pepper and 6-8 coriander seeds.
# Saute the placenta in two tablespoons oil, pour in the vegetables and about a litre of water.
# Allow to boil and then let simmer for an hour.

Enjoy!

==Warning==
As with any meat from uncontrolled sources (such as hunting or scavenging) people should be cautious of risks involved. Certain blood borne diseases can live in blood and tissue outside the body for some time. Be sure that sensible precautions have been taken.

==Pneumonitis In Lung Cancer==
===SBRT Planning===
*'''Udine, Italy; 2009''' PMID 19954913 -- &quot;Radiation injury of the lung after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for lung cancer: A timeline and pattern of CT changes.&quot; (Linda A, Eur J Radiol. 2009 Nov 30. [Epub ahead of print])
**Review of CT findings after SBRT. Different patterns and time-course than conventional fractionation

*'''Japanese Radiation Oncology Group; 2006''' (1996-2002) PMID 16613661 -- &quot;Characteristics of patients who developed radiation pneumonitis requiring steroid therapy after stereotactic irradiation for lung tumors.&quot; (Fujino M, Cancer J. 2006 Jan-Feb;12(1):41-6.)
**Retrospective. 156 patients, Stage I NSCLC, treated with SBRT. 12 (8%) patients required steroids. 31 patients randomly selected for comparision
**Outcome: No predictors from age, sex, tumor size, PS, FEV1, %FVC, BED or dose/fraction. V20 was median 8% (7-18%) vs. median 7% (2%-16%) 
**Conclusion: No statistics predictive for development of pneumonitis requiring steroids

===IMRT Planning===
*'''Peking University; 2010''' (2005-2006) PMID 20462424 -- &quot;Analysis of clinical and dosimetric factors associated with severe acute radiation pneumonitis in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy.&quot; (Shi A, Radiat Oncol. 2010 May 12;5(1):35. [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. 94 locally advanced NSCLC (IIIA-IIIB), IMRT 60/30 or 63/35 with concurrent cisplatin-based or paclitaxel-based chemo. Primary outcome Grade 3+ acute radiation pneumonitis (by clinical symptoms and radiographic findings, interfering with ADL, requiring O2) within 6 months after therapy. LKB model used with TD50=30.5 Gy, m=0.3, n=1. Median F/U 10 months
**Outcome: G3+ pneumonitis 12%. Multivariate analysis NTCP value (&lt;4% 1% vs &gt;4% 43%) and V10 (&lt;50% 6% vs &gt;50% 29%) predictive
**Conclusion: NTCP value and V10 useful parameters for predicting severe acute radiation pneumonitis

===2D/3D Planning===
*Results reported vary in technique used, dosimetric parameters, grade of pneumonitis reported, and concurrent use of chemo
*Concurrent chemo appears to increase risk of pneumonitis
*Preliminarily, it may be reasonable to use the following guidelines when treating with 3D conformal radiation. These recommendations may not apply to patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).
**'''MLD''' (Mean lung dose in Gy): &lt;20 Gy and probably &lt;15 Gy
**'''V20''' (Volume of lung receiving at least 20 Gy): &lt;30% and probably &lt;25%
**'''V30''' (Volume of lung receiving at least 30 Gy): &lt;20%
*Inferior tumor location seems to increase risk for pneumonitis
*DVH should be calculated on the combination of both lungs - GTV.
*There is some evidence that '''V5''' may also be predictive of pneumonitis. IMRT typically increases V5, but decreases MLD. It is not yet clear how significant is the hazard of irradiating large volumes to low doses
 
====Radiographic====
*'''Duke; 2005''' PMID 15936538 -- '''Challenges in defining radiation pneumonitis in patients with lung cancer.''' (Kocak Z, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005).
**Prospective study to evaluate RT-induced lung injury. 251 patients with 6+ months of follow-up
**19% developed Grade 2+ SOB requiring treatment with steroids
**66% had classic pneumonitis, but 28% had co-founding findings and 6% developed fibrosis
**Scoring of RT pneumonitis challenging in 28%

====Tips====
*From Lynn Wilson (Yale):
**TOTAL LUNG: V20 &lt;=30% but &lt;35 acceptable, V10 &lt;=40%, V5 &lt;=60%, and mean lung dose &lt;=17 Gy but &lt;=20 acceptable
**Subtracts out PTV from total lung volume, and all calcs on uncorrected and corrected lung to evaluate differences.  PTV is based in 4D CT/ITV  methodology.

===Pulmonary Function===
*'''Amsterdam; 2005''' (The Netherlands) PMID 15936539 -- &quot;Pulmonary function changes after radiotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with long-term disease-free survival.&quot; (Borst GR, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005)
**34 patients had PFTs before RT, at 3 months, 18 months, and 36 months
**Outcome (3 mo, 18 mo, 36 mo): Decrease FEV1 (NS), 9%, 13%; DLCO -10%, -15%, -22%; alveolar volume -6%, -7%, -16%. No recovery of any parameter
**Conclusion: Significant decrease in pulmonary function at 3 months, progressive worsening to 18 and 36 months

==Pneumonitis In Breast Cancer==
*Historically &lt;=3% with standard RT alone
*Concern that concurrent or even sequential taxanes may increase pneumonitis risk, though data not clear


===With taxanes===

***Retrospective. 40 patients, operable Stage II-III BCA, protocol-based concurrent paclitaxel with RT. Either paclitaxel 60 mg/m2 QW x12 or paclitaxel 135-175 mg/m2 Q3W x4. Standard RT fields
***Outcome: Weekly paclitaxel dose-limiting toxicity in 25%, including 3 symptomatic pneumonitis. No dose-limiting toxicity with paclitaxel Q3W, but still 8% Grade 2 pneumonitis. Any grade pneumonitis 18% overall; tangents 8% vs. nodal fields 22%
***Conclusion: Concurrent treatment with paclitaxel not possible weekly; may be possible Q3W, but caution is warranted due to pulmonary injury
**'''2005''' PMID 15890579 -- &quot;Is a reduction in radiation lung volume and dose necessary with paclitaxel chemotherapy for node-positive breast cancer?&quot; (Taghian AG, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Jun 1;62(2):386-91.)
***Retrospective case-control. 41 patients from PMID 11734597 (paclitaxel/RT) compared with 192 controls (standard chemotherapy/RT)
***Outcome: Pneumonitis in paclitaxel 15% vs. standard chemo 1%. Effective lung tolerance reduced by 24%. No significant dosimetric predictors
***Conclusion: Use of paclitaxel chemo and RT likely increases incidence of RP
**'''2001''' (1993-1999) PMID 11734597 -- &quot;Risk of pneumonitis in breast cancer patients treated with radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel.&quot; (Taghian AG, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2001 Dec 5;93(23):1806-11.)
***Retrospective. 41 patients treated with RT and adjuvant CT including paclitaxel (given concurrently n=21 or sequentially n=20). Sequentially treated patients received paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 Q3W or 70-80 mg/m2 QW. RT to breast-CW and IM nodes; 30 patients also SCV field. Pneumonitis incidence compared to database
***Pneumonitis risk: Grade 2-3: paclitaxel 15% vs. control 1% (SS). Mean time-to-pneumonitis 5 months. Sequential use pneumonitis risk 16%, however, majority of patients had IM and regional lymphatics irradiated
***Conclusion: use of paclitaxel and RT should be undertaken with caution

**Retrospective. 189 BCA patients enrolled in Phase III trial of T-FAC vs FAC. Clinically relevant radiation pneumonitis scored blindly
**Outcome: Pneumonitis rate paclitaxel-FAC 5% vs. FAC 4% (NS). Radiographic changes 39% vs. 24% (SS)
**Conclusion: Patients treated with sequential paclitaxel, FAC and RT have very low rate of clinicallly relevant radiation pneumonitis

== Genders and articles ==
In grammar, ''nouns'' (Portuguese: ''&quot;substantivos&quot;'') are all words that give names to things. Some Indo-European languages (like English and Portuguese) present ''grammatical genders'' (Portuguese: ''&quot;gêneros gramaticais''), meaning that every single word has a specific ''gender''. In English words are either masculine, feminine or neutral, but only singular personal pronouns distinguishes genders: ''&quot;he&quot;'', ''&quot;she&quot;'' and ''&quot;it&quot;'', respectively. The grammatical gender in English coincides with the &quot;natural gender&quot;: masculine nouns are those that name men or male animals, feminine nouns are those that name women and female animals, neutral nouns are all those that are not male nor female.

Unlike English, Portuguese has no neutral gender (nouns are either masculine or feminine) and there is not actually a rule for determining what the gender of a noun is. Every single noun (people, animals, even inanimate objects and places) has a specific gender. For example, the word ''&quot;mesa&quot;'' (''table'') is a feminine noun, but the word ''&quot;prato&quot;'' (''dish'') is a masculine noun. The gender of each noun must be learned, although there is a rule of thumb that does help you to greatly minimize the amount of mistakes that can be done - you will meet it in the next few paragraphs.

Portuguese articles and adjectives also have masculine and feminine forms. Their gender is determined by the noun they are with (masculine nouns must be linked to masculine articles and adjectives, and feminine nouns to feminine articles or adjectives). Looking at a word's article, it is possible to say which is the gender if the noun. The definite articles in Portuguese are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Definite article &lt;small&gt;(&quot;the&quot;)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! Gender
! Singular
! Plural
|-
! Masculine
| o
| os
|-
! Feminine
| a
| as
|-
|}

Unlike English, grammatical gender isn't always correlated to sexual gender; it is sometimes correlated, but it is not a rule.
: '''''a''' mulher'' (&quot;''the'' woman&quot;) &amp;ndash; ''&quot;mulher&quot;'' is a feminine noun.
: '''''o''' homem'' (&quot;''the'' man&quot;) &amp;ndash; ''&quot;homem&quot;'' is a masculine noun.
: '''''a''' criança'' (&quot;''the'' child&quot;) &amp;ndash; ''&quot;criança&quot;'' is a feminine noun, but it is used both for boys and girls.

There is a tip about determining the gender of a singular noun: the last vowel of a noun is often the same as that of the definite article of its gender. It means that nouns ending in '''-o''' are mostly masculine, and nouns ending in '''-a''' are mostly feminine.
: '''''a''' cas'''a''''' (&quot;''the'' house&quot;) &amp;ndash; ''&quot;casa&quot;'' is a feminine noun.
: '''''o''' almoç'''o''''' (&quot;''the'' lunch&quot;) &amp;ndash; ''&quot;almoço&quot;'' is a masculine noun.
: '''''a''' caix'''a''''' (&quot;''the'' box&quot;) &amp;ndash; ''&quot;caixa&quot;'' is a feminine noun.
: '''''o''' quart'''o''''' (&quot;''the'' room&quot;) &amp;ndash; ''&quot;quarto&quot;'' is a masculine noun.

Portuguese indefinite articles are easier to learn than the definite ones. Let's look at them:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Indefinite article &lt;small&gt;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;some&quot;)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! Gender
! Singular
! Plural
|-
! Masculine
| um
| uns
|-
! Feminine
| uma
| umas
|-
|}

: '''''uma''' mulher'' (&quot;''a'' woman&quot;)
: '''''um''' homem'' (&quot;''a'' man&quot;)
: '''''uma''' criança'' (&quot;''a'' child&quot;)
: '''''uma''' casa'' (&quot;''a'' house&quot;)
: '''''um''' almoço'' (&quot;''a'' lunch&quot;)

The plural form of the indefinite article has the meaning of the english ''&quot;some&quot;''.
: '''''umas''' caixas'' (&quot;''some'' boxes&quot;)
: '''''uns''' quartos'' (&quot;''some'' rooms&quot;)

It is worth calling the attention that ''um'' and ''uma'' are also the numerals for the english ''one'' - in portuguese, numerals also accord to the gender of the noun they refer to.

== Personal pronouns ==
There are eight ''personal pronouns'' (Portuguese: ''&quot;pronomes pessoais&quot;'') in standard Portuguese:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Personal pronouns
|-
! Person
! Portuguese
! English
|-
! 1. s.
| eu
| I
|-
! 2. s.
| tu
| you
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | 3. s.
| ele
| he, it
|-
| ela
| she, it
|-
! 1. p.
| nós
| we
|-
! 2. p.
| vós
| you all
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | 3. p.
| eles
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | they
|-
| elas
|-
|}

Some of these are unusual or absolutely not used in common Brazilian Portuguese. The pronoun ''&quot;vós&quot;'' is never used coloquially (even in European Portuguese), either in formal language or in informal language; however, you will find it in classic literary work. Also, in some dialects, the pronoun ''&quot;tu&quot;'' is no longer used. Instead of the second-person pronouns, one may use the ''address pronouns'' (Portuguese: ''&quot;pronomes de tratamento&quot;'') ''&quot;você&quot;'' (singular) and ''&quot;vocês&quot;'' (plural). Despite being second person pronouns (meaning ''&quot;you&quot;'' and ''&quot;you all&quot;''), they behave as third person pronouns (all address pronouns behave the same way).

The pronoun ''&quot;nós&quot;'' is becoming increasingly avoided by many people (especially the younger) in colloquial language, although a significant portion of the population still uses it. Instead, ''&quot;a gente&quot;'' (literally: ''&quot;the people&quot;'') is used. Though it actually means ''&quot;we&quot;'', it is a feminine noun, and behaves as a third person ''singular'' &quot;pronoun&quot;.

Languages such as Italian, German, Polish and even Portuguese have special words to address people politely. In Italian, ''Lei'' is used for addressing both a man and a woman, generally an unknown or someone we know but are not intimate with; in Polish one has ''Pan'' for men and ''Pani'' for women. In Portuguese, it is customary to address older people, or anyone we would want to be respectful with, by '''''o senhor''''' (the male form, equivalent to the english ''&quot;sir&quot;'') and '''''a senhora''''' (the female form, equivalento to ''&quot;madam&quot;''). These words mean, respectively, ''&quot;the sir&quot;'' and ''&quot;the madam&quot;''. When using the vocative, the articles (''&quot;o&quot;'' and ''&quot;a&quot;'') are removed.

: '''''Senhor''', que horas são?'' (&quot;What time is it, '''sir'''?&quot;)
: ''Com licença, '''senhora''', qual o nome desta rua?'' (&quot;Excuse me '''madam''', what is the name of this street?&quot;)
: ''Como '''a senhora''' está?'' (&quot;How are ''you''?&quot;, polite)

However, do not address people by ''senhor'' or ''senhora'' unless they are of a certain age, or if they are in an important position. Brazilians tend to be very informal and many people might find it strange to be addressed by ''senhor'' or ''senhora''. As a matter of fact, they might even feel old - and they will let you know it sometimes, albeit with a great dose of good humor!

== Adjectives and nouns ==
Portuguese nouns, just like English ones, are inflected in singular and plural forms. As said before, adjectives must have the same gender of the noun they are connected to. Adjectives must also have the same grammar number (singular, plural) of their nouns.

In normal situations, the adjectives are put after the noun, but they may be put before. Putting the adjective before the noun may cause a different interpretation, or may sound weird to a native speaker. This is because putting an adjective before a noun is mostly used in literary work.

To turn the vast majority of common nouns and adjectives to their plural form, just add '''-s''' at the end of the word.
: '''''a''' pesso'''a''' elegant'''e''''' (&quot;the elegant person&quot;)
: '''''as''' pesso'''as''' elegant'''es''''' (&quot;the elegant people&quot;)

All adjectives which end in '''-o''' also change in gender. To turn them into their feminine forms, change the final '''-o''' to '''-a'''. The gender of some nouns which end in '''-o''' may be changed the same way.
: '''''o''' menin'''o''' cansad'''o''''' (&quot;the tired boy&quot;)
: '''''os''' menin'''os''' cansad'''os''''' (&quot;the tired boys&quot;)
: '''''a''' menin'''a''' cansad'''a''''' (&quot;the tired girl&quot;)
: '''''as''' menin'''as''' cansad'''as''''' (&quot;the tired girls&quot;)

You will also find many nouns and adjectives that end with an ''r''. Such nouns are generally masculine; the female form will usually take an ''a'':
: '''''o''' pint'''or''''' (&quot;''the'' painter&quot;, male)
: '''''a''' pint'''ora''''' (&quot;''the'' painter&quot;, female)
: '''''o''' profess'''or''''' (&quot;''the'' teacher&quot;, male)
: '''''a''' profess'''ora''''' (&quot;''the'' teacher&quot;, female)

=== Other plurals ===
Some adjectives that end in '''-z''' take '''-es''' for forming the plural.
: '''''o''' indivídu'''o''' feli'''z''''' (&quot;the happy person&quot;)
: '''''os''' indivídu'''os''' feli'''zes''''' (&quot;the happy people&quot;)

Most nouns and adjectives ending in '''-l''' have their last syllables stressed. The plural of such words is made by changing the '''-l''' for '''-is'''.
: '''''o''' códig'''o''' pena'''l''''' (&quot;the penal code&quot;)
: '''''os''' códig'''os''' pena'''is''''' (&quot;the penal codes&quot;)

Some nouns ending in '''-l''' don't have their last syllable stressed (marked by the circumflex or by the acute accent), so they don't get '''-is''' for pluralizing. Instead, they get '''-es''', just like words ending in '''-z'''.
: '''''o''' cônsu'''l''''' (&quot;the consul&quot;)
: '''''os''' cônsu'''les''''' (&quot;the consuls&quot;)

Of course, there would be exceptions to the simple rule. One of them is when a noun ends with '''-ão''', which becomes '''ões''':
: '''''o''' avi'''ão''' (&quot;the airplane&quot;)
: '''''os''' avi'''ões''' (&quot;the airplane&quot;)
: '''''o''' bal'''ão''' (&quot;the balloon&quot;)
: '''''os''' bal'''ões''' (&quot;the balloons&quot;)

=== Augmentative form ===

This ending can also be used to for the augmentative form of nouns. Used colloquially, it can also be an enhancement to the quality expressed by the adjective, but only in the masculine:
: ''amarel'''o''''' (&quot;yellow&quot;)
: ''amarel'''ão''''' (&quot;intense yellow&quot;)
: ''bonit'''o''''' (&quot;handsome&quot;)
: ''bonit'''ão''''' (&quot;very handsome&quot;)

The feminine version of this &quot;superlative&quot; form would be '''-ona'''. The grammatically correct form used generally would be to add &quot;muito&quot; (very)  before the adjective, or the append the suffix ''-íssimo'':

: ''alt'''o''''' (&quot;tall&quot;, &quot;high&quot;)
: ''muit'''o''' alt'''o''''' (&quot;very tall&quot;, &quot;very high&quot;)
: ''altíssim'''o''''' (&quot;extremely tall&quot;)

as opposed to ''alt'''ão''''', which would be a colloquial but very common form for ''muito alto''.

== Copula verbs ('ser' and 'estar') ==
''Copula verbs'' (Portuguese: ''verbos de ligação'') are verbs which mean ''&quot;to be&quot;''. Portuguese make a distinction between two copula verbs: ''&quot;estar&quot;'' and ''&quot;ser&quot;''. While ''&quot;estar&quot;'' denotes a non-permanent situation (like ''&quot;to stand&quot;'' or ''&quot;to stay&quot;''), ''&quot;ser&quot;'' denotes a permanent situation.

: '''''estar''' feliz'' (&quot;to be happy&quot;) &amp;ndash; being happy is not a permanent situation.
: '''''ser''' feliz'' (&quot;to be happy&quot;) &amp;ndash; being happy is a permanent situation.

The copula verb ''&quot;estar&quot;'' is also used with places (where it happens) and ''&quot;ser&quot;'' is used with time (when it happens).

: '''''estar''' aqui'' (&quot;to be here&quot;)
: '''''ser''' noite'' (&quot;to be night&quot;)

== Verb 'estar' ==
Portuguese verbs conjugate or inflect, having different forms for each grammatical person. Most verbs follow one of three regular conjugation patterns. There are several irregular verbs; the two copula verbs are irregular. The first verb you will learn is ''&quot;estar&quot;'' in the simple present. Portuguese grammar calls this tense ''present indicative'' (Portuguese: ''presente do indicativo'').

|}

: ''Eu '''estou''' feliz!'' (&quot;I ''am'' happy!&quot;)
: ''Nós '''estamos''' alegres.'' (&quot;We ''are'' happy.&quot;)

As seen before, the adress pronouns ''&quot;você&quot;'' and ''&quot;vocês&quot;'' behave as third-person pronouns, so they get third-person inflected verbs. A similar phenomenon happens with ''&quot;a gente&quot;'', which gets the third person singular. Paradoxically, if you use the third person plural form with ''&quot;a gente&quot;'', people will frown at you!

: ''A gente '''está''' alegre!'' (&quot;We ''are'' happy!&quot;)
: ''Tu '''estás''' aqui!'' (&quot;You ''are'' here!&quot;)
: ''Você '''está''' lá.'' (&quot;You ''are'' there!&quot;)

When having lots of subjects, the conjugation is that of the equivalent personal pronoun.

: '''''Eu e você&lt;small&gt; (&quot;I and you&quot; are &quot;we&quot;)&lt;/small&gt; estamos''' aqui.'' (&quot;''I and you are'' here&quot;)
: '''''Tu e ele&lt;small&gt; (&quot;you and he&quot; are &quot;you all&quot;)&lt;/small&gt; estais''' aqui.'' (&quot;''You and he are'' here&quot;)
: '''''Você e ele&lt;small&gt; (&quot;you and he&quot; are &quot;you all&quot;)&lt;/small&gt; estão ''' aqui.'' (&quot;''You and he are'' here&quot;)

For turning a sentence to the negative form, just put the adverb ''&quot;não&quot;'' (''not'') before the verb. For turning a sentence to the interrogative forms, don't change the place of verbs as you do in English.

: ''Eles '''estão''' lá.'' (&quot;They ''are'' there.&quot;)
: ''Eles '''não estão''' lá.'' (&quot;They ''are not'' there.&quot;)
: ''Eles '''estão''' lá?'' (&quot;''Are'' they there?&quot;)
: ''Eles '''não estão''' lá?'' (&quot;'''Are''' they ''not'' there.&quot;)

As the verb changes for each person, one can take the pronoun out of a sentence. Portuguese grammar calls this phenomenon ''hidden subject'' (Portuguese: ''sujeito oculto''). The hidden subject is a widely used element both in informal and formal speech.

: '''''Eu estou''' elegante.'' / '''''Estou''' elegante.'' (&quot;''I am'' elegant.&quot;)
: '''''Nós estamos''' elegantes.'' / '''''Estamos''' elegantes.'' (&quot;''We are'' elegant.&quot;)

The hidden subject is meant to be used only with first-person and second-person forms of inflected verbs. Using it for the third person, might cause some confusion, since ''&quot;vocês&quot;'' and ''&quot;eles/elas&quot;'' take the same verbal form.

: '''''Você está''' feliz?'' / '''''Está''' feliz?'' (&quot;''Are you'' happy?&quot;)
: '''''Ele está''' feliz?'' / '''''Está''' feliz?'' (&quot;''Is he'' happy?&quot;)
: '''''Ela está''' feliz?'' / '''''Está''' feliz?'' (&quot;''Is she'' happy?&quot;)
: '''''A gente está''' feliz?'' / '''''Está''' feliz?'' (&quot;''Is she'' happy?&quot;)
: '''''Vocês estão''' felizes?'' / '''''Estão''' felizes?'' (&quot;''Are you all'' happy?&quot;)
: '''''Eles estão''' felizes?'' / '''''Estão''' felizes?'' (&quot;''Are they'' happy?&quot;)
: '''''Elas estão''' felizes?'' / '''''Estão''' felizes?'' (&quot;''Are they'' happy?&quot;)

When one hides a third-person singular subject, it can be either ''&quot;ele&quot;'' (''he''), ''&quot;ela&quot;'' (''she''), ''&quot;você&quot;'' (''you'') or even ''&quot;a gente&quot;'' (''we''), and when one hides a third-person plural subject, it can be either ''&quot;eles&quot;'' (''they''), ''&quot;elas&quot;'' (''they'') or ''&quot;vocês&quot;'' (''you all''). Grammatically it is called ''indeterminate subject'' (Portuguese: ''sujeito indeterminado''). However, in colloquial Brazilian Portuguese, a hidden subject of third person is always meant to be ''&quot;ele&quot;'' or ''&quot;ela&quot;'' - colloquially, the hidden subject is not used for plural forms at all.

=== Colloquial form of some pronouns and the verb 'estar' ===

This is quite important to understand colloquial Brazilian Portuguese, independently of the dialect one considers. You will only very rarely hear the verb &quot;estar&quot; fully pronounced. Only a few people will pronounce it fully and not sound pedantic. Instead, most of the time you will hear their contracted forms.

The contracted form of ''&quot;você&quot;'' is '''''&quot;cê&quot;''''' (plural: '''''&quot;cês&quot;'''''), and the contracted forms of the verb '''''&quot;estar&quot;''''' are obtained simply by removing the initial syllable ('''''&quot;es&quot;''''') from the fully conjugated form. So, if someday you are walking through the streets of Brazil and you hear someone asking on the phone:

: ''Onde '''cês tão'''?''

you won't panic. Instead, you'll have that enlightened smile of someone who knows that the question was

: ''Onde '''vocês estão'''?''

However, it is important to know that '''''&quot;você&quot;''''' is usually but not always contracted. Generally, after ''&quot;para&quot;'' (for), and as a vocative, '''''&quot;você&quot;''''' is not contracted:

: ''Eu trouxe este presente '''para você'''.'' (&quot;I brought you this gift.&quot;)
: '''''Você'''! É, '''você'''! Me ajude aqui, por favor!'' (&quot;You! Yes, you! Please help me here!&quot;)

== Continuous tense ==
In English, the ''continuous tense'' (Portuguese: ''tempo contínuo'') is formed by combining ''&quot;to be&quot;'' with the present participle of a verb. In Portuguese, it is formed the same way, with the auxiliary verb ''&quot;estar&quot;''. The present participle is called ''gerund'' (Portuguese: ''gerúndio'') by Portuguese grammar. The infinitive verbs are preceded with ''&quot;to&quot;'' in English. In Portuguese, all of them end in '''-r'''. To form the gerund tense, just change their '''-r''' to '''-ndo'''.

Moutabbal (Baba Ghanouzh)
Eggplant and Tahini Puree

== Ingredients ==
* 1 large ripe [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]] (aubergine)
* 2 - 3 tablespoons (30-45g) [[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]]
* 1 - 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]], juiced and strained
* 2 - 3 cloves fresh [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* Salt
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]

== Procedure ==
#Roast the eggplant on open gas flame - range top or barbecue. If your stove is electric, split the eggplant lengthwise, place face down on cookie sheet and bake in hot oven on top rack 30-45 minutes. For open flame roasting, use a fork to turn often. Skin will wrinkle and char, and flesh will shrivel and become soft. When eggplant is completely soft all over, remove to a bowl, slash once or twice to drain out bitter juice, and let rest until cool enough to handle. Some authors suggest cooling the eggplant inside a brown paper bag.
#Cut off stem and peel away skin. Scrape flesh into bowl of food processor or blender. Add garlic, tahini, lemon juice and process. Amounts depend upon size of eggplant and your taste - please sample frequently. Salt to taste.
#If you don't have a food processor or blender, the eggplant is quite easy to mash by hand. Mash the garlic with the flat of a broad knife, then mince it fine. Some cooks prefer mashing by hand to mechanical means as the blades of food processors can break the seeds which releases undesirable bitter flavours. If you have a mortar and pestle, mash the garlic with salt into a paste. A large mortar and pestle can be used to mash all ingredients.
#Serve at room temperature, drizzled with olive oil, garnished with a black or green Mediterranean olive, or sprigs of cilantro or parsley.

I think in this page before we begin to talk about the units of measurement and more sophisticated concepts, we should first elaborate on the meaning and the importance of measurement in all sciences, especially in physics, and that unless we can attache a numerical value to the phenomena of the physical world we actually cannot begin talking about science of physics and so on and on...

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objective ==

The actor must find out what his or her character &quot;wants.&quot; &quot;I want,&quot; &quot;I need,&quot; &quot;I must have&quot; statements help the actor to solidify the objective of the character.

'''The obstacle is what stands in the way of the objective.'''

'''Super Objective'''
Broad overall objective for a character that works throughout the play. Provides a through line and arc for the character.
*I need love
*I need to have power.
*I want security.
*I want to find the love of my life.
*I want peace.
*I want a family.

A &quot;need&quot; is stronger than a &quot;want&quot; and is usually the stronger choice because it creates more drive for an actor. 
 
'''Objective'''
Every scene has an &quot;Objective&quot;. This is best formatted (for the actor) as what you want to get from the other person in the scene.  
* I need you to worship me.
* I need you to love me.
* I need you to give me my power back. 
* I desire validation.

== Actions ==

The strategy used to achieve your objective. A character will use a certain action to get their objective. They switch actions when they feel it is not working anymore. Make sure when you pick actions that you are using playable words (use ACTIVE VERBS.)

'''Good Examples'''
*To scold 

*To taunt

*To cheer up

*To bribe

*To bargain

*To flirt

*To corrupt

'''Not So Good Examples''' 
*To understand

*To complicate

*To imagine

*To cry

*To feel

*To run

The not so good examples are DEAD END actions. Dead end tactics do not work through the other characters on stage(your identifiable partner). There is a big difference between &quot;I am angry at her&quot; (what are you going to do about it?) and &quot;I want to destroy her.&quot;

== Overview ==

'''''Pigwidgeon''''', or '''''Pig''''', a Scops owl, was a gift from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]. Ron's sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], named the owl. The owl refused to answer to anything else after that.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

At the end of the last chapter, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] travels on the Hogwarts Express, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] notices a little owl just outside the window. Harry catches it and takes it inside. It carries a note for Harry from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]]: Sirius has hidden far away, and is thinking about letting himself be seen by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]], so that security at school can be lowered. He was the one who had sent Harry the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Firebolt]]; he had gotten [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]] to deliver the order to the post office. Hermione says that she had known it was him. Sirius also says that he feels responsible for causing Ron to lose his rat [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]]; now that Ron has no pet, he may keep the owl if he wishes. Ron holds the owl under Crookshanks' nose, and Crookshanks purrs (apparently stating it is just a normal animal, not like Ron's previous pet, Scabbers, an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]]), so Ron keeps the owl.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Ron sends Pigwidgeon to Harry with the information that whether or not the Dursleys will allow him to go to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], the Weasleys will be coming to get him; and saying that Harry should let Ron know whether it will be a visit or a rescue by return owl. Harry is bemused; he hasn't yet learned Pigwidgeon's name, and doesn't understand why Ron refers to him in his note as &quot;Pig&quot;.

Once Harry has arrived at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], he learns the owl's name. This year, there is a requirement that all students have formal robes; Harry's are elegant, but Ron's are musty, have lace around the collar and sleeves, and look to date back to the previous century. Pigwidgeon chooses this moment to choke on an over-large owl treat, and Ron, hurrying to help him, laments about how everything he owns is rubbish.

Near Christmas, Ron sends Pigwideon off with a message for Sirius Black. Pigwidgeon apparently takes about three weeks to deliver the message and return, although by this time Sirius is reportedly somewhere in England.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Pigwidgeon flies madly around Harry, Ron and Hermione as they greet one another excitedly on Harry's arrival at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]]. He continues to fly around, twittering madly, as Harry yells at Ron and Hermione, but retreats to the top of the wardrobe, joining [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] into the room.

After the meeting that evening, Hedwig and Pigwidgeon are clattering around on top of the wardrobe. Ron throws some Owl Treats up there for them, explaining that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] doesn't want them out hunting too often, it would raise questions.

On the last day before the start of classes, Harry climbs on a chair to clean all the owl droppings off the top of the wardrobe. Finishing, he tosses the accumulated owl droppings into a wastebasket, which swallows them and belches loudly. During the conversation that follows, the wastebasket occasionally makes soft gagging noises as it coughs up the owl droppings.

Pigwidgeon is almost certainly on the luggage cart which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] brings to the platform, but his presence is not mentioned. The first time we see him is when Ron returns to Harry's compartment and puts Pigwidgeon's cage beside Hedwig's. As they near Hogsmeade station, Ron and Hermione, being prefects, must supervise the other students' preparations, so Pigwidgeon is left for Harry to carry. Luna volunteers to carry Pigwidgeon for him. She is separated from Harry in the crush of students, but catches up to him and Ron as they prepare to enter the horseless carriages, much to Ron's relief.

The next time Pigwidgeon is mentioned is as Ron is returning to school after the Christmas holidays. They are traveling on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Knight Bus|Knight Bus]], which is full of chairs rather than four-poster beds, it being daytime. As the Knight Bus travels with its normal great Bang!, Ron's chair is knocked over and Pigwidgeon, in his lap, bursts out of his cage and flies to the front of the bus, to rest on Hermione's shoulder.

Hedwig and Pigwidgeon are then not seen again until the trip back to London on the Hogwarts Express. It is noted that Hedwig and Pigwidgeon are disturbed by Ron's outburst when he learns that Ginny is going out with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When Harry turns 17 and he is no longer bound by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|the restriction against underage sorcery]], he celebrates by sending a number of Ron's possessions flying around the bedroom they share. The commotion disturbs Pigwidgeon, who starts fluttering madly around in his cage.

Pigwidgeon does not accompany Ron on his travels; we don't see him after Ron, Harry, and Hermione leave The Burrow.

== Strengths ==

Despite his size, Pigwidgeon is a valiant owl. He is always eager for a delivery job, and will tackle any delivery, even if it is so large that he is barely able to lift it. In one scene, Ron tosses him out the window of the Owlery at the school with a letter to carry, and Pigwidgeon falls halfway to the ground before he manages to reach flying speed.

== Weaknesses ==
Pigwidgeon is only about the size of a tennis ball. Though he has a valiant spirit, a standard sized letter is too large for him to handle physically. On one occasion, Pigwidgeon takes several weeks to travel a distance that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] travels in two days. Unlike the other post owls, who apparently can be sent on deliveries with enough accuracy that they can be expected to reach their destination at a specific time, Pigwidgeon, overwhelmed by his cargo, is almost as erratic as the superannuated [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Errol|Errol]] in making his deliveries on time.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Pigwidgeon is owned by Ron Weasley, who seems to be very scathing towards Pigwidgeon in public, referring to him as a &quot;stupid little feathery git&quot;, as he constantly seems to try to show off. However, despite appearances, Ron is actually very attached to Pigwidgeon, as he is the first owl he owns. Ginny also seems quite taken with the owl when Ron first gets him, as she is the one who names Pigwidgeon in the first place.

conservation of linear momentum and recoil velocity===
A motionless catapult was aimed horizontally and fired a 10.0 kg wood block due west at 50 m/s.  If the catapult's mass was 250 kg, what is the recoil velocity of the catapult if friction is ignored?

==Solutions==

Conservation of linear momentum or recoil velocity===
Conservation of linear momentum is used to solve this problem.  The sum of the momentum of the wood block plus the momentum of the catapult must equal the sum of their momentum before the object was fired, which is zero.


M = mass, V = velocity, c = catapult, w = wood block


:&lt;math&gt;M_cV_c+M_wV_w = 0&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;(250. kg)V_c + (10.0 kg)(50.0 m/s) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

     
:&lt;math&gt;V_c =\frac {-(10.0 kg)(50.0 m/s)}{250.0 kg}&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;V_c = - 2.00 m/s&lt;/math&gt;


The negative sign indicates that the direction is opposite to the direction of motion of the wood block, which would be east.

{{BookCat}}


== ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION ==
solution
as we know here ,the external force is zero(The force which provide the forword velocity to the wooden block )so the net momentum of the system will remain constant

Let  
Pi =the initial momentum of the system (catapult + wooden block)
So that Pi = (Pc +Pw) initial
Here Pc is the momentum of the catapult and Pw is the momentum of the wooden block
As initially both of the catapult and wooden block were at rest so that their initial momentum was zero
As the external force on the system is zero so initial momentum of the system must be equals to the final momentum 
Hence Pf = 0 = (Pw +Pc) finally
As Pw = 10*50 =500
And Pc = 250* final velocity of catapult (v)
So that  
(500+250V) =0
V= -2 m/s here negative sign show that the final velocity of the catapult will be in the opposite direction of the wooden block</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The revenue recognition principle is the basis for making adjusting entries at the year end. These are necessary to better match the revenues and expenses that occurred during the accounting year. Adjusting entries are used to record the economic events. Examples of adjusting entries are:

A prepaid expense is an economic benefit paid for in advance of its use. We pay insurance premium for a year. If this period does not coincide with the accounting period then at the year end an advance part of the premium is for the next year. We have to adjust this amount of advance payment as Prepayments (or sundry debtors) Account to reflect that the amount is not yet utilised to the benefit of the company but an asset with future benefit yet to be utilise. Unless similar expenditures are adjusted at the year end, the profit for the year is not accurate.

Similarly, expenses incurred during the year but not yet paid must be accounted for by adjusting by charging to the respective expenditure account and temporarily held in credits on the sundry creditors account as if the amount is owed to the external party.

Another kind of year end adjustment is where there is no financial activity to prompt the record of such transactions. Under this category are apportion of depreciations, provision of directors fees, provision for proposed dividends etc.

Notice all these actions of adjusting is just to reflect on the true and fair situation so that the profits, assets and liabilities of the company is fully stated and recorded completely according to the economic and financial effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Balance Sheet is a [[financial statement]] that lists the [[asset|assets]], [[liability|liabilities]], and the [[equity|ownership equity]] of a [[business entity]] as of a specific date.

A balance sheet can be presented in many different ways. A classified balance sheet is one format where the accounts are listed in some logical manner such as:

* Assets are listed in order of liquidity with the most liquid to the least liquid form. This is usually classified into groups such as Current Assets and Fixed Assets.
* Liabilities are listed in order of when they are become due.  The further subdivision may be Long Term Liabilities and Current Liabilities.
* Equity is generally presented with paid-up capital first and then various reserves and lastly the retained earnings.

The balance sheet could reflects the financial strength of a business. It depends on the type the business. A healthy balance sheet for a merchandiser would probably have a [[Current Ratio]], i.e. Current Assets divided by Current Liabilities of 2 and a Debt Equity ratio of 1:2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Book/Page|prev=Chapter 1|next=Chapter 3|tab=2|title=Dobby's Warning}}
== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

The strange, small creature on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s bed has large, green eyes, pointy ears, and is wearing a ragged pillowcase. He introduces himself as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]]. Dobby is unable to reveal the Wizarding family that owns him, and hits himself uncontrollably each time he tries. He also punishes himself for speaking badly about his masters and for leaving his home without permission, which he did to deliver a dire warning: Harry must not return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] because terrible events will happen at the school. Dobby is once again unable to provide more details. When Harry ignores his warning, Dobby taunts him about his friends not writing to him all summer. When Harry asks how Dobby knew that, Dobby admits having intercepted Harry's letters hoping Harry would think his friends no longer cared about him, and so would not return to school. 

Furious, Harry chases Dobby downstairs, where the Dursleys are dining with the Masons. Dobby levitates [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]]'s cake. When Harry refuses his demand to stay away from Hogwarts, Dobby drops the cake, splattering cream over Petunia's spotless kitchen before vanishing. The Dursleys blame Harry, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] attempts to pacify the Masons, telling them his nephew is slightly disturbed. However, when a messenger owl arrives, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Mason|Mrs. Mason]] becomes frightened, dashing Uncle Vernon's hopes for a lucrative business deal.

The owl-borne letter is from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mafalda Hopkirk|Mafalda Hopkirk]], an official at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], stating that Harry has violated the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]]. Any further magic on Harry's part while away from school may be grounds for expulsion from Hogwarts. Uncle Vernon locks Harry into his bedroom and bars the window, now knowing he is unable to use magic to escape.

Three days later, a rattling on the window bars awakens Harry; in the moonlight, Harry sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] peering in at him.

== Analysis ==

Harry is once again manipulated by forces he is unable to control. A House-elf wants to prevent his return to Hogwarts, nominally for Harry's own protection, though no specific information is provided as to what peril could be there. Harry, believing in his own strength, never considers any real danger awaits at Hogwarts, at least nothing serious enough to compel him to remain at the Dursleys. Dobby probably would have revealed additional information if he could, but as he appears to be a slave, he is likely prohibited from saying more. Of course, there is no definitive proof yet that the House-elf's warning is genuine, and there could even be some sinister motive behind his actions, though that seems unlikely — Dobby's character and actions seem too simplistic and transparent for such a deception, and the deception he does admit to, intercepting Harry's letters, seems almost child-like in its execution and expectation.

If Dobby is indeed being truthful, then his emotional reaction to Harry's respectful manner provides a glimpse into the Wizarding world beyond what Harry, and readers, have seen so far. Dobby's reaction suggests that non-human magical creatures are probably poorly treated in Wizarding society. Also, Dobby's reverential treatment toward Harry re-enforces his fame, and indicates it is even more wide-spread than Harry realized. Harry is still uncomfortable with the unwanted attention, and the knowledge that everyone knows more about him than he does. This fame, at least while he must stay at the Dursleys, is anything but an asset, resulting in his family treating him even more disdainfully as the magical world they so detest increasingly seeps into the Dursley household.  

The Ministry's letter clearly surprises Harry. While he had been warned against using magic at home, he was unaware the Ministry could monitor him. However, they obviously are unable to detect just who performed the magic, as it was assumed it was Harry who cast the Hover charm. Harry's obvious fear while in the kitchen with Dobby was concern that Vernon would punish him for disobeying his orders, rather than the Ministry detecting him using magic. Harry knows Vernon still has significant power over him and can make his life even more miserable. Harry may also fear that Vernon will attempt to prevent him returning to Hogwarts, a fear that seems justified when Harry's bedroom becomes a jail cell.

Tension gradually mounts as Harry's chances to return to the place he loves grow ever more remote. While Ron's appearance at the window brings some immediate relief, it also raises questions: though Ron knows Harry's situation, how can he, also being underage, help Harry? And how, in fact, did he reach Harry's room without triggering a similar Ministry warning?

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Dobby, we will eventually learn, is the Malfoy family's House-elf; we, like Harry, don't yet know this for certain, as he is restricted from revealing anything to Harry. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Dobby's poor condition reflects how the Malfoys generally treat anyone they consider beneath them, just as Harry's physical condition reflects how badly the Dursleys treat him. We have already seen the Malfoys' disdain for those they consider their inferiors, as shown by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco's]] treatment of Harry, Ron, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], treatment that will continue throughout the series. It is Dobby's similarly shabby treatment, compared with how Ron, Hermione, and Harry are treated by Draco, that leads the reader to guess, possibly before Harry, that Dobby is the Malfoy's House-elf.

Dobby is a minor character, though he proves extremely useful to Harry throughout the series. Here, he is violating orders by speaking to Harry; we gather this is because Dobby knows how House-elves' lots improved since [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|the Dark Lord]]'s fall following his encounter with Harry, and, aware that the Malfoys are planning some mischief at Hogwarts, has taken it upon himself to warn Harry. Dobby's freely-given loyalty to Harry will continue, and is returned with Harry's respect and treatment due an equal. The contrast between Dobby responding to Harry's needs, and his response to the Malfoys' demands, is a lesson in the difference and value of loyalty that is freely given as opposed to it being demanded.

It should be noted here that Dobby's expectations for ill-treatment from humans seems common among House-elves; we will see it again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], and to a lesser extent in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]]. Later, we see that Ron, though treating House-elves benignly, also considers them as menials, while Harry and Hermione feel differently; Hermione is even moved to create a student organization, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/S.P.E.W.|S.P.E.W.]], that advocates elf rights. Harry and Hermione have both been raised in non-magical households, and so only recently learned that House-elves existed and are enslaved. Raised as Muggle children, Harry and Hermione were isolated from the prevailing belief that House-elves are an under-class, and should be treated accordingly. Ron, having been raised in the magical world, believes it is morally acceptable to enslave these creatures, and agrees with the generally-held view that most elves are treated well, and are happy only when they have masters to serve. While this may actually be an accurate assessment, it could have resulted from centuries of selective breeding and behavioral conditioning. Bigotry towards House-elves, other non-human magical creatures, and also Muggle-born wizards and witches is a recurring theme throughout the series.

What [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] is planning to send into the school is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] Diary. It is always uncertain whether Malfoy knows exactly what the result will be, or even what the Diary is (Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]). The Diary, we later learn, was likely given to Lucius with information that it was an anti-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mudblood|Mudblood]] weapon, though without details as to how precisely how it would act. If Malfoy had known that the weapon was barely controllable and largely indiscriminate, he might have balked at putting it in such close proximity to his son, Draco, or would at least have issued Draco a stronger warning.

Interestingly, Dobby seems to be better aware of the threat's precise nature than Lucius Malfoy, who is orchestrating it. When Harry asks if the threat is connected to &quot;He Who Must Not Be Named&quot;, Dobby claims it is not, but seems to be hinting at something. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 18|the book's final chapter]], Dobby states it was not precisely &quot;He Who Must Not Be Named&quot;, as the threat was actually from before he stopped using the name Tom Marvolo Riddle in favour of the tabooed &quot;Lord Voldemort&quot;. Dobby is clearly aware this early in the book that the threat, as embodied by the Diary and its embedded Horcrux, is Tom Riddle, who only later adopted his new, self-imposed title. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 12|We hear later]] that Lucius had told his son, Draco, that he did not know who the Heir of Slytherin was. We cannot know if Lucius was lying, but whether or not he knew that the Heir was Tom Riddle, he was probably ignorant about the precise nature of the weapon embedded in the Diary; if he had known that it was a Horcrux, he likely would have been far more careful about what he did with it, and would have known that the plan to attack Hogwarts with it would have to be placed in abeyance until Voldemort had returned and could give the go-ahead.

While Dobby knew Tom Riddle would be the threat's agent, it is unlikely he knew how the threat would be carried out. Dobby is probably unaware of what had happened the previous time the Chamber was opened, as Lucius was a student significantly after that sequence of events. (Tom Riddle had attended Hogwarts some fifty years before this; Lucius Malfoy, only about twenty years previous.)

It is mentioned elsewhere that stories involving magic have a drawback: by making anything possible and largely effortless, it becomes too easy for the hero to succeed, thus making the story uninteresting. The Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery is an intriguing method for the author to impose limitations on using magic. Harry certainly could make his life easier by judiciously using magic during his summer vacations, but that would remove an interesting plot point. The Dursleys, annoying as they are, will remain useful as a contrast to Harry's life at Hogwarts, and his means of coping with his aunt and uncle without using magic becomes a ruler by which to measure his growing character and maturity.  There is an exception to this in the next book when Harry reacts against his family using magic, though it is entirely unintentional, driven by extreme emotions after provocation.

The Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery is significant later in the series. The decree states that it is a  &quot;reasonable&quot; restriction, indicating that circumstances exist under which a minor can use magic, presumably in an emergency situation. While Harry is only issued a warning for the Hover charm, which he did not even cast, later, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], when Harry and cousin [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] are attacked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] intending to suck out their souls, Harry casts a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus charm]] to repel them. However, the Ministry of Magic immediately suspends Harry from Hogwarts and charges him with a crime, forcing him to attend a full Ministry hearing. Their sole motive at that time is to permanently expel him not only from Hogwarts, but wizard society, thus removing him as an impediment to the Ministry's official agenda regarding Voldemort. The Ministry misuses the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery solely to achieve this; Harry is forced to prove that his using magic in that situation is, in fact, reasonable, in the face of a court biased strongly against him.

=== Connections ===
* The Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery is here mentioned for the first time by name. It is earlier mentioned [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|in the previous book]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 1|in the first chapter of this book]] without being named. Concerns about violating this Decree will cause Harry to bolt [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 2|early in the next book]], only to be effectively pardoned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 3|the following chapter]]. The Decree is mentioned again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 2|the fifth book]], and it is used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 8|later in that book]] as a weapon against Harry, at which it proves inadequate. Finally it is mentioned that the Trace enforcing the Decree has been terminated [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 7|on the morning of Harry's 17th birthday]].
* &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is the first thing Dobby says in the series. It will be also the last thing he says in the series, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 23|before he dies]].
* The warning letter was sent by Mafalda Hopkirk. Mafalda will [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Books/Order_of_the_Phoenix/Chapter_2|send Harry two more letters]] when he uses magic to protect himself and Dudley from Dementors. Later, when the Trio breaks into the Ministry, [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Books/Deathly_Hallows/Chapter_12|Hermione will be disguised as Mafalda]] by using Polyjuice Potion.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Book/Page|prev=Chapter 2|next=Chapter 4|tab=3|title=The Burrow}}
== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and his brothers, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], are outside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s window in a flying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]]. There to rescue Harry, they pull the bars off the window with the car. Fred and George gather Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] belongings that are locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and load them into the car.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] screeches, reminding Harry she is being left behind. This awakens [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]], who barges into Harry's room as Harry is half way out the window. Grabbing Harry's ankle, he attempts to pull him back in, but Harry yanks free, and he, Ron, Fred, and George head to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Weasley Family|the Weasleys]]' home, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]].

Harry tells Ron, Fred, and George about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], and they speculate about who owns him, eventually concluding that he could belong to the Malfoys. Harry learns that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]]'s father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], once supported [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]].

They arrive at The Burrow, an oddly crooked house. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]] is waiting, furious that they &quot;borrowed&quot; the car. After yelling at the Twins and Ron, Mrs. Weasley warmly greets Harry. During breakfast, Harry glimpses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], Ron's younger sister, who is apparently too shy to speak.

As punishment, the Twins and Ron must [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gnome|de-Gnome]] the garden, using ''Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests'' technique in his book. Curious, Harry assists, even though he does not have to. He attempts to gently drop the leathery Gnomes over the fence, but after being bitten, he flings them like the Weasley boys, who first twirl them until they are too dizzy to find their way back.

Ron's father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], who works for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], arrives after a long night's work, searching for illegal and Dark magical objects. Mr. Weasley loves Muggle technology and gadgets, and he is clearly intrigued with his sons' adventure in the car until Mrs. Weasley sternly chastises him. Ron shows Harry his bedroom, which is plastered in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] posters. He apologizes for his home's disorderliness, but Harry thinks it is all wonderful, and, as he watches the gnomes making their way back into the garden, looks forward to spending the remaining summer with the Weasleys.

== Analysis ==

In the last chapter we asked: how can Ron help Harry? Ron is underage, as are Fred and George, and capable though they may be, they are prevented from using magic to free Harry. However, apart from the flying car, which apparently does not violate the prohibition against underage magic, no magic is used to liberate Harry. Instead, the bars are pulled off the window with the car, and Fred and George pick both the bedroom's and the cupboard under the stairs' locks with a common Muggle hairpin. The same hairpin is used to open Hedwig's cage, freeing her for the first time all summer. It is never made clear why casting a spell triggers the prohibition trace, but using a charmed object like the flying car does not; for some speculation on this matter, please see the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|The Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]]. 

It is worth noting how quickly Harry settles in to the Weasley household. The reader gets the feeling that Harry feels at home almost instantly, even before Mrs. Weasley tips a few extra sausages onto his breakfast plate. Some of this, no doubt, is due to the existing friendship with Ron, but that alone is not sufficient to explain it. We can speculate that part of Harry's increasing comfort in The Burrow is due to acceptance of his magical ability, and part to the healthy communication between Weasley family members. This straightforward relationship is something Harry has been hunting for during almost all of his time at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']], and has never found.

The author often mentions a character by name before they are actually seen. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]], who plays a large role in the book, is introduced here, by name only. He is apparently handsome (&quot;'Mum fancies him,' said Fred in a very audible whisper&quot;), and his solutions for problems may look good on paper, but only seem to work temporarily when employed. By sunset, Harry observes the Gnomes sneaking back into the garden one-by-one through the Weasley's hedge.

Ginny Weasley is reintroduced, though she only glances at Harry from afar; every time she sees him (twice in this chapter), she squeaks and runs away. Says Ron, &quot;You don't know how weird it is for her to be this shy, she never shuts up normally . . .&quot; She may have a classic schoolgirl crush, building Harry up in her mind as some heroic figure, then, when physically in his presence, is too timid to speak.

The boys have correctly surmised that Dobby belongs to the Malfoys, though Harry will be uncertain until the book's end. Simply because Dobby is the Malfoy's property, his actions, though supposedly meant to protect Harry, would actually seem suspicious and likely motivated by that family for some sinister purpose. However, Dobby has risked his own life to warn Harry that he is in grave danger should he return to Hogwarts. Because Dobby is the Malfoys' slave, he has become aware that Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy, is behind the plot to unleash a monster within Hogwarts. Because Dobby is magically bound to protect the Malfoy family's secrets, his warning to Harry is so vague that Harry mostly disregards it. Even were Dobby able to be more explicit, however, nothing could dissuade Harry from returning to Hogwarts, the only place he feels he fits in.

Ginny's reaction to Harry makes it seem unlikely that they would ever have a significant relationship. Oftentimes, a schoolgirl crush simply fades over time, and Ginny's feelings seem more like superficial hero-worship than romantic interest. Ginny, however, will be thrust into several events that force her to mature quickly, and her feelings for Harry deepen as she gradually understands who he really is. Starting even before this chapter, a study of Ginny's character will be rewarding, as the author writes a very realistic maturation for her, ending with a true romantic relationship with Harry.

Several other minor plot points occur in this chapter. Gilderoy Lockhart soon appears, true to our expected image: physically attractive, charming, seemingly plausible, but ultimately unreliable. This tendency to believe in someone simply because they have certain desirable attributes is illustrated by other characters, notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], a former Slytherin student, who, fifty years earlier, falsely implicated [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] in opening the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] and unleashing a monster. Even though Riddle was behind the attacks, he was considered believable mainly because he was handsome, intelligent, personable, and fully human. (Hagrid, we will find out in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 23|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], is half-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giant]].)

The gnomes making their way back into the garden is actually a point in understanding Lockhart's character. Though we have not yet met him, this vignette is a classic example of Lockhart's style: flashy, plausible, initially appearing to work, but ultimately failing. We will see the same in the man himself and in his magic later in this book.

The flying Ford Anglia will also make a few more appearances; notably, it will carry Ron and Harry to school when they find they can't reach Platform Nine and Three Quarters, and it will save Harry and Ron when they get into trouble in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] later in this book.

Arthur Weasley mentions someone named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], who tried to jinx him when his back was turned. Mundungus reappears in the fourth book, as shady as this brief mention leads us to expect, and in each book after that. We never find him to be trustworthy, though he is an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] member and apparently loyal to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and the Order.

Mr. Weasley's job with the Ministry will also prove important, not only because it gives him the authority to investigate other characters for Dark magic, but because it showcases his apparent unambitious nature, as he actually enjoys what he does and stays with it, foregoing the traditional career-advancing track to achieve status and more money that other Ministry employees seek; this unusual trait apparently attracts unwelcome attention from the likes of Lucius Malfoy.

Also, as is typical of how the author introduces something or someone long before it plays a part in the series, it is mentioned that the Weasleys have a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghoul|Ghoul]] in the attic. This Ghoul will play an important role in the final book, though it remains unseen to readers until then.

=== Connections ===

* The ghoul in the Weasley's attic will be made up to look like Ron with a case of Spattergroit, to explain his absence from Hogwarts when he leaves the Burrow with Harry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].
* Arthur Weasley's lack of ambition will be a point of friction with his son [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]]. Percy, also working for the Ministry, is extremely ambitious, and cannot accept that his father is happy in what seems to him to be a dead-end job. The issue that finally results in Percy's estrangement from the family is marginally based on this. The official Ministry position, at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 37|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], is that Dumbledore and Harry are lying about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s return, and Arthur refuses to reject his faith in Dumbledore for the chance to improve his Ministry position. Percy severs relations with his family to prevent any hindrance in his career that would spring from his family's support for Dumbledore.
* While we generally do not mention characters in the Connections section, this chapter's mention of Mundungus Fletcher is worthy of note. Fletcher, who will reappear next in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], and will play a substantial role in each succeeding book, is worth mention here as an indication that the author had already begun to plan for a Wizarding underworld, not allied with either side of the principal conflict, but rather out for what they could get for themselves. Fletcher will develop into a small-time con-man, thief, and dealer of contraband and stolen goods, but will have a significant role to play because of his situation at the edge of respectability. When we see him next, he will be making an inflated damages claim, for the destruction of a twelve-room tent that he had never owned.</text>

In this chapter of the [[Torts Casebook|Torts Casebook]] we will discuss Wrongful Death

[[Image:Life of a Law Student Torts 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Neil Wehneman is a 1L at University of Cincinnati School of Law]]

* Neil Wehneman's notes on this topic (personal communication).

== Cases: ==

=== Eleason v. Western Casualty &amp; Surety Co. - Wisconsin Supreme Court 1948 ===

==== Facts: ====

* The plaintiff was the executor of an estate that belonged to a man run down by a truck and killed

* The defendant was an insurance company 
**at this point in time, Wisconsin allowed direct action against an insurance company

* Luer, driver of the truck, was driving the truck within the scope of his employment; [[wikipedia: respondeat superior|respondeat superior]] would have kicked in through [[wikipedia: Vicarious liability|vicarious liability]]

* Within a few hours of the man's death, his wife died after finding out about the tragedy

* Luer knew that he had &quot;spells&quot; where he would lose consciousness

* It was illegal for someone with epilepsy to get a driver's license

==== Issues: ====

''Is it [[wikipedia: negligence| negligence]], specifically wrongful death action, for an individual who suffers from &quot;spells&quot; (even if he does not understand their reason) to drive?''

==== Decision: ====  

'''Yes''', the [[wikipedia: reasonable person|reasonable person]] would be aware of the danger caused by these &quot;spells&quot;. 

The defense in turn justified the actions by saying they were &quot;[[wikipedia: Act of God|Acts of God]]&quot;

Response by the Supreme Court Justice: &quot;the term [[wikipedia:Act of God|Act of God]] in its legal sense means such inevitable accident as cannot be prevented by human care, skill, or foresight.&quot;

== Wrongful Death Overview: ==

Wrongful death is one of the most significant torts, as far as damages go; it does not fall under the [[wikipedia:common law|common law]], it is a statutory tort. 

'''Statutes'''

Under common law, you cannot recover from wrongful death. The theory is that you cannot be &quot;made whole&quot; if you are dead. 

The statutes fixed this problem by assigning the rights to the heirs of the deceased. (Note: If the heirs are not determined by the will, the state has a means of finding your rightful heirs)

'''Damages'''

Due to [[wikipedia:tort reform|tort reform]] the common law often puts a caps on tort damages. In Ohio, the constitution states that wrongul death damages cannot be capped, but a statute is in place that does not allow for punitive damages. 

There is ''huge'' list of damages that can be included, ie consortium, companionship, education, etc...

'''Survival Action'''

This is a period after the negligent action by the plaintiff, but before the eventual wrongful death. 

::This period of time involves medical expenses, lost wages, and mental and physical pain. 

If you die immediately you cannot recover, and if you are unconscious you will only get medical expenses.

'''Unmarried, Long Term Couples'''

In general, unwed couples do not have the ability to recover from a wrongful death unless it is stated explicitly in the statute. However, they do have legal recourse if they are mentioned in the explicit will.

===Introduction:===
In economics,Use Value (or Total Use Value (TUV)) is the level of satisfication or preference in terms of money to the amount of goods obtained. It follows the law of demand &amp; decreases with more goods or service obtained.

===Corresponding Equation===
====Average use Value (AUV)====
Equation definition: &lt;math&gt;TUV/Q&lt;/math&gt;

====Marginal Use Value (MUV)====
Equation definition: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta\ TUV}{\Delta\ Q}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As we consider the &lt;math&gt;\Delta\ Q\rightarrow 0,&lt;/math&gt; we can rewrite as &lt;math&gt;\frac{dTUV}{dQ}&lt;/math&gt;

==Utility==
By full differential:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dTU=\frac{\delta X}{\delta U}dX+\frac{\delta X}{\delta U}dY&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ajani's Law ==

Ajani's Law states that '''&quot;Life is Great.&quot;'''

Justification: From an empty shell-of-a-body, life is breathed into it and there rises a Man capable of thought, speech and action.

Truth: There is nothing we look forward to more when we fall asleep than to wake in the morning.

Belief: Who does not want to believe that life was given to us so that we could fulfill a purpose, some higher destiny, a given calling?

Therefore, given that justified true belief virtually equates knowledge, Ajani's Law is knowledge.

&quot;I travelled from the past to declare this law void.&quot; - Ajani</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">First and most important: Always remember, that we are writing a scientific book, not a novel; an essay; or a wikipedia article.
For a start you could [http://www.scidev.net/ms/howdoi/index.cfm?pageid=60 read this article]

Try to write a consistent block of text, using subheadings, paragraphs and footnotes. '''Do not''' make listings, keywords and in general &lt;u&gt;articles&lt;/u&gt;, but chapters.

Your first assignment is the introduction to your chapter. Keep in mind that this is the basis for the rest of your chapter. You shouldn't later rewrite your Introduction completely, because you did not know what to write. This assignment already counts for your mark.

Klasse die Zusammenarbeit, diese Dinge sind mir noch nicht aufgefallen. Bei mir waren es vor allem das deutsche Endglisch was mir in den Augen wehgetan hat und ich mit sehr viel Muehe korrigiert habe. Man will ja nicht die Arbeit der Anderen zerstoeren. Aber schliesslich ist es die Grundvorraussetzung fuer einen  gut strukturierten Text und fuer die Lesbarkeit sowieso.  
Auf der einen Seite gebe ich dir Recht, dass wir erst warten sollten bis alles hochgeladen ist, aber auf der anderen Seite werden die Seiten vom 19.8. bewertet und Veraenderungen danach nicht mehr! Da ich ja auch noch Tutorin bin muss ich mir das alles ja eh noch ein paar mal durchlesen und eigentlich hiess es dass wir wie gesagt die Versionen vom Samstag ausdrucken sollen. Naja vielleicht kann man bei unserer Gruppe ja auch eine Ausnahme machen. Bei den Kapiteln wo noch nichts stand habe ich auch auf die Discussion Homepage geschrieben, dass es sehr wichtig fuer unsere Gruppe ist, dass Sachen schon vorher hochgeladen werden. Trotzdem erwarte ich, dass alles erst wirklich Sonntag fertig sein wird. Conclusion aus all meinem Gelaber, ich denke wir sollten zumindestens die fast fertigen Kapitel schon bearbeiten, da fuer die Gruppen danach ja keine Moeglichkeit gibt was zu veraendern. Ich wundere mich nur ob wir die Text so tiefgreifend aendern sollen (so wie ich das im oberflaechlichen mit dem Korrigieren gemacht habe) oder ob wir die Gruppen nur darauf hinweisen was sie verbessern sollen. Oder teils teils...?
Ich glaube das mit dem 'you' zu aendern ist es jetzt zu spaet. Mir war noch aufgefallen dass manche Anfaenge netter sind wie andere, so z.B. die wo es Beispiele oder kleine Geschichten gibt. Auf den Discussion Seiten der Gruppen die eher einen sproeden Anfang haben, habe ich das vermerkt und teilweise mails verschickt, wenn mir aufgefallen war, dass die Gruppe kaum auf ihre Seite geht. Manche Gruppen habe kaum oder auch gar keine Bilder, was ebenfalls wichtig fuer eine gute Praesentation waere. Ansonsten, finde zumindestens ich, sind ein paar schon richtig gute dabei.
So jetzt habe ich mein Gehirn so weit entleert und hoffentlich nichts vergessen. 
Und ja ich mache gerade Ferien in Frankreich und vor der Haustuer der Mont Blanc. Rafael besucht hier eine Physikschule und waehrendessen arbeite ich halt am Wikibook.

So, also ich hab mal ein bisschen drübergeschaut und mir schonmal ein paar
Stichpunkte gemacht. Ich würde vorschlagen, die ganzen Korrekturen
diesbezüglich aber erst zu machen, wenn alle ihre kompletten Arbeiten
hochgeladen haben, denn erst dann kann man ja alles einheitlich machen,
wenn man weiß, wie die anderen Sachen so sind.
Was ich mir so aufgeschrieben habe sind kleinere Sachen, wie z.B., dass in
der Contentbox die gleichen Begriffe verwendet werden sollten (&quot;Links&quot; vs.
&quot;External Links&quot; z.B.), dass die Contentbox immer ganz oben stehen sollte
und darunter ne Introduction (nicht Outline wie in Evolutionary
Perspektive on Social Cognitions) und so Zeug.
Desweiteren hab ich da aber auch was schwerwiegenderes gefunden. Und zwar
wird in 7 von den 14 Projekten mit &quot;you&quot; gearbeitet (hoffe du verstehst
was ich meine) und in den anderen nicht. Vielleicht sollte man das auch
noch anpassen, obwohl man sich dann einigen müsste, ob man in allen Texten
&quot;you&quot; verwendet oder in keinem. In beiden Fällen wird das Umschreiben ne
blöde Arbeit. Unter Umständen würden wir dann da vielleicht zuviel
Einfluss auf den Text nehmen, denn die Sätze müssten dann komplett neu
formuliert werden.
Ansonsten sehe ich da bisher nicht mehr viel, was wir noch machen
könnten/sollten. Wie gesagt würde ich da ganz gerne warten, bis wir alles
vorliegen haben, um das dann anzugleichen.
 
Bist du eigentlich noch im Urlaub? Wie lange insgesamt? Wenn du noch da
sein solltest erhol' dich noch gut.
 
Bis demnächst.
LG
Steffen

Hi Imme, könntest du dir bitte mal unseren [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Knowledge  Text] (Chapter 13) anschauen und sagen, ob das so ungefähr als Introduction annehmbar ist?

LG, anna (Gruppe Knowledge)

Hey Imme,

kleiner Tipp: In der editing Leiste hat es einen Knopf &quot;unterschreiben&quot;. Dadurch kannst du geschreibsel spraen und die leute können dir direkt auf der seite hier rückmeldung geben.

== Are we referring to inflection here? ==
By &quot;the different spoken pronounciation,&quot; I assume we are not talking about the pronunciation (the sounds that make up the words), but rather the inflection (the tones, what would be notes in music).  What I don't know is whether saying &quot;inflection&quot; here would clarify anything for the reader, who may not recognize the word.

== What writing system(s) does this language use? ==
Estonian uses the letters in the English alphabet, but includes several letters with diacritics. Here is a list of all the Estonian letters.

:A, B, '''C''', D, E, '''F''', G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, '''Q''', R, S, '''Š''', '''Z''', '''Ž''', T, U, V, '''W''', Õ, Ä, Ö, Ü, '''X''', '''Y'''

Letters in '''bold''' are only used in words that are not actually Estonian; rather, they are from another language.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|diacritic|a mark added to a letter to change how it's pronounced.}}

== How many people speak this language? ==
Estonian is spoken by about 1.1 million people, making it the 243rd highest language in number of speakers.

== Where is this language spoken? ==
Estonian is an official language in:

*[[Wikijunior:Europe/Estonia|Estonia]]
*[[Wikijunior:Europe/EU|European Union]]

It is a minority language in:
* [[Wikijunior:Europe/Finland|Finland]]
* [[Wikijunior:Europe/Russia|Russia]]

== What is the history of this language? ==
It is believed that the Baltic-Finnic languages evolved from a proto-Finnic language, from which Sami was separated around 1500–1000 BC. It has been suggested that this proto-Finnic had three dialects: northern, southern and eastern. The Baltic-Finnic languages separated around the first century, but continued influencing each other. You might see southwestern Finnish dialects have many genuine Estonian influences.

Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under great cultural influence of Germany. Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native people, so they invented the Estonian literal language. It was based on the German alphabet and one character &quot;Õ/õ&quot; was added. As time passed, many words that were borrowed from German coalesced. This was the beginning of enlightenment. 

When the Estonians declared themselves a nation, at the beginning of the 20th century, the country bloomed. For the first time they could express themselves freely. This was the golden age of Estonia, and the language evolved greatly. 

The Second World War ended the golden age. Forces from the east marched in, took power, and Estonian was often deemed unnecessary to speak or teach. At that time many changes were made. For example, the structure of sentences was changed — the verb was put at the beginning of the sentence. Interestingly, this is not the way that it is in German.

When the Estonian people got back to power, the Soviet Union was disunified. They were a democratic nation for a second time; the cultural shield was broken. New information came in. A lot of slang words and phrases were adopted from English and English-speaking countries.

==Interesting fact==
Finnish and Estonian are closely-related languages. It's been said that northern Estonians can understand what is being said by Finnish people, even if they haven't learned Finnish.

Strangely, it doesn't seem to work the other way around. The Finnish have to put a lot more effort into learning Estonian, than Estonians have to put in for Finnish.

== What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language? ==

At Christmas time, you might like to sing Christmas carols about your tree. The Estonians do, too. This song is originally called &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot;, but it's called &quot;Oh kuusepuu&quot; in Estonian. It has also been translated into English. The song was first written by Ernst Anschütz in 1824.

Here is the first verse:

== Pronounciation ==

How can we know we're pronouncing these words right?  (well, unless it's Arabic, it must be English phonenems) Should I attend a preschool Arabic speaking class? ;)

[[User:66.219.200.234|66.219.200.234]] 21:50, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

: I know I am pronouncing them right because I speak arabic. Most arabic letters have very similar sounds, some however are pronounced more emphaticly, which your tounge on the roof of your mouth. The only letter really quite difficult for people new to arabic to pronounce is the &quot;alif&quot; (&quot;ا&quot;). However, if there is a great enough need to, i can provide a recording of the words in the &quot;What words can i learn&quot; section. [[User:N1person|N1person]] 14:43, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:: Except for `ayn...  i still can't say that letter!  Would this (and maybe the other sections) be helped by showing the alphabet of the language in question, or samples of characters if it's a character-based system? [[User:The chavi|The chavi]] 23:56, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

== taskheel ==
Hi there,
since arabic is a special consideration you might put the &quot;tashkeel&quot; التشكيل (or maybe harakat? الحركات )into the samples? it should be a good idea for people who are not originally arabic, since they are the ones that might be interested in this book,
[[User:84.36.2.133|84.36.2.133]] 23:31, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
== Who are some famous authors or poets in this language? ==
The first sentence (The most famous and influential Arabic &quot;author&quot; of all time was the founder of Islam, Mohammad with the Holy Qur'an. He was the  messenger of God with the Qur'an, Islam's holy book. ) in this section conveys the idea that Quran was written/authored by Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him) where as Muslims believe Quran is the word of Almighty God. This sentence requires modification to reflect the same.</text>

==Introduction &amp; History==

Imagine yourself being on vacation. It is already evening and you are sitting at the beach, watching the sun setting over the ocean. A warm summer breeze tickles your skin. You look at the horizon and try to imagine what the world was like, when people thought that beyond that ocean there is only the rim of the world. Suddenly, Knut walks by and reminds you of your task to find out what imagery is. In sheer surprise you wake up and continue reading this article.

This chapter deals with exactly the phenomenon you just experienced: Mental imagery. It resembles perceptual experience but occurs in the absence of external stimuli. Very often, imagery experiences are understood by their subjects as echoes, copies, or reconstructions of actual perceptual experiences from their past, while at other times they may seem to anticipate possible, often desired or feared future experiences. Though imagery can occur with respect to sensory modalities like acoustic perception and even emotional feeling, the majority of research was actually done on the topic of ''visual imagery'', on which we are going to focus as well.

Mental imagery was already discussed by the early Greek philosophers. Socrates sketched a relation between perception and imagery by assuming that visual sensory experience creates images in the human's mind, which are representations of the real world. Later on, Aristoteles stated that &quot;thought is impossible without an image&quot;. At the beginning of the 18th century, Bishop Berkeley proposed another role of mental images - similar to the ideas of Sokrates - in his theory of idealism. He assumed that our whole perception of the external world consists only of mental images.

At the end of the 19th century Wilhelm Wundt - the generally acknowledged founder of experimental psychology and cognitive psychology - called imagery, sensations and feelings the basic elements of consciousness. Furthermore, he had the idea that the study of imagery supports the study of cognition because thinking is often accompanied by images. This remark was taken up by some psychologists and gave rise to the ''imageless-thought debate'', which discussed the same question Aristoteles already had asked: Is thought possible without imagery?

In the early 20th century, when Behaviourism became the main stream of psychology, Watson argued that there is no visible evidence of images in human brains and therefore, the study of imagery is worthless. This general attitude towards the value of research on imagery did not change until the birth of cognitive psychology in the 1950s and -60s.

Later on, imagery has often been believed to play a very large, even pivotal, role in both memory (Yates, 1966; Paivio, 1986) and motivation (McMahon, 1973). It is also commonly believed to be centrally involved in visuo-spatial reasoning and inventive or creative thought.

==The Imagery Debate==
Imagine yourself back on vacation again. You are now walking along the beach, while
projecting images of white benzene-molecules onto the horizon. At once you are
realizing that there are two real little white dots under your projection. Couriously
you are walking towards them, until your visual field is filled by two seriously looking,
but fiercely debating scientists. As they take notice of your presence, they invite you
to take a seat and listen to the still unsolved imagery debate.

Today’s imagery debate is mainly influenced by two opposing theories: On
the one hand Zenon Pylyshyn’s (left) propositional theory and on the other hand
Stephen Kosslyn’s (right) spatial representation theory of imagery processing.

===Theory of propositional representation===
The theory of Propositional Representation was founded by Dr. Zenon Pylyshyn
who invented it in 1973. He described it as an epiphenomenon which accompanies
the process of imagery, but is not part of it. Mental images do not show us how
the mind works exactly. They only show us that something is happening. Just like
the display of a compact disc player. There are flashing lights that display that
something happens. We are also able to conclude what happens, but the display
does not show us how the processes inside the compact disc player work. Even if
the display would be broken, the compact disc player would still continue to play
music.

====Representation====
The basic idea of the propositional representation is that relationships between objects
are representated by symbols and not by spatial mental images of the scene. For
example, a bottle under a table would be represented by a formula made of symbols
like '''UNDER(BOTTLE,TABLE)'''. The term ''proposition'' is lend from the domains of Logic and
Linguistics and means the smallest possible entity of information. Each proposition can either be true or false.

If there is a sentence like &quot;Debby donated a big amount of money to Greenpeace,
an organisation which protects the environment&quot;, it can be recapitulated by the propositions &quot;Debby donated money to Greenpeace&quot;, &quot;The amount of
money was big&quot; and &quot;Greenpeace protects the environment&quot;. The truth value of the whole sentence depends on the truth values of its constituents. Hence, if one of the propositions is false, so is the whole sentence.

====Propositional networks====
This last model does not imply that a person remembers the sentence or its single
propositions in its exact literal wording. It is rather assumed that the information
is stored in the memory in a propositional network.

[[Image:Proprep1.png|center|Figure 1: Example of a propositional network]]

In Figure 1 each circle represents a single proposition. Regarding the fact that
some components are connected to more than one proposition, they
construct a network of propositions. Propositional networks can also have a hierarchy,
if a single component of a proposition is not a single object, but a proposition
itself. An example of a hierarchical propositional network describing the sentence
&quot;John believes that Anna will pass her exam&quot; is illustrated in Figure 2.

[[Image:Proprep2.png|center|Figure 2: Propositional network with hierarchy]]

====Complex objects and schemes====
Even complex objects can be generated and described by propositional representation.
A complex object like a ship would consist of a structure of nodes which
represent the ships properties and the relationship of these properties.
&lt;!--A propositional representation of a ship is illustrated in Figure 3--&gt;

Almost all humans have concepts of commonly known objects like ships or houses in their mind.
These concepts are abstractions of complex propositional networks and are called schemes. For example our
concept of a house includes propositions like:

 Houses have rooms.
 Houses can be made from wood.
 Houses have walls.
 Houses have windows.
 ...

Listing all of these propositions does not show the structure of relationships between these propositions. Instead, a concept of something can be arranged in a schema consisting of a list of attributes and values, which describe the properties of the object. Attributes describe possible forms of categorisation, while values rep-
resent the actual value for each attribute. The schema-representation of a house looks like this:

 ''House''
 Category: building
 Material: stone, wood 
 Contains: rooms
 Function: shelter for humans
 Shape: rectangular
 ...

The hierarchical structure of schemes is organised in categories. For example, &quot;house&quot;
belongs to the category &quot;building&quot; (which has of course its own schema) and contains
all attributes and values of the parent schema plus its own specific values and attributes.
This way of organising objects in our environment into hierarchical models enables us to
recognise objects we have never seen before in our life, because they can possibly be related to categories we already know.

====Experimental support====
In an experiment performed by Wisemann und Neissner in 1974, people are shown a
picture which, on first sight, seems to consist of random black and white shapes.
After some time the subjects realise that there is a dalmatian dog in it.
The results of this show that people who recognise the dog remember the picture better than people
who do not recognise him. An possible explanation is that the picture is stored in the memory not as a picture, but as a proposition.

In an experiment by Weisberg in 1969 subjects should memorise sentences like
&quot;Children who are slow eat bread that is cold&quot;. Then the subjects were asked to
associate the first word from the sentence that comes in their mind to a word given
by the experiment conductor. Almost all subjects associated the word &quot;children&quot; to the given
word &quot;slow&quot;, although the word &quot;bread&quot; has a position that is more close to the given
word &quot;slow&quot; than the word &quot;children&quot;. An explanation for this is that the sentence is
stored in the memory using the three propositions &quot;Children are slow&quot;, &quot;Children
eat bread&quot; and &quot;Bread is cold&quot;. The subjects associated the word &quot;children&quot; with
the given word &quot;slow&quot;, because both belong to one proposition, while &quot;bread&quot; and
&quot;slow&quot; belong to different ones. The same evidence was proven in another experiment
by Ratcliff and McKoon in 1978.

===Theory of spatial representation===
Stephen Kosslyn's theory opposing Pylyshyn's propositional approach implies that images are not only represented by propositions. He tried to find evidence for a spatial representation system that constructs mental, analogous, three-dimensional models.

The primary role of this system is to organize spatial information in a general form that can be accessed by either perceptual or linguistic mechanisms. It also provides coordinate frameworks to describe object locations, thus creating a model of a perceived or described environment. The advantage of a coordinate representation is that it is directly analogous to the structure of real space and captures all possible relations between objects encoded in the coordinate space. These frameworks also reflect differences in the salience of objects and locations consistent with the properties of the environment, as well as the ways in which people interact with it. Thus, the representations created are models of physical and functional aspects of the environment.

====Encoding====
What, then, can be said about the primary components of cognitive spatial representation? Certainly, the distinction between the external world and our internal view of it is essential, and it is helpful to explore the relationship between the two further from a process-oriented perspective.

The classical approach assumes a complex internal representation in the mind that is constructed through a series of specific perceived stimuli, and that these stimuli generate specific internal responses. Research dealing specifically with geographic-scale space has worked from the perspective that the macro-scale physical environment is extremely complex and essentially beyond the control of the individual. This research, such as that of Lynch and of Golledge (1987) and his colleagues, has shown that there is a complex of behavioural responses generated from corresponding complex external stimuli, which are themselves interrelated. Moreover, the results of this research offers a view of our geographic knowledge as a highly interrelated external/internal system. Using landmarks encountered within the external landscape as navigational cues is the clearest example of this interrelationship.

The rationale is as follows: We gain information about our external environment from different kinds of perceptual experience; by navigating through and interacting directly with geographic space as well as by reading maps, through language, photographs and other communication media. Within all of these different types of experience, we encounter elements within the external world that act as symbols. These symbols, whether a landmark within the real landscape, a word or phrase, a line on a map or a building in a photograph, trigger our internal knowledge representation and generate appropriate responses. In other words, elements that we encounter within our environment act as external knowledge stores.

[[Image:Spatrep1.png|350px|center|Figure 3: Internal representation map]]

Each external symbol has meaning that is acquired through the sum of the individual perceiver's previous experience. That meaning is imparted by both the specific cultural context of that individual and by the specific meaning intended by the generator of that symbol. Of course, there are many elements within the natural environment not &quot;generated&quot; by anyone, but that nevertheless are imparted with very powerful meaning by cultures (e.g. the sun, moon and stars). Man-made elements within the environment, including elements such as buildings, are often specifically designed to act as symbols as at least part of their function. The sheer size of downtown office buildings, the pillars of a bank facade and church spires pointing skyward are designed to evoke an impression of power, stability or holiness, respectively.

These external symbols are themselves interrelated, and specific groupings of symbols may constitute self-contained external models of geographic space. Maps and landscape photographs are certainly clear examples of this. Elements of differing form (e.g., maps and text) can also be interrelated. These various external models of geographic space correspond to external memory.
From the perspective just described, the total sum of any individual's knowledge is contained in a multiplicity of internal and external representations that function as a single, interactive whole. The representation as a whole can therefore be characterised as a synergistic, self-organising and highly dynamic network.

====Experimental support====
=====Interaction=====
Early experiments on imagery were already done in 1910 by Perky. He tried to find out, if there is any interaction between imagery and perception by a simple mechanism. Some subjects are told to project an image of common objects like a ship onto a wall. Without their knowledge there is a back projection, which subtly shines through the wall. Then they have to describe this picture, or are  questioned about for example the orientation or the colour of the ship. In Perkys experiment, none of the 20 subjects recognised that the description of the picture did not arise from their mind, but were completely influenced by the picture shown to them.

=====Image Scanning=====
Another seminal research in this field were Kosslyn's image-scanning experiments in the 1970s. Referring to the example of the mental representation of a ship, he experienced another linearity within the move of the mental focus from one part of the ship to another. The reaction time of the subjects increased with distance between the two parts, which indicates, that we actually create a mental picture of scenes while trying to solve small cognitive tasks. Interestingly, this visual ability can be observed also with congenitally blind, as Marmor and Zaback (1976) found out. Presuming, that the underlying processes are the same of sighted subjects, it could be concluded that there is a deeper encoded system that has access to more than the visual input.

=====Mental Rotation Task=====
Other advocates of the spatial representation theory, Shepard and Metzler, developed the mental rotation task in 1971. Two objects are presented to a participant in different angles and his job is to decide whether the objects are identical or not. The results show that the reaction times increases linearly with the rotation angle of the objects. The participants mentally rotate the objects in order to match the objects to one another. This process is called &quot;mental chronometry&quot;.

Together with Paivio's memory research, this experiment was crucial for the importance of imagery within cognitive psychology, because it showed the similarity of imagery to the processes of perception.
For a mental rotation of 40° the subjects needed two seconds in average, whereas for a 140° rotation the reaction time increased to four seconds. Therefore it can be concluded that people in general have a mental object rotation rate of 50° per second.

=====Spatial Frameworks=====
Although most research on mental models has focussed on text comprehension, researchers generally believe that mental models are perceptually based. Indeed, people have been found to use spatial frameworks like those created for texts to retrieve spatial information about observed scenes (Bryant, 1991). Thus, people create the same sorts of spatial memory representations no matter if they read about an environment or see it themselves.

=====Size and the visual field=====
If an object is observed from different distances, it is harder to perceive details if the object is far away because the objects fill only a small part of the visual field. Kosslyn made an experiment in 1973 in which he wanted to find out if this is also true for mental images, to show the similarity of the spatial representation and the perception of real environment. He told participants to imagine objects which are far away and objects which are near. After asking the participants about details, he supposed that details can be observed better if the object is near and fills the visual field. He also told the participants to imagine animals with different sizes near by another. For example an elephant and a rabbit. The elephant filled much more of the visual field than the rabbit and it turned out that the participants were able to answer questions about the elephant more rapidly than about the rabbit. After that the participants had to imagine the small animal besides an even smaller animal, like a fly. This time, the rabbit filled the bigger part of the visual field and again, questions about the bigger animal were answered faster. The result of Kosslyn's experiments is that people can observe more details of an object if it fills a bigger part of their mental visual field. This provides evidence that mental images are represented spatial.

===Discussion===
Since the 1970s many experiments enriched the knowledge about imagery and memory to a great extend in the course of the two opposing point of views of the imagery debate. The seesaw of assumed support was marked of lots of smart ideas. The following section is an example of the potential of such controversities.

In 1978, Kossylyn expanded his image screening experiment from objects to real distances represented on maps. In the picture you see our island with all the places you encountered in this chapter. Try to imagine, how far away from each other they are. This is exactly the experiment performed by Kossylyn. Again, he predicted successfully a linear dependency between reaction time and spatial distance to support his model.

[[Image:Isle-spat.png|400px|center|Figure 5: Support for Kosslyn's theory of spatial representation]]

In the same year, Pylyshyn answered with what is called the &quot;tacit-knowledge explanation&quot;, because he supposed that the participants include knowledge about the world without noticing it. The map is decomposed into nodes with edges in between. The increase of time, he thought, was caused by the different quantity of nodes visited until the goal node is reached.

[[Image:Isle-prop.png|400px|center|Figure 6: Support for Pylyhsyn's theory of propositional representation]]

Only four years later, Finke and Pinker published a counter model. Picture (1) shows a surface with four dots, which were presented to the subjects. After two seconds, it was replaced by picture (2), with an arrow on it. The subjects had to decide, if the arrow pointed at a former dot. The result was, that they reacted slower, if the arrow was farer away from a dot. Finke and Pinker concluded, that within two seconds, the distances can only be stored within a spatial representation of the surface.

[[Image:Imgdeb-countermodel.png|400px|center|Figure 7: Counter model by Finke and Pinker]]


To sum it up, it is commonly believed, that imagery and perception share certain features but also differs in some points. For example, perception is a bottom-up process that originates with an image on the retina, whereas imagery is a top-down mechanism which originates when activity is generated in higher visual centres without an actual stimulus. Another distinction can be made by saying that perception occurs automatically and remains relatively stable, whereas imagery needs effort and is fragile. But as psychological discussions failed to point out one right theory, now the debate is translocated to neuroscience, which methods had promising improvements throughout the last three decades.

==Neuropsychological approach==
===Investigating the brain - a way to resolve the imagery debate?===
Visual imagery was investigated by psychological studies relying solely on behavioural
experiments until the late 1980s. By that time, research on the brain by electrophysiological measurements such as the event-related potential (ERP) and brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, PET) became possible. It was therefore hoped that neurological evidence how the brain responds to visual imagery would help to resolve the imagery debate.

We will see that many results from neuroscience support the theory that imagery
and perception are closely connected and share the same physiological mechanisms.
Nevertheless the contradictory phenomena of double dissociations between imagery
and perception shows that the overlap is not perfect. A theory that tries to take
into account all the neuropsychological results and gives an explanation for the
dissociations will therefore be presented in the end of this section.

===Support for shared physiological mechanisms of imagery and perception===
Brain imaging experiments in the 1990s confirmed the results which previous
electrophysiological measurements had already made. Therein brain activity of participants
was measured, using either PET or fMRI, both when they were creating
visual images and when they were not creating images. These experiments showed
that imagery creates activity in the striate cortex which is, being the primary visual
receiving area, also active during visual perception. Figure 8 (not included yet due to copyright issues) shows how activity in
the striate cortex increased both when a person perceived an object (“stimulus on”)
and when the person created a visual image of it (“imagined stimulus”). Although
the striate cortex has not become activated by imagery in all brain-imaging studies,
most results indicate that it is activated when participants are asked to create
detailed images.

Another approach to understand imagery has been made by studies of people
with brain damage in order to determine if both imagery and perception are affected
in the same way. Often, patients with perceptual problems also have problems in
creating images like in the case of people having both lost the ability to see colour
and to create colours through imagery. Another example is that of a patient with
unilateral neglect, which is due to damage to the parietal lobes and causes that
the patient ignores objects in one half of his visual field. By asking the patient to
imagine himself standing at a place that is familiar to him and to describe the
things he is seeing, it was found out that he did not only neglect the left side of
his perceptions but also the left side of his mental images, as he could only name 
objects that were on the right hand side of his mental image.

The idea that mental imagery and perception share physiological mechanisms
is thus supported by both brain imaging experiments with normal participants and
effects of brain damage like in patients with unilateral neglect. However, also contradictory 
results have been observed, indicating that the underlying mechanisms of                                                                                perception and imagery cannot be identical.

===Double dissociation between imagery and perception===
A double dissociation exists when a single dissociation (one function is present another is absent) 
can be demonstrated in one person and the complementary type of single
dissociation can be demonstrated in another person. Regarding imagery and perception
a double dissociation has been observed as there are both patients with normal
perception but impaired imagery and patients with impaired perception but normal
imagery. Accordingly, one patient with damage to his occipital and parietal lobes
was able to recognise objects and draw accurate pictures of objects placed before
him, but was unable to draw pictures from memory, which requires imagery. Contrary,
another patient suffering from visual agnosia was unable to identify pictures
of objects even though he could recognise parts of them. For example, he did not
recognise a picture of an asparagus but labelled it as “rose twig with thorns”. On
the other hand, he was able to draw very detailed pictures from memory which is a
task depending on imagery.

As double dissociation usually suggests that two functions rely on different brain
regions or physiological mechanisms, the described examples imply that imagery
and perception do not share exactly the same physiological mechanisms. This of
course conflicts with the evidence from brain imaging measurements and other cases
of patients with brain damage mentioned above that showed a close connection
between imagery and perception.

===Interpretation of the neuropsychological results===
A possible explanation for the paradox that on the one hand there is great evidence
for parallels between perception and imagery but on the other hand the observed
double dissociation conflicts with these results goes as follows. Mechanisms of imagery 
and perception overlap only partially so that the mechanisms responsible for
imagery are mainly located in higher visual centres and the mechanisms underlying
perception are located at both lower and higher centres (Figure 9, not included yet due to copyright issues). Accordingly,
perception is regarded to constitute a bottom-up-processing that starts with an
image in the retina and involves processing in the retina, the Lateral Geniculate
Nucleus, the striate cortex and higher cortical areas. In contrast, imagery is said
to start as a top-down process, as its activity is generated in higher visual centres
without any actual stimulus, that is without an image on the retina. This theory
provides explanations for both the patient with impaired perception but normal imagery 
and the patient with normal perception but impaired imagery. In the first
case, the patient’s perceptual problems could be explained by damage to early processing
in the cortex and his ability to still create images by the intactness of higher
areas of the brain. Similarly, in the latter case, the patients impaired imagery could
be caused by damage to higher-level areas whereas the lower centres would still be
intact. Even though this explanation fits to several cases it does not fit to all cases.
Consequently, further research hast to accomplish the task of developing an explanation 
that is able to explain the relation between perception and imagery sufficiently.

==Imagery and memory==
Besides the imagery debate, which is concerned with the question how we imagine
for example objects, persons, situations and involve our senses in these mental
pictures, questions concerning the memory are still untreated. In this part of the chapter about imagery we are dealing with the questions how images are encoded in the brain, and how they are recalled out of our memory.
In search of answering these questions three major theories evolved. All of them
explain the encoding and recalling processes different, and as usual validating experiments were realised for all these theories.

In search of answering these questions three major streams evolved. All of them try to
explain the encoding and recalling processes differently and, as usual, validating experiments were realised in all streams.

===The common-code theory===
This view of memory and recall theories that images and words access semantic
information in a single conceptual system that is neither word-like nor spatial-like.
The model of common-code hypothesis that for example images and words both require analogous processing before accessing semantic information. So the semantic information of all sensational input is encoded in the same way.
The consequence is that when you remember for example a situation where you were watching an apple falling down a tree, the visual information about the falling of the apple and the information about the sound, which appeared when the apple hit the ground, both are constructed on – the – fly in the specific brain regions (e.g. visual images in the visual cortex) out of one code stored in the brain.
Another difference of this model is, that it claims images require less time than words for accessing the common conceptual system. Therefore images need less time to be discriminated, because they share a smaller set of possible alternatives than words. Apart from that words have to be picked out of a much grater set of ambiguous possibilities in
the mental dictionary.
The heaviest point of criticism on this model is, that it does not declare where this common code is stored at the end.

===The abstract-propositional theory===
This theory rejects any notion of the distinction between verbal and non - verbal 
modes of representation, but instead describes representations of experience
or knowledge in terms of an abstract set of relations and states, in other words
''propositions''.
This theory postulates that the recall of images is better if the one who is recalling
the image has some connection to the meaning of the image which is recalled. For
example if you are looking at an abstract picture on which a bunch of lines is drawn,
which you cannot combine in a meaningful way with each other, the recall process
of this picture will be very hard (if not impossible). As reason for this it is assumed, that there is no connection to propositions, which can describe some part of the picture, and no connection to a propositional network, which reconstructs parts of the picture. The other case is, that you look at a picture with some lines in it, which you can combine in a
meaningful way with each other. The recall process should be successful, because
in this case you can scan for a proposition which has at least one attribute with the
meaning of the image you recognised. Then this proposition returns the information
which is necessary to recall it.

===The dual-code theory===
Unlike the common – code and the abstract - propositional approach, this model postulates that words and images are represented in functionally distinct verbal and non - verbal memory systems. To establish this model, Roland and Fridberg (1985) had run an experiment, in which the subjects had either to imagine a mnemonic or how they walk the way to
their home through their neighbourhoods. While the subjects did one of this tasks,
their brain was scanned with the positron emission tomography (PET). Figure 10
is a picture combining the brains of the subjects, which achieved the first and the
second task.

[[Image:Iamone.png|frame|Figure 10: Green dots represent regions which showed a higher activity during the
walking home task; yellow dots represent regions which showed a higher activity
during the mnemonic task.]]

As we can see on the picture, for the processing of verbal and spatial information
different brain areas are involved. The brain areas, which were active during the
walking home task, are the same areas which are active during the visual perception and the
information processing. And among those areas which showed activity
while the mnemonic task was carried out, the Broca-centre is included, where
normally language processing is located. This can be considered as an evidence for
both representation types to be somehow connected with the modalities, as Paivio’s
theory about dual-coding suggests Anderson (1996).
Can you imagine other examples, which argue for the dual-code theory? For
example, you walk along the beach in the evening, there are some beach bars ahead.
You order a drink, and next to you, you see a person, which seems to be familiar
to you. While you drink your drink, you try to remember the name of this person,
but you fail stranded, even if you can remember where you have seen the person the
last time, and perhaps what you have talked about in that situation.
Now imagine another situation. You walk through the city, and you pass some
coffee bars, out of one of them you hear a song. You are sure that you know that
song, but you cannot remember the name of the interpreter, nor the name of the song
either where you have heard it.
Both examples can be interpreted as indicators for the assumption, that in these
situations you can recall the information which you perceived in the past, but you
fail in remembering the propositions you connected to them.


[[Image:Iamtwo.png|center|Figure 11: An abstract picture vs. a smiling Knut with a baseball cap]]


In this area of research there are of course other unanswered questions, for example
why we cannot imagine smell, how the recall processes are performed or where
the storage of images is located. The imagery debate is still going on, and ultimate
evidence showing which of the models explains the connection between imagery and
memory are missing. For now the dual-code theory seems to be the most promising
model.

Hello Team Imagery,
I am a member of team 12: Knowledge.
I see , that you are going to write about Imagery and also about Propositions.
Are you going to contrast these two approaches?
Doing that would be a good idea.
We did want to do that also, but with you having this issue, for us it will be enough to do just a tiny bit and link to your chapter.
Please write a note to our discussion site.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Grammar in general ==

For the beginning learner, it is probably easiest just to remember phrases, rather than concentrating on grammar.  But in the long run, learning about the grammar will help you learn faster.

It should be noted that ''grammars'' are full of exceptions.  A grammar portrays an academic viewpoint of a language - but any language is spoken by many people, in many places, and many times.  Artifacts creep in, or the grammarian poorly understands the reality, or takes shortcuts and gets things &quot;mostly right.&quot;  A grammar is a tool, but it is not &quot;always right&quot;.

Most concepts for a tourist, or for rudimentary survival can be conveyed with simple sentences, a simple grammar, and a simple vocabulary. ''I want this.'' ''Jim is tall.''

This structure in English is, more or less, the familiar &quot;Subject-Verb-Object&quot; construction. A more robust, more efficient sentence, that can convey complex thought quickly, requires a more complicated grammar.
''I bought the new magazine at the news stand on the corner.'' —
''The magazine is new.'' ''I bought it at the news stand.'' ''The news stand is on the corner.''

The same idea is conveyed, but the &quot;simpler&quot; structure is actually quite confusing unless someone is prepared to assemble the ideas.

==Notes on Vocabulary==
Though Ukrainian shares much of its vocabulary with Polish or Russian (all differing in their pronunciation though), there are also many original Ukrainian words that are not to be found in neither Russian nor Polish, as for example Ukrainian ''koly'' - when, ''inkoly'', ''dekoly'' - sometimes, ''lyudyna'' - man, ''zirka'' - star, or ''Traven'' - May. Ukrainian names for months are Slavic, all connected with natural as phenomenons as blossoming, grass, snow storm, frost, lime, harvesting, leaves-falling (just as in Czech or Slovak): Sichen (January); Lutyi (February); Berezen (March); Kviten (April); Traven (May); Cherven (June); Lypen (July); 8. Serpen (August); Veresen (September); Zhovten (October); Lystopad (November) and Hruden (December).  At the same time neighbouring Russian language uses Latin names for months. Ukrainian ''koly'' - when (not found in Russian or Polish) is to be found also in Serbo-Croatian. On other hand such nouns as ''kavun'' (melon), ''leleka'' (stork), ''maydan'' (square), ''kolyba'' (hut), ''chaban'' (sheperd) etc. are of Turkic origin.

== Case system ==
In English, we use a structure like &quot;subject verb direct-object indirect-object prepositional-phrase...&quot;

The position of a word impacts its meaning in a sentence.  Changing the position of a word, can be confusing.  The well known phrase &quot;Throw papa down the stairs his hat.&quot; illustrates the point.

Ukrainian, Russian, Belarusian and most Slavic languages in general, being synthetic languages, employ a different means of illustrating the relationship between words. This is called &quot;case&quot;.  The ending of a word changes to reflect its function. Case system was present in the Proto-Indo-European language, but some languages have lost it. In Modern English there are only two noun cases (Common and Genitive), though pronouns show a few relics of case (I/me, she/her, who/whom). It is because category of case in the Englsh language is almost lost, while it was present in the past. Loss of case system took place in some Slavic languages as well: in Bulgarian and Macedonian languages thare are only two cases (Nomiative and Vocative).

Ukrainian kept case system. In fact, there are a Vocative case in Ukrainian that is almost fully extinct in very closely-related Russian and Belorussian (the latter two preseve only in old phrases, typically of religious character). While it makes language a bit more complicated, the word order allows you to express different shades of meaning by changing the word order without changing the sense of sentence in general.

Changing the word order only slightly alters meaning of the sentence. Look at these examples:
{| 
| ''Ukrainian'' || ''Englsh''
|-
| Я чита́ю кни́гу. || I read a/the book.
|-
| Я чита́ю ''кни́гу''. (Other intonation) || I read ''a/the book'' (It's the book (or some book) what I read). 
|-
| Кни́гу чита́ю я. || ''I'' read the book (It’s me who reads the book).
|-
| Кни́гу я чита́ю.  || I ''read'' the book (It’s reading what I do with the book).
|}
Of course, intonation is more important than word order, but it does play an important role. What is the word order in Ukrainian? Usually there is repeating the question first, and then giving the answer.

In English, when we want to swap the object and the subject, we just move them to the proper place. In Ukrainian, we have to change endings of a noun. So, ''The book reads me.'' will be ''Мене́ чита́є кни́га.'' (or ''Кни́га чита́є мене́.'' and other variants). The word ''я'' turned into ''мене́'', just like Englsh ''I'' became ''me'', and the word ''книгу'' became ''книга''. As you can see, nouns change only endings and can still be recognized. Pronouns are typically ommited in the present and future tenses due to context, as the verb stem indicates who performs the action, i.e, '''я чита́ю''' (&quot;I Read&quot;), can be shortened to just '''чита́ю''' and so forth. This is not the case when talking about the past tense, as these agree with the gander (masculine, femenine, neuter) and number (singular or plural), so the pronoun is necessary here.

== What does every case mean ==
''Nominative case'' (Називни́й ві́дмі́нок) is used for the subject of the sentence. What we consider the subject of a sentence will generally be in &quot;nominative&quot; (naming) case - the form of a word that is found in a dictionary.

The object of a sentence will generally be in ''accusative'' case. There are several models for accusative formation. In masculinum and neutrum for things that are not alive the accusative and the nominative is the same form, for things that are alive the accusative and the genetive is the same form. That rule don't work with feminine (and few masculine) nouns. Accusative and nominative cases can be easily confused for the non-native speaker, but it is very important to understand them, because the order of words in the sentence does not indicate what is a subject and what is an object. Anyway, you can say &quot;студент читає журнал&quot; (&quot;A student reads a magazine&quot;) or &quot;журнал (pause here) читає студент&quot; (&quot;A magazine reads a student&quot; has to be &quot;журнал читає студента&quot;).

Compare:
:Я візьму велику цукерку, а ти - маленьку.
::I'll get the big candy, and you'll get the small one. &quot;Маленьку&quot; is accusative adjective, so that it refers to the object &quot;сandy&quot;. The words &quot;will get&quot;, &quot;candy&quot; are clear from the context.
:Я візьму велику цукерку, а ти - маленька. 
::I'll get a big candy, and you are small girl. &quot;Маленька&quot; is nominative adjective, it refers to the subject &quot;you&quot;, and it is a predicate &quot;to be small&quot;.

When a thing is taking away (whereof? - from me) ''genitive'' case is used. Genetive is also used for the direct object of a sentence if we talking about a part of the object, or some number of objects, or its absence.

That case is used with prepositions &quot;from&quot;, &quot;since&quot; - &quot;з&quot;, &quot;від&quot;. There are double prepositions that are used with genitive, &quot;з-під&quot; - &quot;from under&quot;.

When a thing is given (to whom? - to me) another case is used - the ''dative'' case for show who get it. 

When a thing accompanies, or is used, (with whom? - with me) another case is used, called the ''instrumental'' (the thing is instrumental in the action.)

Prepositions &quot;under&quot;, &quot;behind&quot; - &quot;під&quot;, &quot;за&quot; and some other are used with nouns in instrumentalis.

Each preposition has its own quirk, but there is a ''prepositional'' (other name ''locative'') case used for locations - &quot;in&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, &quot;on&quot; - &quot;в&quot;, &quot;при&quot;, &quot;на&quot;. For directions other case (frequently accusative) is used: ''у будинку'' - in house, ''у будинок'' - into house.  

Finally, a ''vocative'' case (who should listen? - calling a name) is used rarely in Russian, somewhat more in Ukrainian. The stereotypical phrase is invoking &quot;my god&quot;  or &quot;Bozhe Miy&quot;, or calling to Victor &quot;Viktore.&quot;

A word is modified to reflect whether it is a direct object, indirect object, and so forth.

Boh (God)

The dictionary form of God is Boh, a &quot;masculine&quot; noun - as marked by the consonant ending.  Grammatically, God would also be &quot;animate.&quot;

*The Nominative  -  boh    (God)
*Accusative      -  boha
*Genitive        -  boha   (of God)
*Instrumental    -  bohom  (by means of God)
*Vocative        -  bozhe  (my God)

Note, for a masuline, ANIMATE object accusative and Genitive HAVE THE SAME FORM
 -a

*Nominative     -   zhurnal   (magazine)
*Accusative     -   zhurnal   (about the magazine)
*Genitive       -  zhurnala  (of the magazine)
*Instrumental   -   zhurnalom (using the magazine)
*Locative       -   zhurnali  (on/in the magazine)

Note, for a masuline, lifeless or inanimate object nominative and accusative have the same form, no ending.  You see this in an example sentence below.

The dictionary form of book is knyha, a &quot;feminine&quot; noun, as denoted by the -a ending.

I am reading a book (literally, I read book)
Ya chytaju knyhu.

The ending -u attached to a feminine noun implies Accusative case (direct object.)

*Nominative   - knyha
*Accusative   - knyhu
*Genitive     - knyhy
*Instrumental - knyhoju
*Locative     - knyzi

A point of emphasis - my example &quot;I read book&quot; uses SVO order.  In Ukrainian it does not have to.  &quot;I book read&quot; is equaly valid.

Ya chytaju knyhu.
Ya knyhu chytaju.

Changing the word order MAY CHANGE EMPHASIS, but a beginning speaker should not worry greatly about this detail.

You may see tables that reflect this sort of pattern, rather then spelling out the whole word.

*Nominative    knyha
*Accusative    -u
*Genitive      -y
*Instrumental  -oju
*Locative      -i

In the long run, this is important because there are six (or seven) cases, and nouns, pronouns, and adjectives (and some other related things) change (&quot;decline&quot;) in varying ways, according to case (function) and gender.

I am reading the new magazine.

Ya chytaju novyj zhurnal.

Subject Verb Object, or Nominative Verb Accusative

The adjective &quot;new / novyj&quot; is in accusative case - but you would not really note that, since for MASCULINE, INANIMATE objects, nominative, and accusative have the same general form.

Pronouns.

In English we see a fairly simple shift in pronouns I - me, he - him, she - her.  In Ukrainian, pronouns shift with case much more dramatically.  (remember, pronouns when referring to people are ANIMATE.)


*Nominative   -  ja,      ty,      vin,    vona,   vono,   my,     vy,    vony
*Accusative   -  mene,    tebe,    joho,   jiji,   vono,   nas,    vas,   jikh  
*Genitive     -  mene,    tebe,    joho,   jiji,   vono,   nas,    vas,   jikh 
*Dative       -  meni,    tobi,    jomu,   jiji,   jomu,   nam,    vam,   jim
*Instrumental -  mnoju,   toboju,  nym,    neju,   nym,    namy,   vamy,  nymy 
*Locative     -  mene,    tebe,    n'omu,  n'ij,   n'omu,  nas,    vas,   jikh


It is important for a beginning speaker to remember some basic patterns for LISTENING COMPREHENSION.

Ya (I) in all other cases will wind up begining with an M..  If a speaker says mene, meni, mnoju... the important thing is probably that they are referring to themselves.

Ty (you) in all other cases will wind up begining with an T..  If a speaker says tebe, tobi, toboju... the important thing is probably that they are referring to YOU.

Number - things generally have number, one few many, uncountable.

In English, things like sugar, or milk are considered uncountable.  We often use words like &quot;some&quot; or &quot;a bit&quot; to indicate that these things are hard to measure.  Ukrainian will treat this a little differently.

Similarly, nouns have grammatical gender masculine, feminine, nueter, and often this &quot;gender&quot; reflects a real gender, the word for a male horse is masculine.  However, this grammatical gender is not real.  Some words have a grammatical gender that is actually opposite of their real gender.  Other words have a gender that cannot be guessed, but rather must be memorized.  For the beginning learner, it is probably easiest just to remember phrases, rather than concentrating on grammar.  But in the long run, learning about the grammar will help you learn faster.

(
This article is a draft.  Initially it may make use of poor references, and use latin script rather than cyrillic script.  Feel free to make MEANINGFUL changes.

Ukrainian is historically an indo-european, and (east) slavic language, with signifigant Polish, Russian, German, and other influences.  In the literary era, French vocabulary may have been adopted.  As empires rose and fell other languages influenced.  In the television era English vocabulary may have been adopted, and so forth.  Modern usage will reflect ALL OF THESE SOURCES to one degree or another.

A beginning learner may find few free resources.  For grammar, Russian resources are relevant although there are differences between Russian and Ukrainian.

Russian grammar and vocabulary are widely used and understood.  Polish vocabulary may also be consulted for comparison, but generally this is probably an advanced task.
)

&quot;Ukrainian case endings are somewhat different from Old East Slavic, and the vocabulary includes a large overlay of Polish terminology. Russian na pervom etazhe &quot;on the first floor&quot; is in the prepositional case. The Ukrainian corresponding expression is na pershomu poversi. -omu is the standard locative (prepositional) ending, but variants in -im are common in dialect and poetry, and allowed by the standards bodies. The x of Ukrainian poverx has mutated into s under the influence of the soft vowel i (k is similarly mutable into ts in final positions). Ukrainian is the only modern East Slavic language which preserves the vocative case.&quot; from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language

==Verb==

===Aspect===

The aspect is an important property of Ukrainian verbs. Unlike English the Ukrainian aspect is not a form of the verb. Probably you never say &quot;he is knowing&quot; but formally this form is correct, any English verb may be in indefinite, continuous, or perfect  form (&quot;to do&quot;, &quot;to be doing&quot;, &quot;to have done&quot;, moreover &quot;to have been doing&quot;); in Ukrainian each verb (almost each, actually there are few unmarked verbs) is either perfective or imperfective verb. Just like any Ukrainian noun has the gender: you can't say &quot;he is a cow&quot; - the cow is ''&quot;she&quot;'', the ''bull'' is &quot;he&quot; (N.B.: not &quot;it&quot;!). Thats why you can see in a Ukrainian dictionary two translations for one English verb. They are actually translations for &quot;to be doing&quot; and &quot;to have done&quot;. Another important difference is that Ukrainian perfective is not English perfect, it is an ''aoristic'' perfective. The imperfect verbs in Ukrainian are state-words. Action, inactivity, periodical activity... and a result of action too. The perfect verbs are event-words. State changed. And this moment when it changes is the meaning of the word. That's why perfect verbs have not present tense! If something is changed right now it's a state of changing, not an event.

Ukrainian verb has two stems. For not to be confused which one is first, which one is second, lets call they a personal and an impersonal stem (you'll see why). The impersonal stem is the basis for infinitive, past and conditional forms. The personal stem is the basis for imperative and ''imperfect'' present or ''perfect'' future form. Finally imperfect future is a synthetic form that combines the significant infinitive with the auxiliary verb. Only one imperfect verb has a simple future form, the verb &quot;to be&quot; - &quot;бути&quot;, and that is the auxiliary verb we have talked.

Let's add the endings to the stems...

      <comment>/* Picking Up The Accordion */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Picking Up The Accordion==
You may lift the accordion by the straps, but do not carry the accordion by the straps.  If the strap breaks, your accordion will fall. While falling will not damage your accordion, the sudden stop after it hits the ground may. You put it on like a reverse backpack. The ''treble keyboard'' (the one that looks like a piano) will be played with your right hand. The ''bass keyboard'' (the one with rows of buttons) will be played with your left hand.

==A Word About Notes==
An octave goes from a C note to the next C note and contains 8 notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. Since you only have five fingers, you will only be able to play five notes without moving your hand. (Don't worry, our first lesson won't require you to do that.) If you happen to have more than five fingers, congratulations! Many great musicians have made use of their extra digits to play pieces that would be difficult or even impossible for those with only five.

==Fingering==
For the time being, each finger on your hand will strike one and only one key in a given song. Later in the course, you will learn how to smoothly move your hands across the keys to play a greater range of notes.

To help you play these early songs accurately, each note in the song will be numbered. Starting with your ''right'' hand, count from your thumb to your pinkie. Your thumb will be &quot;1&quot;, and your pinkie will be &quot;5&quot;. Any &quot;1&quot; note will be played by your thumb, and &quot;5&quot; note by your pinkie, and any &quot;3&quot; note by your middle finger. 

We'll do the same thing on your left hand. Your thumb will be a &quot;1&quot; and your pinkie will be a &quot;5&quot;. 

'''''Note: More advanced musicians do not refer to notes this way. Starting from the &quot;1&quot; note, the notes would be C, D, E, F, and G. After you get more practice, we'll phase out the use of this numbering system. Our main concern right now is to get your fingers moving and making music! '''''

Look on the ''treble keyboard'' (right hand) for the first grouping of two black keys. Place your thumb on the white key to the left of the first black key. The remaining fingers should be placed on the adjacent white keys. 

Look on the ''bass keyboard'' (left hand). You want to place your &quot;4&quot; finger on C. (Some people prefer to use &quot;3&quot;.) The C key will have a jewel, bump, or indentation on it so you can feel it, instead of looking for it. If you have a large accordion, you may have a few keys like this. The one in the middle is usually C. Don't feel daunted by the number of keys on the bass keyboard! Most songs we will be playing will only use a few that will be easy to reach.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cool things in blender that aren't that obvious. Useful tips and tricks in Blender.

==Attribution==

Many of The Following Tips and Tricks have been contributed by members of the [http://www.cgsociety.org/ CGsociety.org], a Public Society for Digital Artists. The tips have been extracted from a [http://forums.cgsociety.org/showthread.php?t=52560&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15 CGsociety thread].
They have been roughly edited to improve readability.

==File Browser Functions==

===Delete, Move, Rename, and Make Directory===

When you are inside a file browser for loading or saving something and you want to create a new directory, just add the name to the path on top of the window and confirm 'Makedir'.

you can also delete(x), move(m), or rename(n) a file. you can do action on multiple files by seling with right click

===Preview images when loading them as a texture===

Whenever you are loading images as a texture, you can hold down '''Ctrl''' while clicking on the 'load'

===Trick for Creating Quick File Revisions===

After you have saved a blend file or an image you can then save it in progression that is:

car .blend. or car .JPG

Next time do &quot;Save As&quot; then press the + (plus) key which will advance the blend file by 1 every time it's pressed. example: car .blend becomes car 1.blend. press again car 2.blend and so on.

The - (minus) key will subtract one. I've gotten into the habit of saving frequently. Yeah I know there is now the undo feature but I like this better because it gives you a history in case you need to back a few levels of a build. You get a saved version at the level you choose.

Note: Blender automatically detects the number... meaning it does not need to be in any position. For instance: If you have a file named 001starport.png or .blend or whatever, pressing the + (plus) key will automatically name it 002starport.png. If you want to name it starport1.png, it will change it to starport2.png.

Two rules:
The filename has to have a number. It can be 0, or 1, or 3.141569.

If the file number is a negative, pressing + (plus) key will increase the &quot;magnitude&quot; of the negative number. I may have used magnitude wrong, if so, I mean pressing the + (plus) key will make -0.04 drop to -0.05. The - (minus) key will bring you only to 0, and then it will start to eat itself up.

===Open Recent===

Control O

==Object/Vertex Manipulation==

===Constrain Movement to one Axis or to a plane===

when moving objects/vertices or set of objects/vertices ('''[G]''' key) if you move in the direction of the global X axis (Up/Down) and then press the '''MMB''', movement will be constrained to only move in the X axis, or if you move the vertices in the direction of the Y axis and then press '''MMB''' it will be constrained to move only in the Y axis. The same is true of the Z axis.

You can achieve the same effect by using the X, Y or Z keys while in grab mode. You simply have to press X key, Y or Z, once to lock to X Y or Z global axis,*

To Constrain the Movement to two axes (a plane):
Press '''Ctrl+X''' to move in the Z-Y-Plane. '''Ctrl+Z'''=XY, '''Ctrl+Y'''=XZ.* 

Alternatively, Select scaling mode and select the axis not to scale with the selecting button at the same time as you hit '''Shift'''.

*in every case You can hit the X,Y or Z button again to constrain movement to a different set of axes. Normally this different set of axes is local. However you can change the identity of this set to  global, local, normal, or view by pressing '''Alt+Space'''. which cycles through the different identites.

Note: All of these shortcuts work with scaling and Rotating as well

===Shrink/fatten mesh in direction of vertex normals===

When you're mesh-editing, '''Alt+S''' will shrink/fatten the mesh selection in the direction of the vertex normals.


===Vertex Parenting===

You can parent object to a Mesh, in that case you are parenting to the center of the mesh.. BUT if the mesh is translated somehow (let's say by an armature''''[S]''' pose) the center remains in the same spot, and thus the child object doesn't receive any transformation at all.

To solve this, you can parent the child object to a vertex (or a face) within the mesh, and any transformation that the vertex receives is passed to the child.

There are only 2 options, to parent to any 3 vertex within the mesh or to parent to just one vertex. If you parent to 1 vertex then only location information is passed, with 3 vertex all transformations (rotation, location and size) are passed to the child.

How to do it? Starting in object mode select the child(ren), hold '''Shift''' and select the parent, enter edit mode, select one or three vertex, press '''Ctrl+P'''. That's it!

===Work around to welding Verts===

For Edge loop (Verts) position both loops together as close as possible then hit W then 4 (not on numkey pad). You can adjust how far the effect of collapse can go in the Edit window (a button on the right labeled Limit: ***, where * is a number).

As for individual Verts, e.g. Two vertices welded to become one, select both Verts, scale until they are very close then hit W then 4.

you can also do this with the snap combo

select the vertex you want to weld together
'''Ctrl+S''', Cur -&gt; Sel
'''Ctrl+S''', Sel -&gt; Cur
'''[W]''', Remove Doubles

Also, whenever Blender pop up a menu with different options, you can just type in a number to choose one of the options (use the numbers not on the '''NumPad''')

===Make individual objects the camera and Change them back===

If you select certain objects and press '''Ctrl+0(zero)'''it will make them the camera. I use it all the time to align spotlights.

Select your camera and hit '''Ctrl NumPad 0''' to make it the active camera again

===Ordering Meshes in Vertex Groups===

If you are preparing to skin your meshes and you are ready to create the vertex groups, you should pay attention to the order in which you create them, because once they are created there is no way to re-arrange them on the vertex-group list.

That means that if you are a ultra-by-the-book person and you would like the vertex group alphabetically ordered on the list them you must create them in alphabetical order.

.. Or, if you would like them to be ordered according to their function (shoulders, then arms, then forearms, then palms, etc. you must create them in that order.

This may all sound like a stupid thing to care about, but If you have a character with 39 vertex groups you may quickly find that when one of them needs fixing it is a little difficult since they were randomly created.

=== Position and scale along face normal,===

-'''Shift V''': Position camera along face normal,
'''Alt S''': scale selected vertices along face normal 


===Using Fake Users===

pressing '''Shift+F4''' will turn the window into a ¨Data Select Window¨ where you can assign and unassign fake users to almost everything by selecting the name and pressing the F key 

Creating a fake user allows you to keep useful data blocks (materials, textures, base meshes) at hand even if they are not linked to an object.
You can use it to set a default material that would have the shader you like best.

===Align a selection of vertices on a plane===

If you want to perfectly align a selection of vertices on a plane, you just have to follow these little steps:

1.) Before you are selecting the vertices you want to align, position your 3D cursor in the plane that you want to align to (you could select the 4 vertices of a big plane and hit '''Shift+S''' / Cursor-&gt;Selection for example, but you can position it anywhere)


2.) Now select those vertices you want to align

3.) Choose &quot;3D Cursor&quot; under &quot;Rotation/Scaling Pivot&quot;

4.) Now with the '''[S]'''-key start scaling mode, hit the key of the axis you want to move the vertices on (X,Y,Z)

5.) Holding down the '''Ctrl-Key''', you can now move the vertices in one line towards the cursor, until the value for the chosen axis is 0.000. Alternatively, just enter, using the keyboard, the scale factor you want (0 in this case) .

6.) Hit LMB. The vertices are perfectly aligned along a plane through the 3D cursor.

This even works very well while in perspective view mode, so you can align on the fly and don't have to switch to front/side/top view all the time.

===Welding Vertices===

You can weld vertices by selecting them in edit mode and pressing '''Alt+M'''.


===View wireframe of hidden Verts===

to view the wireframe of hidden Verts, make sure you are in WIREFRAME MODE and then turn SubSurf on and change the level to 0
If you already knew about this then 

===Select a true loop===
shortcut is '''Shift + Alt + right Button''' of the mouse, serves to select true loop, in vertices as in edges like in faces.

===Selecting one object from a single mesh comprised of multiple objects===

If you have more than in Edit Mode, you can place your mouse cursor next to one of the Verts in the desired object, then press the &quot;L&quot; key to select all of the Verts linked to that one. &quot;Alt+L&quot; reselects in the same manner.

===Precise Zoom and Select/Deselect===

Selecting: If you Hold down the '''Ctrl+LMB''' (left mouse button) and drag the mouse, it will allow you draw a selection as opposed to using the B button which gives you a square.

Deselecting:To draw an area to deselect, Hold down the '''Ctrl+ Shift+ LMB'''(left mouse button) and drag the mouse,

Zooming:Hold down the '''Ctrl+MMB'''. Move your mouse vertically to can get a more controlled zoom versus scrolling the Mouse wheel.

This feature may not be present in 2.37 or earlier versions.


===Mouse Gestures===

Left click and draw:

*a straight line - moves the selected object.
*a circle - rotates the selected object (note: this must be drawn fairly circle-like).
*a V - scales the selected object.

===Selecting Obscured or Hidden Objects===

Say you are in front or side view and you want to select an object, but it is obscured or hidden behind other objects. If you press '''Alt RMB''' over a group of objects, a menu will be displayed in the 3D window allowing you to pick the object you wish to select.
===Select or Deselect Multiple Vertices===

In Edit mode, when you click the '''RMB''' near a vertex that vertex (face or edge)will be selected, '''RMB''' again will reselect. By holding the '''Shift''' key this will allow you to add each selected vertex (face or edge) in that highlighted group.

Pressing the U key (Undo in Edit mode) will also remove the last selection you made.

Alternatively, you can Press B and then draw a box with '''MMB'''. Anything caught in the box will be deselected. Also works with BB and the draw selection. Draw with '''MMB''' and you reselect.


===Selecting multiple items===

You can hold '''Shift''' and use right mouse button to select multiple items to append.

===Measuring, length, distance on an object.===

Hit &quot;F9&quot; (editing), you should have split (2) windows. One &quot;3d&quot; the other &quot;buttons&quot;
go to the Mesh Tools 1 panel and press the Edge Length, Edge Angles and the dimensions will appear on your selections in the 3d view.

===Adding Connected Vertices===

In Edit Mode, if only one vertex is selected, pressing &quot;E&quot; will add a vertex, on a freely defined place, connected 
to the selected one. As will holding '''CTR'''L and left clicking the mouse where you want the new vertex to be positioned.

Note: It must be an Image texture and in wireframe mode to be visible.

(2.37a)


===Recalculate Normals===

'''Ctrl + N''' = Recalculate normals outside (you might have to select faces before doing so)
'''Shift + Ctrl + N''' = Recalculate normals inside

These two hotkeys are useful when you extrude some edges and see a kind of seam in between (due to normals pointing in different directions).

Then, after selecting an edge, '''Ctrl + NumPad(+)''' selects the face associated with this edge. '''Ctrl + NumPad(-)''' deselect the face.


===Create a Quad from two Tris===

'''Alt + J''' when having two Tris selected makes a Quad.

===Remove Doubles===

To Remove Doubles use hotKey: W. You can adjust the &quot;limit&quot; option so that &quot;Remove Doubles&quot; has more or less tolerance. This option is located in editing window under the mesh tools panel, (i.e. weld vertices that are further?)

===Combine edit levels on a mesh.===

When in Edit mode for a mesh (TAB key) you can choose the level that you wish to edit at. At the bottom of the 3D window, there are four buttons. Vertex, edge, face &amp; back-face cull.

By default the vertex level is selected, if you hold '''Shift''' and press the edge button, you can use both at once.


===Change Select Mode===

to change select mode (vertex, edge or face) you can press '''Ctrl+Tab'''. But this way you can't use the Ctrl+Key to ADD the select modes.. Still could be useful, if you don't have a header for the window you're working in..

===Precision Warping===

When using the warp tool ('''Shift+W''') you may find that there are times when you have trouble perfectly closing a 360-degree loop. This is because Blender will warp based on the total width of the selection, which may not necessarily be what you want. 


Getting around this is simple, just select two verts to denote the new endpoints, duplicate them ('''Shift+D'''), scale the two verts times two, so they are just twice as far apart. Then select what you want to warp plus those two marker verts, and warp 720 degrees. 


When done, click a vert on your mesh and type '''L''' to select everything linked to it. Then type '''H''' to hide it. Once you've hidden all of your mesh, all that remains are the two marker verts. Do a Select All ('''A''') and type '''X''' to delete them. Now unhide your mesh using '''Alt+H''' and you have just the warped mesh, extra guide verts are all cleaned up.

===Precision Cutting===

The Knife Tool can actually be quite precise if you take advantage of the snap feature. Press '''K''', choose '''&quot;Knife(Exact)&quot;''' and then hold the '''Ctrl''' key while choosing where you wish to cut and you will find that the path to be cut will now snap to nearby vertices. 


Keep in mind that the vertices being snapped to don't have to be the ones you are cutting. Say you want to cut the midsection out of a UV sphere and you want the cut to be two grid units in height. While viewing the side of the sphere, add a plane, and scale it to be two grid units tall, and wide enough so that it extends beyond the sphere. Now select the vertices of the sphere (because what we have selected is what gets cut) and when you cut it, snap to the four verts of the plane. Now hit '''Enter''' to apply your perfect cut. 


Using guide geometry such as a plane to cut other geomery &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; style can be extremely useful when accuracy is needed. Remember to align your view before cutting, since your view will determine the angle from which the geometry is cut.

==Working  with Meshes==


===Turning Sub-Surfed Mesh into Normal Mesh===

If you have a sub-surfed mesh you can turn THAT sub-surf mesh into a normal mesh.
Just select the sub-surfed mesh and press '''Alt+C''' (Conversion).

===How to remove (numb) black spots on a Mesh===

If a Sub-Surfed mesh becomes (numb) black on some places, that's because of the normals. Select all and press '''Ctrl+n''' and then confirm. now it should look prettier!

if the above solution does not work , save your Blend file, Quit Blender then restart. Use '''Ctrl O''' to open the last file and your mesh will have returned to correct shaded state.

===Select all holes in a mesh and fill them===

'''Shift+M'''* selects all Non-manifold edges/vertices (holes) in a mesh **. Then all you have to do is hit '''Ctrl+F''' to auto-fill those holes with &quot;beauty fill&quot;. 

*
'''Shift+M '''is an alternative shortcut for 'Select Non-manifold'. You'll find this in the select menu when in mesh edit mode. The listed short cut there is '''Ctrl+Alt+Shift+M'''. '''Shift M''' is obviously a lot more comfortable on the fingers though!
** 
Although 'Non-manifold' usually refers to holes in your mesh, it is not necessarily only holes e.g., an edge with three faces coming out of it is also a non-manifold edge!



===Fill in four or fewer vertices===

Select the vertices and press '''[F]''', this will fill in the empty space around them.

To clean up a filled in space, select all the vertices for the area, and press '''[F]'''. Choose OK to make FCon.
For example: add a plane in wireframe mode, extrude it several times, select all vertexes, then hit '''[F]'''.



==Animation==

===Animation  Preview in all windows at the same time===

It is well known that '''Alt+ a''' is for previewing an animation on the 3D window. But that's not all of it. Divide your screen into multiple 3D Windows, each from a different point of view.

Press '''Alt + Shift + a'''

Enjoy!!!

If you have an Action/Ipo Window and 3D windows open, and you issue the '''Alt + Shift + a''' command from the Action (or the Ipo) window, it will animate both (the action and the 3D) in sync!! Great for visualization of Ipo's effect on your model.

===Choose animation mode, Convert mouse movements to IPO===

-T in IPO window: Choose animation mode, i.e., linear, bezier, constant
-'''[R]''' in IPO window: Record mouse movements, and convert to IPO


===Animate procedural textures===

To animate procedural textures, press 'i' with the mouse pointer in the materials window, and select the type of Key-Frame you wish to set in the pop up menu. advance a few frames, tweak your materials, and set another key frame.

==UV Mapping, Particles and Texturing==

===Blender color picker===

Blender has a PhotoShop-esque color picker. Simply click on the color preview next to the sliders to use it. Hit enter when you have the color you want.


===Saving your face groups selections===

Regarding UV mapping and Face Groups Selections there seems to be the general misconception that you can't save your face groups selections on Blender.

Most people already know that from within the Face Select Mode (Potato Mode) you can switch into Edit Mode and whatever selection you do while in Edit Mode is passed back to Face Select Mode when you exit the Edit Mode.

Well, Did you ever wonder why Material Index Groups (that are nothing more than face groups with a common material on them) have those little 'Select' and ´Deselect' buttons there? Sure they come handy for later modification of the material index but that is not all about them.

Do this: Before starting the UV unwrapping job, cut your mesh by creating as many material indexes as you need, you can even assign each one a different color so you can be sure that there is no face orphan. Once you have the mesh all cut and sliced (so to speak) you enter in Face Select Mode, then switch into Edit Mode, select the index containing the faces you want to unwrap, press 'Select', leave Edit Mode and Voile! You now have an entirely useful face group waiting for you to unwrap. No more manual (and imprecise) face selection is needed.

If you later need to change the mapping of those faces, don't fear. Just make sure there isn't any face selected on Potato Mode, do as you did first (enter edit mode, select the index, exit edit mode) and there are your very same faces selected again with the UV mapping you already assigned to them.

Note: Another benefit of have precise face selection groups is that, initially, you don't have to worry about UV coordinates overlapping, since you know have the way to select ONLY the faces you want to. For example, you unwrap all your faces by groups and when you are done you can start thinking about scale and position within the texture map, not like before when you have to solve those things as you go.



===Bulk Texture Change===

Consider a scenario in which you have a scene with a 100 mesh objects, and 50 of them have one texture and 50 of them have another.

If you want to change the texture of the first 50, but don't want to change each individually, do the following. Add a Plane out of the view of the camera. Add your new texture (Material) to the plane. Then use the “Copy to material Buffer” button in the header of the Material buttons.
Select one mesh object of the same sort that you want to change, open Material buttons and Paste from Material Buffer.

All the mesh objects with the same texture will now have the new texture.

Alternatively, If you have a material that you want to apply to a lot of objects at once:

1. Select all the objects you want to apply the material to.
2. Apply a material. (this only applies to the last selected object)
3. press '''Ctrl+L''' &gt; Materials. (this links the material of the last selected object to all the other objects)


===Negative Meta-Balls===

Add&gt;Metaball as usual. Exit EDIT mode and Add&gt;Metaball. This time before you exit EDIT mode, hit the Negative button in the EDIT buttons window. Then leave edit mode.

If you move the negative Metaball around, you can see the effect it has on the positive metaball.

Be careful though, as negative metaballs are not displayed in the same manner as positive metaballs, you will only see the Pivot point not a meta-mesh.

This is a little test you can try to see the amazing effects negative metaballs can produce.

Make 1 Metaball, make it big.
Place three spheres (UV) inside, make them emit particles, one 100, one 200, one 300 particles.
Parent three negative metaballs, one to each sphere, and use dupli-vert on each sphere.
Make the 100 duplicate metaball quite big, the 200 medium and the 300 small. Hit '''Alt A''' to run animation in 3D window.

[http://www.elysiun.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14058&amp;highlight=metaball ''(&lt;s&gt;Click here for this author's negative-metaball thread&lt;/s&gt;... '''oops,''' it's not there anymore, well, not the AVI anyway!)'']

[http://www.selleri.org/Blender/movies/Metaball.avi ''(Click here for this author's negative-metaball AVI.)'']

===Maintain the UV layout when moving/scaling/rotating UV co-ords.===

When you have the UV image/editor window open and have loaded an image you want to UV map to a mesh, click on the UV tab in the header bar and turn off 'Snap UV to pixels'.

This will help to maintain the UV layout when moving/scaling/rotating UV co-ords.

==Rendering==

===Tricks, related to the view ports and the render buffers===

First. Switching among screens

So you have your screen made off the 3D window, the buttons window and the info window... but you are doing some fine tunning to the mesh in two places simultaneously, and they both need to zoom in the 3D window. You could scroll or zoom out, translate the view and zoom in again. None of them an elegant solution.

Another situation. You are working on a model and are using an image for reference. You are not tracing over the photo, just take a look at it often to make sure you don't deviate to much from the concept. So you open the photo in a 2D program and keep switching back and forth from Blender.. or you have the photo open in an image window and keep maximizing and minimizing the window... another hassle

Worry no more!!! Blender can handle multiple virtual screen (ala Linux) and you can come and go from them with just one key stroke.

Just press '''Ctrl+Left Arrow''' or '''Ctrl+Right Arrow''' (for all of you OS X users, add a '''Shift''') and you are switching screens. Go ahead! By default EVERY .blend file comes with 3 screens ... and of course you can add/delete as many as you see fit.

the magic button to add or delete screens is right beside the Tools menu, up there in the info window.

===Using the render buffers===

Ok, so you set your scene and press RENDER, a nice window comes up and you see your hard work coming to existence (that's the default behavior, if your change it on the display buttons then this may not work for you).

Do you realize that the window containing your render image is also a render buffer? Actually they are 2 buffers for your to play with. Whenever the render window is open (and you can re-open it by pressing F11 without having to wait again for the render) if you press the J key you can switch from Buffer A and B. (the last active one is what you save when you press F3). You can even switch buffers in the middle of a rendering (but I advice against that when rendering very complex scenes, you have been warned!)

The cool thing about having two separate render buffers is that you can have instant before-and-after images for things that you change in the scene. For example you are searching the perfect position for a light source in a scene, you place it and do a render, place the light in another position, switch to the second buffer and do a new render. Now, with the render window open, just press J to see how the change on the light's position influence your scene and that makes your decision easier.

By the way, the render window can be zoomed (by the normal ways or by pressing Z ) to do a closer inspection of the image.

===Render window Tricks===

To zoom into the render window, use the '''ZKEY'''. 

To find out what the (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) values of rendered image are, left click and hold the button of your mouse.this will reveal the RGBA values of the pixel below the mouse cursor. i.e. R 127, G 255, B 13, A40. The values will appear in the bottom left corner of the render window. You can also hold the button and drag the mouse around. This will display the values of the pixels your mouse pointer passes over.

With the render window open, you can press '''AKEY''' to view an alpha version of the image. Press '''AKEY''' again to go back to the normal colour view.

To do a before/after comparison after making a change, hit '''JKEY''' to switch render buffers, then hit '''F12''' to render. In the render window, use '''JKEY''' to alternate between the previous render and the current one, so you can easily see the differences.

===Working while you Render===

If you use a X/X11 based window manager, you do not need to watch blender while it renders, go to a different virtual desktop. Blender doesn't have to keep X informed of what's going on and rendering speed may increase.

===Border Rendering===

In the rendering buttons find the buttons marked &quot;Border&quot; and &quot;Crop&quot;. If you depress &quot;Border&quot;, you can get a rendering of any part of what the camera sees. Just do the following : 

Go into a camera view using '''NumPad 0''', press '''Shift+B'''.
Then, mark the limits of the rendering as you want them using LMB.
Next, render the usual way and the section you marked will be rendered first, then it will be integrated to the complete rendering. If you wish that *only* the chosen section would be rendered then click on the button marked &quot;Crop&quot; also.

===Creating a cluster of particles which takes little time to render===

Render some particles, and make the picture into an alpha mapped tga in GIMP or whatever graphics editing application you use. 

Load the image onto a plane.
Adjust the alpha settings accordingly. 
Parent the plane to the emitter. 
Press dupli-verts.

You now have a cluster of particles which takes relatively little time to render. Of course it doesn't have to be an alpha map of particles. That's entirely up to you.

===Alpha from render view===

When cut &amp; pasting stuff from render window to {insert your favorite image editor here} using '''Alt+ PrtScr''', cut and paste the render first, come back to render window and press &quot;A&quot;. It changes the view to alpha and you get black &amp; white mask to cut the background nicely in the {again, favorite image editor}.
Nice when you do testing in low res.


===View alpha texture as wire.===

'''Ctrl+d''' in 3d
very usefully for preview without rendering.

Also, if you have an object (works best on a mesh plane) with an image texture, you can use '''Alt+V''' key outside edit mode. This will adjust the object's size values so that the image won't be stretched when projected.

==Miscellaneous==

===Restoring your “lost” work.===

If you go to the temp folder where you have Blender save its temp .Blend files, reload the most recent one and this will save you losing the whole of your work. You don't even need to save a .Blend file for this to work. You can change the settings for this in the tool window at the top of the Blender screen.

===Built in Hot-Key List===

Since the few last versions (since 2.28 I think) blender has a built-in all inclusive hot-key list.
Just open a text-editor window, and right besides the option to create a new text-buffer there is a menu option called ¨KEYLIST.intrr¨. Select that option and the full list is loaded in memory

--Edit: There may be many hot-keys missing, especially the newest ones, like M to mirror a mesh, K for the Knife tool, '''Alt+Z''' for textured view... but the list is a good start at least.

===Un-compiled PlugIns ===
Blender can load plug-ins for texturing, sequence editor, etc. . However, Blender comes with a few of such PlugIns un-compiled.

In Linux they are located on the plug-ins sub-directory of the default Blender install, and all that you need is a Make command to compile them. I don't know how to compile them in Windows, but there they are, just waiting for you to awake them!!!

===Blender “Easter Eggs” (Weird things included in blender)===

All Publisher versions of Blender have been shipping with a Monkey mesh called Suzanne. Just open the main tool box ('''Space Bar''') -&gt; Add -&gt; Mesh -&gt; and right below the other primitives you'll see the Monkey.

Why/What it is for? Only NaN programmers know*. It is supposed to be a private joke among the blender developing team. Since then, its considered as a sort of mascot for blender. However, it is incredibly useful as a quick complex object for testing textures, shaders, etc..

By the Way, Suzanne isn't the only joke included... but I won't spoil the surprise. You will bump with them on your daily work, that is for sure.

*NaN was the company that originally developed Blender

Try this: run blender with the -Y argument (open the command prompt/terminal, go to your blender executable file folder, and type blender -Y)

===Weird Error Message===

Sometimes, when trying to use a boolean on a tri-based mesh, Blender gives the prompt:
&quot;Wanna Crash?&quot;
&gt;Yes Please!

but clicking it doesn't crash.
This is because Blender is a lot more stable now compared to when that 'crash' request was coded. It also used to appear when using beauty fill after face fill. ('''Ctrl+F''' in edit mode)

Blender 2.37 now has a 'widget', which replicates the red/blue/green axis symbol in 3DSMax in the 3d windows. Rotation scaling and movement of objects/Verts/faces etc., can be manipulated using the widget, or in the usual manner of earlier versions of Blender.


===Turn your blender animation into a screen-saver (Windows)===

to turn your blender animation Windows binary file into a Windows screen saver, rename the EXE file into SCR and right click it and install !


===Discover the FPS rate of a Window===

If you hit '''Ctrl+Alt+T''' key in a window, Blender will tell you how much time it takes to render a single frame of that window, in milliseconds. Valuable Benchmark


==???==

using construction widget press '''Shift''' to get precision mode for fine tuning. Release left mouse button (LMB) and holding '''Shift''' down press it again, then you'll get moving along another axis.

==Sculpt Mode Hotkeys==

* F: an interactive brush resize
* Shift F: an interactive brush strength adjuster
* Ctrl F: in interactive texture angle adjuster for your brush.
* Shift B: a rectanglular zoom selection for close-up work
* Alt B: hides all but selected rectangle
* A: toggles airbrush
* S: smooth
* D: draw
* G: grab
* L: layer
* I: inflate
* P: pinch
* V: toggles add and subtract in draw mode
* Use X, Y and Z to toggle axis mirroring.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Confusing Chart ==

The chart under &quot;where is this language spoken&quot; is a little to much information, i was quite confused by it at first look. This confusion was compounded by the fact that the foot notes are in portuguese. Prehapes we can simplify it in some way (having 2 columns, one with percent, the second with numbers, then having translations of the nations names into english)?
[[User:N1person|N1person]] 13:45, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

== How about a tongue twiser? ==

&quot;Três tristes tigres&quot;
Fun for all trying to learn the language. [[User:Jdos2|Jdos2]] 19:33, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Add pronunciations? ==

How hard would it be to include proper pronunciations?  Ideally, pronunciation could be indicated by sound files (I think Wiki-oriented articles like .ogg files), or at least by including the IPA notation.

Hi I made a fairly major edit but forgot to log in.

*I removed the &quot;confusing chart&quot; because it was not necessary for the scope of this page - it was also in Portuguese which wasn't very helpful.  

*I redid the &quot;where&quot; section - how many children know what &quot;assimilate&quot; means?

*I also changed the history section to make it more readable.

*I changed the links beneath the flags to point to the English Wikipedia article rather than the Portuguese one.

If someone added the pronounciation (not IPA - again how useful is this to children) to the phrases it would help.  I would but I don't speak Portuguese.

      <text xml:space="preserve">PDAS FOR SUPPORTING DYSLEXIC STUDENTS
People with dyslexia have difficulty with words as the brain process deals with language differently than non dyslexic sufferers.  Dyslexic people often lack the skills required when learning how to read and write.  Students with dyslexia often have problems with spelling, keeping appointments and managing their time which can be very stressful particularly around exam times.  For further details please visit The British Dyslexic Association - http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/extra329.html.  One tool on the market for Dyslexic students is a Personal Digital Assistant (P.D.A.).  A PDA is a personal organiser usually of pocket size that come or (can be purchased) with a variety of software programs that will aide dyslexic students overcome some of their difficulties that they encounter when studying. As technology advances so do PDA’s with many on the market now having wireless network facilities allowing easy access to the Internet and email facilities. This article will provide an account of how this tool can be used for students with dyslexia in their everyday lives and what features are specifically useful to them rather than a description of the technological capabilities of a PDA.

PDA’s provide some easy options for organising and planning your work.  The built in organiser functionality is an electronic diary that will allow the user to set reminders similar to using post-it notes and have screen savers with alarm setting using built in sound devices.  Dyslexic sufferers are often prone to short term memory loss and this is just one of the features that will help them.  Students can record lesson and exam timetables and even include locations as the Organiser has a scheduling option similar to Microsoft Outlook.  If the user is familiar with using Microsoft Office applications this software can also be installed and used on a PDA.

Using a PDA for taking notes is extremely useful as they come with a built in keyboard.  You can use a Stylus (electronic pen) to tap in your notes; however, there are several keyboards available that can be attached to the PDA if the user plans to input a lot of information.  The note taking and word processing software come with spell checker functionality which will be invaluable to the dyslexic student.  Dyslexic suffers often have difficulty with organising their thoughts clearly and if students like creating ideas using images then using mind maps is a useful tool to aide them.  Mind-mapping software is readily available on the market and can be installed on a PDA.

One major advantage of using a PDA is its synchronisation capability.  Synchronisation allows the user to update information from a PDA to a Personal Computer keeping it current and making it easily accessible wherever and whenever required.  Synchronisation is an easy way to install programs and transfer files from one device to the other thus making it quicker and avoids duplication.

In conclusion, PDAs have a lot of valuable features that will help Dyslexic suffers to overcome some of the difficulties they face when studying.  If you would like further details on products and how students can use PDA’s please visit the Dyslexic website on http://www.dyslexic.com/database/articles/pdas.html.

== Lesson 3 ==

''In this lesson you will learn how to say phone numbers and ask what someone else's phone number is in Japanese, and learn how to talk about your age.''


=== 電&lt;sup&gt;でん&lt;/sup&gt;話&lt;sup&gt;わ&lt;/sup&gt;番&lt;sup&gt;ばん&lt;/sup&gt;号&lt;sup&gt;ごう&lt;/sup&gt;・Phone Numbers ===



例&lt;sup&gt;れい&lt;/sup&gt;一


* 電話番号は何&lt;sup&gt;なん&lt;/sup&gt;ですか？・でんわばんごうはなんですか？
** ５５５の５５５５です


Translation:


* Question: Denwa bangou wa nan desu ka? - (What is your phone number?)
** Answer: _ _ _ no (の) _ _ _ _ desu (です). - (Phone number)
 
           
'''Example:''' With the phone number, 987-6543, one could appropriately respond to the question, &quot;Denwa bangou wa nan desu ka?&quot; by saying, &quot;&lt;u&gt;Kyuu&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;hachi&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;nana&lt;/u&gt; no (acts as a dash) &lt;u&gt;roku&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;go&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;yon&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;san&lt;/u&gt; desu.&quot;


'''NOTES:''' Always use the word ''yon'' for four and the word ''nana'' for seven in phone numbers. Zero can be either zero - ゼロ (in a Japanese accent) or maru - まる (丸&lt;sup&gt;まる&lt;/sup&gt; - circle). If one would like to ask another's cellphone number add keitai infront of the denwa. ex. 携&lt;sup&gt;けい&lt;/sup&gt;帯&lt;sup&gt;たい&lt;/sup&gt;電話番号は何ですか？・けいたいでんわばんごうはなんですか？
Often times, Japanese will use Kuu(くう） instead of Kyuu（きゅう） for nine（九） because of superstition.

=== 年&lt;sup&gt;ねん&lt;/sup&gt;齢&lt;sup&gt;れい&lt;/sup&gt;・Age ===

''Saying age in Japanese follows a consistant pattern, as demonstrated below.''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: gray&quot;&gt;(&lt;time&gt; は)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;adjective&gt;天気 ですね。
|}

Words such as &quot;いい&quot; (good), &quot;わるい&quot; (bad), &quot;あつい&quot; (hot), あたたかい (warm), &quot;すずしい&quot; (cool), &quot;さむい&quot; (cold) and &quot;ひどい&quot; (terrible) are commonly used to describe the weather.
{{Japanese example|
: いいてんきですね。 — Nice weather, isn't it?
: 昨日、天気が寒かったです。 — Yesterday, the weather was cold.}}

== Grammar Patterns ==

;&quot;~ですね。&quot;
: When &quot;ね&quot; is added after &quot;です&quot;, it translates similarly to &quot;isn't it?&quot;, or &quot;eh?&quot;.
;そうですね。
: A phrase that usually translates to &quot;it is, isn't it&quot; in this context.

== Examples ==

{{Japanese Phrasebook conversation|begin}}
{{Japanese Phrasebook conversation
| ja = としお
| japanese = きょうはいいてんきですね。
| en = Toshio
| english  = It's nice weather today, isn't it?
}}
{{Japanese Phrasebook conversation
| ja = きみこ
| japanese = そうですね。
| en = Kimiko

* [[Japanese/Lessons/Na-adjectives]]}}

There are two types of adjectives in modern Japanese: な- and い-adjectives. Both are descriptive and modify nouns. They describe nouns and form predicates differently.

The い-adjectives (形容詞, けいようし) are fairly simple creatures. Any い-adjective will end on an &quot;い&quot; in it's basic form and they behave very regularly. The only problem in differentiating between い- and な-adjectives comes from the fact that some な-adjectives also end on &quot;い&quot; (e.g. きれい and ゆうめい) or a syllable in the い-row (e.g. げんき).

== Grammar ==

When they stand alone, い-adjectives don't take the copula, but when modifying nouns, they do. Otherwise they don't change.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.49}}

== Setup ==

Start with the [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Beginning Tips|default scene]]: it should contain a selected cube. Delete this cube by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}} &amp;rarr; ''Delete''.

[[Image:Blender_3D-cursor.png|right]]
Put the 3D cursor at the scene center by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|C}}.
:'''''Note:''' after deleting the cube you must be in ''Object Mode''. If not, switch with {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}.''

{{Clear}}


== Creating the body ==
[[Image:Blenderpenguin1.png|right|Z-scaled sphere]]

'''Noob note:''' to ensure that you don't become confused, make sure that your viewport is set up in the same direction you see in these pictures. The colored arrows are red, green, and blue and they control the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' axes, respectively.)

* We start by creating our main body from a sphere. Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}} to switch to top view, and then {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} ''&amp;rarr; Mesh &amp;rarr; UVSphere'', then choose 16 segments and 16 rings.
**'''''Note:''' You have to manually switch to the ''Edit Mode'' after creating the sphere; do this by pressing ''TAB'' (In older versions of Blender before 2.45, Blender automatically switches to the ''Edit Mode''. This is OK, since we will start editing the mesh now.)''&lt;br&gt;There was a report that in 2.61 it didn't have a pop up unless the {{B3D:N2P/Do|F5}} key was hit immediately after placing the sphere

We're going to make it look like a penguin body:
* press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}} to switch to the front view,
* with all the vertices selected (if not, {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}), choose the scale tool ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}),
* restrict scaling to the Z-axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}),
* and move the mouse away from the 3D cursor while holding down the {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} key (this snaps the scale values to whole numbers),
** '''''Note:''' Make sure the mouse cursor is not too far away from the sphere when hitting the {{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} or else you may not be able to reach a 2.000 scale value. The scaling steps are proportional to the distance from the 3D cursor when calling the scale tool.
* the current scale shows in the lower left corner of the viewport, click when you've reached 2.000 {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}).
** '''''Note:''' You can also do this by typing in 2 after starting the scale and restricting movement to the Z-axis''

This is our main body!

== Shaping the head ==

We’re going to shape the penguin head from the top of the sphere.

[[Image:Blender3D Limit selection to visible.png|right|200px]]
Start by selecting the top-most single vertex as well as the top two smallest circle segments.
:'''''Note:''' selection has been explained in a [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Modeling a Simple Person|previous tutorial]]. Here, the easiest methods are either box selection {{B3D:N2P/Do|BKEY}}) in the front view {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}) and ''Limit selection to visible'' off, or lasso selection ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}) in the top view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}}) and ''Limit selection to visible'' (May also be labeled ''Occlude background geometry'') on.  You can also switch to top view, center your mouse on the topmost vertex and use the circle tool. Don't forget to deselect all first ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}})

:'''Noob note:''' make sure the ''Limit selection to visible/Occlude background geometry'' button is in the right state each time you select vertices, edges or faces. When it's off, selection affects any item, visible or not.''

{{Clear}}




===Building the neck with the 3D transform manipulators===
To turn on the 3D transform manipulator, either push down its button [[File:Blender Handicon.png]] or use {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|SPACE}} and choose ''Enable/Disable''.

====Moving the two selected circles up====
[[File:Blenderpenguin2a.png|right|200px]]
Choose the ''Translate'' manipulator (red triangle). Go to the front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}). Drag the blue arrow while holding the {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} key down to move the selected vertices 0.3 units up.

:'''Noob note:''' you may not be able to snap the extrusion lengths to tenths of units. {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} snaps to the grid size by default: if you can only translate by one unit (1.0), zoom in until the grid divides itself into tenths ('''SCROLL'''). Some Blender versions allow to snap to one tenth of the current step by holding both the {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} keys while moving the mouse.

:'''Noob note:''' instead of the ''Translate'' manipulator, you can use the {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} and constraint the movement to the Z axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}).''

{{Clear}}



====Rotating the neck====
[[Image:Blenderpenguin2b.png|right|200px]]
Now switch to the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}) and make sure that the rotation/pivot point is set to &quot;median point&quot; either by selecting it from the third drop down menu right of the &quot;Mesh&quot; menu, or by pressing &quot;;&quot;. Choose the ''Rotate'' tool ({{B3D:N2P/Do|R}}).  Move the mouse with the {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} key down to rotate the selection 30 degrees counter-clockwise. Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} to validate the rotation.

{{Clear}}



[[Image:Blenderpenguin2c.png|right|200px]]
Select an additional ring of vertices by expanding the selection ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} + {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM+}} (''Note: ''NUM+'' Refers to the addition symbol on the NUM Pad, ''KEY+'' will not do.''). You can contract the selection by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} + {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM-}}. Move these vertices an additional 0.3 units up, then rotate them as previously 30 degrees counter-clockwise in the side view.

{{Clear}}


[[Image:Blenderpenguin3c_-_2.png|right|180px]]
Repeat those steps (selection expansion, translation and rotation) two more times and you'll end up with the body seen in the below.

That doesn’t really look like a penguin, yet!
{{Clear}}



[[File:Blenderpenguin3c.png|right|200px]]


Now move all of the selected vertices to the left 0.4 units by pulling the manipulator's green arrow (and of course holding the {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} key down). This straightens out the neck as seen in the next picture.

:'''Noob note:''' you can also use the {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} and translate the selection by -0.4 as displayed in the bottom left corner of the viewport. Still do this in the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}).


:'''Noob note''' if you had to pull the red arrow, not the green one, then you probably didn't switch to side view, and modeled the neck in front view. If you realize here that you have this done from another view then press AKEY twice, then NUM7, then Space -&gt; Transform -&gt; Rotate and type 90 or 270

{{Clear}}

====Creating the beak====
[[Image:Blenderpenguin4b.png|right|180px]]
Switch to the front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}), and select the frontmost vertex (the one that originally was the top vertex of the sphere) with the {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}. Then switch to the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}) and translate this vertex to the left by 1.2 units using the manipulator's green arrow or the translate tool.

:'''''Note:''' some Blender versions allow moving the vertices from the keyboard with the following sequence: {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}}, -1.2, {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}.''&lt;/br&gt;


The main body of the penguin is now finished. The next step is to create some flappers for the poor little guy.

{{Clear}}

== Extruding the wings ==

We are going to create the wings by extruding faces on each side of the penguin.

:'''Noob Note:''' You can rotate the whole object by pressing A to select all of its vertex and then rotate it pressing R or using the Rotate Manipulator until the axis on your screen matches the axis on the example image. That way, also, you can practice a little more


[[Image:Penguin from sphere - wing start.png|right|200px]]
Choose the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}) and switch to the ''Face select mode'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} &amp;rarr; ''Faces'', or click on the triangle in the toolbar).
{{Clear}}




[[Image:Blenderpenguin5b.png|right|200px]]
Now, select two faces that will make up the penguin’s shoulder as shown on the right (either select the first one with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} and the second one holding {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}, or use box selection ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}) to select them both in a single operation).
{{Clear}}



[[Image:Blenderpenguin4-02.png|right|200px|Wing extrusion]]
Then switch to front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}) and extrude the selection:
* choose {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} &amp;rarr; ''Region'',
* constrain to the X axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|X}}),
* hold {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} to snap,
* and move the mouse to extrude the shoulder by 0.2 to 0.3 units.
{{Clear}}






[[Image:Blenderpenguin4-03.png|right|200px|Bottom face selection]]
We'll now extrude the bottom face of this new extrusion. Rotate the view to show it with:
* a {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} drag, 
* or several presses on {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM2}},
* or {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}} (bottom view).
Press the {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} to deselect all, and select the bottom face ({{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}), switch to front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}), extrude by 1.4 units down ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}).

Now do the same on the penguin's other side: use {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}} to view the left side (you can also rotate with {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}}, or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM4}} several times).

{{Clear}}

==Smoothing the wings==

We’re going to smooth out the shoulders and improve the wings. Though this can be done in many ways, we'll only use the merge tool.

{{Clear}}

[[Image:Blenderpenguin4-04.png|right|200px]]

Rotate your penguin so that you can see one shoulder from above. Then switch to ''Vertex select mode'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} &amp;rarr; ''Vertices''). Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} to deselect all, then select the two shoulder vertices with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}.

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|MKEY}}, choose ''At Center'' from the popup in order to merge the two vertices at their center.  Finally dismiss the message saying ''Removed 1 Vertices''.

{{Clear}}

[[Image:Blender - Penguinto spheres - wing smoothing.png|thumb|250px|right|Edges to smooth]]
Repeat the steps with the two other vertex pairs shown on the right picture, and smooth the other wing. I’m leaving the middle segments for now, else the wing tips will be too pointy.

:'''''Note:''' if you have troubles merging vertices, it comes from vertex duplicates in your mesh. You probably chose ''Individual Faces'' instead of ''Region'' when extruding the wings, which creates duplicate vertices and neighbouring faces. To clean up your model: select all vertices ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}) and choose {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} &amp;rarr; ''Remove Doubles''.''

You must do them one by one!

{{Clear}}




[[Image:Blenderpenguin6b.png|right|200px]]


Finish off the wings by selecting the two backmost vertices of the wings, and moving them up using the blue arrow by 0.1 unit.

{{Clear}}
[[Image:Blender - Penguins to spheres - wing complete.png|200px|right|Wings complete]]


You should now have something like this:


{{Clear}}

==Cutting the underside==
[[Image:Blenderpenguin5-01.png|200px|right]]
[[Image:Blenderpenguin7.png|right|200px]]
We're going to cut the penguin's lower end, for it to stand up! Select the bottom vertices (bottom vertex and the first ring above it) as shown in the picture. There are many ways, this is left as an exercise.

Once they're selected, delete them ({{B3D:N2P/Do|X}} &amp;rarr; ''Vertices''). Now our penguin is hollow: select all the vertices around the hole, and fill it using {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|FKEY}}.



:'''Noob note:''' To quickly select all the vertices around the hole, you can enter edge mode {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}-&gt; &quot;Edges&quot;, and then select one edge that goes around the hole. Now press '''CTRL+E''' -&gt; &quot;Edge Loop Select&quot;, which should select all edges around the hole. Now go back to Vertex select mode and continue with {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|FKEY}}.
:'''Noob note:''' For Blender 2.56 In vertex select mode and occlude on hold down ALT and select one of the vertices all the vertices in the ring will be selected.

==Adding the feet==
[[Image:Blender - Penguins to spheres - feet start.png|right]]
The next step is to provide the little guy with feet. To do this, we’re going to extrude two of the front faces:

* choose the front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}),
* switch to ''Face select mode'',
* turn on ''Limit selection to visible'',
* and select the face to the left and right of the middle two faces of the penguin.

{{Clear}}

[[Image:Blender - Penguins to spheres - feet.png|right]]

Then switch to the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}) and extrude the selection by -0.6 units ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} &amp;rarr; ''Region'', restrict to the Y axis: {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}}).

{{Clear}}


[[Image:Blenderpenguin5-05.png|right|190px]]

Keep the selection and look for the ''Mesh Tools'' in the Tool Shelf. If you can’t see it, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|T}} to make the Tool Shelf visible. Then click on the ''Subdivide'' button (under Add in the Tools tab). Or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} and choose Subdivide.

{{Clear}}


[[Image:Blenderpenguin5-06.png|right|190px]]

Switch to &quot;Vertex Select Mode&quot;,
Now select the three middle vertices (or two edges) vertically at the tip of each foot, and drag them along the Y axis by 0.3 units towards the penguin

:'''Note:''' if something goes wrong here, you may need to remove double first. As always, to move the vertices, either use the manipulator or {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}} sequence.''

You should end up with what's shown in the right picture (minus the selection).

{{Clear}}


[[Image:Blenderpenguin5-08.png|right||190px]]
The feet look too thick, let's flatten them a bit. Switch to the front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}) and select the two bottom vertex rows (''Limit selection to visible'' off, use either the lasso or box selection).

{{Clear}}

[[Image:Blenderpenguin8.png|right||190px]]
Then choose the scale tool ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}), limit its action to the Z axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) and scale down by a factor of 0.4.

{{Clear}}

The feet still look rather peculiar, so please go ahead and move the vertices around on your own as you like.


'''''Reminder:''' you can use the {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} and restrict movements to the X or Y axis using the {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}}. Try not to move vertices along the Z axis to keep the penguin's bottom flat.

==Extruding a tail==

[[Image:Blenderpenguin5-09.png|right|250px|]]
[[Image:Blenderpenguin5-10.png|right|250px]]
[[Image:Blender - Penguins to spheres - tail.png|right|250px]]

To complete the penguin, we have to add a tail (the end of the tuxedo):
* go to the back view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}),
* make sure you're still in ''Vertex select mode'',
* and that ''Limit selection to visible''/''Occlude background geometry'' is on.

Select the three middle vertices in the second row up from the bottom.  Then, switch to the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}) and extrude the edges 0.3 units away from the penguin and 0.08 units down ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} &amp;rarr; ''Edges''), so that the end of the tail is at the same level as the bottom of the penguin.

'''Noob Note:''' Or you can extrude the edges 0.3 units away from the penguin, then {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} -0.08, {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}.

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} to save your work!

== Subsurfing ==

[[Image:Blender - Penguins to spheres - subsurf.png|frame|right|Now that's what I call a penguin. But then again, there are no penguins where I live, so I might be wrong.]]
Go to ''Object Mode'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}), and make sure the penguin is selected. Then check for the ''Modifiers'' toolkit in the ''Buttons'' panel. Press ''Add Modifier &amp;rarr; Subsurf'' (or Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|O}}).

Look at the penguin now, he’s much smoother. You can alter the levels of the subsurfing if you like, but I’ll settle for level one.
Under the ''Links and Materials'' toolkit, you can press the ''Set Smooth'' button as well, which makes the penguin really slick.
:'''''Note:''' you may see some weird effects at the bottom and the tail after subsurfing the penguin. If so, there is an issue with normals: they have to be all pointing outwards. This can be achieved by selecting all vertices in ''Edit Mode'' and recalculating the normals outside ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|N}}). Click on the message to confirm. Note that {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|N}} will turn the normals inwards and that {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} &amp;rarr; ''Flip Normals'' flips them.

:'''''Question:''' The finished penguin looks fine in Object Mode, but when I render it, it looks odd. Quite patchy.
:'''''Answer:''' Make sure you adjust the &quot;Render Levels&quot; parameter (directly under &quot;Levels&quot;) to be greater-or-equal than &quot;Levels&quot;.

==Protein Handling and Storage==
&lt;p&gt;Over time, changes will take place in protein structure that could potentially alter experimental results.  There are also many problems that can arise from improper handling of proteins. Contaminants in samples can cause results to be skewed, and may even damage equipment. However, there are many steps that can be taken in the protein handling and storage processes that help to 
minimize any damage and in turn, maximize accuracy of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Sterile Work Environment====
&lt;p&gt;Whenever handling protein samples, it is very important to wear gloves.  Often times gloves are used to protect us when handling harmful substances, but the gloves are also used to shelter the sample from any foreign proteins or chemicals found on our hands.  Contamination could not only lead to unexpected results but could potentially damage our sample.  For this same reason it is also very important to always use sterile containers, pipette tips, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Flash Freezing====
&lt;/p&gt;At some point it may be desirable to store a protein for use months down the road; most often, this is achieved by freezing.  By storing proteins at temperatures as low as -20 degrees celcius, the structural components of the molecule can be preserved until its use, assuring functionality. However, if the freezing process is not carried out correctly, the protein can actually be subjected to drastic changes in pH as well as in salt concentration.  To avoid these environmental changes over time, the sample can be &quot;flash frozen&quot; by dipping the tube containing protein sample in a mixture of dry ice, ethanol and acetone.  After being frozen, the sample can then be rapidly thawed in a beaker of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Protein Loss====
&lt;p&gt;While perforing any proteomics experiment care must be aware of potential for loss of proteins or peptides due to chemical properties of those proteins in a sample. For example, it is not uncommon for hydrophobic proteins to stick to the walls of test tubes or chromatography columns in solution. If a protein of interest is known to be hydrophobic, the glass ware to be used can be &lt;b&gt;silanized&lt;/b&gt; or salanized glassware can be purchased to prevent loss of the protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

====Working with Small Samples====
&lt;p&gt;Micro-biopsies, laser capture micro-dissection, and stem cell therapy only provide small, non-conventional sample sizes, and in order to take advantage of these small samples, a less wasteful sample preparation is needed.  Trifluoroethanol provides a viable alternative to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Hydrostatic Pressure Cycling Technology====

[[Image:Pct-lipids-fullsize.png | thumb | right | 450px | PCT dissociates lipids, protein remains intact; protein is released from lipid tissue. ]]
&lt;p&gt;Pressure cycling technology (PCT) alternates pressure in a reaction vessel.  For example, a sample is placed in an air-tight vessel and next the pressure in the vessel is alternated between very high pressure and room pressure.  When pressure drops from very high down to room levels, compressible molecules (such as lipids) tend to dissociate.  One example of useful dissociation is that of bilayer lipid membranes, which results in the release of proteins and other metabolites from the bilipid layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCT-assisted liquid-liquid extraction {{ref|Gross}} leverages PCT to fraction a sample into different classes, using class-specific immiscible solvents within the same reaction vessel.  The initial solvents are combined with the raw sample, then the pressure is raised.  As the pressure peaks, the solvents mix, forming a temporary solvent, and the sample dissolves in this new temporary solvent.  The pressure is lowered, and the temporary solvent separates back into the initial solvents, fractioning the dissolved sample in the process (the different classes of sample molecules being more soluble in a particular initial solvent) .  At room pressure, each class of sample molecules are found isolated within each of the initial, immiscible solvents.&lt;/p&gt;

'''Summary'''

Micro-biopsies, laser capture micro-dissection, and stem cell therapy only provide small, non-conventional sample sizes, and in order to take advantage of these small samples, a less wasteful sample preparation is needed.

Typical protocols for proteomic sample processing usually involve a strong denaturant such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride combined with different types of detergents.  These methods are rapid, however, the detergents or salts need to be entirely removed from the sample before the LC-MS analysis.  If they are not properly removed, the level of detection sensitivity may not be enough for the peptides.  These procedures show their weaknesses when working with sample sizes less than a microgram, because some of the sample is inevitably left behind when removing the detergents.

To get around the issues involved with using detergents, a different sample preparation technique using only a single tube was used.  The technique used trifluoroethanol (TFE), in a hypotonic aqueous buffer as a replacement for the detergents.  TFE is better because it improves protein solubility and denaturation, and it readily evaporates, so there’s no need to remove the TFE when no longer needed.  So using TFE in the place of detergents removes the cleanup step, eliminating the waste involved with removing the detergent.

An experiment was conducted to test this hypothesis using two different mouse brain tissue samples.  One was disrupted in a buffer of denaturants and CHAPS, and the other one in a hypotonic buffer containing 50% TFE.  The chromatogram figures of the two samples indicated that the presence of detergent in the first sample has suppressed the signals of peptides that are co-eluted with the detergent.  A larger number of proteins were identified using the TFE protocol rather than CHAPS protocol.  Also, TFE proved to be more efficient than the traditional detergent based protocol even with processed MCF cells, with a larger number of proteins identified than when using traditional methods.

The TFE based protocol proved to be more efficient in micro and nano scale sample processing than traditional methods. The main advantage in using the TFE based protocol is that extra cleanup steps are eliminated and the whole process is carried out in a single tube, hence there is no manhandling and no loss of sample. Other advantages of TFE are that it improves protein solubilization, increases protein denaturation, and finally it can be removed by tryptic digestion without performing any extra clean up step.  The TFE based protocol also provides better sample recovery and better reproducibility.

'''Course Relevance'''

Sample preparation efficiency can be a large problem when trying to detect different proteins in a proteome, because if a proteome only has a tiny amount of a certain protein to begin with, 
then any loss of the sample during preparation may mean the loss of some or all of that protein.  Therefore, learning a variety of different sample preparation methods, preferably the most efficient methods, is useful to students hoping to work with and prepare proteomic samples.

===Tissue Fractionation by Hydrostatic Pressure Cycling Technology: The Unified Sample Preparation Technique for Systems Biology Studies===

[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=19137106 Gross V, Carlson G, Kwan AT, Smejkal G, Freeman E, Ivanov AR, Lazarev A. ''Journal of Biomolecular Techniques'' '''19:'''189-199 (2008)]

'''Main Focus'''

The authors present a novel, detergent-free, concurrent sampling process for high yield extraction of multiple classes of biological molecules from the same sample, using pressure cycling technology (PCT) as the basis of the new process.  A significant advantage of the new process is that the samples may either be used directly in another (compatible) process for further analysis (such as MS), or require very minimal cleanup before additional analysis.  Relevance to systems biology studies is emphasized.{{ref|Gross}}

[[Image:Pct-lipids-fullsize.png | thumb | right | 600px | PCT dissociates lipids, protein remains intact; protein is released from lipid tissue. ]]

'''Summary'''

Given the widening popularity of systems biology studies, it's become increasingly important to improve the consistency and quality of the samples under analysis.  Many current high quality sampling techniques are geared toward a single type of analysis (DNA/RNA, or protein, or lipids).  Concurrent sampling techniques are important, in particular with regard to systems biology studies, because of the way that information from several classes of molecules must be correlated during analysis.  Concurrent techniques are also critical where small sample size is a constraining factor (for example, human biopsy tissue).  

The authors have developed a new concurrent sampling protocol that cleanly separates DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids using detergent-free processes.  The new protocol leverages pressure cycling technology (PCT), as well as a proprietary set of partitioning reagents that separate molecules by class.  PCT destabilizes molecular interactions by quickly alternating pressure, from very high to low.  High pressure mostly affects compressible molecules (lipids), which subsequently dissociate when the pressure is lowered.  PCT does not impact covalent bonds, so DNA, RNA, and proteins remain intact while lipid bilayers are dismantled.

PCT-assisted liquid-liquid extraction is another PCT-based technique that's used to partition a sample given a set of partitioning solvents.  For example, two solvents are combined with the sample, the solvents being immiscible.  Pressure is then increased, and the solvents begin to merge.  When the pressure is high enough, the solvents mix and form a temporary tertiary solvent in which the sample dissolves.  The pressure is then lowered, and the tertiary solvent separates back into the initial two solvents, particles of the original sample being partitioned into either of the two solvents.  When the pressure is back to “normal”, the original sample has been cleanly partitioned into the separate solvent phases.  In previous works, the authors have evolved the above PCT-based techniques, with some commercial success.   The newly developed ProteoSolve-SB protocol builds upon this previous work such that the new protocol cleanly separates DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids from a single sample.

ProteoSolve-SB is compared to current protocols, including Thizol, AllPrep, and PARIS.  Thizol shows good DNA recovery, but suffers from slow extraction and cleanup from the organic phase, as well as from possible protein modification.  Thizol works well with relatively low sample concentrations (less than 10% of volume), whereas ProteoSolve-SB is compatible with sample concentrations up to 25% to 30% of the overall volume.  Sample concentration is an important factor since subsequent precipitation procedures are more efficient with higher concentrations of the sample.

AllPrep had RNA recovery volume similar to Thizol and ProteoSolve-SB, however it's a more expensive process and required multiple columns for the test procedure.  AllPrep also suffers from the side-effect of potential protein loss: many proteins may not unbind from RNA, so they may not be recoverable.  Also, the proteins that are recovered must be cleaned before SDS-PAGE; the cleaning process may incur additional protein loss.

PARIS recovered less than half the RNA as compared to the other tested protocols, which was expected since only half the sample was used for the RNA analysis: the other half was used for protein analysis.  In addition to low yields of RNA, the recovered proteins required additional cleanup (dialysis, filtration).

ProteoSolve-SB has been shown to yield high recovery of DNA, RNA as well as a significant recovery of protein and an simplified recovery of lipids (fewer steps than other methods, less hands-on time).  Sample homogenization via PCT yields more consistent samples, as opposed to sonication or grinding in liquid nitrogen.  Once centrifuged, minimal cleanup is required for analysis: the proteins are ready to go after drying; lipids are ready to go for MALDI-TOF MS, and; DNA, RNA may be extracted from the solid phase using common, compatible extraction protocols.  Future work will focus on scaling down the process further for applications such as needle biopsies, as well as for cell cultures derived from individual stem cells.

'''Course Relevance'''

This new process provides a low-loss rate for proteins in the original sample, as well as avoids detergents and other solvents that may change the protein before it can be analyzed further downstream.  It's relevant to proteomics because it provides another method of extracting proteins from cell tissue in a manner that reduces the loss and/or the contamination of the proteins from the original sample.  It's also a relevant process for samples that are unique or hard to obtain.

''Cleanup of protein detergents:''
A gas chromatographic method for quantification of detergents frequently used in membrane protein structural studies 

Gas Chromatography http://www.separationsnow.com/coi/cda/detail.cda?chId=3&amp;id=20260&amp;type=Feature&amp;page=1/ (2009-01-26)

'''Main Focus'''
The traditional method of protein extraction involves use of detergents. Though they affect the stability of the proteins, they were used in the extraction for quite a long time until the advantages of organic solvents are known.

'''Summary'''

Structure of proteins are studied outside the functional environment in conditions different to normal conditions. The most conventional method is the use of detergents in the extraction, purification, concentration and crystallization of proteins. But the concentration of detergents have a strong impact on the stability of the proteins. The procedure of measuring the amount of detergent associated with the protein was illustrated by using four detergents decyl maltoside, dodecyl maltoside, dodecyl phosphocholine and lauryldimethylamine N-oxide. Separation of the detergents was carried out at a temperature gradient of 200-280C and low injection volumes of 1 microlitre. The retention times for all these four detergents were suitable for the separation and identification of detergent mixtures. Separations were carried out under the experimental conditions and the resultant calibration curves matched with the quadratic regression curves. Thus this is one of the most easy methods for the separation of detergent mixtures from the proteins.

'''Main Focus'''

PCT will improve the rate of discovery for proteomics-based research by providing practitioners with a technology that safely and efficiently fractions biological samples into specific biological classes (proteins, lipids) that may, in some cases (especially for proteins), be fed directly into common downstream analysis processes.

'''Summary'''

Major diseases in the US continue to be targets of biological research: namely obesity, heart disease and diabetes.{{ref|Pressure}}  The relationships between such diseases are complex as are the analyses of the biological mechanisms.  Improved processes and technology are needed to battle these diseases, and of particular importance is more efficient drug discovery and drug development cycles.  Such improvements will increasingly support complex research efforts, including the use biomarkers and proteomics to drive discovery forward.

There are some important technological challenges to address in the proteomics space, including the need for processes which are increasingly sensitive to lower protein concentrations as well as in tissue proteomics, where proteins of interest are found primarily in lipids.  Sample preparation techniques play a large role in the outcome of proteomics experiments, and many current preparation techniques have problems such as safety, contamination, long processing times and are not easily automated.  Compounding the problem is that some techniques are only useful for specific sample types.  As a consequence, experimental results are not easily, reliably reproduced.

Proteins found in high lipid concentration tissue are critical to our understanding of important diseases.  The use of detergents presents a challenge because not all the protein in a sample may be exposed, especially if the lipid concentration exceeds sixty percent and the sample is prepared in an aqueous solution.  Furthermore, detergents are not always compatible with subsequence analysis procedures.  There have also been cases where proteins of interest have been discarded with pellets as cell debris.  These types of challenges can have negative impacts on the pace of research.

[[Image:Pct-liquid-liquid.png | thumb | right | 400px | PCT-based liquid-liquid extraction breaks apart cells, separates molecules into solvent fractions; no detergents necessary. ]]

Pressure cycling technology (PCT) addresses the aforementioned concerns.  In a single step, using all organic (not detergent-based) solvents, lipids and proteins are dissociated and partitioned in a manner that is very safe for the researcher.  PCT-based liquid-liquid extraction is leveraged to capture dissociated molecules in different solvent fractions.  Samples are added to a combination of immiscible solvents.  Next, PCT makes use of high pressure in the reaction vessel to break apart and mix samples with liquid solvents.  Upon the release of the high pressure, sample molecules are fractioned in the initial liquid solvents.  The reaction vessel in PCT (special reaction tubes) are designed to withstand high pressure, isolate the sample and solvents from contaminants as well as to provide safety to the researcher.  PCT is especially good at releasing proteins from their captivity in lipid tissues.

In a study between Pressure BioSciences and Harvard School of Public Health, the results of proteomic analysis of adipose tissue were deemed useful for the mechanistic studies of diabetes and obesity.  In the results of the study, PCT is reported to have higher protein yields compared to more “traditional” techniques.  PCT results were high yield and efficient to come by.  PCT was also compatible with the downstream protein identification method (HPLC-ES/MS).  PCT processes are also highly reproducible.

Other applications may include those dealing with neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, hyperactivity, depression and/or schizophrenia.  Neurological disorders make an interesting research target because myelin, which coats a major portion of neuron cells, has a protein/lipid ratio of about three to seven.  Phospholipids, which tend to be membrane proteins, are important for neuron regulation – as such, phospholipids also make an interesting research target.

;Adipocyte: Animal connective tissue cell specialized for the synthesis and storage of fat. Such cells are bloated with globules of triglycerides.{{ref|Adipocyte}}
;Biomarker: A biochemical feature or facet that can be used to measure the progress of disease or the effects of treatment.{{ref|Biomarker}}
;Cavitation: The formation and instantaneous collapse of innumerable tiny voids or cavities within a liquid subjected to rapid and intense pressure changes. Cavitation produced by ultrasonic radiation is sometimes used to effect violent localized agitation. Cavitation caused by severe turbulent flow often leads to cavitation damage.{{ref|Cavitation}}
;Delipidation: The removal of lipids or lipid groups, often from a protein.{{ref|Delipidation}}
;Immiscible: Incapable of being mixed without separation phases. Water and petroleum oil are immiscible under most conditions, although they can be made miscible with the addition of an emulsifier.{{ref|Immiscible}}

'''Course Relevance'''

PCT is relevant to proteomics because it is the basis of an efficient, safe, automated, reproducible sample preparation technique, of particular importance with respect to protein extraction from lipid tissues.

==Contaminant Elimination==
&lt;p&gt;In almost any biological experiment, eliminating contamination is of utmost importance.  This is especially true when dealing with proteins, as human  
subjects can contaminate the sample with their own proteins, leading to unexpected results.  Dialysis, Desalting, Protein Precipitation and Ultrafiltration are all methods that may be used to prevent unwanted molecules, assuring accurate and reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Dialysis====
&lt;p&gt;Dialysis is a common protocol for isolating proteins in a sample based on size exclusion. Semi-permeable membranes are manufactured with varying pore sizes such that a dialysis bag can be selected specific to a particular experiment’s needs. The protein sample, in solution, is sealed in the bag which is then placed in a large volume of buffer, normally 200 – 500 times the volume of the sample [3]. Due to the gradient between the sample and the buffer, the molecules in the sample attempt to flow from the dialysis bag where only those smaller than the pore size actually leave the sample [2]. The power of dialysis lies in its ability to cleanse a sample of a number of contaminants at once, including small proteins, and small contaminating molecules such as salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to a successful separation based on dialysis is the selection of an optimal pore size. Membrane pore sizes are typically measured in Daltons such that pores measuring 1,000 Daltons will retain molecules a molecular mass of 1,000 Daltons. More information on preparing a dialysis tube based separation can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Image:dialysis_bag.png|dialysis bag concept]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

====Desalting====
&lt;p&gt;Another method for removing foreign molecules from protein samples, desalting provides us with the ability to remove detergents, DNA or RNA, lipids and salts.  Oftentimes, this method is known as gel filtration, or molecular exclusion.  The premise behind desalting is that the molecules in the sample are passed through a porous resin.  The smaller molecules pass into the pores and get stuck, whereas the larger molecues do not fit and simply flow around and out of the resin.  In doing so, the larger molecules are separated away from the other molecules in the solution, which remain stuck in the pores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Protein Precipitation====
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the other methods already discussed, precipitation involves removing unwanted substances from our protein sample prior to analysis.  In this case, it is the protein that is precipitated, allowing for the remaining solution to be poured off.  Most often, precipitation is achieved using salts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At low salt concentrations, proteins are generally observed to be more soluble than at high concentrations.  Using this information, a technique known as salting out is often used which involves increasing the salt concentration until the proteins precipitate out.  Although this is the most common form of protein precipitation, similar results can be obtained by changing the pH of the solution or through the introduction of metal ions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Ultrafiltration====
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafiltration is a process similar to gel filtration or molecular exclusion, but also relies on pressure in separating the molecules.  Due to the pressurized samples, a much smaller pore size may be used (around 250 nanometers)[4].  The smaller molecules are then forced through the pores while the larger proteins are retained.&lt;/p&gt;

*Solubilization and Solution Preparation
For High Performance LC (HPLC), it is very imporant that the sample solution (mobile phase) be free of particulate matter.  Due to the sensitive nature of a HPLC column and the extreme pressures involved, such contaminants can be extremely damaging and [[w:Proteomics|Protein_Sample_Preparation|Contaminant_Elimination#Contaminant_Elimination]] is very important.  


*Recombinant techniques for affinity chromatography

Affinity chromatography is a protein seperation technique where substrates with affinities for specific proteins are used in the solid phase of a chromatogaphy column.  One highly specific technique is to use recombinant technology to isolate proteins expressed from recombinant DNA. If a gene is inserted into a cloning vector for the purpose of fermenting large amounts of a protein, the gene can be altered to include additional amino acids in the protein.  This subsequence can then be utilized as a binding site for the stationary phase substrate.  Two examples of this are the additions of histidine residues that bind covalently to certain metal ions and the addition of glutathione-S-transferase protein that will bind with glutathione.

==Sample Preparation for Electrophoresis==
&lt;p&gt;Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE), described in detail in [[Proteomics/Protein Separations- Electrophoresis|Chapter 4.2]], is a process by which molecules, typically proteins, are separated by their mass. By assuming the speed at which a protein travels through a gel matrix is directly related to its mass, that is, the total matter in the protein, it is crucial to ensure the shape of the protein is not affecting its speed. As such, a number of sample preparation techniques have been refined to confer similar shapes on all proteins in a sample. Furthermore, protocols have been refined to maximize the consistency of mass related characteristics. This section aims to confer the purpose and procedures of a number of these techniques involved in preparing a sample for gel electrophoresis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====SDS Treatment:====
&lt;p&gt;Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent used to denature proteins prior to gel electrophoresis. As stated above, it is necessary to denature all proteins in a sample in order to separate them solely on their mass in a gel matrix. SDS efficiently breaks down secondary structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets (both primarily comprised of hydrogen bonds) as well as many tertiary structures. However, SDS does not break down any of the disulfide bonds that participate in many tertiary structures; treatment with DTT, described below, is often necessary to break down disulfide bonds.&lt;br&gt;
SDS is found to be particularly useful in 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). As mentioned in [[Proteomics/Protein Separations- Electrophoresis|Chapter 4.2]], 2DE involves an initial stage of Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) which results in all proteins finding their pI on the IEF strip resulting in all proteins having a net charge of zero. Due to the nature of PAGE, a negative charge is necessary to induce movement of the proteins through the gel matrix. Fortuitously, treatment of a protein sample with SDS not only denatures all proteins in the sample, it also binds all proteins and confers its negative charge to the bound proteins. It is seen that SDS binds a protein in a manner proportional to the mass of that protein which results in a negative charge directly related to the protein’s mass; further supporting a separation based on mass alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Image:SDS-2D-skeletal.png|500px|Chemical structure of SDS]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
====DTT Treatment:====
Dithiothreitol (DTT) is a reducing agent typically used to break down the disulfide bonds contributing to tertiary structure which SDS was unable to affect, further denaturing the protein to deemphasize the role of protein shape in PAGE. DTT reduces a disulfide bond by two sequential thiol-disulfide exchange reactions resulting in DTT becoming a six-member ring structure. 2-mercaptoethanol (ME), another disulfide reducing agent, is commonly used in lieu of DTT. Furthermore, it should be noted that while both DTT and ME sufficiently reduce disulfide bridges in proteins, there is a propensity for them to reform. Thus the protein sample is commonly treated with 2-Iodoacetamide, an alkylating sulfhydryl reagent, which binds covalently to free sulfides and prevents disulfide bridges from reforming.
&lt;/p&gt;

====Protein Extraction from Yeasts====

To extract proteins from yeast, the collected yeast cells are resuspended in a buffer containing NaOH, 2-mercaptoethanol, and SDS and immediately heated to 90oC. Then the sample is neutralized using a Tris-HCl buffer.  Glycerol and bromophenol blue is then added so that the final sample is contained in a standard SDS-PAGE buffer. The combination of both the heat and the buffer in effect destroys all cell walls and at the same time makes soluble the proteins needed to be extracted.

Varying the concentration of SDS, boiling time, and the addition of solubilizing reagents can change and optimize the extraction of yeast proteins. The addition of deoxycholate or urea to the above protocol was found to optimize the extraction of certain proteins but decreased the optimization of others.  The above parameters are optimal for the extraction of most of the proteins expressed in S. cerevisiae, but not for all proteins.  To this date, there is no one universal buffer or protocol that can yield all expressed protein from the yeast cell.

===Optimized Protein Extraction for Quantitative Proteomics of Yeasts===
[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001078 von der Haar T ''PLoS One'' '''2(10):'''1-8 (2007)]

'''Main Focus'''

The main focus of this article is to find the optimal extraction technique for yeast proteins.  The von der Haar group has found an optimal technique for most of the yeast proteins but not all expressed proteins.

'''Summary'''

[[Image:Yeast Protein Preparation.PNG|right|thumb|450px|Diagram of the steps necessary to prepare yeast proteins for SDS-PAGE]]

The abundance data that come out of published papers for any protein can vary from group to group.  This is due to the varying efficiencies of the extraction procedures that they use. The von der Haar group has found a protein extraction procedure that can extract most of the proteins in the yeast ''S. cerevisiae''.  The original protocol that they found to be the best calls for the use of 0.1N NaOH as the resuspension buffer, incubate for several minutes, then boiled in standard SDS-PAGE sample buffer.  The problem with this procedure is that when yeast is suspended and incubated in 0.1N NaOH not all the cell walls are destroyed.  Many yeasts cells are still intact.  This can lead to the yeast cells to express proteins not normally expressed solely under the environment of study but due to the NaOH environment.  The von der Haar group has devised a new protocol that fixes this problem.

The new protocol calls for the extracted yeast cells to be resuspended in a buffer containing NaOH, 2-mercaptoethanol, and SDS and immediately heated to 90oC.  Then the sample is neutralized using a Tris-HCl buffer and glycerol and bromophenol blue is then added so that the final sample is contained in a standard SDS-PAGE buffer. The combination of both the heat and the new buffer in effect destroys all cell walls and at the same time makes soluble the proteins needed to be extracted.

The von der Haar group has also found that varying the concentration of SDS, boiling time, and the addition of solubilizing reagents can change the optimization of protein extraction.  The optimal concentration of SDS that they have found was 2%.  The optimal time of boiling is 10 minutes at 90oC.  These parameters are optimal for the extraction of most of the proteins expressed in ''S. cerevisiae'', but not for all proteins.  The addition of 1% deoxycholate increased the efficiency of the extraction of Sup45p and Rpl25p, but decreased the efficiency of Sup35p.  The addition of 8M Urea increased the efficiency of extraction of Sup35p but decreased the efficiency of all the other proteins.

The von der Haal group did find the optimal protocol to extract most of the proteins expressed in S. cerevisiae, but not for all proteins.  The addition of other solubilizing agents can be optimal for certain proteins but can significantly decrease the solubilization of others.  It is clear that there can be no one universal buffer or protocol that can yield all expressed protein for the yeast cell.

For more descriptive steps, refer to Figure 1 of the article.

'''Main Focus'''

The main focus of the website is to provide protocols and other information about the Gottschling Lab, a laboratory focused on cancer research.

'''Summary'''


The Gottschling laboratory is interested in studying yeast, specifically ''S. cerevisiae'', because of its link to cancer.  When yeast cells enter the middle to late stage of their lifespan, they experience genomic instability.  This genomic instability can also be seen in humans due to increased age and cancer.  The Gottschling group believe that there is a link between the transition experienced by yeast and the increased age and occurrence of cancer in humans.

The website provides many different protocols along with a protocol for extracting yeast proteins.  They list three different ways to prepare yeast proteins for direct gel electrophoresis.  The first uses a SUMEB buffer along with a protease inhibitor in order to extract yeast protein.  The website provides the ingredients needed to make the SUMEB buffer.  The second protocol uses only sample buffer and the website also provides the recipe for the sample buffer.  The third protocol that they have listed is the use of glass beads along with sample buffer.



Refer to the website link for a more detailed description of the steps for rapid protein preparation.

More sure about German than English here.
''Mir ist übel'' or ''mir ist schlecht'' means I am going to throw up (nausea).
''Ich bin krank'' means I am suffering from an illness (generally, with or without nausea).
The English translations seem reversed to me (i.e. sick sounds more nauseous than ill to me).

==Sample Preparation for Chromatography==

[[Image:hplc.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A HPLC. From left to right: A pumping device generating a gradient of two different solvents, a steel enforced column and an apparatus for measuring the absorbance.]]

====Solubilization and Solution Preparation====
&lt;p&gt;For High Performance Liquid [[Proteomics/Protein Separations - Chromatography|Chromatography]] (HPLC), it is very important that the sample solution (mobile phase) be free of particulate matter.  Due to the sensitive nature of a HPLC column and the extreme pressures involved, such contaminants can be extremely damaging and [[Proteomics/Protein Sample Preparation/Contaminant Elimination|contaminant elimination]] is very important.  Each specific liquid chromatography technique requires specialized solutions.  Reversed phase chromatography requires polar organic solvents, while normal phase chromatography can use inorganic solvents such as water.  One of the most common organic solvents is acetonitrile.  This polarity gives the solvent the ability to elute proteins out of a reversed phase column, and it is also easily coupled to mass spectrometry.  Also, solution buffers must contain high quality pH stabilizers such as acetic acid (acid) and sodium acetate (base).  Salt buffers such as Potassium Chloride are used to produce elution conditions in ion-exchange chromatography, and also must be of very high purity.  A list is given below of common chromatography reagents:&lt;/p&gt;
*Buffer reagents
**Acetic Acid
**Phosphoric Acid
**Triethylamine
**Sodium Acetate
**Ammonium Acetate
**Potassium Phosphate
**Sodium Bicarbonate
**Sodium Chloride
&lt;br&gt;

RIPA is radio immunoprecipitation Assay the buffer can be used to solubilize proteins in a cell. Analysis shows that RIPA dissolves some membrane bound protiens and most intracellular proteins. RIPA is not to be used to find protein- protein interactions because this buffer breaks the bonds of the protein-protein formations.

====Recombinant Techniques for Affinity Chromatography====
&lt;p&gt;Affinity [[Proteomics/Protein Separations - Chromatography|chromatography]] is a protein seperation technique where substrates with affinities for specific proteins are used in the solid phase of a chromatogaphy column.  One highly specific technique is to use recombinant technology to isolate proteins expressed from recombinant DNA. If a gene is inserted into a cloning vector for the purpose of fermenting large amounts of a protein, the gene can be altered to include additional amino acids in the protein.  This subsequence can then be utilized as a binding site for the stationary phase substrate.  Two examples of this are the additions of histidine residues that bind covalently to certain metal ions and the addition of glutathione S-transferase[http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1R5A|Glutathione-S-transferase] protein that will bind with glutathione.&lt;/p&gt;

===Sample prep for proteomics of breast cancer: proteomics and gene ontology reveal dramatic differences in protein solubilization preferences of radioimmunoprecipitation assay and urea lysis buffers===

[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2600628&amp;tool=pmcentrez Ngoka, Lambert CM; ''Proteome Science'' '''6''': 30. pg 1-21; Published online 2008]


The focus of this paper is to prepare a protien sample from cancer cells using the widely etstablished RIPA method. RIPA buffer does this by taking protiens from there native insoluable state and solubilizing them into a seperable sample.It also seperates the protiens from salts and other contaminents making it a reliable sample prep tool. A problem with using just one sample buffer is that the buffer may not have solubilized all the proteins from the sample cell. This experiment, in addition to RIPA, also uses urea to extract proteins missed by RIPA. Tumor cells with varying origin characteristics were subjected to RIPA analysis and urea analysis. It was concluded that using the different methods each cell yielded some of the same proteins and many unique proteins. With the RIPA analysis many intracellular proteins and proteins with small molecular weights were readily soluble. Some Other Proteins would bind weakly to the buffer following for solubility. The results for the urea analysis proved somewhat opposite, this test would solublize extracellular matrix proteins and proteins with high molecular weights. This is not to say that neither protein yielded the same results, from the paper it can be witnessed there is a big overlap of the same proteins found with different analysis. When making a protein sample or finding novel proteins experimenters should use multiple isolation techniques to obtain the greatest population of proteins available. 

'''New Terms'''

plasmogen activators- molecule used to disasociate blood clots.

angiogensis -  blood vessel genesis and progression. (dictionary.com)

In the extraction process of proteomics it is useful to use more than one extraction buffer to obtain different libraries of proteins.

==Websites Summarized==

===Immunoprecipitation===

http://www.molecularstation.com/protein/immunoprecipitation (3/26/09)

This website describes Immunoprecipitation along with some applications and methods it employs.

'''Summary'''

Immunoprecipitation has several steps, the first is to lysis the cell and obtain a protein mixture. It is then a good idea to clean the cell of all non-specific proteins. Following this cleaning you want to add the anti-bodies to precipitate the targets. Then you can isolate your sample for further analysis. Some lysis buffers are RIPA and NP-40, RIPA disrupts protein-protein interactions and NP-40 is used to identify protein-protein interactions. Success of this technique depends on the affinty binding of the protein-antibody formation.

Immunoprecipitation is a method of protein extraction, usually radio-labeled this technique can obtain the molecular weights and quantity of protein samples. Samples are extracted using anti-body- protein complexes. Immunoprecipitation can also be used to determine protein- protein interactions, rate of synthesis of a protein, and can concentrate small levels of proteins. 

'''New Terms'''

pre-clearing -  A step in imuunoprecipitation that lowers non-specific proteins. (http://www.molecularstation.com/protein/immunoprecipitation)

mono-clonal antibodies - antibodies cloned to produce high volume populations of themselves. (dictionary.com)

Immunoprecipitation is widely used in sample preparation of proteins, it yields samples with acceptable concentrations and accurately targets specific proteins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The carboxyl group (abbreviated -CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H or -COOH) is one of the most widely occurring functional groups in chemistry as well as biochemistry. The carboxyl group of a large family of related compounds called Acyl compounds or '''Carboxylic Acid Derivatives'''.

All the reactions and compounds covered in this section will yield Carboxylic Acids on hydrolysis, and thus are known as Carboxylic Acid Derivatives. Hydrolysis is one example of ''Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution'', which is a very important two step mechanism that is common in all reactions that will be covered here.


==Structure==
This group of compounds also contains a carbonyl group, but now there is an electronegative atom (oxygen, nitrogen, or a halogen) attached to the carbonyl carbon. This difference in structure leads to a major change in reactivity.

==Nomenclature==
The systematic IUPAC nomenclature for carboxylic acid derivatives is different for the various compounds which are in this vast category, but each is based upon the name of the carboxylic acid closest to the derivative in structure. Each type is discussed individually below.


===Acyl Groups===
Acyl groups are named by stripping the ''-ic acid'' of the corresponding carboxylic acid and replacing it with ''-yl''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH = ''acetic acid'' &lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO-R = ''acetyl-R''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Acyl Halides===
Simply add the name of the attached halide to the end of the acyl group. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH = ''acetic acid'' &lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COBr = ''acetyl bromide''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Carboxylic Acid Anhydrides===
A carboxylic acid anhydride ([RC=O]O[O=CR]) is a carboxylic acid (COOH) that has an acyl group (RC=O) attached to its oxygen instead of a hydrogen.
If both acyl groups are the same, then it is simply the name of the carboxylic acid with the word ''acid'' replaced with ''anhydride''. 
If the acyl groups are different, then they are named in alphabetical order in the same way, with ''anhydride'' replacing ''acid''. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH = ''acetic acid'' &lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO-O-OCCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Ethanoic Anhydride''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Esters===
Esters are created when the hydrogen on a carboxylic acid is replaced by an alkyl group.  Esters are known for their pleseant, fruity smell and taste, and they are often found in both natural and artificial flavors.  Esters (RCOOR&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) are named as ''alkyl alkanoates''. The alkyl group directly attached to the oxygen is named first, followed by the acyl group, with ''-ate'' replacing ''-yl'' of the acyl group.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH = ''acetic acid'' &lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''acetyl butanoate''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
cooh
1
cooh
1 2-ethan oic acid
&lt;\blochquote&gt;

===Amides===
Amides which have an amino group (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) attached to a carbonyl group (RC=O) are named by replacing the ''-oic acid'' or ''-ic acid'' of the corresponding carboxylic acid with ''-amide''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH = ''acetic acid'' &lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''acetamide''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nitriles===
Nitriles (RCN) can be viewed a nitrogen analogue of a carbonyl and are known for their strong electron withdrawing nature and toxicity.  Nitriles are named by adding the suffix ''-nitrile'' to the longest hydrocarbon chain (including the carbon of the cyano group). 
It can also be named by replacing the ''-ic acid'' or ''-oic acid'' of their corresponding carboxylic acids with ''-onitrile''.
Functional class IUPAC nomenclature may also be used in the form of ''alkyl cyanides''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''EXAMPLE:'''&lt;br&gt;
 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN = ''butonitrile'' or ''butyl cyanide''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Structure and Reactivity==
Stability and reactivity have an inverse relationship, which means that the more stable a compound, generally the less reactive - and vice versa.  Since acyl halides are the least stable group listed above, it makes sense that they can be chemically changed to the other types.  Since the amides are the most stable type listed above, it should logically follow that they cannot be easily changed into the other molecule types, and this is indeed the case.

The stability of any type of carboxylic acid derivative is generally determined by the ability of its functional group to donate electrons to the rest of the molecule.  In essence, the ''more electronegative'' the atom or group attached to carbonyl group, the ''less stable'' the molecule.  This readily explains the fact that the acyl halides are the most reactive, because halides are generally quite electronegative.  It also explains why acid anhydrides are unstable; with two carbonyl groups so close together the oxygen in between them cannot stabilize both by resonance - it can't ''loan'' electrons to both carbonyls.

The following derivative types are ordered in decreasing reactivity (the first is the most reactive):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Acyl Halides '''(CO-X)''' &gt; Acyl Anhydrides '''(-CO-O-OCR)''' &gt; Acyl Thioester '''(-CO-SR)''' &gt; Acyl Esters '''(-CO-OR)''' &gt; Acyl Amides '''(-CO-NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As mentioned before, any substance in the preceding list can be readily transformed into a substance to its right; that is, the more reactive derivative types (acyl halides) can be directly transformed into less reactive derivative types (esters and amides).  Every type can be made directly from carboxylic acid (hence the name of this subsection) but carboxylic acid can also be made from any of these types.

M = MgBr (Grignard reagent) or Li (organolithium reagent)

===Mechanisms===
A common motif in reactions dealing with carboxylic acid derivatives is the tetrahedral intermediate. The carbonyl group is highly polar, with the carbon having a low electron density, and the oxygen having a high electron density. With an acid catalyst, a H+ is added to the oxygen of the carbonyl group, increasing the positive charge at the carbon atom. A nucleophile can then attack the carbonyl, creating a tetrahedral intermediate. 

For example, in Fischer esterification, the mechanism can be outlined thus:
1) H+ is added to carbonyl oxygen
2) Oxygen atom of the alcohol adds to the carbonyl carbon
3) Proton transfer from alcohol oxygen to carboxyl oxygen
4) Water molecule ejected from tetrahedral intermediate, double bond forms, recreating the carbonyl
5) H+ is removed from carbonyl oxygen
