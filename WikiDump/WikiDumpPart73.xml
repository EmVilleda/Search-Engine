      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Apples''' are among the most familiar fruits, with a long history of cultivation. This book is about the cultivars of apples (some 7,500 are known to exist). 

[[File:Apfelwiese-2007-Ast.jpg|300px|right|thumbnail]]

This book will consist of pages for each apple variety, with information about the qualities and uses of the fruits, as well as technical information about growing them (such as compatible pollenators and rootstocks). Additional chapters will discuss rootstocks and interstocks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! And if you have any questions, in particular about the Muggles' Guide, please feel free to ask on my talk page. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:29, 29 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

Who is the &quot;I&quot; in the article? [[Special:Contributions/128.61.38.107|128.61.38.107]] ([[User talk:128.61.38.107|talk]]) 08:26, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

That mysterious &quot;I&quot; makes me think this article is plagiarized from somewhere. At the least it's original research. [[Special:Contributions/128.61.28.130|128.61.28.130]] ([[User talk:128.61.28.130|talk]]) 17:30, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== strerror ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
char *strerror( int num );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function strerror() returns an implementation defined string corresponding to ''num''.  If an error occurred, the error is located within the global variable '''errno'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== strtoul ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
unsigned long strtoul( const char *start, char **end, int base );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function strtoul() behaves exactly like [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/strtol|strtol]](), except that it returns an {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} long rather than a mere long.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== strtol ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
long strtol( const char *start, char **end, int base );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The strtol() function returns whatever it encounters first in ''start'' as a long, doing the conversion to ''base'' if necessary. ''end'' is set to point to whatever is left in ''start'' after the long. If the result can not be represented by a long, then strtol() returns either '''LONG_MAX''' or '''LONG_MIN'''. Zero is returned upon error.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

== Conditions for Being a Base ==

I have deleted the proof from this section. To be proven is an equivalence, but only an implication in one direction is shown. Also, the fact that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}\not\subseteq U&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;U\in \mathcal{T}\supseteq\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;) clearly falsifies the proof.

This might be a minor error, but somebody definitely needs to go over it and check. It's removed for now.

''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; be any open set. Consider any element &lt;math&gt;x\in U&lt;/math&gt;. There is an open set within &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}\subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;. The union of all of them is &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, any open set can be formed as a union of sets within &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

With a list, normally you have each item as a paragraph, with sub-items indented further and optionally numbered or bulleted. For your requirements, you need to add a little HTML to break the lines without either starting another list item or starting a new paragraph (external to the list).

== Re:Math Bookshelf ==

Don't worry about the late reply, we aren't on a timeline here! If you go to the page [[Subject:Mathematics]], You will see a list of math books, a list of sub-topics, etc. If you notice, the list of books here is very large, but the number of sub-topics is very small. I think that we can create several sub-pages under mathematics for things like &quot;calculus&quot;, &quot;algebra&quot;, &quot;geometry&quot;, &quot;topology&quot;, etc. If you give me a list of all the sub-pages you want to see, I can make them for you. I hope this helps. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:39, 9 May 2008 (UTC)

:The difference between bookshelves and subject pages, at least the two major differences, are the location of the pages themselves and the method in which the pages are kept up-to-date. A bookshelf is a manually-edited list, while subject pages are typically dynamically updated based on categories. I would think that the method of topic/subtopic would be more familar to Windows users, following an obvious folder/subfolder scheme. However, there are more then one way to do it, and I want to point out now that you don't need to follow the pattern that other pages use. You can easily add all the algebra books under an &quot;Algebra&quot; subheading, instead of in a subtopic. Using the {{tlx|CategoryList}} template, this becomes particularly easy to do. And the benefit is, of course, that once you create the subject page as you think it should be, the lists will update automatically when new books are added to the appropriate categories.
:Either way, the next step is clear: We need to figure out what sub-categories to have, and which of our existing books belong in which categories. Here is one possible scheme, based on the current [[Wikibooks:Mathematics bookshelf|mathematics bookshelf]] layout:
:*Basic Math (&quot;Arithmetic&quot;?)
:*Algebra
:*Geometry
:*Discrete Math
:*Calculus and Trigonometry
:*Statistics and Probability
:*Analysis
:*Topology
:*Number Theory
:*Applied Mathematics
:I'm sure this list needs some modifications. I put calculus and trig together because I don't feel like we are going to have too many trig books and a 1-book section is probably not great. Actually, when I learned trig in highschool it was part of an Algebra course. Let me know what you think of all this. Once we have a plan for organizing, we can work out the details on presentation (and there are a lot of options and possible details to play with!) --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:43, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

::Breaking books up by reading level is easy, we could use the {{tlx|Reading level}} template to mark books according to their level of material. This could easily be done in addition to breaking books up by subject, and then we can take the intersection of different categories and reading levels to produce lists of age-appropriate books on different levels. I have my doubts that breaking up by level is going to be sufficient, I would also like to explore a subtopic-based organization scheme too. Luckily for us, we can easily have both schemes operating in parallel. My internet access is limited until sunday night or monday, so I can start laying some groundwork on it then. After that, it's a matter of tweaking details to suit our particular needs. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:10, 11 May 2008 (UTC)

There are a few templates that you could use, I've prepared a little list of them here: [[User:Whiteknight/Template Cheatsheet]].

Dear Spat,

You added a section on exercises in Wikibooks. You gave precisely one exercise in this section. That exercise was to verify that a connected space is always locally connected. This is completely incorrect. The [[w:comb space|comb space]] (see the page I created on the comb space in Wikipedia), and the topologist's sine curve, are both examples of connected spaces which are not locally connected. Also see the page I created on [[w:Locally connected space|Locally connected space]] in Wikipedia. In future, please check what you have written before submitting it.

Note that I am a wikipedia user and not a wikibook user. Please see my page to go to the links I have suggested.

[[User:Topology Expert|Topology Expert]] ([[User talk:Topology Expert|talk]]) 14:44, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

Dear Spat:

Your exercises in the section on the 'separation axioms' are far too easy. It is great that you included exercises though! Of course, I will build on them but please don't give too easy exercises for it can be boring for the reader (for example, it is obvious that if a space is T_1 it is T_0 and if it is T_2 it is T_1 etc...). You don't need to give these sorts of problems as exercises. A more challenging excercise (challenging compared to yours but not too difficult):

1. a) Prove that a finite point set is Hausdorff (T_2) if and only if it has the discrete topology.
   
b) Conclude that a finite point set is metrizable (under a given topology) if and only if its topology is induced by the discrete metric. 

This could serve as a first exercise. This can of course be applied to show that every finite Hausdorff space is totally disconnected, a finite space can be imbedded in R if and only if it has the discrete topology etc.... Of course the applications of the theorems could also be given as exercises. This are more interesting exercises and you probably agree. As I said, your exercises are good but please see the exercises in the section on the comb space. They do challenge the reader and I am suggesting that you try to make your excercises like them (or at least as challenging). I see that you have done good work on Wikibooks though so keep it up!

[[User:Topology Expert|Topology Expert]] ([[User talk:Topology Expert|talk]]) 09:45, 8 June 2008 (UTC)

Dear Spat,

I have had a look at the real analysis Wikibook but I will have a better look later. The book looks good overall. I am thinking that in Wikibooks, we want the reader to learn as much as possible and I think that perhaps you may wish to leave more proofs as exercises (but give hints). If you have a look at the topology wikibook (particularly the page on the [[/Induced homomorphism/]] and the [[/Perfect map/]]), you may find that I have done it this way. But of course, we all have different ways of writing so I don't think there is anything wrong with that. If you have experience with LaTex, then perhaps you may be able to correct some mathematical notation on the pages I created in topology wikibooks (if you have time). Good work overall though!

[[User:Topology Expert|Topology Expert]] ([[User talk:Topology Expert|talk]]) 12:45, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

Dear Spat,

Unless Wikibooks have the same number of chapters (and sections) as the book by Munkres, it is unlikely that anyone will understand the section on the fundamental group by reading Wikibooks. However, the fundamental group has a relationship to connectedness and local connectedness so that is why I am adding these sections. Perhaps the general reader should refer to the book on group theory before reading the book on algebraic topology so the prerequisite of group theory isn't a problem.

I will give my opinions soon.

[[User:Topology Expert|Topology Expert]] ([[User talk:Topology Expert|talk]]) 14:32, 14 June 2008 (UTC)

Dear Spat,

Apologies for the late response. I had a better look at the section on [[The fundamental group]] and I think I somewhat agree with you. I think that perhaps the motivation in the section could be improved as can the level of explanation. On the other hand, mathematics is a subject which you have to think about; ommitting details gives the reader the opportunity to fill them in. I think it is best to split the chapter into two sections; one one covering spaces and another on the fundamental group. It is also a good idea to add exercises to this section. The following is an example of an exercise that demonstrates the kind of style that most exercises should be presented in:

1. Show that if X is homeomorphic to Y, then their corresponding fundamental groups are isomorphic (Hint: Consider the induced homomorphism)

2 (easy). Give an example of two spaces E and B such that there exists a covering map from E to B but that E and B are not homeomorphic.

I also think that it would be good to introduce the reader to fibre bundles after he/she studies covering maps. I think that the two concepts have vaguely similar definitions.
Also, it would be good if there was an extra 'refreshing' section on group theory before presenting the section on the fundamental group. Anyway, I think it will be some time before the topology section in Wikibooks is bought to a decent level. Basically, there are very few people out there who actually have the time to edit topology related books; most people study group theory, number theory etc...

Hi. I saw you warned [[User talk:217.65.152.2]] about their edits, and I thank you for doing so. But they were already previously warned, so it would be better to contact an admin about it. I blocked them for 1 day due to prior acts of vandalisim. However, I still thank you for helping. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 17:31, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

Well, we could either change the name of the article to Jack London or ask someone to write some meaningful content on Emily Dickinson. Merge is always an option too.[[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 16:20, 17 July 2008 (UTC)

== [[Abstract Algebra]] ==

I think that this book needs a lot of work. If you could, could you work on this one? Especially the parts about polynomial rings and fields.--[[User:The Scarlet Letter|A]] ([[User talk:The Scarlet Letter|talk]]) 23:50, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

Your message did not quite seem to be complete. Did you mean something related to analysis or topology? Regards, [[User:The Scarlet Letter|A]] ([[User talk:The Scarlet Letter|talk]]) 21:34, 2 August 2008 (UTC)

== Real analysis ==

Dear SPat,

The edits (and proofs) that you added to the book on real analysis look good to me although I have not read a lot. I have, however, some criticism towards the book on Riemann-Stieljes integration:

* You wrote that the function ''alpha'' has to be ''strictly increasing'' but this is not true. Rather, the function ''alpha'' needs to be monotonically increasing (there is a difference!)

* It would be more precise to write: let ''P'' be a partition over [a,b] and let ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' belong to ''P'' for ''i=1'' to ''n'' (rather than saying: let ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt; belong to ''P'')

I have not read the other section in the same chapter yet. 

Also, I think that the 'book on real analysis' is currently not about real analysis (if you know what I mean). Currently the book is only presenting topics pertaining to calculus (apart from very few other topics such as Riemann-Stieltjes integration and metric spaces). The sections on limits, continuity, differentiation... should be either moved to the book on calculus, or maybe generalized to operations on Banach spaces. Otherwise, the book is basically the book on calculus, re-written.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

==The Quick Course==
{{drop|T}}'''his first ''Pictures'' page is intended for a quick study or for revision and will not bore you too much with discussion.'''.
This page will show a Wiki writer how to fit images into their work using the most usual layout methods.  For those who need only a coding summary, go straight to the image code examples in the drop-box of the section ''Insert the Image Code''.  A summary of image code options can be found in the section ''Adjust the Options''.  For those who need more complicated methods, for example, tables, gallery, or drop-control methods, refer to the ''Other pages'' links.

As the reader will realize, formatting in Wiki uses Wikitext mark-up code.   To make the learning task a bit easier, code modules have been prepared for the various parts of the work.   At various points in the text there are panels or drop-down boxes that contain the blocks of code.   The code is easily pasted into the {{edit|Wikibooks:Sandbox|Wikibooks Sandbox Editor}}, to try the formats for yourself.   As a general rule, the best method for new formatting is to carry out the testing of your ideas in the safety of the Sandbox, before pasting them into your work.
{{-}}
==Get the Image Details==

=== Find a Wikimedia Image ===
Many thousands of images are already stored in the Wikimedia Commons image database.   The main pieces of data to obtain about the image are its exact name and its [[commons:Commons:Licensing|copyright status]], and these and other image details can be found in two ways.

*'''The first method''' makes use of image lists on the Wikimedia Commons website.   The same images that are to be found using the Mayflower search engine can be searched in categories on the  [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]].   This site has various categories to browse, including [[commons:Category:Public_domain|Wikimedia Public Domain Images]], and many others.   Collect the details of any images that interest you, ready for working on your page.

*'''The second method''' is simply to get the details of an image that you like from some other Wiki page.   To find all of the details of ''any'' image on a Wiki page, just ''left-click'' it with the mouse to go to its image description page. If you just need to know the name or the rendered size of an image on a page, then ''right-click'' the image and read the details in the ''image properties''.      

Finally, because users might need some samples to study image layouts, the drop-box below has a set of code lines that can be used to produce high quality images in either your own work or in the  {{edit|Wikibooks:Sandbox|Wikibooks Sandbox Editor}}.   You can modify these lines of code at will, on ''any'' page, to see how their options affect the display.
{{dropimage|align=center|hfs=1.2em|cfs=1em|width=300px|hfw=normal|Image Code to Try
|{{fancy3|Ready-to-use Image Code : | the flowers set...}}

This list contains a selection of ready-made flower image formats.   These make thumbnail images with a base dimension of 250 pixels, have a border on them and a caption.   They are located by default on the ''right'' of the page, though an extra option can be added to specify ''left'', ''right'',  or ''center''.

Copy individual image lines into the '''Sandbox''' or directly into your work to experiment with their formats.   Satisfy ''yourself'' as to the copyright conditions on the individual image pages when planning their use.   For an overview of how to use images, read the other pages in the ''[[../|Editing Wikitext/Pictures]]'' series.

=== Upload Your Own Image ===
{{drop|Y}}'''our own images can be uploaded''' to the Wikimedia Commons image database, for use on any Wikibooks page.  In fact, they will become available to any user.   It works like this.

The ''edit this page'' version of each Wikibooks page, including ''this'' page's edit page, has a link in its margin called [[WB:UPLOAD|Upload file]], but images can only be uploaded by users who are first logged-on.   Following that link leads to the Commons upload pages, where instructions can be found.   Perhaps the best current method of making an upload is to access the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page '''Wikimedia Commons'''] home page, then by selecting the ''Upload file'' link it its left margin, you can follow your way through the upload wizard, making life much easier.  

When there is a choice, images are best uploaded in the largest available size.   This gives the user the greatest possible choice as to its dimensions on the page.   Images can always be ''reduced'' in size on the work pages themselves, by specifying their sizes in ''pixels'' within the mark-up code.   As soon as an image is uploaded, its own dedicated image page is shown.   This page repeats all of the data given by the contributor, including the copyright status.   Once the image file is uploaded, it is available immediately for use in your work, and by others.     

[[File:Ascocenda Princess Mikasa .jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;big&gt;[[w:Ascocenda|'''Ascocenda Orchid''']]&lt;/big&gt;   :   &lt;small&gt;''Princess Mikasa&lt;br /&gt;300x300 pixels''&lt;/small&gt;]]
&lt;h2&gt;Insert the Image Code&lt;/h2&gt; 
{{drop|I}}'''mages are placed on a page by typing an image code''' along with any other text. As with the typing of text, this is done in the editing window of the page being edited.
Selecting the ''edit this page'' tab at the top of the page accesses the editing panel, and all of the user's preferences and other links can be found at the top of each page as soon as the user signs-on.

=== The Basic Image Code ===
Without more ado, this section introduces the most comprehensive image code first.   It contains all of the features likely to be of interest to the writer.   The standard form includes an image name and file type suffix, a page position, a border type, an image size, and a caption.

The vertical-bar separators in the code are called ''pipe'' symbols.   It is important to learn where these are on the keyboard since they are used in all image work.   On some keyboards they are not located in the marked positions.   ''Shift-backslash'' and ''Ctrl-Alt- top-left'' are common locations on keyboards for this symbol.   In any case, if it cannot be found on the keyboard, there is a selection of such symbols to copy, at the bottom of each editing page.   The standard form for the most useful image code looks like this:{{-}} 
{{block|background=ivory|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,monospace|'''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Image file name|Position|Type|Size|Caption]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''}}
The practical format of a typical image line, suitable for a page is like this:
{{block|background=ivory|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,monospace|'''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Gerbera_pink.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pink Gerbera]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''}}    
{{-}}
[[File:Gerbera_pink.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pink Gerbera]]
The image to the right of this text was made with the above code line.   The coding makes an image at the right margin of the page, (''right'').   It is in the style of a thumbnail, (''thumb''), which has a border; there is a link to its image page.   It has a base dimension of 200 pixels, (''200px''),  and a caption beneath the image, within the border, (''Pink Gerbera'').   This text on the page wraps around it.  In fact, depending upon the position of the image code line on the page, the point from which the accompanying text starts to wrap can be changed.   This point will become more clear with the examples in the drop-box below.  
   
Beware of transferring your work from word processors, since some characters may not be supported by the Wiki editor.   If in doubt, first copy the code into the Sandbox for testing.   To back-up your ''unfinished'' mark-up code, you can copy your text from the sandbox editing window and save it in Notepad, the windows accessory.   Notepad is a plain text device, and affects the mark-up code least.   Note also that all of the saved page versions are available in the History tab, should they ever need to be restored to the form that existed at an earlier date.

The basic image placement examples are given in the drop-box below:
{{dropimage|width=700px|hfw=normal|align=center|Basic Image Layout Examples|The general form of the preferred format and an example of it is given below:

&lt;pre&gt;[[File:filename|position|type|size|caption]]

and;

[[File:Close up lily.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lily Stamens]]&lt;/pre&gt;

In each case, when a ''single'' pixel, (px), figure is given, it refers to the ''base'' dimension of the image; the rest of the image is scaled in proportion.     Read the code carefully in the examples below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Example of a RIGHT- positioned image:'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[[File:Close up lily.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Lily Stamens]]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Close up lily.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Lily Stamens]]
The code above produces this display.   The size was reduced to 150 pixels to fit the example.   The text ''wraps'' to the left of the image.   In fact, any text which lies ''above'' the image code line in the editing window would extend across the page.   For this case, it is the text typed ''after'' the image code line in the editor, which starts to wrap.   To prevent text of the ''next'' section from closing up and wrapping along side this image , a special code can be placed in the line immediately ''before'' the work of the new section to make sure it uses the whole width of the page.   The code to use is:
&lt;center&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.&lt;/center&gt;
This code is often placed in the line ''above'' each section heading, and is often found to be the  solution to confusing problems involving overlapping text.  
Incidentally, this particular code works within the text of a main page but will not work in a drop-down box such as this.  


'''Example of a LEFT-positioned image:'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[[File:Ascocenda Princess Mikasa .jpg|left|thumb|150px|Ascocenda Orchid]]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Ascocenda Princess Mikasa .jpg|left|thumb|150px|Ascocenda Orchid]]
This example also uses all four options. It is shown on the left.   It is smaller than the one in the main page, and the caption has been simplified for this example.   As with the above case, the text ''wraps'' from a selected point.   The ''left'' and ''right'' examples comprise the main methods for automatic text wrapping.   Compare these with the next example.  








'''Example of a CENTER-positioned image:'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[[File:primula_aka.jpg|center|thumb|200px|Primula]]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:primula_aka.jpg|center|thumb|200px|Primula]]
This image is shown in the center and for this example the text ''cannot'' wrap; it ''must'' follow-on beneath the image.   '''This ''following-on'' of text is characteristic of ''centering'' and all other positioning of images,(absolute and relative positioning included)'''.   ''Left'' and ''Right'' image placement are special cases.


'''Example of both LEFT and RIGHT-positioned images:'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[[File:primula_aka.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Primula]]
[[File:Ascocenda Princess Mikasa .jpg|right|thumb|100px|Ascocenda Orchid]]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:primula_aka.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Primula]]
[[File:Ascocenda Princess Mikasa .jpg|right|thumb|100px|Ascocenda Orchid]]
This combination allows the wrapping of text between the two images, since it is comprised of only the ''left'' and ''right'' positions.   As long as the ''center'' position is avoided, then wrapping is automatic.   If one image were deeper than the other, the text would still properly fill the available space. 






'''Example of all three positions together:''' ''Alignment fails in Internet Explorer before version 7.''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[[File:Gazania_rigens-1.jpg|left|thumb|125px|Gazania]]
[[File:Blossoming almond tree.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Almond]]
[[File:Coleostephus_February_2008-2.jpg|center|thumb|125px|Coleostephus]]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Gazania_rigens-1.jpg|left|thumb|125px|Gazania]]
[[File:Blossoming almond tree.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Almond]]
[[File:Coleostephus_February_2008-2.jpg|center|thumb|125px|Coleostephus]]


The use of all ''left'', ''right'', and ''center'' positions will result in the alignment of all three across the page, provided that the ''last'' image line is that for ''center'', but will otherwise fail.  Note that although text will wrap to the side images, it must always ''follow-on'' below the one in the center.   That is to say, for the best use of space keep the largest image away from the center position.   Sadly, this layout does not suit some browsers. (See ''Browser Compatibility'' below).

'''Browser compatibility and other image methods'''
This last all-in-line layout looks useful in that it fills the space well, and for the most recent browsers it undoubtedly makes a neat layout.   The line-up is unreliable for older browsers however, because they interpret HTML code differently.   Browsers apply different margins, text sizes and padding, and this can disrupt a layout.   A Wiki writer must consider how the page will look in the majority of browsers; many older browsers are still in use and their update prevented by changes in platforms and other factors; (e.g. Win98 cannot use a browser beyond Explorer 6).

To explain further, in recent Explorer 8, Opera 9, and Firefox 3 browsers, this three image line-up will be seen all-in-line; but in some other browsers, for example, Internet Explorer 6, the center image will be displaced below the other two.  Programmers attempt to compensate for these differences in their style sheets, but authors too, can help by understanding these limitations.

There is a similar failing in some versions of Firefox for a ''centered'' gallery of images; a gallery will be seen to shift to the ''left'' of the specified ''center'' position, whether it stands alone or is within another structure, such as a drop-box.

For those who need more methods for image layout, there are notes for the ''tiling'' of images, (casually in line), and for locking them in place, in  [[Editing Wikitext/Pictures/Tiled Images|Tiled Images]] and [[Editing Wikitext/Pictures/Images in Containers|Images in Containers]] respectively.}} 
{{-}}   
When such a line of image code is in place, press the ''Show preview'' button at the bottom of the editing window and wait for the system to display the reformatted page.   If the image position is ''left'' or ''right'' then the text will be seen to wrap.  If the ''center'' is selected, (or ''none''), then the text ''cannot'' wrap, and the text will move to a point ''below'' the image.

In any case, if the rendered result is not as expected, then the text can be changed as often as is necessary, until it is right.   When the work ''is'' right, press the ''Save page'' button at the bottom of the page to store the revised page for other web users to see.  
{{-}}

==Adjust The Options==
&lt;br /&gt;
{{drop|T}}'''hese notes describe the image options in detail''', and are correct at the time of writing.

The ''sequence'' of image options is unimportant, and with the sole exception of the image name these entries are ''insensitive to case''.   However, it is recommended that a ''size'' is ''always'' included, to avoid enormous image sizes.      The general coding format and the most useful options for the image syntax are again given below:
{{block|background=ivory|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,monospace|'''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:File_Name|Position|Type|Size|Caption]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''}}

{{hiddenh3|POSITION: ''The horizontal position on the page...''}}
;'''When position is not specified'''...: The default position is ''right'' when the border ''type'' is set to ''frame'' or ''thumb'', else it is ''left''.
;'''The position options'''...: These are ''right'', ''left'', ''center'', or ''none''.
;'''To wrap text around images'''...: Choose either the ''left'' or ''right'' image positions, or one image set to each, for wrapping between two images.
;'''To force text to follow-on'''...: Choose ''center'' or ''none'' since these cannot wrap text. 
;'''To fix an image without wrapping'''...: Choose ''none''. This forces the image onto a new line at the left.
;'''For an image in a table cell'''...: Set the position to ''center'' within the image code, and if necessary, set the vertical position with a CSS style in the respective table element.
;'''Additional note'''...: The positioning of images at ''left'', ''right'', and ''center'', when there is a similar image already occupying some space, can result in these terms being interpreted as ''relative to the remaining space''.  These images are said to ''float''.   By contrast, an image set to ''none'' is ''non-floating'', and it does not permit anything alongside it.   


{{hiddenh3|TYPE:  ''The border type for the image...'' }}
;'''When type is not specified'''...: An image with no border is produced.
;'''The type options'''...: These are ''thumb'', ''frame'', or ''border''.
;'''For a border, caption, and scaling'''...: Use ''Thumb'' since it has the most scope. 
;'''For a border, caption, but no scaling'''...: Use ''Frame'', but only for same-sized images.
;'''For a very faint border'''...:Use ''border''. This is useful when an otherwise border-less,  pale image needs a slight color separation from a pale background.
;'''Make a user-sized thumbnail on the right'''...:Set ''thumb'' with ''only'' the image details. The size will be set in accordance with the user-set preferences.   The size will be seen locally, and others will see their own, or its default. 
;'''Images on colored backgrounds'''...: Avoid ''thumb'', since an unwanted white margin might be seen. Consider the use of a frame-less image to avoid it.
;'''Images for table cells'''...: These should be border-less.   There are problems with framed image captions, and the borders are best made with table properties.
;'''Image captions'''...:These are possible only with ''thumb'' and ''frame'', though the template set [[template:noframeleft|Noframeleft]], [[template:noframeright|Noframeright]], [[template:noframecenter|Noframecenter]], and [[template:noframenone|Noframenone]] permits captions for frame-less images and gives more scope in the making of custom borders.   
  

{{hiddenh3|SIZE:  ''The image size, not counting any borders...'' }}
;'''When size is not specified'''...:The image will be full-sized, and in most cases would be too big.   However see comments about user-set thumbnail type.
;'''Resizing an image'''...: This is possible for all option types except when the ''frame'' type is chosen.
;'''Units of image measurement'''...:The ''units'' used for images are pixels, and the size of an image applies to the image only; any borders add to the overall layout.
;'''There are two image size formats'''...: The required image size can be specified as just its width, or as its width and height.   It cannot be specified as height alone. 
;'''The ''single'' size format'''...: This is the pixel size of the image's base, with the shape preserved.   Screens render images as about 70 to 100 pixels to the inch.  A typical entry is e.g. 240px. 
;'''The ''double'' size format'''...: This is the base dimension times the height, e.g. 240x150px, when both are known.
;'''When there is an inconsistent dimension given'''...: That is to say, when one of a pair of dimensions seem to be trying to change the shape, only the smaller of the two possible image sizes is produced.  
;'''Equalizing heights of mixed image shapes'''...: Knowing the exact dimensions is unnecessary. For example, to equalize the heights of mixed-shape images, use the double format with all of the size code set for the required common height, and their widths greatly exaggerated. This forces an ''inconsistent'' scaling that achieves the required result.  For example, two images that are 350x150px and 700x450px are clearly of different shape.  To display the two side by side, both with a height of 100px, we set their image code to say 900x100px and 900x100px.   The obvious 900px inconsistency is ignored and the 100px is taken as the useful dimension for scaling.   The shape of each image will nonetheless be preserved without having to re-calculate the exact dimensions.  


{{hiddenh3|CAPTION:  ''The caption that goes inside the border...'' }}
;'''When caption is not specified'''...: Only ''thumb'' and ''frame'' permit captions, and they can be omitted to leave an empty space.
;'''Format caption text'''...:Use HTML tags, Wikitext and hyperlinks to format captions.
;'''Use text templates''' ...: Templates can be used to format captions. They can reduce the effort and add consistency to the appearance.
;'''Options that are not recognized'''...: When an image option is misspelled or otherwise not understood, it will be taken as a caption, or as alternative text for the image placeholder.   When there are two possibilities only the first is taken.
;'''What is alternative text?'''...:The empty box for an image is called a placeholder, and text can sometimes be found in it; this is the ''alternative text''.  When the image is not available, or when software for the disabled ''reads'' the page, this text can be used.
;'''Alternative text or captions'''...:   When captions are ''impossible'' because of the border type, an attempt at adding a caption is taken as ''alternative text''.   When a caption ''is'' possible, it is also used as the ''alternative text''.  Having different captions and alternative texts in images is not possible. 
{{-}}

==Use Image Templates==
{{Noframeleft|1=[[File:Rose_Queen_Elizabeth_20070601.jpg|200px]]|2=Rose, ''Queen Elizabeth'': Frame-less}}
{{Noframeright|cwidth=200px|border=4px outset darkgreen|1=[[File:Rose_Queen_Elizabeth_20070601.jpg|200px]]|2=Rose, ''Queen Elizabeth'': With a border.}}
{{drop|T}}'''here are occasional inconveniences in the  use of the basic image syntax'''.

{{blockwrap|ta=left|background=transparent|fs=1em|ff=inherit|1=For example:

*The basic options allow captions for only ''frame'' and ''thumb'' types.
*Images with borders on colored backgrounds often show unwanted white margins.
*Custom made borders are not possible.}}
These points, when necessary, can be overcome by displaying the image within a template.  In particular, the Wikibooks templates  [[Template:Noframeleft|Noframeleft]], [[Template:Noframeright|Noframeright]], [[Template:Noframecenter|Noframecenter]], and [[Template:Noframenone|Noframenone]] were made for this purpose, and images made with them behave in much the same way as the basic image examples.

Each template in the set is made for the appropriate position on the page. Two examples of template use can be seen on the left and the right of the page; The left image is an example of a frame-less image with a caption and was made with [[Template:Noframeleft|Noframeleft]]. The image on the right was given a border with [[Template:Noframeright|Noframeright]]. Compare the absence of white margins with the orchid and gerbera images shown elsewhere on this page.

The code to make use of these templates for this specific result is just:
{{blockwrap|ta=left|background=ivory|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,monospace|'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Noframeleft|1=[[File:Rose_Queen_Elizabeth_20070601.jpg|200px]]|2=Rose : ''Queen Elizabeth''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Noframeright|cwidth=200px|border=4px outset darkgreen|1=[[File:Rose_Queen_Elizabeth_20070601.jpg|200px]]|2=Rose, ''Queen Elizabeth'': With a border.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''}} 

It should be stressed that the white margins for thumbnails do not pose any problems for the ''default'' page coloring, and that colored backgrounds are comparatively rare in the Wikibooks project.
{{-}}

==Find Other Methods==
{{drop|T}}'''here are other image layout techniques.''' The ''tiling of images'' is covered in [[Editing Wikitext/Pictures/Tiled Images|Tiled Images]], and explains how to overlap images and how to line them up across the page.   A separate page on ''image containers'' has been provided at [[Editing Wikitext/Pictures/Images in Containers|Images in Containers]], and gives methods for tables, galleries and drop-down boxes.   For example, the top section of ''this'' page is made with an invisible table ''container'', and the colored background is made by placing the page within styled HTML ''div'' tags. 

As was described in the previous section, writers have developed ''templates''.   Examples include caption-making, text-formatting, and image placement.   Templates allow laborious formatting to be done without the need for the coding that usually accompanies such work.   The writer need only add text to a few key words for the formats to be added automatically.

Specific examples of templates in use may make the point more clearly.  The drop capitals on this page make use of a template called [[Template:Drop|Drop]].   The ''what to type'' panels of whatever color use the template [[Template:Block|Block]], and the drop-control boxes for the examples use [[Template:Dropimage|Dropimage]].   The template  [[Template:Hiddenh3|Hiddenh3]] has made various ''hidden'' headings, headings with the correct formats but without a listing in the table of contents. 

It is not proposed here to explain template making but rather to provide a link to a page that does so.   See [[../../Making Templates A101|Templates A101]].  To see a few examples of ''existing'' templates, see [[../../Templates_Ready_to_Use|Templates Ready to Use]].

==Tiled Images==

===All in a Line===
{{drop|I}}'''mages are easily placed in a line''' without the use of an image container, and most associate this kind of line-up with the notion of ''floating images''; if one too many of these images is added, the last one will just ''float'' to another page position rather than anchoring itself where it was put.   The ''simplest'' method for an image line-up depends on limiting the image options to the minimum.   Specify ''only'' the image names and their sizes, and disregard all other options, otherwise the method might become problematic.   The image syntax can be written all in one line, or in successive lines, and an example of the coding to use has been included in a drop-box for the adjacent line-up of images.

Notice that the example shown has no captions, since captions can only be used in the ''frame'' or ''thumbnail'' format.   However, by using templates such as [[Template:Noframeleft|Noframeleft]] for the images in such a lineup, tiled images ''with'' captions can be obtained.   A set of these templates has been made to include all of the image positions.    

A thin dividing space has been made between adjacent images by inserting a single space character between the image definitions.   To set the images edge to edge without any space between them, simply omit the space characters.   Because we rarely want to start an image line-up at the left margin of the page, it is useful to have a means of padding out the images.   In fact, a transparent, ''blank'' image has been uploaded to the image collection for that purpose; it is called  '''&lt;nowiki&gt;Padding.gif&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', and it can be sized on the page like any other image.   Refer to the code notes for an example of its use.   (Another method, capable of precise positioning, is described in the next section).
 
Images are rarely the size that you would prefer them to be and this is especially the case when the images are set side by side.   There ''is'' a method to get the images standardized.   Consider the image line-up.  Because these images were greatly ''different'' in their initial shapes, and their exact dimensions were laborious to find, it was decided to set their ''heights'' to be the same, and to allow the widths to be scaled accordingly.   The method to do this, shown in the code box below, is to specify the ''important'' dimension exactly, in this case the ''height'', while greatly exaggerating the size of the less important dimension, the ''width''.   Note that ''some'' dimension for width is required, but its exact value need not be known.   The software will use the ''smaller'' and more practical possibility, ignoring the implied larger scaling.   In this way the vastly different shapes can be scaled ''without'' having to make calculations based on ''both'' width and height.

Use either of these two listings in the Sandbox to produce a straight
line-up of the three images.   They do not have any frames around them.
In fact, they must use only the file name and the size for this method
to work.

For the second of the listings, (all written in one line), a space can
be left between the image definitions to produce a white space. If the
space is missed out, then the edges will meet.

It is possible to tile a white blank image with the others, to produce
page spacing, and this has been done here to set the distance of the
first image from the margin by 50 pixels.   A better way, and a bit
more complicated, is to place the images with an ''HTML inline style'',
using position properties called Relative Positioning.

Some have used a table to solve image spacing problems, and tables have
been useful in the past owing to their profusion of formatting choices.
If images are placed into the cells of a table, and the borders made to
vanish, then the width of unused cells can be used to invisibly adjust
the spacing between the images.  Captions can also be placed in the
cells beneath each image.

Other methods exist too; the image gallery, for example.   Examples of
these other methods will be shown in the sections below.&lt;/pre&gt;}}

===Relative Positioning===
{{drop|M}}'''ost image positioning is restricted to the three ''preset'' locations'''.   These of course are, ''left'', ''right'', and ''center''.   However, with the help of a little in-line HTML, images, tables, text paragraphs and other structures can be placed ''anywhere'' on the page.   In particular, this means that an image can be placed at a point ''relative'' to its position as expected by other code.   To explain further, if the usual position for an image is at the left margin, according to the syntax used, then the addition of relative positioning code allows it to be shifted relative to that point, up or down, right or left, even beyond the margin.   The pixel values for the vertical and horizontal shifts specify the exact extent of the displacements.   

The main problem with this method, apart from its complexity, is that it will not deliver ''wrapped'' text for the placements.   Like ''centered'' images, the text is restricted to  ''following-on''.   Another problem concerns frames for the images; because shifting is applied to images ''within their immediate containers'', all types of borders must be avoided.   As a result of losing frames and thumbnail borders, all of the captions have to be arranged by other means.   

To expand on the matter of text having to follow-on, it is perhaps helpful to note the sequence of events for relative positioning.   When the image, box or other structure is first placed, it is allocated to the space ''without'' relative positioning; that is, as if the shifting code were missing or set to zeros.   Then the code shifts the item to its new position by the amounts given by the shifting code.   '''A space is left at the first location, equal in size to the item that was moved'''.   When the next line of text or another item is added to the work, it must take account of that allocated space.   As a result, when a large image or block of text is moved vertically, the following text cannot be located until ''after'' the gap.

Although it is theoretically possible to shift tables and large blocks of text, the above mentioned limitation renders it less useful.   '''Relative positioning works best when the shifts and texts are fairly small'''.   The method meets these requirements for shifting images that are initially tiled across the page, and for overlapping effects.

An example of overlapping images is given below.   The ''normal'' position for these images, without shifting,would have been in-line, starting from the left margin, and the padding image has been omitted for this example.   The images were shifted from these tiled positions by the required amounts to create the overlapping effect.  

The paleness or density of images can be varied.   The code for twenty percent opacity can be found in the drop-box along with an example of shifted text.    




&lt;span style=&quot;position:relative;left:100px;top:0px&quot;&gt;[[Image:Nymphaea tetragona.jpg|500x226px]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;position:relative;left:50px;top:-20px&quot;&gt;[[Image:Chamomile@original size.jpg|500x226px]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;position:relative;left:0px;top:-40px&quot;&gt;[[Image:Krokus-kih.jpg|500x226px]]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;


'''Notes on the code:'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;poem style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;font-family:'Courier New',Courier,monospace;&quot;&gt;Paste this code section into your editing window or the Sandbox to reproduce the overlapping image layout.   These image lines would normally be shown as tiled inline, starting at the left margin, since there are no padding images used in it.

The normal position is modified by the mark-up code's ''left'' and ''top'' properties.   In the first image line ''left=100 pixels'' and ''top=0 pixels'', means that the ''left side of the image'' will be placed 100 pixels ''beyond'' the point otherwise expected for it; it would usually be at the left margin so it will be at 100 pixels from it to the right.

The ''top of the image'' will not be shifted.   The left of the second image, which would  usually be to the ''right'' of the first image anyway, need only be shifted 50 pixels onward from its usual position, to produce the effect.   The second image is also moved upwards by 20 pixels.   Relative to its usual position, the third image is not shifted along at all, but is shifted upwards by 40 pixels.

The important point in relative positioning is to note that they are positional ''changes'' that are specified; changes from the positions that the images could reasonably have been expected to occupy based on their other coding.   Images placed at the left of the page are the easiest to calculate new positions for.  

It is also possible to use the property ''right'', meaning the ''right side of the image'' and ''bottom'', meaning the ''bottom edge of the image''.   Their use follows similar reasoning to that above.   The overlap, if any, is determined by the order that the image code was written; the last placed will be on top, with the first on the bottom.   The stacking order can be changed with
further coding.   

If images are placed in frames, the positioning is likely to become confused or fail altogether.   Positioning within frames such as table cells or boxes is possible, but the shifting will take place within the image container.&lt;/poem&gt;}}
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;opacity:0.2;filter:alpha(opacity=20)&quot;&gt;[[image:gerbera_pink.jpg|center|340px]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:lucida handwriting;line-height:1.5em;color:maroon;font-size:16pt;position:relative;left:300px;top:-225px&quot;&gt;'''''This is the text.'''''&lt;/span&gt;

==Mouse-hover Images==
{{noframeright|margin=10px|cwidth=200px|{{HoverImage|Big yellow.jpg|Red chrysanthemum.jpg|250px}}|Gerbera:''Move the mouse on the image.''}}
Two images can occupy the same space provided that only one of them is seen at a time.   The usual way to do this is to hover the mouse over the ''default'' image, the one that is stable and seen most of the time.   When this is done the ''alternative'' image replaces it, and when the mouse is removed, the original image reappears.

This technique is available using the template [[template:HoverImage|HoverImage]].   The names of the two images are provided to the template, along with any other image options, and two separate captions can be made.   The method works best with images that are the same ''shape''; that is, have the same ''aspect ratio''.  Then, with one base size setting, both will be scaled to the same ''size''.  When the shapes differ and the images change, the height or the width of the presented work changes too.   Because the text adjusts in wrapping around the images the effect is not necessarily bad, and you can see this best for yourself by trying it in the sandbox.   As was suggested elsewhere on this page, a method exists to allow fixing of image ''heights'' instead of ''widths'', and this might suit some better.

In all other respects the template can be used as if it were a single image, with for example, text wrapping for the ''left'' and ''right'' positioned images.    The template can be used in any situation that needs the ''full image syntax''; for example, it could ''not'' be used to build gallery entries, since these use only an abbreviated image syntax; the image ''name''. It ''could'' be used on a page, within tables and drop-boxes, and anywhere else that can make use of the full image syntax.  

The image on the right shows an  example of the template's use; more detailed notes can be found on the page [[Editing_Wikitext/Templates_Ready_to_Use|Templates Ready to Use]], and on the template page itself.

===Images in a table===
{{drop|I}}'''n-line, tiled images are simple to do''', though they lack the positional stability of images in table cells.   Although the matter rarely becomes important for images placed at the left or right of a page, when a more ambitious layout is needed, tables come into their own.

Tables allow many formatting options but do require some knowledge of Wiki's table-making code. To learn how to make tables see the page [[Editing_Wikitext/Tables|'''Tables''']], and to remind yourself of the styles used, see the drop-box later on this page.    

After trying different methods, it is found best to use a table with ''two'' rows; one for the images, and the row below that for their captions.   This allows the captions to be formatted separately from anything in the image cells and generally gives the best flexibility in working.   When table borders are removed in such an arrangement, the images seem to stand on their own without the table being visible at all.   The first example below uses this method, with the mark-up code for its implementation shown nearby.

To space out the images across the page against the prevailing background it is best to add extra columns to the tables.   Do this by adding extra cells in the existing rows, and set their widths  to achieve the necessary spacings.   To avoid the need for additional styling of the table's background it can be made ''transparent''.   In this way the page color shows though, regardless of what color is set.   An example using these points is shown, and the code to produce it is also displayed nearby.

For those who find tables a bit awkward to use, the '''image gallery''' may be more to their liking.   It is much simpler, and quite good results are to be had without formatting.   It is  described below with varying complexity.

'''Notes on the code:'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre  style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New',Courier,monospace;font-size:1.1em;border:none;background:white;&quot;&gt;
The code makes use of the many table-formatting options available.
The main formats are set in the table section and then various other
formats are set in rows and cells.   The first table row has the code
to align any contents of the row horizontally to the center: the
second row formats do the same and also set the vertical alignment for
the row to top.   The color scheme has been set to white text on a
grey background. 

The images are all placed in the cells of the first row, and their
captions have been placed below each in the cells of the second row.
Widths of the columns have been set in the cells of the second row.

The captions have been formatted to bold type.   Note that the table
caption has been formatted separately to bold, black on white.   The
image spacing is done with the padding number in the table definition.

Use the link at the bottom of the page, (Help:Table), for assistance
with additional table styles and formatting, such as the CSS properties
of font-family and font-weight.(eg: Verdana and bold).   In addition,
both cell and table borders could be set in various widths, styles, and
colors.

Note that the images were all forced to the same height by setting an
arbitrarily high value for their horizontal dimensions, as described
elsewhere in this article.

The disadvantage of this method is clearly the complexity in coding 
required for a beginner, though by copying such code into the Sandbox,
it can be tested and adjusted to any extent without damage.

Another example of the use of a table can be found in the
top section of this page, where the table of contents and
two images share a table.   This configuration was chosen to
stabilize the top section layout.   The code is:&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--Simulated pre box --&gt;

A similar effect to that of two images plus a Table of Contents can be obtained using the template [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Imageontop '''Imageontop'''], and avoids the need for much coding.}}

The spaced table code is similar to that of the previous
example, except that the addition of five extra columns
allow the images to be spaced at any point horizontally
across the page.   Simply adjust the width entries for
the blank cells in the second row to do this.   Additional
code to change formats is to be found by following the
Help:Table link at the foot of the main page.
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

{{tablestyles}}

In addition, the images at the top of this article are both housed in table cells, with the table of contents, (TOC), in another; this was deemed necessary to constrain the positioning of the TOC in its various contortions.   The code can be found in the drop-down box and if required, can be pasted into an editing window, or the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Sandbox&amp;action=edit '''Sandbox'''] for modification.   For those who are unfamiliar with table handling, a set of templates, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Imageontop '''Imageontop'''], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Image1ontop '''Image1ontop'''], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Image2ontop '''Image2ontop'''], and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Image3ontop '''Image3ontop'''],have been prepared and allow the user to make similar top sections to the one on this page.   If the requirement is just for a table of contents with text all the way to the top, then use the template [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Textontop '''Textontop''']. 

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

===The Image Gallery===
{{drop|C}}'''onsider the three image gallery examples in the drop-down box'''.   In the most simple example of its use, the user need not even scale the images, and need not know their sizes.  The software makes all of the calculations and adjusts all of the dimensions to fit the images neatly into the gallery layout.  Captions are available for both the images and the gallery itself, and any reasonable number of images can be added, with each image's coding typed onto a separate line.   If required, a small amount of text can be inserted instead of an image.

The first example is the simplest and is ordered in rows of four images.   This four-to-a-row format is provided by default, but can be adjusted as will be shown in the second example.  Blank places are left for any unused image space in a row, e.g.; for a gallery of seven images, there would be one blank space in the second row.  Although this gallery uses an ''HTML align attribute'' in an attempt to center it, centering has failed within the drop-box and it merely appears to be centered because it is the widest inclusion, and has simply been expanded to the size that is needed by this block element. 

There are problems with the centering of the gallery function ''within a drop-box'', though not necessarily when galleries are used on the open page.   The problem seems to be connected with the use of the ''HTML align attribute''.   It is likely that a CSS style in a style sheet has invoked a priority in drop-boxes over the use of an HTML attribute.  However there is a way to overcome the problem within a drop-box; in the second example below the ''HTML align attribute'' has been replaced by CSS styles for ''width'' and ''margin'', and the use of this alternative styling overcomes the problem. The method can use percentages as dimensions to allow for different container (screen) widths, but the styles need careful adjustment for each gallery that is to be displayed. Notice too that whereas the relative percentages for values of ''width'' always refer to the immediate container, the values used for ''margin'' refer to percentages of the ''table width''. Once the point is understood, there is rarely any confusion. 

Note the use of the ''CSS width style'';  this allows an adjustment of the image masks; e.g., by setting a gallery width, any difference between it and the width calculated for the layout, is adjusted by changing the widths of the image masks.   

In the second example, row height, column width, and the number of images per row have been added as options. In this way the layout can be changed greatly, and in this particular case, the display made smaller.   The position is ''centered'', using CSS styles.   Since some viewing screens are narrower than others, reducing the number of images across the gallery with this method helps to keep the whole thing visible at the same time. 

In the third example, many other font and formatting options have been added.  These formats use  many style-sheet rules. (See  [http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp '''CSS2 Properties Reference''']  for more).   In this way all of the font ''family'', ''style'', ''color'', etc., can be adjusted, as well as the text ''padding''. Some properties remain obstinate; the notion of background color does not extend to the off-white photo mask, but can work on the space between the border and the mask.   In addition, some slight difference in appearance for backgrounds has been noted between galleries on a page and galleries in a drop-down box.   

The Wikitext markup code used to produce the three results is given in another drop-down box with descriptive notes.   The modules can be copied into the  [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Sandbox&amp;action=edit '''Sandbox''']  for further testing and use.   Bear in mind that not all of the available text rules have been included.   There is some distance still to go in experimenting with useful formats, and some kind soul might even devise a way to expose the photo mask for background coloring.

'''Notes on the code:'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre  style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New',Courier,monospace;font-size:1.1em;border:none;background:white;&quot;&gt;The image code in each case must occupy a separate line, Text can occupy
a line instead of an image. See the code for the format.     The comments
below have been written for the last code example, since it has the most options.
The description applies also to the other two cases.&lt;/pre&gt; 

&lt;pre  style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New',Courier,monospace;font-size:1.1em;border:none;background:white;&quot;&gt;Notes on style entries:
The gallery class is modified here using in-line style rules.
The above style entries have two different formats; in one,
the format is:

style=&quot;Property1:value; Property2:value; ... ;Property-last:value&quot;

where the combination of a property and its value is called a &quot;rule&quot;.
Note that the whole set of rules with this format is enclosed
within double quotes, and each rule is separated from the next with
a semi-colon.   In addition, properties and values are separated
by a full colon.

The other format is:

Property1=Value Property2=Value etc.

In this case also the combination of a property and its value is
called a &quot;rule&quot;.   Note the absence of double quotes.   Each rule
here is separated from the next with a space.   In addition,
properties and values are separated by an equals sign.

The format within quotes is known as the CSS style,
(Cascading Style Sheet), and other property values can be found in
listings such as the one at the site:
http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp,
and within WikiBooks under the keywords: CSS Programming.

If there is faulty syntax used within the quotes, then the whole style
expression might not work, and the format of the work will look strange.
The properties must be appropriate for the gallery tag, or for the tag
that is being modified; (for example, text would not have image
properties).   Any reasonable number of expressions can be placed
between the double quotes.

The other part of the style rules that lie outside the double quotes,
belong to an earlier syntax that is nonetheless still useful.

Both of these formats can coexist in style modifications, provided that
care is taken as to which rules need which format.  Although this comment
applies to the gallery tag, it applies to ''any'' tag used in HTML.
The styles for the gallery class definition, wherever it has been made,
is changed by including these rules within the tag at the point that it
is used.   This is called an ''in-line style'', (within the text itself),
and it has priority over any other styles created in external style sheets,
or in the heading of the web page.

In short, such in-line styles are necessary, when the other style
settings are out of reach.

Note that links can be added in captions. The second example above
replaces simple captions with links to pages with more information.

The following notes list the properties and a few of their values.
In the order that they are written:

color:        This is the font color.   Other colors from &quot;W3&quot;,
              the site mentioned above or from http://en.wikipedia.org/
              wiki/Web_colors#X11 color names Example values; red,
              blue,papayawhip,lghtyellow,maroon,dimgray,teal,linen,darkgray,
              black,royalblue,etc.   Color names are often written as
              one word.

background:   Usually refers to the general background color though in
              the gallery, fails to color the off-white photo mask.   When
              padding is used then the background has the same color.
              In a drop-box this format changes a little compared the page.
              Uses the same color set as above.

font-family:  The face name of the font; Garamond, Courier, Arial,
              Verdana, Impact, Fixedsys, etc. Items with spaces all
              in quotes.   Note that for a priorities list of fonts
              to use for a tag, use font-face. 

font-size:    The font size; e.g. in points; 10pt, 12pt, 14pt...xx-small,
              x-small,small,medium,large,x-large,xx-large,smaller,
              larger,length,%.   Worded terms relate to the default.

font-weight:  The thickness of the font. eg bold, bolder, lighter,
              normal, 100-900.   See CSS reference link for more.

text-align:   The horizontal position of text in the space; left,center,
              and right, and in paragraphs, justify.
              It affects the captions and any text in cells.

border:       Specified as width, type, color, where width is
              often in pixels, type is single, double etc, and any color can
              be used.

padding:      This refers to the gallery space between the outside border
              and the edge of the white photo-mask, and takes the
              background color. It can disappear in a drop-box!
              The sequence is top, right, bottom, left. If only one is stated
              then it applies to them all.  It two figures are given, then
              opposite sides are given equal padding.

align:        This refers to the left, center, or right positions
              in the page.   It moves the whole gallery.  Note that the
              gallery follows the same rules as images for wrapping of
              text; left and right do it but center follows-on.                
            
caption:      This refers to the text used for the top caption, (above the
              gallery).  It can be formatted with wikitext or HTML tags.

widths:       Peculiar to the gallery, it sets the width of the image
              and white mask combination for every cell, eg 150px.

heights:      Peculiar to the gallery, it sets the height of the image
              and white mask combination for every cell, eg 170px.

perrow:       Peculiar to the gallery, it sets the number of images per
              row; an integer.   If blank spaces are produced then they
              are the color of the mask; (always off-white!.
              Images are placed on separate lines.   If text is used
              on a line instead, its length is limited.&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

===Drop-down Images===
{{drop|I}}'''t can be useful to save space or to un-clutter a page'''. For all the space saving qualities of tables or the gallery, it can be useful to save even more.   An image or even a gallery of images can be tucked away in a drop-down box.   The display will appear when the bar is clicked with the mouse; clicking it again closes the control and restores the page to a more tidy state.

For those writing within '''WikiBooks''', there is a template ready-made to make things easy.   Refer to  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Dropimage '''Template : Dropimage''']  for its use, limitations, and options.   All of the drop-boxes on this page made use of it.

For those who write within '''Wikipedia''' there is also a version of '''Dropimage'''.   In addition, for '''Wikipedia''', Wikimedia, and WikiBooks, there are collapsible tables.   See [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Collapsing '''Collapsible Tables'''], and [[Editing_Wikitext/Tables|'''Tables''']], for the details.

Whether the enclosure is text, an image, an animation, or a whole gallery of images, the method of using the '''Dropimage''' template is the same.   The code that will produce the text, image, or gallery is placed in the ''last'' parameter space, and the message for the top heading goes into the ''first'' parameter.   Although it is sometimes found useful to use the ''named'' parameter method, (2=''parameter text''), for most text and images it will be OK to just place the material as it is.   If the parameter text is very complicated, it is often a good idea to view it first on its own to make sure it is as expected.

Avoid using Wiki heading codes for your first characters since this messes things up; i.e.; use the HTML '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags instead of the equals signs.   If your intention is to place a ''table'' in a drop box, be sure that it is an HTML table, since the ''pipe'' symbols of a Wiki table might be misinterpreted.   Refer to the WikiBooks &lt;nowiki&gt;Template:Dropimage&lt;/nowiki&gt; page for an example.

The typical syntax for the Dropimage template and its result are shown below.

{{block|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dropimage|align=center|width=120px|Press me !|[[image:Animated flower.GIF|200px|center]]''Flower Power''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

{{dropimage|align=center|width=120px|Press me!|[[image:Animated flower.GIF|200px|center]]''Flower Power''}}

When previewed in a page being edited or in the  [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Sandbox&amp;action=edit '''Sandbox'''] , the above code block makes a drop control identical to the one above; the control is centered, has a ''top'' caption of ''Press me !'', and an ''inside'' caption also.   The ''initial'' width of the control is 120 pixels, though the image within it is greater, with a base width of 200 pixels.   Take time to change the image and the other settings to see how the template works.

WikiBooks templates ''will'' work in other projects, such as Wikipedia, provided that they are first imported by their administrator, though in the case of '''Dropimage''' it was easier to simply reproduce it there instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Proteolytic processing in the broad sense means a protein or a protein complexing processing another protein or protein complex to modify its activity. This processing may lead of activation, inhibition or modulation of the protein activity. Much of the cellular processes are triggered by proteolytic processing. Proteolytic processing is the major part of post translational modification of a protein to make a functional protein complex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this tutorial, you will learn how to calibrate the [[w:en:Odometry|odometry]] of your robot. There are various ways to calibrate the odometry of a differential-drive robot. The procedure we show here is perhaps not the most precise, but certainly one of the simplest to quickly get decent calibration values.

== Odometry in a Nutshell ==

Your Khepera III robot is equipped with two DC motors with an encoder each. These encoders allow to obtain the current position of the robot in very small increments (~ 2760 steps for one tour of the wheel). By recording how the wheels turn, it is possible to estimate the trajectory of the robot. This procedure is commonly termed ''odometry'' (or position estimation with odometry), and implemented in the program ''odometry_track''.

The major problem of this procedure is error accumulation. At each step (each time you take an encoder measurement), the position update will involve some error. This error accumulates over time and therefore renders accurate tracking over large distances (&gt; 10 m) impossible. Over short distances (&lt; 1 m on a flat surface), however, the odometry can provide extremely precise results.

To get these good results, it is crucial to calibrate the robot. Tiny differences (~ 1 micrometer) in wheel diameter will result in important errors after a few meters, if they are not properly taken into account. Note that each robot (if you have several of them) has to be calibrated individually, preferably on the same type of floor it is being used later on.

== Setup ==

Boot a Khepera III robot and make sure it is [[Khepera III Toolbox/Network Setup|connected]] to your computer via WLAN. In the following text, we assume that you are working with robot 203.

You will need a couple of motor programs and the ''odometry_goto'' program for the calibration. Copy these onto your robot with
 cd Programs
 k3put +203 motor* odometry_goto
Log onto the robot (&lt;tt&gt;k3go +203&lt;/tt&gt;) and initialize the motors:
 cd your_username
 ./motors_initialize
You are now ready to calibrate the odometry of your robot.

== Odometry Calibration ==

There are 3 free parameters in a differential-drive system which have to be known to estimate the position using odometry:
* The distance per increment (conversion factor) for the left wheel.
* The distance per increments (conversion factor) for the right wheel.
* The distance between the two wheels (axis length).

As these parameters are difficult to measure directly, we will instead measure 4 parameters which allow us to derive the parameters above. These 4 parameters, in the order we measure them, are:
# '''increments_per_tour''': The number of increments per wheel tour.
# '''axis_wheel_ratio''': The ratio between the axis length and the mean wheel diameter.
# '''diameter_left''' and '''diameter_right''': The two wheel diameters, up to a scaling factor. (Actually, the ratio between the two wheel diameters - this is why these two values count as only one parameter.)
# '''scaling_factor''': A scaling factor.
The necessary parameters can then be derived as follows:
 distance_per_increment_left = wheel_diameter_left * scaling_factor * 2 * PI / increments_per_tour
 distance_per_increment_right = wheel_diameter_right * scaling_factor * 2 * PI / increments_per_tour
 axis_length = axis_wheel_ratio * (wheel_diameter_left + wheel_diameter_right) / 2 * scaling_factor
These equations are implemented in ''calibration.pl'', which will create a calibration file and upload it on a robot.

=== Step 1: Increments per Wheel Tour ===

The number of increments per wheel tour is a constant, depending only on the encoder and the gearbox used. For the Khepera III robot, this value is 2764.8 (4 * 16 * 1.6 * 27).

You can experimentally verify this number by marking the wheels at one point, and let them move by this number of steps:
 ./motor_setposition 0 0
 ./motor_gotoposition 2765 2765
Your marker should be back at exactly the same position.

=== Step 2: Ratio between Axis Length and Wheel Diameter ===

Both axis length and wheel diameter can only be measured approximately with standard measurement tools. However, their ratio can be measured very precisely by letting the robot turn on the spot and counting the number of steps. This number divided by 2764.8 directly yields the ratio we are looking for. Of course, to get a more precise value, we will let the robot make several rotations.

From rough measurements with a ruler we know that this ratio is about 2.11 (88.5 mm / 42 mm), so let's start with this value and let the robot turn 10 times on the spot. The position value for that would be:
 10 * 2.11 * 2764.8 = 58337.28
Put the robot on the ground, mark its orientation, and type:
 ./motor_setposition 0 0
 ./motor_gotoposition -p 58337 -58337
The '''-p''' option will enable the trapezoidal speed profile. Once the robot has stopped, it should have ''almost'' the same orientation as in the beginning, but is likely to be a few degrees off. Play with the position value until it has ''exactly'' the same orientation (as far as you can judge visually).
Once you've found a good value (assume it was 58255), just do the math backwards to find out the ratio:
 58255 / (10 * 2764.8) = 2.1070

If you want to get a more precise value, you can repeat the above experiments with 100 turns.

=== Step 3: Wheel Diameters ===

To experimentally find out diameter differences between the two wheels, we will load our current odometry model onto the robot and then let it move around in your arena while keeping track of its position. At the end, we let the robot move back to where it thinks it started, and note the offset with the real initial position.

To to start with, we need to upload the current odometry values. Edit ''calibration.pl'' and execute it:
 ./calibration.pl
If you set a robot IP address inside this script, it will upload the odometry values onto the robot. (Note that any existing odometry values there will be overwritten without merci.) Otherwise, you have to edit the file ''/etc/khepera/odometry'' on the robot by yourself.

The ''odometry_goto'' program which you uploaded at the beginning will now use these values to keep track of the position. Put the robot in an open area with at least 1 m space around it, mark its position and type:
 ./odometry_goto position 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
The robot will now move to all corner points of a square with 1 m width, and hence cover a distance of about 4 m. At the end, the robot believes being back at the initial position (with a different heading, though), but is most likely up to 30 cm off. Compare the final position with the initial position (disregard the heading), and ajust the wheel diameter difference as follows:
* If the robot is on the right of its initial position (i.e. the square is not closed), increase the diameter of the right wheel by increasing the ''wheel_diameter_difference'' in ''calibration.pl''. 
* If the robot is on the left of its initial position, increase the diameter of the left wheel by decreasing the ''wheel_diameter_difference'' in ''calibration.pl''.

Then, upload the new odometry values and repeat this step until the distance between the initial and final position is less than 5 cm. If you have enough space, you can increase the size of the rectangle to get more precise measurements.

=== Step 4: Scaling Factor ===

The scaling factor is again very easy to find out. Put the robot on your floor, which an open area of 1 m in front of it, mark its initial position and type:
 ./odometry_goto position 1 0
The robot will stop approximately 1 m in front of its initial position. Measure that distance precisely with a measuring tape, and calculate the corresponding scaling factor as follows:
 scaling_factor = real_distance / 1 m
You can of course choose a longer distance if you have enough space.

Adjust the scaling factor in ''calibration.pl'', and execute that script again to upload the newest odometry calibration values onto the robot. Your robot is now calibrated!

Proteolytic processing is highly specific process. Mechanism of proteolytic processing varies according to the protein being processed, location of the protein, and protein processing it. There is no general rule of the thumb for proteolytic processing. This section therefore gives examples of different proteolytic processing approaches to get the basic idea

&lt;!-- Priyanka --&gt;

Proteolysis of Precursor proteins regulates many cellular processes like gene expression, embryogenesis, cell cycle, programmed cell death, intracellular protein targeting and endocrine/neural functions. All these processes needs proteolytic cleavage of the precursor protein and in this context this can be done by serine proteases in the secretory pathway. These proteases are calcium dependent serine endoproteases and are related to yeast and subtilisin proteases and therefore called Subtilisin-like Proprotein Convertases (SPCs) or PCs. Till now they identified &amp; characterized seven members of this family in mammals and they have conserved signal peptides, pro-regions, catalytic and P-domains but they differ in C-terminal domains. These proteases get activated by autocatalytic cleavage of an N-terminal propeptide just like Subtilisin which is required for folding and activity. Studies predict that an eight-stranded beta barrel is formed due to folding of the P domain which interacts through a hydrophobic patch to a catalytic domain.  Folding and activity requires a downstream domain of 150 amino acids named P- or Homo B-domain which plays a regulatory role, influencing both the calcium dependence and pH optima. Here the C-terminal regions play a minor in subcellular routing. Furin, one of the seven members of the SPCs, serves as a model for other PCs. The autoactivation mechanism involves intramolecular cleavage of prodomain that allows furin to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Until the cleaved inactive proenzyme reaches the trans Golgi Network (TGN) where dissociation of prodomain is facilitated by calcium-enriched environment and acidic pH conditions, the prodomain remains attached noncovalently to it. For full activation, further inhibitory reactions takes place within the prodomain by a second cleavage. Proinsulin, Proglucagon and POMC are the well studied peptide hormone precursors. PCs are responsible for the cleavage at specific sites in each of these precursors. The most frequent sites for cleavage are KR and RR. Proglucagon is processed by PC2 in the alpha cells and by PC1/PC3 in the intestinal L cells and releases active forms of glucagons-like peptides namely GLP-1 and GLP-2. The convertases PC2 and PC1/PC3 are majorly expressed in brain and neuroendocrine system to act on neuropeptide precursors in the secretory pathway. Glucose, the second messengers in the neuroendocrine cells regulates the transcription and translation of PC2 and PC1/PC3. Other convertases like PC4 expressed in testis and an isoform of PC6 that lacks a TM domain belong to PC family. Recently discovered convertases are PC7, furin, PACE4 and PC6B. These are  expressed in tissues like liver, gut, brain, neuroendocrine system. 
There are still many unidentified enzymes that participate in cleavages at single basic residues and unusual sites, other than the sutilisin-like Proprotein Convertases.

*Renal proteins
In concern with the proteolytic processing with respect to kidney the human prorenin is considered. The proteolytic processing of human prorenin in renal tissues is discussed here. The  mouse proprotein convertase also known as PC1 accurately cleaves the prorenin and generates active rennin. The human Proprotein Convertase also known as PC3 can also process the prorenin to generate rennin but not as efficiently as mPC1 does. This is because of the differences in the sequences of the carboxy terminus from PC1 to hybrid hPC1/mPC1. The cleavage of prorenin bay PC1 in humans takes place at a pair of basic amino acids by removal of 43 amino acid prosegment from the amino terminus of the it along with identification of a functionally important site in the hPC1. Also PC1 generates active rennin in other tissues like adrenal medulla and certain adrenal tumors. 
If human prorenin has either in Lys or Arg residues at the cleavage site then the hPC1 cannot generate active rennin. 

*Blood protein
The Kell Blood Group Protein belongs to family of metalloendopeptidases. It’s a membrane glycoprotein which shares a pentametric zinc-binding consensus sequence. It conserves all the amino acids required for the endopeptidase activity. Kell Blood Group proteins have a homology with M13 family in which a disulphide bond is covalently linked to a protein named XK, this spans the membrane 10 times, whereas kell proteins is linked to XK present is fifth extracellular loop. Activation of endothelins and processing of bioactive peptides can be done by Kell proteins. 

*Human Brain Spectrin
Fodrin, Human Brain Alpha Spectrin plays an important role in the nervous system yet its mechanism is not completely understood. Its isoforms are present within the cells and in some neurotransmitter neurons. It is proteolytically processed by the calcium dependent proteases. This processing of fodrin is a central molecular mechanism does the development of long term memory. Foldrin has a proteolytically hypersensitive site in its centre for cleavage. Calcium-dependent binding of calmodulin takes place at this site.

&lt;!-- Priyanka --&gt;

Polyprotein precursors translates the proteins that forms the retroviral particle. One of these precursors has viral protease that processes the precursors itself. This viral protease cleaves the retroviral precursor proteins during the virus assembly. Fully infectious viral particles are produced by precise Protease-mediated precursor processing and if the order of the cleavage changes, it results in the less infectious viral particle.  To become active the protease has to be localized along with the requirement of enzyme dimerization. Enzymes come from PR(Protease) domains of GagPol precursors. The processing events are first carried out by the embedded PR, prior to the release from the GagPol precursor.The activated protease domain on one pair of GagPol molecules cleaves initial sites on those same molecules. Further substitutions at the first amino acid in the protease, a proline, lift this constraint and free the protease domain within GagPol to cleave additional native processing sites in the precursor not cleaved by the wild-type embedded protease.

&lt;!-- Vrunda --&gt;


The fact that certain proteins can modify others by binding to specific site and alter its activity is used as a principle in the development of certain modern therapeutics. Here is an example of how the process of proteolytic processing has been used to find possible cure for diseases.
Human coronavirus is the causative agent of the common respiratory disease in adults and children. There are no current cure for CoV as a result proteolytic processing is being exploited to find new drug targets. Biochemical analysis of HCoV –NL63 virus showed 2 viral papain like protease PLP1 and PLP2 which process viral replicase polyprotein. In this case they generated polyclonal antisera against 2 of replicase non structural proteins nsp3 and nsp4. It was found that PLP1 processes clevage site to release 1 to release nsp1 whereas PLP2 released nsp2 and nsp3. Also by using hexa ubiquitin substrate and ubiquitin vinylsulphonate inhibitor specific to deubiquitinization enzyme futher show that CoV has deubiquititination activity. Understanding the concept of proteolytic processing and deubiquitinating of PLP’s can pave a way to the development of novel antisera regents directed against HCoV.

&lt;!-- Vrunda --&gt;


This is the process in which a protein modifies itself to convert a proprotein into an active protein. Classic example of this is the autoprocessing of furin family of endoprotease. Furin the most widely used proteolytic processing enzyme and functions mainly for cleavage of proproteins needed to maintain cellular physiology.Furin family of protease is also called the PACE family. Furin is transmembrane protein which is synthesized as a 100KDa protein. This protein undergoes catalytic cleavage in the Endoplasmic reticulum to become acxtive furin which is 94 KDa. The proprotein however remains bound to the protein and acts as the furin inhibitor. The polypeptide release then occurs in the trans golgi network where furin becomes active.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lethal effects of proteolytic processing==
&lt;!-- Vrunda --&gt;

Proteolytic processing not only helps in carrying out normal cellular processes but it also can cause processing of proteins to give lethal proteins. A classic example of proteolytic processing which develops lethal protein is development of Netherton syndrome . 
Netherton syndrome is a autosomal recessive congenital syndrome which causes ichthyosiform erythroderma caused by a mutation in the human SPINK5. Biochemical analysis of Netherton syndrome have shown an increase in the proteoytic processing of profilggrin into its constituent filaggrin monomers.
Defects in filaggrin processing cause congenital disorders like icthyosis. SPINK5 undergoes extreme proteolytic processing  furin is assumed to be involved in the proteolytic processing of SPINX5 however the exact extent of processing is yet to be deteremined.In the absence of serine protease inhibitor SPINK5 there is abnormal increase in the processing of profilaggrin resulting in the increased production of filaggarin monomers causing severly compromised epidermal barrier function.

== [[Special:Import]] ==

Why is this Special page not allowed to all users? I would like to use it, because I use the stuff and I cannot quickly import it. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 19:46, 23 February 2008 (UTC)
: I asked this about a year ago.  The Import tool is sort of in beta testing right now, and it still doesn't work perfectly.  But the real reason it's not generally available (or so I've been told) is because it chews up a lot of bandwidth on the servers.  But methinks the best way to get that tool in your hands is by making you an admin.  Shall I nominate you? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 22:18, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

::I'm don't know the exact reason why this wouldn't be available to all users, but there are a couple possible reasons why:
::#It does eat up a lot of bandwidth, as Jim mentioned. It has, therefore, been limited in software.
::#It has legal implications because improper use can create works which are not in compliance with the GFDL. This is, at least partially, because of the hard limits imposed in number #1. 
::#Because importing a page over an existing page would cause the original page to be overwritten, and histories merged. History mergers are currently only allowed by admins. History mergers cannot, currently, be undone.
::Maybe the case could be made that this should be opened up to more users, but considering the potential problems, and the bugginess that Jim mentioned, I think it's probably better to keep it for just admins for now. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:47, 25 February 2008 (UTC)

I used my bot to fix links on the entire Muggles Guide tonight, it was about 500 edits in the space of 10 minutes or less. I watched the RC list myself live, so the RC patrollers won't miss anything if you skip over that patch in the logs.

In retrospec, I probably should have given myself the botflag for the event, but I wasn't sure if that was something I should do without prior discussion, so i didnt.  Maybe for tasks like this in the future, giving the botflag temporarily to bot operators might be a good idea.--'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:51, 28 February 2008 (UTC)

:::Yes, I just talked to brion, briefly, and he mentioned that there was a limit of 5 edits per minute. Now, I'm not sure if that is for all edits, or just rollback edits.

=== Raise Edit Limits for Rollbackers ===

After the discussion above, I talked with some devs on IRC, and it turns out that  our rollbackers are limited to 5 edits per minute. Admins are exempt from all editing limits, so this isn't an issue for them. I'm also not entirely certain if the 5/minute limit is for all edits, or if it is just for rollbacks. Regardless, there is no reason why our rollbackers should be limited like this, especially when our vandals can easily circumvent an edit throttle by creating sock puppets. I propose, therefore, that we ask the devs to increase the edit limit of our rollbackers from 5/minute to something much more reasonable for vandal fighters. 20 per minute or so would be 1 edit every 3 seconds, which is pretty impressive by any standards, should be good enough. What do people think about this? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:02, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

:It would probably be applied through [[mw:Manual:$wgRateLimits|$wgRateLimits]] affecting all edits and moves, but admins and 'crats are spared this through [[mw:Manual:$wgRateLimitsExcludedGroups|$wgRateLimitsExcludedGroups]] - and we should add rollbackers to that. My local wiki has the default 'null' on all rate limits, but I'd guess that there would be a limit set in LocalSettings.php for Wikibooks and other WikiMedia projects. 5/min would basically require a script or at least a fast-keying mindless vandal, as I know I haven't exceeded 3/min in past I'm-a-robot editing efforts :-) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:16, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

:{{support}} - I'd say 20/min is plenty, or just remove the limit. OTOH, If a rollbacker is getting anywhere close to 20/min then they should be hollering for some backup cuz there's some blocking to do :) Still, I see no reason to limit our rollbackers like this.
:While we're at it (and I'm thinking about it), we might think about giving our patrollers the autopatrolled permission, as admins and bots currently have. If we trust them to mark pages as patrolled, I think we can trust them to not make garbage pages. This change would mean that all pages created by patrollers would be automatically marked as patrolled, as is currently done for admins and bots. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:21, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

::Just a point about the limit rate: 5/minute is equivalent to one edit every 12 seconds. IMHO, that's already beyond the bounds of sane, reliable manual page editing. It could only be achievable via a script. As noted above, I've managed 3/min or one edit per 20 seconds when doing mindless page or image tagging, and even that requires a modicum of mental participation to ensure that the page is suitable for the action being taken. What we're talking about here is dropping the limit completely for rollbackers who might be using scripts to automate some actions. Talk of 20/min limit rates, i.e. one edit per 3 seconds, is pointless here IMHO as it's probably faster than transaction speed unless your script is running on a computer inside WikiMedia's LAN. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:56, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

::::Just a note: I'm able to rollback much faster than that by opening new pages on each button hit (then closing them before they even load). Still couldn't get more than 12 or 13 a minute though. Also, we could ask for [[Special:Nuke]] to be enabled here as well... this rools back all of a users contribs with one click (and would have been handy yesterday). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:27, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

:::::I thought that extension wasn't ready for production use yet, but looking at the documentation... apparently it is. So yes, I'd support enabling the extension. It doesn't let admins do anything they can't do already, it just makes it easier to do. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:56, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

:::I think the rate limit is for rollbacks (there is a separate one for moves, for edits etc, I think). If that's the case, then we either need a very high rate limit on rollback (or none at all) to avoid just this sort of situation. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:59, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

::::We'll have to see what the dev's say, but AFAICT there are separate rate limits for ''edit'', ''move'' and ''mailpassword''; rollback would be an ''edit''. My point above was simply that beyond 5/min you might as well drop the rate limit for that group of users, as anything faster would be approaching transaction speed across the Internet anyway. It would be interesting to know why rollback is triggering this, however, because my reading of the doc for $wgRateLimits suggests that we must either have a small number of edits per a small number of seconds specified, or a rollback is doing quite a number of edits in a single transaction.

:::::In response to a few points made above, I've clocked my bot at just under 60 edits per minute (slightly more then 1 second between edits). This was done during a relative lull in activity, so the servers had some bandwidth to spare. I personally, without bot help, have pushed between 12-20 edits per minute for repetitive tasks, such as rolling back a large list of malicious edits, or copy+pasting templates on multiple pages. I won't say that it's common, and I also won't say it's reasonable, but it has happened. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:37, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

:Well today [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] hit the 20/min rollback rate limit, and was stopped. While 20/min seems like a lot, it really isn't considering that a) these are not normal edits, they're rollbacks and b) our rollbackers ''must'' be able to go at least as fast as the vandals. Even a single vandal can make enough edits that a rollbacker would hit the 20/min rate limit.

== New book: Prealgebra for Two-Year Colleges ==

I'm new to Wikibooks and I am starting a book called [[Prealgebra for Two-Year Colleges]].

I think it belongs on the [[Wikibooks:Mathematics_bookshelf]] under Basic Math, but I
don't know how to put it there.

I also uploaded two images

[[:Image:half.png]] and [[:Image:quarter.png]]

Now I realize that they probably belong in 
Prealgebra for Two-Year Colleges/half.png
and
Prealgebra for Two-Year Colleges/quarter.png
but I don't know how to move them there.
(I could upload them to Prealgebra for Two-Year Colleges/ but I don't know how
to delete the old images.)

I also don't know how to delete my scratch pages, such as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Dr.enh/Prealgebra for Two-Year Colleges]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Thanks for your help!

Dear community, I can't find anything if I search for Labskaus in the cookbook of Wikibooks.
On the German mainpage i find it, though. [Why isn't it linked?/Why isn't this linked to?/Why aren't you linked?]

Thanks and greeting from Thomas Wagner

: I suspect this might be the dish that originates in Liverpool called Scouse whose name originated from Labskaus (not certain of the spelling).  Indeed you'll see a reference to it on [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_the_United_Kingdom]] although the page hasn't been created which is suprising considering that the dish is so popular and so easy to make.  Maybe one of our German speaking editors would like to copy it over to our Cookbook and add an inter-wiki language link. --[[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:13, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

      <comment>/* The Hatch */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Hatch ==

[[Image:Teardrop_hatch.jpg|thumb|The Hatch]]

For some reason, the construction of the hatch evokes fear in a lot of new builders. I have read builders delaying the hatch until the very end of their build.  There is a point to their fear. The hatch is constructed by bending luan over a wooden frame, and one problem with that is a problem called &quot;bow-back&quot;.  

Bow-back is where the force of the bent luan pulls the whole hatch out of shape and causes a gap at the bottom.  This is due to builders attempting to build the hatch with contoured ribs, so that the hatch is thin (the ribs being 1.5&quot; - 2&quot; wide).  If the ribs can not withstand the force of the luan bent around them, the ribs bend. Many builders make a second hatch after the first one failed.

For our simple teardrop, we will avoid the entire bow-back issue by keeping the back edge of the rib straight. With a straight edge there is no possibility of bow back (via simple engineering mechanics). It behaves like a form of triangulation.  The downside is that, as you can see, the ribs are rather bulky.  The upside is that they are so strong you only need two, one on each end.

== Making a Cardboard Hatch Rib Template ==
[[Image:Teardrop_hatch_template.jpg|thumb|left|Making a cardboard hatch template for the ribs.]]
First you need to make a cardboard pattern for the end ribs. The shape is too complex to try to measure out, it is easier to try, cut, and fit the pattern (see image for reference):
# Get a piece of cardboard.
# Trace the curve of the sidewall for the length of the opening onto the cardboard and cut it out.
# Hold the cardboard up to the sidewall and mark and trim to the angles of the floor and the angle of the spar at the top of opening for the basic rib length.
# Cut a straight back on the rib template allowing for a hatch spar at the bottom and at the top (about 2&quot; from the curve on the angled lines).
# The end result should look like this.

[[Image:Teardrop_hatchrib_section.jpg|thumb|right|Cross-section: Correct fit of rib to floor and body spar at top of opening.]]
Check the template on both sides of the hatch opening to make sure all the angles and edges fit well. It doesn't have to be perfect. You should be able to pivot it from the top outside corner of the template (from where the hinge will be on the body) without any interference on the bottom with the floor. The bottom of the rib should come to rest on the floor with curve remaining flush with the sidewall all the way to the top. With the rib resting on the floor and the template curve flush with the curve of the sidewall, the top of the template should only have about a 1/8&quot; gap between it and the body spar at the top. If the template works for one side but not the other, then simply make a second template for the other side.

[[Image:Info icon.svg|30px|left]] The Luan will overlap the hatch frame on both sides and the bottom. This overlap will be a surface for weather stripping and will contact the edges of the sidewalls and the end of the wood bed.  The luan on the top will be cut flush with the hatch frame.

You can then use the template(s) to cut out 2 ribs from the same 3/4&quot; plywood material as the sidewalls.  The next step is to attach four 2&quot;x2&quot; spars horizontally between the ribs (2 on the top and bottom and 2 evenly spaced in the middle) to form the complete hatch frame. Spar length should be chosen so that there is about 3/8&quot; clearance between the outside of the end ribs and the inside of the teardrop sidewalls. Screw and polyurethane glue these items together. 

[[Image:Teardrop_inside_picture_of_hatch.jpg|thumb|right|Inside view showing hatch.]]
With the glue still wet, position the frame inside the teardrop hatch opening and use long wood screws to screw through the ribs from the inside out into the teardrop sidewalls to hold the frame square in place while the glue dries (Be careful not to screw all the way through the outside teardrop sidewall!). The frame should be positioned so there is equal distance on both sides between the hatch end ribs and sidewalls; and the top of the hatch frame is in the position required for fastening the hatch hinge (i.e. the gap is about 1/8&quot; at top).

[[Image:Teardrop_bare_body.jpg|thumb|left|Basic construction finished on hatch and body]]
After the hatch frame dries overnight, you can cut a piece of luan so that extends from the bottom of the wooden bed (overlapped) to the top of the hatch frame flush with the top edge of the hatch frame spar (and there should be about 1/8&quot; inch gap between the top spar of the hatch frame and the teardrop body spar which is at the top of the hatch opening.).  As was done with the luan roofing allow the luan to completely overlap the sidewalls to be trimmed flush later.

With the hatch frame still held in place by temporary screws, you can then glue and screw the luan skin over the back of the hatch frame while it is positioned in the teardrop hatch opening on the trailer.

The next step is to use the router again with the laminate trim bit to trim the overlapped luan of the hatch to the teardrop exterior sidewalls.  The hatch construction is complete and can be freed from its temporary screws after the glue dries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hatch Hinge ==
[[Image:Teardrop_plastic_piano_hinge.jpg|left|thumb|Plastic Piano Hinge]]
For our simple teardrop we will use a novel hinge. The hinge is called a &quot;Harsh-Environment Plastic Piano Hinge&quot; and is available from McMaster-Carr on the web.  This is a very durable 2&quot; wide hinge that is waterproof and can be fastened simply by driving wood screws through it (I used the same screws as for securing the luan).  The process is simple enough:
* Obtain 2 pieces of 3/4&quot; x 1/8&quot; x 48&quot; aluminum and drill holes every 6 inches for the wood screws.
* Position the hatch in the desire location.
* Place the plastic piano hinge in place.
* Place the aluminum strips in place and drive wood screws through the plastic hinge into the body and hatch.
* Caulk around edges.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Alternative splicing: Biological function ==


Alternative splicing is the process in which the primary transcript of a gene is reorganized to produce a different protein than the primary transcript.  By manipulating of the exons, the sequence of the amino acids produced from the mRNA is affected, resulting in a different protein sequence, and protein structure.[[http://www.rnajournal.org/cgi/content/full/13/8/1155]]  This can have a drastic effect on the protein that is produced.  Alternative splicing has been observed as a mechanism to produce tissue specific proteins from a signe gene.  Depending on the tissue different proteins can be produced in different tissues from a single gene.  This process can be thought of a multiplication process that increases the possible proteins that are produced from a single gene.

[[Image:DNA_alternative_splicing.gif|right|thumb|350px|General Overview http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/DNA_alternative_splicing.gif]]

Alternative Splicing is a major source of protein diversity in living organisms.  It has been estimated that at least 30% of all genes in the human genome are alternatively spliced and this number continues to expand.  It was originally thought that the number of alternatively spliced genes accounted for only 5% of proteins in humans.  With the unveiling of the human genome it was revealed that the human genome contains less than 30,000 genes[[http://www.exonhit.com/index.php?page=59]].  This could potentially account for the huge gap between the number of genes and the proteome.

It has been suggested that alternative splicing is the source of higher level complexity in eukaryotes[[http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v30/n1/abs/ng803.html;jsessionid=BF0AED8347574D063F5E347EC693AE83]].  This idea is based on the thought that more complex organisms will alternatively splice their genes more often to obtain more possible mRNA sequences.  However evidence shows that the level of alternative splicing between different complexities of organisms is not significant.   Providing evidence of the contrary.  This study was done using ESTs (expressed sequence tags *link to EST page*).  As more EST studies are done, it has become apparent that there is a greater number of alternatively spliced genes than previously thought.  ESTs were compared to mRNA sequences using BLAST.



== Examples of Alternative Splicing ==


Alternative splicing has been implicated in several diseases.  An example of a disease that plays a role in alternative splicing is Rett syndrome.  This disease is found primarily in girls and is characterized by problems in forming connections between neurons, or synapses[[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/rett/detail_rett.htm#109713277]].  It is believed that the gene MECP2 produces a protein that regulates alternative splicing of some proteins.  When this gene is disrupted, transcripts of other genes that would normally be spliced by MECP2 are not spliced, leading to Rett the phenotype of the syndrome.




== Splicing Mechanism ==


Splicing occurs through the mechanism of the Spliceosome.  The spliceosome consists of a number of proteins and snRNA components.  snRNAs U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U6[[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TCY-45FYM7X-F&amp;_user=47004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=47004&amp;md5=eea15989e03f8b963bdc33384a4ef93b]].  These snRNAs recognize the splice sites and then recruit other proteins that connect the splice sites.  These splice sites are then brought together through the interaction of these proteins which form the spliceosome.  Once the spliceosome has formed, the sites are cleaved to bring the correct exons (or introns) together. 

[[Image:Ppy-tract-2g4b.png|right|thumb|250px|spliceosome complex http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Ppy-tract-2g4b.png
]]




There are 4 common types of alternative splicing, they are as follows:

*Alternative promoter selection: A different promoter is used for different splice variants.  This results in a different start of the mRNA transcript.

*Alternative selection of cleavage/polyadenylation sites:  Different exons are spliced based on recognition of different cleavage or polyadenylation sites, entire exons can be skipped.  Results in a different exon at the 3’ end of the transcript.

*Intron retaining: Introns are used as coding regions.  A sequence that is normally considered an Intron is retained in the final transcript that serves as a template for translation.
*Exon cassette:  Entire exons can be skipped in the middle of the protein, resulting in a different transcript

]]




== The Growing Need for Protein Identification: ==


	Proteins are the basic unit of structure and function within living systems.  Consequently the field of proteomics has taken on added significance in the modern study of biology.  The genomic revolution, which culminated in the sequencing of many genomes, has generated a tremendous amount of data.  The field of proteomics [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics]]  has unfortunately been lagging behind, resulting in a disconnect between genomic information and observable phenotypes.  Originally, proteins and protein dependent pathways were studied individually.  Recently an emphasis on systems biology has lead to changes in this methodology.  Entire cells are being characterized with high throughput techniques.
 
[[Image:Protein pattern analyzer.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Shotgun protein sequencing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Protein_pattern_analyzer.jpg]]

	Mass spectroscopy has become the golden standard of protein identification ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spec]]) [[http://www.eurekalert.org/features/doe/2001-06/drnl-pib061902.php]].  Briefly, proteins are broken down into peptides, suspended into a gas phase by one of a various number of methods, ionized, and sent through a detector which can determine the mass to charge ratio of various peptides.  Mass spectroscopy can be easily automated and combined with other forms of protein separation, making it an ideal candidate for high throughput analysis.  In addition, thousands of peptides can be identified from a single source at one time, making this technique much more applicable to systems biology then older techniques such as Edman degradation.   Mass spectroscopy can also be used to identify single proteins of interest that have been isolated using other techniques, such as chromatography.
 
[[Image:Mass spectrometer schematics.png|right|thumb|250px|Mass Spectroscopy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Mass_spectrometer_schematics.png]]

== Splicing and Protein Identification ==

	A major drawback of mass spec analysis, and even identification by Edman degredation, is that proteins must be digested into peptides before identification.  Often for use with shotgun sequencing 
[[http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/ancham/2008/80/i06/html/ac701697w.html]], proteins are digested before any form of isolation process is done.  In order to confirm identifications protein databases are searched in order to match unique peptides to entire proteins.  This process is made more complicated by the immense level of sequence homology shared by peptides produced by alternative splicing. [[http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/4/10/1419]].  These proteins, although sharing similar primary structures may have very different or even antagonist functions, making their identification critical from a biological perspective.  What is more, the level of alternative splicing that occurs is not well characterized so it is not even well known which proteins cannot be unambiguously identified.  These problems will likely remain until alternative splicing is well documented or can be predicted efficiently computationally.
 


== Effects to analyze alternative splicing: ==

	In vivo analysis is currently the most accurate way to identify alternative splicing, either at the transcript, or in some cases at the protein level.  Numerous databases exist that document proteins known to undergo alternative splicing, including the Alternative Splicing Database [[http://hazelton.lbl.gov/~teplitski/alt/]].  and the Alternative Splicing and Transcript Diversity database [[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/asd/]].  Well these are good references, as discussed above, the estimates of even the amount of alternative splicing present in eukaryotic organisms vary dramatically.  There is therefore, very little information on how complete these databases are.  
	
Steps have also been taken to computationally predict alternative splicing [[http://bfgp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/5/1/46]].  Generally these algorithms combine gene finding approaches with experimental data.  Splice sites are recognized and rated in efficiency based on consensus sequences.  Sequences are then matched to known expressed sequence tags to make predictions.   Tools such as BLAT, Spidey, and SIM4 can be adapted for these processes.  Most modern computational tools encounter difficulty in comparing genomic data to sequences as small and variable as splice sites.  False positives and negatives are fairly common [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WSN-41T1FBT-2&amp;_user=47004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=47004&amp;md5=d3b999a5147780e759f2e9aa7b8c47e7]]).  New approaches are still being developed.

There are many ways to cover the seams in the luan skin on the teardrop body.  Builders use aluminum, wood, and RV trim bought commercially.

However, for our simple teardrop trailer we will create a moulding over the seam with Bondo.  Step one is to apply masking tape on either side of the seam.  Once that is done, mix some bondo according to the directions and apply a thick layer (about 1/8&quot; thick) across the seam and over the edges of the masking tape.  

With this technique, you don't have to worry about doing it all at one time. In fact its better not to try because you need to pull the masking tape '''prior''' to the bondo starting to cure.  So as soon as you are done applying it, start pulling the tape. If the Bondo starts to cure before you pull the tape, chunks of bondo may come off the edges.

When you pull the tape it will leave the nice straight edge.  You can continue on with masking tape and more Bondo as required to cover the entire seam.  After you are finished, let the Bondo fully cure.  You can then carefully sand the bondo smooth so that it looks like a moulding.  You can try painting it if you like but try it on a test piece first.  Its really better just to leave it plain.  Later you will apply urethane varnish over the trailer and over the Bondo seams.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As with location in real estate, a star's mass is everything. In fact, aside from the exact chemical composition or the gravitational effects of companion stars, mass is the factor that determines the fate of a star. Even chemical composition is fairly unimportant at this stage of the universe, because the vast majority of stars are still primarily hydrogen and helium. The initial mass of a star sets the various parameters of a specific star's lifetime far more rigidly than any factor in the life of a biological organism such as a person. Mass determines the temperature, physical size and span of life, and the exact progression from one stage to the next. Two stars with the same initial mass will follow the same path through '''life''' and are in effect '''identical twins''' in the absence of any disturbing factor such as a companion star.

Unlike smaller stars, the largest stars have even more spectacular ends. The life track of a high mass star is similar to that of a low mass star like the Sun, except shorter and more violent. High mass stars effectively '''Live hard and die young.''' Near the end of their short lives, they puff up into a giant red star, although in this case a '''supergiant,''' and then they collapse. 

A giant star consumes its nuclear energy more quickly than smaller stars, as one after another layer of core develops, where it fuses lighter elements into heavier elements. All of those reactions produce more energy than they consume. No star can go further in fusing elements than the creation of iron without producing a net loss of energy from the star.

The iron core shrinks, and one after another layer of core falls upon it. The iron core becomes extremely hot and unstable. Implosion is imminent once the star's temperature reaches 10 billion Kelvin. The star suddenly explodes releasing an extreme amount of energy in a very brief period of time as a supernova.

You don't want to be near a supernova; if you were in a pleasant zone near a star about to erupt as a supernova, you would be incinerated when the radiation from the supernova reached you. If one of the nearer stars like Alpha Centauri, Sirius, or Altair were to go supernova, the intense radiation would be deadly, but no nearby star is going to go supernova. That will happen to a giant like Betelgeuse, Deneb, or Antares, each of which is far enough away that the radiation is not a hazard.

While these hypothetical observers near a supernova find them unpleasant, astronomers on Earth -- a safe distance away -- find them very useful. There is a certain type of supernova called type Ia that is very useful for measuring distances. The nice thing about type Ia supernova is that they all have the same absolute brightness. Because they all have the same absolute brightness, they are called standard candles. The differences in apparent brightness of one type Ia supernova from another are entirely due to their different distances from Earth. The most popular theory is that a white dwarf accumulates material from a companion star, slowly growing towards the Chandrasekhar limit mass, until it has just barely enough -- about 1.38 solar masses -- to trigger an explosion. It's still a mystery as to what triggers the explosion and what happens during the explosion,
but because it occurs at the same mass for all Ia supernova,
all Ia supernova produce the same brightness. The differences in apparent brightness of Ia supernova are entirely due to their different distances from Earth. Astronomers measure the apparent brightness of a supernova as seen from Earth, and combine this with the known absolute brightness of all Ia supernova (also taking Doppler shift into account), to find the distance of the supernova from Earth -- and, by implication, the distance to the entire galaxy containing that supernova. The distances measured this way have led to a greater mystery discussed in [[General Astronomy/Current Unsolved Mysteries]].

If the core ends up with a mass more than 1.44 times that our Sun (known as the '''Chandrasekhar Limit'''), not even quantum mechanical laws can prevent a massive star from compacting further.

For a remnant core between about 1.44 and 2 times the Sun's mass, the force of gravity pushes negative electrons into the positive protons, producing neutrons that occupy less space than their original particles and the core shrinks to what is essentially one large neutron. This '''neutron''' has more mass than our Sun but is about the size of a city on Earth, perhaps 20 kilometers across. It has become a '''neutron star.''' A teaspoon of neutron star material would weight about a billion tons on Earth.

The status of a remnant core between 2 and 3 times the mass of the Sun is not entirely clear, as it could become a neutron star, or perhaps an even smaller '''quark star''' which has only been theorized, or a '''black hole.'''

If the remnant core has more than 3 times the mass of our Sun, the gravitational field at its surface is not only large, but infinite. Nothing that gets too close to this object can escape. In fact, in theory no force of the Universe is strong enough to pull an object away that has wandered too close to a black hole. This distance away from the black hole is called the Event Horizon, or the surface of the Schwartzchild Sphere. Nothing that falls through the Event Horizon can escape, as escape velocity is greater than the speed of light. Hence not even light can escape, and the object appears completely black, hence the name, '''black hole.'''

A typical black hole with a mass three times that of the Sun would be roughly 18 kilometers across. Strictly speaking, this is the diameter of the Schwartzchild Sphere which is the '''visible''' surface of the black hole. However, the total mass of a black hole is considered to be  concentrated into a single point with zero volume. Thus it is meaningless to speak of how much a '''tablespoon''' of black hole material would weigh. Effectively, the gravitational force and density at the black hole singularity are infinite.

We have not observed black holes directly (for obvious reasons), but we have ample evidence of their existence by the detection of radiation from objects falling into black holes, and in the gravitational effects they have on other bodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Basically, the greater a star's mass, the greater the pressure in its core (caused by gravity) and the higher the internal temperature. High temperatures force a greater consumption of the available nuclear fuel. The greater the consumption of fuel, the hotter and brighter the star, and the shorter its lifetime.

Stars that are mid-range in mass, such as our Sun, typically live a few billion years (about 10 for the Sun). Smaller stars live much longer, perhaps several hundred billion years. The universe is still too young to have any of the oldest of the smallest stars to have consumed all their fuel. Their lives are longer than that of the universe to date. 

But a middle-sized star such as the Sun cannot last as long as the universe has existed. Our sun has existed less than a half the time since the Big Bang (about 13-14 billion years ago). Since the Sun is thought to be typical, we can use it as an example for studying similar stars. 

A star like the sun first fuses hydrogen (as it does now) into helium thereby releasing energy, that ultimately leaves the Sun as sunlight. When the Sun is about twice as old as it now is, it will no longer have enough hydrogen in its core to sustain stable hydrogen fusion. The resulting slow down in fusion will result in less outward pressure, to withstand the inward pull of gravity. As a result, the star will contract, compressing the core, and causing its temperature to rise.

The higher temperatures in the sun's core will allow it to fuse helium into heavier elements, but at the same time, the sun's outer layers will expand and cool. As a result it will turn red, making it a red giant. 

For our Sun, this stage lasts only a few tens to a few hundreds of millions of years, and another collapse ensues. This time the core is compressed and heated further, but it has run out of hydrogen and helium fuel in its core and is in essence, a hot, dying ember composed largely of carbon called a white dwarf. 

A white dwarf is a strange beast, having the mass about the same as the Sun, yet is only about as large as the Earth. At this point, the white dwarf is so tightly packed that a teaspoon of its matter would weigh about 2 tons on Earth! In fact, it is no longer even '''normal''' matter that obeys the laws of physics we are used to. Instead, it obeys quantum mechanical laws that prevent it from collapsing any further.

At the same time the white dwarf is formed from the leftover core of the star, the outer layers of the red giant are blown off into space to form a '''planetary nebula'''. The white dwarf remnant simply cools, slowly changing from white hot through the range of colors eventually ending, after tens of billions of years, as a cold black dwarf.

The upper limit for the mass of a white dwarf is about 1.44 times the mass of the Sun. So any star whose core ends up with a mass of more than 1.44 solar masses at the end of its life (after the outer layers have been blown off into a planetary nebula) cannot form a white dwarf, but ends up in an even more bizarre state. This is called the '''Chandrasekhar Limit.'''

More massive stars have even wilder lives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''failure mode''' is the manner in which a system fails, or the manner by which a failure is ''observed''. So, it is not the same as the cause of the failure, but it describes the way a failure occurs. There are three kinds of failure modes: conceptual, technological and organizational. This text deals with technological failure modes only, and concentrates on embedded control systems. This chapter is very relevant for the embedded systems designer because such systems often work without human supervision and at places where human correction of the failure are expensive to execute. Therefore, the designers should pay extra attention to what could go wrong in their system (i.e., ''to identify'' its failure modes) and [[w:risk assessment|to assess the risk]] of each failure (i.e., ''to analyse'' the consequences of each failure mode). It is obvious that it is way better ''to avoid'' failures than ''to repair'' them, and that ''simple'' designs are easier in this respect than complex systems; however, making simple designs is still a form of engineering art, and not yet a structured engineering discipline. Also keep in mind that many failures will not be detected by testing.


== Introduction ==
Technological failure modes in embedded systems can be divided into two main groups: hardware failure modes and software failure modes; the toughest failures to prevent however, are those caused by subtle interactions between hardware and software.


'''Some examples of software failure modes are:'''
*[[w:Buffer overrun|Buffer overflow]]: the computer memory is smaller than the programmer expected, so during operation of the embedded system, one of the programs in the system is accessing wrong parts of the computer's memory.
*[[w:Dangling pointer|Dangling pointers]]: this error is common in [[w:Type safety|non-safe programming languages]] in which the human programmer is responsible for making sure that every pointer points to the right memory location at all times.

'''Some examples of hardware failure modes:'''
*Electrical failure: short-circuiting, too high voltage/current
*Mechanical failure: jamming of a valve
*Temperature effects: deformation of components
*Material failure: corrosion

It is important to note again that these examples are only consequences and not causes!


'''Some examples of software failure causes are:'''
*[[w:Deadlock|Deadlock]]: two or more processes are each waiting for the other to finish, so none of the processes ever finish.
*[[w:Resource starvation|Resource starvation]]: a process doesn't get the resources it needs, so it can never finish. 
*Too small memory 
*Noise
*Shared interfaces with other systems


'''Some examples of hardware failure causes:'''
*[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Hostile Environment|Hostile environments]]: any factor which prevents a system from functioning correctly.
*Badly calibrated sensors
*Choosing the wrong dimensions
*Manufacturing/assembly process deficiencies


Some failures are not caused by hardware or software, but are caused on the system level.

*Operational failure: human operators make mistakes too. The [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Categories of system complexity#Distributed Hardware — Distributed Control | Three Mile Island accident]] is a fine example of an operational failure.

== Overview ==

Due to the increasing capabilities and functionality of embedded systems, it is difficult to prevent or sometimes even detect failure modes. One way to ensure reliability is extensive testing using techniques such as [[w:Reliable system design|probabilistic reliability modeling]]. One of the problems with these techniques is that they are only used in the late stage of development. It is better to design quality and reliability in, in the early stages of development.


To detect failures in the design process it is important to perform different tests on the system (especially on the software) at the beginning of the design. But tests are often expensive and they also should provide the correct information: the usability of test results depend on the quality of the test. So it is not always easy to come up with an appropriate test.

[[w:Dynamic program analysis|Dynamic analysis]] in the software world is the testing and evaluation of software by executing programs on a processor. An example of a dynamic analysis on hardware could be vibration and [[w:Stress_analysis|stress analysis]].

These days engineers have developed a [[w:Static code analysis|static analysis]] for software, which is test-free: no specific tests need to be developed and the software can be checked for flaws without having to execute the program.


There are a number of possibilities to reduce the chance of failure occurrences. But some failures need to be treated more urgent than others. At first one should look at the frequency with which a systems fails, this is called the [[w:Failure rate|failure rate]] of a system. It is desired that systems don’t fail, but if a failure is very rare it is often not necessary to take steps.

An other aspect of a failure mode is its severity. An electrical appliance that short-circuits can be life threatening, whereas the jamming of a valve in vending machine is less life threatening.


Despite all the effort an engineer can put into designing a system that doesn’t fail, failures will always occur. For example: an average cell phone these days contains as much as 2 million lines of software code. It is very likely that in one of those lines a fault is introduced. Systems are getting even more complex. For instance: that same cell phone is expected to have as much as 10 million lines of code in 10 years. Therefore a design should be more [[w: Robust |robust]].[http://www.npd-solutions.com/robust.html] When the system detects something goes wrong it can signal this and go into a [[w:safe mode|safe mode]] until the user takes appropriate actions. Take for example again the jamming of a valve of the vending machine: the machine can light all its leds to signal something is wrong and cease providing soda until it is repaired.

Failures are also to be expected when separate systems have to work together, for instance: the different robots in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/RoboCup RoboCup]. An other example of such a complex system are the robots of professor James McLurkin of MIT who have to perform the Star Wars theme tune together, but every robot can only play some notes. So they have to cooperate in order to play the entire theme correctly.[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3204/03.html]


The cost of designing embedded control systems tends to increase exponentially with increasing reliability: removing X% of the faults in a system will not necessarily improve the reliability by X% ([http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~farn/courses/SE/ch3.ppt a study] at [[w:IBM|IBM]] proved that with removing 60% of the errors, only 3% reliability was added). In some cases, it may therefore be more cost effective to not investigate in more trustworthy systems but to pay the failure costs. However one has to keep in mind that this strategy can lead to a bad name of the company for selling systems that can not be trusted. There is always a trade-off between different [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Characteristics_and_design_criteria design criteria], depending on the system. Off course, [[w:Safety-critical_system|critical systems]] should always be designed as reliable as possible.


This all stresses out how important it is to rule out failures in the design process. Fortunately, engineers have developed some procedures to do this systematically. All the following procedures can be used in what is called [[w:safety engineering|safety engineering]]. The study of failures is an important aspect of designing embedded control systems as it ''can'' safe time, money and even lives, and helps with eventual future modification of a system.

There are [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Learning_from_failure many examples] of real-time disasters, due to incomplete failure testing.

== Failure prevention ==

===&lt;u&gt;Safety factors&lt;/u&gt;===
[[w:Factor_of_safety|Safety factors]] are used to ensure that a design will work, and to protect it against failures. However, large safety factors don’t always give rise to a reliable system. Often they lead to overdesigned systems, which are more expensive and can take a longer time to manufacture/assemble.

===&lt;u&gt;Failure mode and effects analysis&lt;/u&gt;===
[[File:FMEA.png|300px|right]]
In order to reduce (or better prevent) the failure chance of a system, engineers have developed a technique called “[[w:Failure mode and effects analysis|Failure Mode and Effects Analysis]]” (FMEA). This is a tool to identify potential or actual failure modes in a system and to choose the proper corrective action, when designing. FMEA provides an analytical approach to determine which risk has the greatest concern, and therefore an action is needed to prevent a problem before it arises. The development of these specifications will ensure a system that will meet the defined requirements.

It is also possible to identify critical or important design/process characteristics that require special controls to prevent or detect failure modes. A crucial step is anticipating what might go wrong with a product. While anticipating every failure mode is not possible, a development team should formulate an extensive list of potential failure modes as completely as possible. 
FMEA starts at the beginning of a design, and is maintained and adapted through the entire [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Embedded_design_process design process]. This way it is possible to design out failures. This way FMEA contains important information for use in future system improvements.

====Using FMEA when designing====
The process for conducting an FMEA is straightforward. It is developed in 3 main steps, in which appropriate actions need to be undertaken. But before starting with a FMEA, it is important to do some pre-work to make sure the robustness and past history are included in the analysis. It is important to consider both intentional and unintentional uses! Unintentional uses are a form of [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Hostile Environment|hostile environments]].

*Step 1: Determine the severity number
Determine all failure modes based on the functional requirements and their effects as perceived by the user.
Each effect is given a '''severity number'''(SEV) from 1(no danger) to 10(important). If the severity of an effect has a number 9 or 10, actions are considered to change the design by eliminating the failure mode, if possible, or protecting the user from the effect.

*Step 2: Determine the probability number
In this step it is necessary to look at the cause of a failure and how many times it occurs.
A failure mode is given a '''probability number'''(OCCUR), again from 1 to 10. Actions need to be determined if the occurrence is high (meaning &gt;4 for non safety failure modes and &gt;1 when the severity-number from step 1 is 9 or 10). 

''TIP: The probability number can also be used after implementation in a table of failures to give the operator a first guess of the origin of problems of frequent occurence.''

*Step 3: Determine the detection number
When appropriate actions are determined, it is necessary to test their efficiency. Also a design verification is needed. The proper inspection methods needs to be chosen. 
Each combination from the previous 2 steps, receives a '''detection number'''(DETEC). This number represents the ability of planned tests and inspections at removing defects or detecting failure modes.

After these 3 basic steps, Risk Priority Numbers (RPN) are calculated.

====Risk Priority Numbers====
RPN do not play an important part in the choice of an action against failure modes. They are more threshold values in the evaluation of these actions.

&lt;math&gt;RPN=SEV * OCCUR * DETEC&lt;/math&gt;

The failure modes that have the highest RPN should be given the highest priority for corrective action.

After these values are allocated, recommended actions with targets, responsibility and dates of implementation are noted. 
Once the actions have been implemented in the design/process, the new RPN should be checked, to confirm the improvements. Whenever a design or a process changes, a FMEA should be updated.

A few logical but important thoughts come to mind:
*Try to eliminate the failure mode (some failures are more preventable than others)
*Minimize the severity of the failure
*Reduce the occurrence of the failure mode
*Improve the detection (!)

===&lt;u&gt;Anticipatory Failure Determination&lt;/u&gt;===
Like FMEA, ''Anticipatory failure determination'' (AFD) has the objective of identifying and preventing possible failures.[http://www.npd-solutions.com/afd.html] The approach of AFD however is just the inverse of that of FMEA. Rather than searching for causes of failure modes, AFD asks developers to view at the failure of interest as an intended consequence and to look for ways to make sure that this failure always happens reliably. In this way, AFD is a complementary method to FMEA. Using FMEA the failures with the highest Risk Priority Number can be found and afterward redesigned using the AFD method.

AFD is more suited for complex failure analysis than FMEA. FMEA relies on the identification of failures and their causes based on application or personal experience of others. However the problem with this approach is “the denial phenomenon”. If one tries to consider what can go wrong with a functioning system, there is the tendency to resist thinking about unpleasant possibilities that might occur unless they actually have been experienced before. Sometimes people even deny a problem because one would not admit having made mistakes in the design.
By reversing the problem, AFD overcomes this “denial phenomenon” and opens up creative insights into analysis of failures.

====AFD-process====
*Step 1: Formulation or inversion of the problem
Instead of thinking about possible causes for a failure, an engineer should think about how to make that failure happen, under the same environmental conditions that made the failure happen. First identification of these conditions is needed. After that one should think about the scenario that gives rise to the failure and try to localize it.

*Step 2: Search for solutions or methods to produce the failure
The thought process is now shifted to finding the mechanism or means to produce the examined failure. Function analysis can be useful to identify a series of functions or actions involved in the failure scenario.

*Step 3: Verify that resources are available to cause the failures
There are seven potential categories of resources: substances, field effects, space available, time, object structure, system functions and other data on the system. For each of the potential solutions to cause a failure, it is necessary to check if the required resources are available to support this solution.

===&lt;u&gt;Fault tree Analysis&lt;/u&gt;===
[[w:Fault tree analysis|Fault tree analysis]] (FTA) is a third form of failure analysis in which an undesired state of a system is analyzed using [[w:boolean logic|boolean logic]] to combine a series of lower-level events. FTA takes place after implementation in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Embedded_design_process design process] i.e. at testing level, but if all these fault trees are collected and maintained well they can be a useful aid at operating level too if failure nevertheless occur. This analysis method is mainly used in the field of [[w:Safety_engineering |safety engineering]].

FTA analysis involves 5 steps:
* Step 1: Define the undesired event to study
Definition of the undesired event can be very hard to catch, although some of the events are very easy and obvious to observe. An engineer with a wide knowledge of the design of the system or a system analyst with an engineering background is the best person who can help define and number the undesired events. Undesired events are used then to make the FTA, ''one event for one FTA''.
* Step 2: Obtain an understanding of the system
Once the undesired event is selected, all causes with probabilities of affecting the undesired event are studied and analyzed. Getting exact numbers for the probabilities leading to the event is usually impossible for the reason that it may be very costly and time consuming to do so. &lt;br /&gt;System designers have full knowledge of the system and this knowledge is very important for not missing any cause affecting the undesired event. For the selected event all causes are then numbered and sequenced in the order of occurrence.
* Step 3: Construct the fault tree
After selecting the undesired event and analyzed the system so that we know all the causing effects and if possible their probabilities we can now construct the fault tree. Fault tree is based on AND and OR gates which define the major characteristics of the fault tree.
* Step 4: Evaluate the fault tree
Analyze the tree for any possible improvement or in other words study the [[w: Risk_management| risk management]] and find ways for system improvement. In short, in this step we identify all possible hazards affecting in a direct or indirect way the system.
* Step 5: Control the hazards identified
This step is very specific and differs largely from one system to another, but the main point will always be that after identifying the hazards all possible methods are pursued to decrease the probability of occurrence.

Because assembling a FTA can be a costly and cumbersome experience, the perfect method is to consider subsystems and integrate them afterwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;Closures as Objects&lt;/big&gt;'''

From ''Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs'':

    (define (account amount)
        (define (deposit d) (set! amount (+ amount d)))
        (define (withdraw w) (set! amount (- amount w)))
        (lambda (msg arg)
            (cond
                ((eq msg 'withdraw) (withdraw arg))
                ((eq msg 'deposit) (deposit arg))
                (else (error &quot;unknown message: &quot; msg))
                )
            )
        )

Now we can treat ''account'' as a constructor:

    (define a (account 100))
    (a'withdraw 10)
    (a'deposit 20)

The closure that translates messages to function calls is a hack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;Environments as Objects&lt;/big&gt;'''

If you are going to use an existing 'object' as an 'Object',
then environments are a better choice.

In Scheme, environments are first-class 'objects'.

   (define (account amount)
       (define (deposit d) (set! amount (+ amount d)))
       (define (withdraw w) (set! amount (- amount w)))
       (procedure-environment (lambda () 1))
       )

We need the 'dot' operator:

    (define (dot obj message)
        (eval message obj)
        )

Now, our account looks like:

    (define a (account 100))
    ((dot a 'withdraw) 10)
    ((dot a 'deposit) 20)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;Inheritance via Concatenation&lt;/big&gt;'''

The idea is from Antero Taivalsaari.

Concatenate the environment of the subclass and
the superclass.

Now, looking up a component of a superclass is exactly
the same process as looking up a component of the
subclass.

    class g
        {
        var x = 2;
        function me(&quot;I'm g&quot;);
        }
    
    class f extends g
        {
        var y = 4;
        function me(&quot;I'm f&quot;);
        }

Make some objects:

    var gobj = new g;
    var fobj = new f;

''gobj'''s environment:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! variable
! value
|- 
| ''x''
| 2
|-
| me
| lambda() { &quot;I'm g&quot;; }
|}


''fobj'''s environment:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! variable
! value
|- 
| ''y''
| 4
|-
| ''me''
| lambda() { &quot;I'm f&quot;; }
|-
| ''x''
| 3
|-
| ''me''
| lambda() { &quot;I'm g&quot;; }

|}

Three of the twelve modes of inheritance from:

The others are obscure or considered ''not a very good idea''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;Inheritance Implementation Strategies&lt;/big&gt;'''

So how to implement the big three via concatenation inheritance?

For simplicity, let's assume a sequential search of the environment
table when trying to resolve a variable.

Will use Sway syntax from here on out.

The quintessential class/constructor:

    function node(item,next)
        {
        this;
        }

Making nodes:

    var items = node(1,node(2,node(3,:null)));

Or shorthand:
    
    var # = node;
    var items = right(1 # 2 # 3 # :null);

Using nodes:

    while (items != :null)
        {
        inspect(items . item);
        items = items . next;
        }

The function [[../right|''right'']] can be written in Sway using reflection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;Extension Inheritance&lt;/big&gt;'''

Extension inheritance: whereby the subclass adds features not found 
in the superclass.

    function super(a)
        {
        var b = a + 1 * (a - 1);
        this;
        }
    
    function sub()
        {
        var c = 3;
        extends(super(c * c));
        }

Now we make a ''sub'' object:

    var s = sub();
    inspect(s . b);

The output is:

    s . b is 80

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;Reification Inheritance&lt;/big&gt;'''

Reification inheritance: whereby the subclass completes (or partially completes)
an incomplete superclass.

    function super()
        {
        function a(x) { b(x * x); }
        this;
        }

    function sub()
        {
        function b(y) { y + 1 * (y - 1); }
        extends(super());
        }

Now we make a ''sub'' object:

    var s = sub();
    inspect(s . a(3));

The output is:

    s . a(3) is 80

Sway allows you to look at the concatenated environment:

    ppObject(s);

yields:

    &lt;OBJECT 5651&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 654&gt;
        dynamicContext: &lt;OBJECT 654&gt;
        callDepth: 1
        constructor: &lt;function sub()&gt;
        this: &lt;OBJECT 5651&gt;
        b: &lt;function b(y)&gt;
        a: &lt;function a(x)&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;Variation Inheritance&lt;/big&gt;'''

Variation inheritance: whereby the subclass changes a behavior of the super class.

    function super()
        {
        var greeting = &quot;hello&quot;;
        function a() { greeting; }
        this;
        }
    
    function sub()
        {
        function a() { &quot;well, &quot; + a . prior() + &quot; there!&quot;; }
        extends(super());
        }
    
    var s = sub();
    
    println(s . a());

The output is:

    well, hello there!

Looking at the ''s'' object gives:

    &lt;OBJECT 2611&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 654&gt;
        dynamicContext: &lt;OBJECT 654&gt;
        callDepth: 1
        constructor: &lt;function sub()&gt;
        this: &lt;OBJECT 2611&gt;

        a: &lt;function a()&gt;

Every component in a Sway Object is public:

* A belief that programming is not a adversarial exercise

* Simplifies the language (syntactically speaking)

However, it is possible, with a little bit of work, to
make a component private.
One method in Sway uses simple scoping rules
(see the [[../ClassAndObjectComponents|Class and Object Components]] page.

The other uses operator [[../PublicAndPrivateComponents2|overloading]].

''Class component'': shared by all instances

''Object component'': unique for each instance

Could use a global variable...

    var shared_count = 0;

    function z()
        {
        var count = 0;
        shared_count += 1;
        count += 1;
        this;
        }

    function x()
        {
        extends(z());
        }

    inspect(x() . shared_count);
    inspect(x() . count);
    inspect(x() . shared_count);

Results are as expected:

    x() . shared_count is 1
    x() . count is 1
    x() . shared_count is 3

Not very [[../ClassAndObjectComponents2|satisfying]]...

How about ''with''?

    function with(obj,$actions)
        {
        $actions . context = obj;
        force($actions);
        }

Let's create an object:

    function f(x) { var y = x + 1; this;}
    
    var o = f(3);

Now let's modify its slots:

    with (o)
        {
        x = 10;
        y = 13;
        }

Did it work?

    inspect(o . x);
    inspect(o . y);

Output:

    o . x is 10
    o . y is 13

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What countries did they live in? ==

Mesopotamia included the area that is now eastern Syria, south eastern Turkey and most of Iraq.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
They had buildings made of mud and clay with an opening on top because they hadn't made doors yet.

== What did they eat? ==

Ordinary people in Mesopotamia ate better food than the poor. Some workers were paid in food. Others had to buy or trade for food.

In Mesopotamia they ate a meal twice a day, these meals were prepared outside in a small courtyard. The meals included a flat bread made of barley. They did not eat beef  because it was too expensive. So they ate lots of vegetable soups or stews.  They also drank lots of alcoholic beverages, mainly ale. They drank some cows' milk but they could not keep it long because it would spoil in the hot climate. People that lived near the river used spears and nets to catch fish. The fish were salted and stored to eat in the winter. People near the coast would hunt for turtle eggs and eat them. They ate in clay plates or on hard bread.

Food from other countries was enjoyed including bananas from India, wine from Syria. The King had fancier meals made with different spices. He also was the first to have the imported white cheese. 

Recipes have been found on clay tablets.

== What did they wear? ==
They mostly wore clothes made from wool, cotton and silk were introduced later.

== What did their writing look like? ==

Mesopotamia writing was one of the first written languages. They wrote using pictograms. They used small drawings of simple pictures to communicate.

Writing began in Mesopotamia around 3500 BC. Scribes were people who learned to write. Clay tablets were used for recording information.  Scribes kept track of sales and trades, tax payments, gifts for the gods,  marriages, and deaths. There were many symbols that scribes had to learn. They used sharp tools to write with like a stylus.  Later on their writing was called cuneiform.  Cuneiform has lots of triangles and wedge shaped symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Papankek, John L. and John M. Fahey, Jr.|title=Mesopatamia: The Mighty Kings|publisher=Time-Life Books|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Service, Pamela F.|title=Mesopotamia|publisher=Benchmark Books, New York|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacobs, Heidi Hages, Michal LeVasseur, and Brenda Randolph|title=The Ancient World|publisher=Prentice and Hall, Needham, Massachusetts|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What did they believe? ==
The Mesopotamians believed that the gods were beyond reach of humans and that the gods considered them extremely insignificant. In comparison, the Egyptians thought that you could make sacrifices for gods and they would listen. The Egyptians also believed that there was a connection between humans and the gods, the pharaoh being the link, who was made divine by the god Horus. The Egyptians also thought that you could receive eternal life in the after life.

In the epic of Gilgamesh, the god Enlil decided to flood the earth and almost every other god took his side on this matter. The Egyptian god Amon would cause the Nile to flood, always at the same period of time, and they believed that if they praised him and made sacrifices for him, he would continue to flood the Nile.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
Yes, people such as Gilgamesh are still famous today.

== What is left of them today? ==
There are many artifacts, including tablets in their language, ceramic pots, and many other daily objects.

== When did the civilizations start and end? ==

The civilizations started around 5300 B.C. and ended either in the 6th century B.C. or 644 A.D.

Here's an attempt...

    var z =
    {
    var z_shared = { var count = 0; this; };
    
    function z()
        {
        var shared = z_shared;
        var count = 0;
        shared . count += 1;
        count += 1;
        this;
        }
    };
    
    function x()
        {
        extends(z());
        }

Testing...

    inspect(x() . shared . count);
    inspect(x() . count);
    inspect(x() . shared . count);

Output is as desired:

    x() . shared . count is 1
    x() . count is 1
    x() . shared . count is 3

[[File:GIMP-Toolbox-BrushBlend-Menu.png|thumb|right|10000px|Default gradient settings.]]

[[File:GIMP-Toolbox-BrushBlend-Icon.png]] '''Shortcut: L'''

The GIMP Blend tool enables you to make gradients. For instance, a gradient may be a paint [[fill]] or [[stroke]] which smoothly blends from red to green. A gradient may have sudden changes as well. And a gradient may be applied to [[selection]]s or [[opacity|opacities]].

On the right side of the gradient dialog box, are the default settings:

:* '''Mode''' - you can select mode here (more information in the [[GIMP/Mode|Modes]] article)
:* '''Opacity''' - set whether gradient will be transparent or fully visible
:* '''Gradient''' - type of gradient
:* '''Offset''' - effects how far along the start colour in the gradient begins
:* '''Shape''' - shape of gradient
:* '''Repeat''' - way of repeating
:* '''Dithering''' - helps reduce banding by dithering the gradient.
:* '''Adaptive supersampling''' - try to refine the gradient in high contrast areas. Choose how much difference is required before supersampling activates, and how hard GIMP tries to get good quality samples.

== Opacity ==
This bar controls the [[w:Transparency_(graphic)|transparency]] of the gradient. Any value between 0.0 and 100.0 is possible with 100 being fully opaque and 0 being fully transparent. The default value is 100.

== Gradient ==
There are hundreds of types of gradients in GIMP. Neons, flags, flares and much more. All of them have their own effect, but only few use selected colours. Here's short description of them:
&lt;!-- for 2.7 and later (uncomment once 2.8 is out) * ''' FG to BG (Hardedge)''' - from foreground to background colour with no transformation in the middle (just uses the two colours) --&gt;
* '''FG to BG (HSV anti-clockwise)''' - using HSV palette, moves counter-clockwise
* '''FG to BG (HSV clockwise hue)''' - using HSV palette, moves clockwise
* '''FG to BG (RGB)''' - using RGB palette
* '''FG to Transparent''' - moves from foreground colour to transparent.
Next to it you can see a flip option ([[File:GIMP-Toolbox-BrushBlend-Flip.png]]). It reverses the gradient direction. For example, Red to Green would flip to Green to Red.

== Offset ==
Gradient offset ranges from a default of 0, up to 100 percent. When offset is 0, the gradient begins at the start of the blending line. When offset is 50, the gradient begins at the halfway point in the blending line. Any earlier points are rendered with the same colour as the leftmost colour in the gradient. Setting offset to 100.0, which makes the gradient a solid (non-gradient) colour.

== Shape ==
There are eleven gradient shapes, clicking and dragging inside a [[selection]] makes the gradient follow its boundary.

* '''Linear''' - Smoothly blends from left to right
* '''Bi-linear''' - Smoothly blends to the left and right from the middle
* '''Radial''' - Linearly blends outward along radius - pseudo-spherical appearance
* '''Square''' - Linearly blends into a square from center to corner
* '''Conical (symmetrical)''' - blends linearly with angle in a circular arc 
* '''Conical (asymmetrical)''' - blends linearly with arc, until reaching the starting radius
* '''Shaped (angular)''' - formerly [[shapeburst]], produces an angular beveled gradient
* '''Shaped (spherical)''' - fills selection with a bulging beveled gradient
* '''Shaped (dimpled)''' - fills selection with a puckered beveled gradient
* '''Spiral (clockwise)''' - clockwise spiral blend centered at click, with varying amount of twist
* '''Spiral (counterclockwise)''' - counterclockwise spiral

== Repeat ==
[[Image:GIMP-Toolbox-BrushBlend-RepeatTriangular.png|thumb|256px|right|Example of triangular wave ( using radial shape ).]]
There are three options for repeating:
* '''None''' - no repeat
* '''Sawtooth wave''' - once passing the end of the gradient, begins again at the start
* '''Triangular wave''' - once passing the end of the gradient, blends backwards until the start, and then begins blending forward again..

You can use Repeat with these shapes: Linear, Bi-linear, Radial, Square, Conical (sym), Conical (asym).

== Dithering ==
[[Wikipedia:Dithering#Digital_photography_and_image_processing|Dithering]] reduces banding patterns in the gradient. If your gradient includes deliberately banded areas, turn dithering off in order to preserve them. If the result must be very precise, consider turning dithering off also (dithering trades spatial resolution for colour resolution, which is only good if you have spatial resolution to spare.)

== Adaptive Supersampling ==
Adaptive supersampling identifies areas that seem to have high contrast and tries to improve the precision of the rendering only at these points.
The general effect is that areas of high contrast are smoothed out; One easy way to see this is comparing the appearance of a 'sawtooth wave' repeated gradient with and without supersampling enabled.
The options in this section allow you to control
* How much contrast is considered 'high contrast'
* How much GIMP will try to improve the sample quality before accepting the result (this comes into action when the additional samples' relationship to each other is also considered as high contrast)

See [[w:Supersampling|supersampling]] for a detailed explanation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Assembling the Doors ==
Its time to find the door blanks that you cut out for the door openings.  We will use these blanks for the actual door.

There are two issues with making doors. One was discussed previously. 

=== Door Seal ===
[[Image:Teardrop door seal configurations.jpg|thumb|right|Door seal configurations]]
[[Image:Teardrop_door_open.jpg|thumb|right]]
[[Image:Teardrop_door_closed.jpg|thumb|right]]

You need to figure out how you are going to seal the door from outside water intrusion and construct some form of sealing surface around the door perimeter.

There are several thoughts on this and their availability depend on the shape of the door you chose:

==== Inside Seal ====
You can add moulding around the inside of the door opening (on the body,inside)and place the seal on this moulding facing out.  On the upside, this allows the outside of the door to be completely flush with the outside of the sidewall, and the path which water would have to take to get to the seal is inherently difficult.  The downside is that the interior moulding takes away slightly from the already narrow interior cabin space and any imperfections of your door opening cut are completely visible and may need to be sanded with a belt sander.

==== Outside Seal ====
[[Image:Teardrop_door_spaced.jpg|thumb|right|Photo from inside showing door spaced and held in place for drilling of hinge bolt holes.]]
You can alternatively add moulding around the outside on the door itself and place the seal on this moulding facing in.  On the upside, it hides imperfections of your door opening cut and allows the interior cabin space to remain free of anything you might rub against in the night.  On the downside, the seal will be directly exposed to driving rain (you'll need to put a barrier moulding around the outside of the door on the body itself to block this. And unless you have a curve-free (straight) hinge side on the door (with square corners), you'll be forced to use gate hinges instead of piano or house door hinges.

[[Image:Info icon.svg|30px]]
If you're confused about the photos apparently showing the style of door that is most problematic - the author learned the hard way on the doors.  I decided to use an outside moulding as described above, however I decided to cut out a single piece of luan to cover the door and have it extend about an inch beyond the door.  This forced the use of gate hinges because the pivot point had to be at the edge of the overhang (i.e. the screw holes for any other type hinge would not reach the 3/4&quot; plywood part of the door).  Mistake number 2 was that I read that using polyurethane glue on the edge of plywood was a good way to seal it so I put polyurethane glue on the door edges.  Weatherstrip glue does not stick to polyurethane glue - don't put it on the door edges like I mistakenly did!  Mistake number 3 was thinking I could lighten the door by cutting out some holes in the 3/4&quot; wood.  As you can see, my holes are awful looking. I planned on putting paneling over them but later decided against it.

What about overriding simple variables?

    function z()
        {
        var value = 3;
        function getvalue() { value; }
        this;
        }
    
    function x()
        {
        var value = 4;
        extends(z());
        }
    
    var obj = x();

What should &lt;tt&gt;obj . getValue()&lt;/tt&gt; produce?

We overload assignment so that only variables can appear
on the left hand side of the assignment operator.

    function =($a,b)
        {
        var assign = shadowed(:=);
    
        if (type($a . code) != :VARIABLE)
           {
           throw(:restrictedAssignment,
               &quot;you are only allowed to assign to simple variables&quot;);
           }
    
        $a assign b;
        }

So, anything like:

    x . a = 3;

throws an exception.

Since ''setters'' can access the variables directly,
they are not affected by this change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Feuvert2.jpg|thumb|200 px|A Traffic Light]]

'''Traffic Signals''' are one of the more familiar types of intersection control.  Using either a fixed or adaptive schedule, traffic signals allow certain parts of the intersection to move while forcing other parts to wait, delivering instructions to drivers through a set of colorful lights (generally, of the standard red-yellow (amber)-green format).  Some purposes of traffic signals are to (1) improve overall safety, (2) decrease average travel time through an intersection, and (3) equalize the quality of services for all or most traffic streams.  Traffic signals provide orderly movement of intersection traffic, have the ability to be flexible for changes in traffic flow, and can assign priority treatment to certain movements or vehicles, such as emergency services.  However, they may increase delay during the off-peak period and increase the probability of certain accidents, such as rear-end collisions.  Additionally, when improperly configured, driver irritation can become an issue.  Traffic signals are generally a well-accepted form of traffic control for busy intersections and continue to be deployed. Other intersection control strategies include signs (stop and yield) and roundabouts. Intersections with high volumes may be grade separated.

Traffic signals can be pretimed, semi-actuated, or fully-actuated. Pretimed intersections have a fixed cycle length. This is easy to implement but can cause excessive delay at some intersections. Semi-actuated intersections have vehicle detectors on the minor roadway. When a vehicle approaches on the minor roadway, the detector receives a signal to change the light to green. In a fully-actuated intersection, all approaches have a detector. Each phase has an initial green light interval to provide time for standing vehicles to get through the intersection. This initial time is extended if the detector at the approach detects a car moving through the intersection. If there are no cars moving through the intersection for a given period of time, the light will change. This is called a &quot;gap out&quot;. After the maximum amount of time has passed for the light to be green, the light will change even if there are still cars moving through the intersection. This is called a &quot;max out&quot;. 

== Intersection Queuing ==
[[File:Typical Signal Schedule and Traffic Flow Diagram, North-South across Market (1929).png|thumb|Typical Signal Schedule and Traffic Flow Diagram, North-South across Market (1929) From Signal Timing Schedule for Traffic Control Plan, June 15, 1929. Attempted &quot;green wave&quot;: 8.5mph on Market; 50 vara district: 10.5 mph north-south, 14.5 mph east-west; 100 vara district: 14.5mph north-south, 20.5mph east-west.]]

At an intersection where certain approaches are denied movement, queuing will inherently occur.  Of the various queuing models, one of the more commons and simple ones is the D/D/1 Queuing Model.  This model assumes that arrivals and departures are deterministic (D) and one departure channel exists.  D/D/1 is quite intuitive and easily solvable.  Using this form of queuing with an arrival rate &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and a departure rate &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, certain useful values regarding the consequences of queues can be computed.

One important piece of information is the duration of the queue for a given approach.  This time value can be calculated through the following formula:

&lt;math&gt; t_c {\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{\rho r}}{{1 - \rho }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;t_c&lt;/math&gt; = Time for queue to clear
*  &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; = Arrival Rate divided by Departure Rate
*  &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; = Red Time

With this, various proportions dealing with queues can be calculated.  The first determines the proportion of cycle with a queue.

&lt;math&gt; P_q {\rm{  }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{r{\rm{ }} + {\rm{ }}t_c }}{C}{\rm{ }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;P_q&lt;/math&gt; = Proportion of cycle with a queue
*  &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; = Cycle Length

Similarly, the proportion of stopped vehicles can be calculated.

&lt;math&gt; P_s  = \frac{{\lambda \left( {r + t_C } \right)}}{{\lambda \left( {r + g} \right)}} = \frac{{r + t_C }}{C} = P_q  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; P_s  = \frac{{\lambda \left( {r + t_C } \right)}}{{\lambda \left( {r + g} \right)}} = \frac{{\mu t_C }}{{\lambda C}} = \frac{{t_C }}{{\rho C}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;P_s&lt;/math&gt; = Proportion of Stopped Vehicles
*  &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; = Green Time

Therefore, the maximum number of vehicles in a queue can be found.

&lt;math&gt;Q_{\max } {\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}\lambda r \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

== Intersection delay ==
Various models of intersection delay at isolated intersections have been put forward, combining queuing theory with empirical observations of various arrival rates and discharge times (Webster and Cobbe 1966; Hurdle 1985; Hagen and Courage 1992).  Intersections on arterials are more complex phenomena, including factors such as signal progression and spillover of queues between adjacent intersections.   Delay is broken into two parts: ''uniform delay'',  which is the delay that would occur if the arrival pattern were uniform, and ''overflow delay'',  caused by stochastic variations in the arrival patterns, which manifests itself when the arrival rate exceeds the service flow of the intersection for a time period. 

Delay can be computed with knowledge of arrival rates, departure rates, and red times.  Graphically, total delay is the product of all queues over the time period in which they are present.

&lt;math&gt; D_t {\rm{  }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{\lambda r^2 }}{{2\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}{\rm{ }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, average vehicle delay per cycle can be computed.

&lt;math&gt; d_{avg} {\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{\lambda r^2 {\rm{ }}}}{{2\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}\frac{1}{{\lambda C}}{\rm{ }}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; d_{avg} {\rm{ }} = \frac{{r^2 }}{{2C\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

From this, maximum delay for any vehicle can be found.

&lt;math&gt; d_{\max } {\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}r \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Level of Service==

In order to assess the performance of a signalized intersection, a qualitative assessment called Level of Service (LOS) is assessed, based upon quantitative performance measures.  For LOS, the performance measured used is average control delay per vehicle.  The general procedure for determining LOS is to calculate lane group capacities, calculate delay, and then make a determination.

Lane group capacities can be calculated through the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;c = s\frac{{g}}{{C}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = Lane Group Capacity
*  &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = Adjusted Saturation Flow Rate
*  &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; = Effective Green Length
*  &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; = Cycle Length

Average control delay per vehicle, thus, can be calculated by summing the types of delay mentioned earlier.

&lt;math&gt;d = (d_1(PF)) + d_2 + d_3\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


If your intersection is D/D/X:
&lt;math&gt;d = ((d_1(PF)) + d_3&lt;/math&gt;

This is because there are no random arrivals.

If your intersection is M/D/X:
&lt;math&gt;d = (d_1(PF)) + d_2 + d_3&lt;/math&gt;

You might think that there would be no deterministic arrivals because the intersection is M/D/X, however, this is incorrect.  d_1 can be thought of as the baseline for the intersection.


Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; = Average Signal Delay per vehicle (sec)
*  &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; = Average Delay per vehicle due to uniform arrivals (sec) (equivalent to &lt;math&gt;D_T&lt;/math&gt; in previous section)
*  &lt;math&gt;PF&lt;/math&gt; = Progression Adjustment Factor
*  &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; = Average Delay per vehicle due to random arrivals (sec)
*  &lt;math&gt;d_3&lt;/math&gt; = Average delay per vehicle due to initial queue at start of analysis time period (sec)

Uniform delay can be calculated through the following formula:
&lt;math&gt; d_1  = \frac{{0.5C\left( {1 - \frac{g}{C}} \right)^2 }}{{1 - \left[ {\min \left( {1,X} \right)\frac{g}{C}} \right]}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; = Volume/Capacity (v/c) ratio for lane group.

Similarly, random delay can be calculated:

&lt;math&gt; d_2  = 900T\left[ {\left( {X - 1} \right) + \sqrt {\left( {X - 1} \right)^2  + \frac{{8kIX}}{{cT}}} } \right] \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = Duration of Analysis Period (in hours)
*  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; = Delay Adjustment Factor that is dependent on signal controller mode
*  &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; = Upstream filtering/metering adjustment factor

Overflow delay generally only applies to densely urban corridors, where queues can sometimes spill over into previous intersections.  Since this is not very common (usually the consequence of a poorly timed intersection sequence, the rare increase of traffic demand, or an emergency vehicle passing through the area), it is generally not taken into account for simple problems.

Delay can be calculated for individual vehicles in certain approaches or lane groups.  Average delay per vehicle for an approach A can be calculated using the following formula:

&lt;math&gt; d_A  = \frac{{\sum\limits_i {d_i v_i } }}{{\sum\limits_i {v_i } }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;d_A&lt;/math&gt; = Average Delay per vehicle for approach A (sec)
*  &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; = Average Delay per vehicle for lane group i on approach A (sec)
*  &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; = Analysis flow rate for lane group i

Average delay per vehicle for the intersection can then be calculated:

&lt;math&gt; d_I  = \frac{{\sum\limits_A {d_A v_A } }}{{\sum\limits_A {v_A } }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;d_I&lt;/math&gt; = Average Delay per vehicle for the intersection (sec)
*  &lt;math&gt;d_A&lt;/math&gt; = Average Delay per vehicle for approach A (sec)
*  &lt;math&gt;v_A&lt;/math&gt; = Analysis flow rate for approach A

==Critical Lane Groups==

For any combination of lane group movements, one lane group will dictate the necessary green time during a particular phase.  This lane group is called the Critical Lane Group.  This lane group has the highest traffic intensity (v/s) and the allocation of green time for each phase is based on this ratio.

The sum of the flow ratios for the critical lane groups can be used to calculate a suitable cycle length.

&lt;math&gt; Y_c  = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {\left( {\frac{v}{s}} \right)} _{ci} \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;Y_c&lt;/math&gt; = Sum of Flow Ratios for Critical Lane Groups
*  &lt;math&gt;(v/s)_{ci}&lt;/math&gt; = Flow Ratio for Critical Lane Group i
*  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = Number of Critical Lane Groups

Similarly, the total lost time for the cycle is also an element that can be used in the calculation of cycle length.

&lt;math&gt; L = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {\left( {t_L } \right)_{ci} }  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = Total lost Time for Cycle
*  &lt;math&gt;(t_L)_{ci}&lt;/math&gt; = Total Lost Time for Critical Lane Group i

==Cycle Length Calculation==

Cycle lengths are calculated by summing individual phase lengths.  Using the previous formulas for assistance, the minimum cycle length necessary for the lane group volumes and phasing plan can be easily calculated.

&lt;math&gt; C_{min }  = \frac{{L*X_c }}{{{\rm{X}}_{\rm{c}} {\rm{  -  }}\sum\limits_{{\rm{i}} = {\rm{1}}}^{\rm{n}} {{\rm{Yi}}} }}{\rm{  }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;C_{min}&lt;/math&gt; = Minimum necessary cycle length
*  &lt;math&gt;X_c&lt;/math&gt; = Critical v/c ratio for the intersection
*  &lt;math&gt;(v/s)_{ci}&lt;/math&gt; = Flow Ratio for Critical Lane Group
*  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = Number of Critical Lane Groups

This equation calculates the minimum cycle length necessary for the intersection to operate at an acceptable level, but it does not necessarily minimize the average vehicle delay.  A more optimal cycle length usually exists that would minimize average delay.  Webster (1958) proposed an equation for the calculation of cycle length that seeks to minimize vehicle delay.  This optimum cycle length formula is listed below.

&lt;math&gt; C_{opt}  = \frac{{\left[ {\left( {1.5L} \right) + 5} \right]}}{{\left( {1.0{\rm{ }} - {\rm{ }}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {Y_i } } \right)}}{\rm{  }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;C_{opt}&lt;/math&gt; = Optimal Cycle Length for Minimizing Delay

==Green Time Allocation==

Once cycle length has been determined, the next step is to determine the allocation of green time to each phase.  Several strategies for allocating green time exist.  One of the more popular ones is to distribute green time such that v/c ratios are equalized over critical lane groups.  Similarly, v/c ratios can be found with predetermined values for green time.

&lt;math&gt; X_i  = \frac{{v_i }}{{c_i }} = \frac{{v_i }}{{s_i *g_i /C}} = \frac{{v_i /s_i }}{{g_i /C}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; = v/c ratio for lane group i

With knowledge of cycle lengths, lost times, and v/s ratios, the degree of saturation for an intersection can be found.

&lt;math&gt; X_c  = \sum {\frac{{v_i }}{{s_i }}\frac{C}{{C - L}}}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;X_c&lt;/math&gt; = Degree of saturation for an intersection cycle

From this, the total effective green for all phases can be computed.

&lt;math&gt; \sum {g_i }  = \sum {\frac{{v_i }}{{s_i }}\frac{C}{{X_c }}}  = C - L \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


==Second Method For Green Time==

Another method for calculating the effective red and green time for a given cycle is to minimize the total delay of the intersection. By assuming the intersection is controlled based on D/D/1 queuing the above equations for total delay can be used. Since the light will contain at least two or more directions the total delay must be calculated for each direction, and then added together to determine the total delay of the intersection. For a two way intersection with opposing lights a and b

&lt;math&gt; D_t {\rm{  }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{\lambda_{a} r_{a}^2 }}{{2\left( {1 - \rho_{a} } \right)}}+{\rm{ }}\frac{{\lambda_{b} r_{b}^2 }}{{2\left( {1 - \rho_{b} } \right)}}{\rm{ }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;  


Also the effective red time is the cycle length minus the effective green time for the other directions. 


&lt;math&gt; C {\rm{  }} = r_{a}+g_{a}{\rm{ }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;  


&lt;math&gt; g_a {\rm{  }} = r_{b}{\rm{ }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;  


By substituting the  two above equation for cycle length and effective red time into the total delay equation, it can then be written with only one variable red time. 

&lt;math&gt; D_t {\rm{  }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{\lambda_{a} r_{a}^2 }}{{2\left( {1 - \rho_{a} } \right)}}+{\rm{ }}\frac{{\lambda_{b} (C-r_{a}^2) }}{{2\left( {1 - \rho_{b} } \right)}}{\rm{ }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;  

By taking the derivate and setting it equal to zero, the minimum effective red time can be calculated. The other directions effective red time, and the effective green times for each directions can then be calculated by using the two above equations involving the cycle length.

==Examples==

===Example 1: Intersection Queuing===

{{TProblem|
An approach at a pretimed signalized intersection has an arrival rate of 0.1 veh/sec and a saturation flow rate of 0.7 veh/sec.  20 seconds of effective green are given in a 60-second cycle.  Provide analysis of the intersection assuming D/D/1 queuing.

[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Solution:'''&lt;br&gt;

Traffic intensity, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, is the first value to calculate.

&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{{\lambda}}{{\mu}} = \frac{{0.1}}{{0.7}} = 0.14\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Red time is found to be 40 seconds (C - g = 60 - 20).  The remaining values of interest can be easily found.

Time to queue clearance after the start of effective green: 

&lt;math&gt; t_c {\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{\rho r}}{{1 - \rho }} = \frac{{0.14(40)}}{{1 - 0.14}} = 6.51\ s \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Proportion of the cycle with a queue:

&lt;math&gt; P_q {\rm{  }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{r{\rm{ }} + {\rm{ }}t_c }}{C}{\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{40{\rm{ }} + {\rm{ }}6.51 }}{60}{\rm{ }} = 0.775\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Proportion of vehicles stopped:

&lt;math&gt; P_s  = \frac{{\lambda \left( {r + t_C } \right)}}{{\lambda \left( {r + g} \right)}} = \frac{{0.1 \left( {40 + 6.51 } \right)}}{{0.1 \left( {40 + 20} \right)}} = 0.775 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Maximum number of vehicles in the queue:

&lt;math&gt;Q_{\max } {\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}\lambda r = {\rm{ }}0.1(40) = 4 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Total vehicle delay per cycle:

&lt;math&gt; D_t {\rm{  }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{\lambda r^2 }}{{2\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}{\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{0.1(40^2) }}{{2\left( {1 - 0.14 } \right)}}{\rm{ }} = 93 veh-s \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Average delay per vehicle:

&lt;math&gt; d_{avg} {\rm{ }} = \frac{{r^2 }}{{2C\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}} = \frac{{(40)^2 }}{{2(60)\left( {1 - 0.14} \right)}} = 15.5\ s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Maximum delay of any vehicle:

&lt;math&gt; d_{\max } {\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}r = {\rm{ }} 40\ s \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

===Example 2: Total Delay===

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|TProblem]]'''Problem:'''&lt;br&gt;

Compute the average approach delay given certain conditions for a 60-second cycle length intersection with 20 seconds of green, a v/c ratio of 0.7, a progression neutral state (PF=1.0), and no chance of intersection spillover delay (overflow delay).  Assume the traffic flow accounts for the peak 15-minute period and a lane capacity of 840 veh/hr, and that the intersection is isolated.

&lt;/div&gt;

{{Answer|
Uniform Delay:

&lt;math&gt; d_1  = \frac{{0.5C\left( {1 - \frac{g}{C}} \right)^2 }}{{1 - \left[ {\min \left( {1,X} \right)\frac{g}{C}} \right]}} = \frac{{0.5(60)\left( {1 - \frac{20}{60}} \right)^2 }}{{1 - \left[ {\min \left( {1,0.7} \right)\frac{20}{60}} \right]}} = 17.39\ s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Random Delay:

&lt;math&gt;T = 0.25\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (from problem statement)

&lt;math&gt;X = 0.7\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k = 0.5\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for pretimed control)

&lt;math&gt;I = 1.0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (isolated intersection)

&lt;math&gt;c = 840\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; d_2  = 900T\left[ {\left( {X - 1} \right) + \sqrt {\left( {X - 1} \right)^2  + \frac{{8kIX}}{{cT}}} } \right] = 900(0.25)\left[ {\left( {0.7 - 1} \right) + \sqrt {\left( {0.7 - 1} \right)^2  + \frac{{8(0.5)(1)(0.7)}}{{840(0.25)}}} } \right] = 4.83\ s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Overflow Delay:

Overflow delay is zero because it is assumed that there is no overflow.

&lt;math&gt;d_3 = 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Total Delay:

&lt;math&gt;d = d_1(PF) + d_2 + d_3 = 17.39(1) + 4.83 + 0 = 22.22\ s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The average total delay is 22.22 seconds.
}}

===Example 3: Cycle Length Calculation===

{{TProblem |
Calculate the minimum and optimal cycle lengths for the intersection of Oak Street and Washington Avenue, given that the critical v/c ratio is 0.9, the two critical approaches have a v/s ratio of 0.3, and the Lost Time equals 15 seconds.
}}

{{Answer |
Minimum Cycle Length:

&lt;math&gt; C_{min }  = \frac{{L*X_c }}{{{\rm{X}}_{\rm{c}} {\rm{  -  }}\sum\limits_{{\rm{i}} = {\rm{1}}}^{\rm{n}} {{\rm{Yi}}} }}{\rm{  }} = \frac{{15*0.9}}{{[0.9 - (2(0.3))]}} = 45 \ s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Optimal Cycle Length:

&lt;math&gt; C_{opt}  = \frac{{\left[ {\left( {1.5L} \right) + 5} \right]}}{{\left( {1.0{\rm{ }} - {\rm{ }}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {Y_i } } \right)}}{\rm{  }} = \frac{{1.5(15) + 5}}{{1.0 - 2(0.3)}} = 68.75 \ s \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The minimum cycle length is 45 seconds and the optimal cycle length is 68.75 seconds.
}}

==Thought Question==

'''Problem'''

Why don't signalized intersections perform more efficiently than uncontrolled intersections?

'''Solution'''

The inherent lost time that comes from each signal change is wasted time that does not occur when intersections are uncontrolled.  It comes at quite a surprise to most of the Western World, where traffic signals are plentiful, but there are intersections that perform quite well without any form of control.  There is an infamous video on YouTube that shows an uncontrolled intersection in India where drivers somehow navigate through a busy, chaotic environment smoothly and efficiently &lt;ref&gt;YouTube video: India Driving http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjrEQaG5jPM&lt;/ref&gt; .  The video is humorous to watch, but it shows a valid point that uncontrolled intersections can indeed work and are quite efficient.  However, the placement of traffic signals is for safety, as drivers entering an uncontrolled intersection have a higher likelihood of being involved in a dangerous accident, such as a T-bone or head-on collision, particularly at high speed.

Transportation systems have specific structure. Roads have length, width, and depth. The characteristics of roads depends on their purpose. 

== Roads ==
[[File:Middle Age-road.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Middle age road in Denmark]]
A road is a path connecting two points. The English word ‘road’ comes from  the same root as the word ‘ride’ –the Middle English ‘rood’ and Old English ‘rad’ –meaning the act of riding.  Thus a road refers foremost to the right of way between an origin and destination.  In an urban context, the word street is often used rather than road, which dates to the Latin word ‘strata’, meaning pavement (the additional layer or stratum that might be on top of a path).

Modern roads are generally paved, and unpaved routes are considered trails.  The pavement of roads began early in history.  Approximately 2600 BCE, the Egyptians constructed a paved road out of sandstone and limestone slabs to assist with the movement of stones on rollers between the quarry and the site of construction of the pyramids.  The Romans and others used brick or stone pavers to provide a more level, and smoother surface, especially in urban areas, which allows faster travel, especially of wheeled vehicles.  The innovations of Thomas Telford and John McAdam reinvented roads in the early nineteenth century, by using less expensive smaller and broken stones, or aggregate, to maintain a smooth ride and allow for drainage.  Later in the nineteenth century, application of tar (asphalt) further smoothed the ride.  In 1824, asphalt blocks were used on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.  In 1872, the first asphalt street (Fifth Avenue) was paved in New York (due to Edward de Smedt), but it wasn’t until bicycles became popular in the late nineteenth century that the “Good Roads Movement” took off. Bicycle travel, more so than travel by other vehicles at the time, was sensitive to rough roads.  Demands for higher quality roads really took off with the widespread adoption of the automobile in the United States in the early twentieth century. 

The first good roads in the twentieth century were constructed of Portland cement concrete (PCC). The material is stiffer than asphalt (or asphalt concrete) and provides a smoother ride. Concrete lasts slightly longer than asphalt between major repairs, and can carry a heavier load, but is more expensive to build and repair.  While urban streets had been paved with concrete in the US as early as 1889, the first rural concrete road was in Wayne County, Michigan, near to Detroit in 1909, and the first concrete highway in 1913 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. By the next year over 2300 miles of concrete pavement had been laid nationally.  However over the remainder of the twentieth century, the vast majority of roadways were paved with asphalt. In general only the most important roads, carrying the heaviest loads, would be built with concrete.

Roads are generally classified into a hierarchy.  At the top of the hierarchy are freeways, which serve entirely a function of moving vehicles between other roads. Freeways are grade-separated and limited access, have high speeds and carry heavy flows.  Below freeways are arterials.  These may not be grade-separated, and while access is still generally limited, it is not limited to the same extent as freeways, particularly on older roads.  These serve both a movement and an access function. Next are collector/distributor roads.  These serve more of an access function, allowing vehicles to access the network from origins and destinations, as well as connecting with smaller, local roads, that have only an access function, and are not intended for the movement of vehicles with neither a local origin nor destination.  Local roads are designed to be low speed and carry relatively little traffic.

The class of the road determines which level of government administers it.  The highest roads will generally be owned, operated, or at least regulated (if privately owned) by the higher level of government involved in road operations; in the United States, these roads are operated by the individual states. As one moves down the hierarchy of roads, the level of government is generally more and more local (counties may control collector/distributor roads, towns may control local streets). In some countries freeways and other roads near the top of the hierarchy are privately owned and regulated as utilities, these are generally operated as toll roads.  Even publicly owned freeways are operated as toll roads under a toll authority in other countries, and some US states. Local roads are often owned by adjoining property owners and neighborhood associations.

The design of roads is specified in a number of design manual, including the AASHTO Policy on the Geometric Design of Streets and Highways (or Green Book).  Relevant concerns include the alignment of the road, its horizontal and vertical curvature, its super-elevation or banking around curves, its thickness and pavement material, its cross-slope, and its width.

== Freeways ==
[[File:Phoenix Freeway.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Freeways in Phoenix]]

A motorway or freeway (sometimes called an expressway or thruway) is a multi-lane  divided road that is designed to be high-speed free flowing, access-controlled, built to high standards, with no traffic lights on the mainline. Some motorways or freeways are financed with tolls, and so may have tollbooths, either across the entrance ramp or across the mainline.  However in the United States and Great Britain, most are financed with gas or other tax revenue. 

Though of course there were major road networks during the Roman Empire and before, the history of motorways and freeways dates at least as early as 1907, when the first limited access automobile highway, the Bronx River Parkway began construction in Westchester County, New York (opening in 1908).  In this same period, William Vanderbilt constructed the Long Island Parkway as a toll road in Queens County, New York.  The Long Island Parkway was built for racing and speeds of 60 miles per hour (96 km/hr) were accommodated.   Users however had to pay a then expensive $2.00 toll (later reduced) to recover the construction costs of $2 million. These parkways were paved when most roads were not.  
In 1919 General John Pershing assigned Dwight Eisenhower to discover how quickly troops could be moved from Fort Meade between Baltimore and Washington to the Presidio in San Francisco by road. The answer was 62 days, for an average speed of 3.5 miles per hour (5.6 km/hr).  While using segments of the Lincoln Highway, most of that road was still unpaved.  In response, in 1922 Pershing drafted a plan for an 8,000 mile (13,000 km) interstate system which was  ignored at the time. 

The US Highway System was a set of paved and consistently numbered highways sponsored by the states, with limited federal support.  First built in 1924, they succeeded some previous major highways such as the Dixie Highway, Lincoln Highway and Jefferson Highway that were multi-state and were constructed with the aid of private support.  These roads however were not in general access-controlled, and soon became congested as development along the side of the road degraded highway speeds.

In parallel with the US Highway system, limited access parkways were developed in the 1920s and 1930s in several US cities.  Robert Moses built a number of these parkways in and around New York City. A number of these parkways were grade separated, though they were intentionally designed with low bridges to discourage trucks and buses from using them. 
German Chancellor Adolf Hitler appointed a German engineer Fritz Todt Inspector General for German Roads.  He managed the construction of the German Autobahns, the first limited access high-speed road network in the world.  In 1935, the first section from Frankfurt am Main to Darmstadt opened, the total system today has a length of 11,400 km. 
The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1938 called on the Bureau of Public Roads to study the feasibility of a toll-financed superhighway system (three east-west and three north-south routes).  Their report Toll Roads and Free Roads declared such a system would not be self-supporting, advocating instead a 43,500 km (27,000 mile) free system of interregional highways, the effect of this report was to set back the interstate program nearly twenty years in the US.

The German autobahn system proved its utility during World War II, as the German army could shift relatively quickly back and forth between two fronts.  Its value in military operations was not lost on the American Generals, including Dwight Eisenhower.

On October 1, 1940, a new toll highway using the old, unutilized South Pennsylvania Railroad right-of-way and tunnels opened.  It was the first of a new generation of limited access highways, generally called superhighways or freeways that transformed the American landscape. This was considered the first freeway in the US, as it, unlike the earlier parkways, was a multi-lane route as well as being limited access. The Arroyo Seco Parkway, now the Pasadena Freeway, opened December 30, 1940. Unlike the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the Arroyo Seco parkway had no toll barriers.

A new National Interregional Highway Committee was appointed in 1941, and reported in 1944 in favor of a 33,900 mile system. The system was designated in the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1933, and the routes began to be selected by 1947, yet no funding was provided at the time.  The 1952 highway act only authorized a token amount for construction, increased to $175 million annually in 1956 and 1957.

The US Interstate Highway System was established in 1956 following a decade and half of discussion.  Much of the network had been proposed in the 1940s, but it took time to authorize funding.  In the end, a system supported by gas taxes (rather than tolls), paid for 90% by the federal government with a 10% local contribution, on a pay-as-you-go” system, was established. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 had authorized the expenditure of $27.5 billion over 13 years for the construction of a 41,000 mile interstate highway system. As early as 1958 the cost estimate for completing the system came in at $39.9 billion and the end date slipped into the 1980s. By 1991, the final cost estimate was $128.9 billion.
While the freeways were seen as positives in most parts of the US, in urban areas opposition grew quickly into a series of freeway revolts.  As soon as 1959, (three years after the Interstate act), the San Francisco Board of Supervisors removed seven of ten freeways from the city’s master plan, leaving the Golden Gate bridge unconnected to the freeway system.  In New York, Jane Jacobs led a successful freeway revolt against the Lower Manhattan Expressway sponsored by business interests and Robert Moses among others. In Baltimore, I-70, I-83, and I-95 all remain unconnected thanks to highway revolts led by now Senator Barbara Mikulski.  In Washington, I-95 was rerouted onto the Capital Beltway. The pattern repeated itself elsewhere, and many urban freeways were removed from Master Plans.

In 1936, the Trunk Roads Act ensured that Great Britain’s Minister of Transport controlled about 30 major roads, of 7,100 km (4,500 miles) in length.  The first Motorway in Britain, the Preston by-pass, now part of the M-6, opened in 1958.  In 1959, the first stretch of the M1 opened. Today there are about 10,500 km (6300 miles) of trunk roads and motorways in England. 

Australia has 790 km of motorways, though a much larger network of roads. However the motorway network is not truly national in scope (in contrast with Germany, the United States, Britain, and France), rather it is a series of local networks in and around metropolitan areas, with many intercity connection being on undivided and non-grade separated highways.
Outside the Anglo-Saxon world, tolls were more widely used. In Japan, when the Meishin Expressway opened in 1963, the roads in Japan were in far worse shape than Europe or North American prior to this. Today there are over 6,100 km of expressways (3,800 miles), many of which are private toll roads.  France has about 10,300 km of expressways (6,200 miles) of motorways, many of which are toll roads. The French motorway system developed through a series of franchise agreements with private operators, many of which were later nationalized. 
Beginning in the late 1980s with the wind-down of the US interstate system (regarded as complete in 1990), as well as intercity motorway programs in other countries, new sources of financing needed to be developed.  New (generally suburban) toll roads were developed in several metropolitan areas.

An exception to the dearth of urban freeways is the case of the Big Dig in Boston, which relocates the Central Artery from an elevated highway to a subterranean one, largely on the same right-of-way, while keeping the elevated highway operating.  This project is estimated to be completed for some $14 billion; which is half the estimate of the original complete US Interstate Highway System. 

As mature systems in the developed countries, improvements in today’s freeways are not so much widening segments or constructing new facilities, but better managing the road space that exists.  That improved management, takes a variety of forms.  For instance, Japan has advanced its highways with application of Intelligent Transportation Systems, in particular traveler information systems, both in and out of vehicles, as well as traffic control systems.  The US and Great Britain also have traffic management centers in most major cities that assess traffic conditions on motorways, deploy emergency vehicles, and control systems like ramp meters and variable message signs.  These systems are beneficial, but cannot be seen as revolutionizing freeway travel. Speculation about future automated highway systems has taken place almost as long as highways have been around.  The Futurama exhibit at the New York 1939 World’s Fair posited a system for 1960. Yet this technology has been twenty years away for over sixty years, and difficulties remain.

All networks come in layers. The [[w:OSI model|OSI Reference Model]] for the Internet is well-defined. Roads too are part of a layer of subsystems of which the pavement surface is only one part. We can think of a hierarchy of systems.

* Places
* Trip Ends
* End to End Trip
* Driver/Passenger
* Service (Vehicle &amp; Schedule)
* Signs and Signals
* Markings
* Pavement Surface
* Structure (Earth &amp; Pavement and Bridges)
* Alignment (Vertical and Horizontal)
* Right-Of-Way
* Space

At the base is ''space''.  On space, a specific ''right-of-way'' is designated, which is property where the road goes. Originally right-of-way simply meant legal permission for travelers to cross someone's property.  Prior to the construction of roads, this might simply be a well-worn dirt path.

On top of the right-of-way is the ''alignment'', the specific path a transportation facility takes within the right-of-way. The path has both vertical and horizontal elements, as the road rises or falls with the topography and turns as needed.

''Structures'' are built on the alignment.  These include the roadbed as well as bridges or tunnels that carry the road.

''Pavement surface'' is the gravel or asphalt or concrete surface that vehicles actually ride upon and is the top layer of the structure. That surface may have ''markings'' to help guide drivers to stay to the right (or left), delineate lanes, regulate which vehicles can use which lanes (bicycles-only, high occupancy vehicles, buses, trucks) and provide additional information. In addition to marking, signs and signals to the side or above the road provide additional regulatory and navigation information.

''Services'' use roads.  Buses may provide scheduled services between points with stops along the way.  Coaches provide scheduled point-to-point without stops.  Taxis handle irregular passenger trips.

''Drivers'' and ''passengers'' use services or drive their own vehicle (producing their own transportation services) to create an ''end-to-end trip'', between an origin and destination. Each origin and destination comprises a ''trip end'' and those trip ends are only important because of the ''places'' at the ends and the activity that can be engaged in.  As transportation is a derived demand, if not for those activities, essentially no passenger travel would be undertaken.

With modern information technologies, we may need to consider additional systems, such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), differential GPS, beacons, transponders, and so on that may aide the steering or navigation processes. Cameras, in-pavement detectors, cell phones, and other systems monitor the use of the road and may be important in providing feedback for real-time control of signals or vehicles.

Each layer has rules of behavior: 
* some rules are physical and never violated, others are physical but probabilistic 
* some are legal rules or social norms which are occasionally violated

== Hierarchy of Roads ==

[[Image:FOT-Planning-Hierarchy.png|thumb|500px|Hierarchy of roads]]
Even within each layer of the system of systems described above, there is differentiation.

Transportation facilities have two distinct functions: through movement and land access. This differentiation:
* permits the aggregation of traffic to achieve economies of scale in construction and operation (high speeds); 
* reduces the number of conflicts;  
* helps maintain the desired quiet character of residential neighborhoods by keeping through traffic away from homes; 
* contains less redundancy, and so may be less costly to build.

== Model Elements ==

Transportation forecasting, to be discussed in more depth in subsequent modules, abstracts the real world into a simplified representation.

Recall the hierarchy of roads.  What can be simplified? It is typical for a regional forecasting model to eliminate local streets and replace them with a centroid (a point representing a traffic analysis zone). Centroids are the source and sink of all transportation demand on the network. Centroid connectors are artificial or dummy links connecting the centroid to the &quot;real&quot; network. An illustration of traffic analysis zones can be found at this external link for Fulton County, Georgia, here: [http://wms.co.fulton.ga.us/apps/doc_archive/get.php/69253.pdf traffic zone map, 3MB].  Keep in mind that ''Models are abstractions''.

=== Network ===

* Zone Centroid -	special node whose  number identifies a zone, located by an &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; coordinate representing longitude and latitude (sometimes &quot;x&quot; and  &quot;y&quot; are identified using planar coordinate systems).
* Node (vertices) - intersection of links ,  located by ''x'' and ''y'' coordinates
* Links (arcs) - short road segments indexed by from and to nodes (including centroid connnectors), attributes include lanes, capacity per lane, allowable modes
* Turns - indexed by at, from, and to nodes
* Routes, (paths) - indexed by a series of nodes from origin to destination. (e.g. a bus route)
* Modes - car, bus, HOV, truck, bike, walk etc.

=== Matrices ===

==== Scalar ====

A scalar is a single value that applies model-wide; e.g. the price of gas or total trips.

{| border=&quot;3&quot;
! !! Total Trips 
|-
! Variable
| T
|}

==== Vectors ====

Vectors are values that apply to particular zones in the model system, such as trips produced or trips attracted or number of households. They are arrayed separately when 
treating a zone as an origin or as a destination so that they can be combined into full matrices.

* vector (origin) - a column of numbers indexed by traffic zones, describing attributes at the origin of the trip (e.g. the number of households in a zone)

{| border=&quot;3&quot;
! !! Trips Produced at Origin Zone !! 
|-
! Origin Zone 1
| T&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt; 
|-
! Origin Zone 2
| T&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! Origin Zone 3
| T&lt;sub&gt;i3&lt;/sub&gt; 
|}

* vector (destination) - a row of numbers indexed by traffic zones, describing attributes at the destination

{| border=&quot;3&quot;
! !! Destination Zone 1 !! Destination Zone 2 !! Destination Zone 3
|-
! Trips Attracted to Destination Zone
| T&lt;sub&gt;j1&lt;/sub&gt; || T&lt;sub&gt;j2&lt;/sub&gt;  || T&lt;sub&gt;j3&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

==== Full Matrices ====

A full or interaction matrix is a table of numbers, describing attributes of the origin-destination pair

{| border=&quot;3&quot;
! !! Destination Zone 1 !! Destination Zone 2 !! Destination Zone 3
|-
! Origin Zone 1
| T&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; || T&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;  || T&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! Origin Zone 2
| T&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; || T&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;  || T&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! Origin Zone 3
| T&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; || T&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;  || T&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

== External Exercises ==

Use the ADAM software at the [http://street.umn.edu STREET website] and examine the network structure. Familiarize yourself with the software, and edit the network, adding at least two nodes and four one-way links (two two-way links), and deleting nodes and links.  What are the consequences of such network adjustments?  Are some adjustments better than others?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Decision Making''' is the process by which one alternative is selected over another.  Decision making generally occurs in the planning phases of  transportation projects, but last minute decision making has been shown to occur, sometimes successfully.  Several procedures for making decisions have been outlined in effort to minimize inefficiencies or redundancies. These are idealized (or normative) processes, and describe how decisions might be made in an ideal world, and how they are described in official documents. Real-world processes are not as orderly.

'''Applied systems analysis''' is the use of rigorous methods to assist in determining optimal plans, designs and solutions to large scale problems through the application of analytical methods. Applied systems analysis focuses upon the use of methods, concepts and relationships between problems and the range of techniques available. Any problem  can have multiple solutions. The optimal solution will depend upon technical feasibility (engineering) and costs and valuation (economics). Applied systems analysis is an attempt to move away from the engineering practice of design detail and to integrate feasible engineering solutions with desirable economic solutions. The systems designer faces the same problem as the economist, &quot;efficient resource allocation&quot; for a given objective function.

Systems analysis emerged during World War II, especially with the deployment of radar in a coordinated way. It spread to other fields such as fighter tactics, mission planning and weapons evaluation. Ultimately the use of mathematical techniques in such problems came to be known as operations research, while other statistical and econometric techniques are being applied. Optimization applies to cases where data is under-determined (fewer observations than dependent variables) and statistics where data is over-determined (more observations than dependent variables). After World War II, techniques spread to universities. Systems analysis saw further mathematical development and application to a broad variety of problems. 

It has been said of Systems Analysis, that it is:
* &quot;A coordinated set of procedures which addresses the fundamental issues of design and management: that of specifying how men, money and materials should be combined to achieve a higher purpose&quot; - De Neufville
* &quot;... primarily a methodology, a philosophical approach to solving problems for  and for planning innovative advances&quot; - Baker
* &quot;Professionals who endeavor to analyze systematically the choices available to public and private agencies in making changes in the transportation system and services in a particular region&quot; - Manheim
* &quot;Systems analysis is not easy to write about: brief, one sentence definitions frequently are trivial&quot; - Thomas


The most prominent decision-making process to emerge from systems analysis is '''[[w:Rational_planning_model|rational planning]]''', which will be discussed next, followed by some critiques and alternatives.

[[Image:TE-Systems-RationalPlanningAndDecisionMaking.png]]


''How does one (rationally) decide what to do?''

The figure identifies three layers of abstraction. The first layer (top row) describes the high level process, which we can summarize in six steps. A second layer details many of the components of the first layer. A third layer, identified by the blue box, &quot;abstract into model or framework&quot; depends on the problem at hand

== Overview data ==

The first step is observational, review and gather data about the system under consideration. An understanding of the world around is required, including specifying the system.

The problem (defined in the next step) lies within a larger system, that comprises
# Objectives - measure the effectiveness or performance
# Environment - things which affect the system but are not affected by it
# Resources - factor inputs to do the work
# Components - set of activities or tasks of the system
# Management - sets goals, allocates resources and exercises control over components
# Model of how variables in 1-5 relate to each other

the detailed objectives are identified in the following step, and the detailed model for analysis of the problem is specified in the step after that.


&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
For instance in the case of intercity transportation in California, data about existing demand conditions, existing supply conditions, future demand expectations, and proposed changes to supply would be important inputs. Changes in technology and environmental conditions are important considerations for long-term projects. We would also want to know the certainty of the forecasts, not just a central tendency, and the potential for alternative scenarios which may be widely different.
&lt;/div&gt;

== Define the problem ==

The second step is to ''define the problem'' more narrowly, in a sense to ''identify needs''. 


&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
Rather than an amorphous issue (intercity transportation), we might be interested in a more detailed question, e.g. how to serve existing and future demands between two cities (say metropolitan Los Angeles and San Francisco). The problem might be that demand is expected to grow and outstrip supply.
&lt;/div&gt;

== Formulate goal ==

The third step is to formulate a goal. For major transportation projects, or projects with intense community interest, this may involve the public. 

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
In this step, the 
''To serve future passenger demand between Los Angeles and San Francisco, quickly, safely, cleanly, and inexpensively.''
&lt;/div&gt;

The goal will need to be testable, the process below &quot;formulate goal&quot; in the flowchart suggests this process in more detail. 

The first aspect is to operationalize the goal. We need to measure the adverbs in the goal (e.g. how do we measure &quot;quickly&quot;, &quot;safely&quot;, &quot;cleanly&quot;, or &quot;inexpensively&quot;). Some are straight-forward. &quot;Quickly&quot; is a measure of travel time or speed. But it needs to account for both the access and egress time, the waiting time, and the travel time, and these may not be weighted the same.

The second step is identifying the decision criteria. Each adverb may have a certain value, but it might be that an alternative has not merely have the most points in one area, but establish at least minimum satisfactory points in all areas. So a very fast mode must meet a specific safety test, and going faster does not necessarily mean it can also be more dangerous (despite what a rational economist might think about trade-offs).

The third is to weight those criteria. E.g. how important is speed vs. safety? This is in many ways a value question, though economics can try to value each of these aspects in monetary form, enabling [[Transportation Economics/Evaluation|Evaluation]]. For instance, many [[Transportation Economics/Negative externalities|Negative externalities]] have been monetized, giving a value of time in delay, a value of pollution damages, and a value of life.

== Generate alternatives ==

''Examining, evaluating, and recommending alternatives'' is often the job of professionals, engineers, planners, and economists. Final selection is generally the job of elected or appointed officials for important projects.  

There are several sub-problems here, the first is to ''generate alternatives''. This may require significant creativity. Within major alternatives, there may be many sub-alternatives, e.g. the main alternative may be mode of travel, the sub-alternatives may be different alignments. For network problems there may be many combinations of alternative alignments. If the analyst is lucky, these are ''separable problems'', that is, the choice of one sub-alignment is independent of the choice of alternative sub-alignments.  


# Algorithms-systematic search over available alternatives
## Analytical
## Exact numerical
## Heuristic numerical
# Generate alternatives selectively, evaluate subjectively
## Fatal flaw analysis
## Simple rating schemes
## Delphi exercises
# Generate alternatives judgmentally, evaluate scientifically using system model

A critical issue is how many alternatives to consider. In principle, an infinite number of more or less similar alternatives may be generated, not all are practical, and some may be minor variations. In practice a stopping rule to consider a reasonable number of alternatives is used. Major exemplars of the alternatives may be used, with fine-tuning awaiting a later step after the first set of alternatives is analyzed. The process may be iterative, winnowing down alternatives and detailing alternatives as more information is gained throughout the analysis.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
Several major alternatives may be suggested, expand highways, expand air travel, or construct new high-speed rail line, along with a no-build alternative.
&lt;/div&gt;

== Abstract into model or framework ==
&quot;All Models are Wrong, Some Models are Less Wrong than Others&quot; -- Anonymous

&quot;All Models are Wrong, Some Models are Useful&quot; -- George Box &lt;ref&gt;Box, G.E.P., Robustness in the strategy of scientific model building, in Robustness in Statistics, R.L. Launer and G.N. Wilkinson, Editors. 1979, Academic Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Model''' refers here to a ''mathematical representation of a system'', while a  '''Framework''' is a ''qualitative organizing principle for analyzing a system''. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably.


=== Framework Example: Porter’s Diamond  of Advantage ===
&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

[[Image:TE-Systems-Porter's Diamond.jpg | thumb| right|250px| Michael Porter's Diamond of Advantage]]

To illustrate the idea of a framework, consider Porter's ''Diamond of Advantage''

Michael Porter proposes four key determinants of competitiveness, which he calls the &quot;Diamond of Advantage,&quot; based on cases from around the world: 
# factor conditions, such as a specialized labor pool, specialized infrastructure and sometimes selective disadvantages that drive innovation; 
# home demand, or local customers who push companies to innovate, especially if their tastes or needs anticipate global demand; 
# related and supporting industries, specifically internationally competitive local supplier industries, creating a high quality, supportive business infrastructure, and spurring innovation and spin-off industries; and 
# industry strategy/rivalry, involving both intense local rivalry among area industries that is more motivating than foreign competition and as well as a local &quot;culture&quot; which influences individual industries' attitudes toward innovation and competition. 

&lt;/div&gt;

=== Model Example: The Four-Step Urban Transportation Planning System ===
&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

Within the rational planning framework, transportation forecasts have traditionally followed the sequential four-step model or urban transportation planning (UTP) procedure, first implemented on mainframe computers in the 1950s at the Detroit Area Transportation Study and Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS).

Land use forecasting sets the stage for the process. Typically, forecasts are made for the region as a whole, e.g., of population growth. Such forecasts provide control totals for the local land use analysis. Typically, the region is divided into zones and by trend or regression analysis, the population and employment are determined for each.

The four steps of the classical urban transportation planning system model are:
* [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Trip Generation|Trip generation]] determines the frequency of origins or destinations of trips in each zone by trip purpose, as a function of land uses and household demographics, and other socio-economic factors.
* [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Destination Choice|Destination choice]] matches origins with destinations, often using a gravity model function, equivalent to an entropy maximizing model. Older models include the fratar model.
* [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Mode Choice|Mode choice]] computes the proportion of trips between each origin and destination that use a particular transportation mode. This model is often of the logit form, developed by Nobel Prize winner Daniel McFadden.
* [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Route Choice|Route choice]] allocates trips between an origin and destination by a particular mode to a route. Often (for highway route assignment) Wardrop's principle of user equilibrium is applied, wherein  each traveler chooses the shortest (travel time) path, subject to every other driver doing the same. The difficulty is that travel times are a function of demand, while demand is a function of travel time. 
&lt;/div&gt;

See '''[[Fundamentals of Transportation/Modeling|Modeling]]''' for a deeper discussion of modeling questions.

== Ascertain performance ==

This is either an output of the analytical model, or the result of subjective judgment.

Sherden&lt;ref&gt;Sherden, William (1998) The Fortune Sellers, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies a number of major techniques for technological forecasting that can be used to ascertain expected performance of particular technologies, but that can be used within a technology to ascertain the performance of individual projects. These are listed in the following box:

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
&quot;Major techniques for technological forecasting &lt;ref&gt;Figure 6.4, p. 167 Major techniques for technological forecasting, in Sherden, William (1998) The Fortune Sellers, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Delphi method: a brain-storming session with a panel of experts.
* Nominal group process: a variant of the Delphi method with a group leader.
* Case study method: an analysis of analogous developments in other technologies.
* Trend analysis: the use of statistical analysis to extend past trends into the future.
* S-curve: a form of trend analysis using an s-shaped curve to extend past trends into the future.
* Correlation analysis: the projection of development of a new technology past developments in similar technologies.
* Lead-user analysis: the analysis of leading-edge users of a new technology predict how the technology will develop.
* Analytic hierarchy process: the projection of a new technology by analyzing a hierarchy of forces influencing its development.
* Systems dynamics: the use of a detailed model to assess the dynamic relationships among the major forces influencing the development of the technology.
* Cross-impact analysis: the analysis of potentially interrelated future events that may affect the future development of a technology.
* Relevance trees: the breakdown of goals for a technology into more detailed goals and then assigning probabilities that the technology will achieve these detail goals.
* Scenario writing: the development of alternative future views on how the new technology could be used.&quot;
&lt;/div&gt;

== Rate alternatives ==

The performance of each of the alternatives is compared across decision criteria, and weighted depending on the importance of those criteria. The alternative with the highest ranking would be identified, and this information would be brought forward to decision-makers.


== Compute optimal decision ==

The analyst is generally not the decision maker. The actual influence of the results of the analysis in actual decisions will depend on:
# Determinacy of evaluation
# Confidence in the results on the part of the decision maker
# Consistency of rating among alternatives

== Implement alternatives==

A decision is made. A project is constructed or a program implemented.

== Evaluate outcome ==

''Evaluating outcomes'' of a project includes comparing outcome against goals, but also against predictions, so that forecasting procedures can be improved. Analysis and implementation experience  lead to revisions in systems definition, and may affect the  values that underlay that definition.
The output from this &quot;last&quot; step in is used as input to earlier steps in subsequent analyses. See e.g. [http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.tranpol.2010.04.010 Parthasarathi, Pavithra and David Levinson (2010) Post-Construction Evaluation of Trafﬁc Forecast Accuracy. ''Transport Policy'' ]

== Relationship to other models ==

We need a tool to &quot;Identify Needs&quot; and &quot;Evaluate Options&quot;. This may be the [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Modeling|transportation forecasting model]].

== Problem PRT: Skyweb Express ==

The Metropolitan Council of Governments (the region's main transportation planning agency) is examining whether the Twin Cities should build a new Personal Rapid Transit system in downtown Minneapolis, and they have asked you to recommend how it should be analyzed

1. What kind of model should be used.  Why?

2. What data should be collected.  

Form groups of 3 and take 15 minutes and think about what kinds of models you want to run and what data you want to collect, what questions you would ask, and how it should be collected.  Each group should have a note-taker, but all members of the group should be able to present findings to the class.

&lt;/div&gt;

== Thought Questions ==

* Is the &quot;rational planning&quot; process rational?
* Compare and contrast the rational planning process with the [[w:scientific method|scientific method]]?

== Some Issues with Rational Planning ==
Nevertheless, some issues remain with the rational planning model: 

=== Problems of incomplete information ===
* Limited Computational Capacity
* Limited Solution Generating Capacity
* Limited input data
* Cost of Analysis

=== Problems of incompatible desires ===
* Conflicting Goals
* Conflicting Evaluation Criteria
* Reliance on Experts (What about the People?)

== Alternative Planning Decision Making Paradigms:  Are They Irrational? ==
No one really believes the rational planning process is a good description of most decision making, as it is highly idealized.  Alternatives normative and positive paradigms to the rational planning process include: 

Several strategies normatively address the problems associated with incomplete information:
* [[w:Satisficing|Satisficing]]
* [[w:Decomposition_(computer_science)|Decomposition]] hierarchically into Strategy/Tactics/Operations.

Other strategies describe how organizations and political systems work:
* [[w:Organizational studies|Organizational Process]]
* [[w:Public choice theory|Political Bargaining]]

Some do both:
* [[w:Incrementalism|Incrementalism]]

The paper [http://nexus.umn.edu/Papers/DecisionRules.pdf Montes de Oca, Norah and David Levinson (2006) Network Expansion Decision-making in the Twin Cities.'' Journal of the Transportation Research Board: Transportation Research Record'' #1981 pp 1-11 ] describes the actual decision making process for road construction in the Twin Cities

Apologies.  I haven't edited here for a little while and the above template has been changed and appears to be quite threatening.  What I intended to say was that a recent edit of yours appeared to be unconstructive or inappropriate and that it was reverted.  If you feel that it was justified then I apologise.

[[Image:Serbia in Europe (de-facto).svg|thumb|200px|right|Map showing location of Serbia in Europe (excluding Kosovo)]]
'''Serbia''' (''Република Србија / Republika Srbija'' in Serbian language) is a country located in south eastern Europe in the Balkan peninsula.  Its neighbours are [[Wikijunior:Europe/Bosnia Herzegovina|Bosnia &amp; Hercegovina]], [[../Croatia|Croatia]], [[../Hungary|Hungary]], [[../Romania|Romania]], [[../Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[../Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[../Albania|Albania]] and [[../Montenegro|Montenegro]] (which was part of a union between Serbia and Montenegro until 2006).  Within Serbia there are officially two autonomous regions: '''Vojvodina and Kosovo Metohija''', however, in February 2008 [[w:Kosovo|Kosovo]] declared itself independent from Serbia although the many countries in the world have not recognised this independence including Serbia.  The capital of Serbia is '''[[w:Belgrade|Belgrade]]'''.  Other big cities in Serbia are Novi Sad and Niš.  The currency of Serbia is the [[w:dinar|dinar]].

==Serbia's History==

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Yugoslavia|This country included present-day Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo and Slovenia.  It existed until 1992 and when the country broke up there were wars - a 10 day war in Slovenia, a big conflict in Croatia, a war lasting several years in Bosnia and fighting between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo}}

Serbia has a long history and has been part of many different countries and empires over the centuries including the Roman Empire, Ottoman Empire and, more recently, [[../Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].  During the 1990s Serbia (the dominant part of Yugoslavia, especially after other countries became independent) fought several wars directly or indirectly in the region.  The Yugoslav Army (mostly under the command of Serbs) fought wars in Slovenia and Croatia and the Yugoslav Government (then consisting of just Serbia and Montenegro) aided and funded paramilitary groups during the '''Bosnian War'''.  At the end of the 1990s Serbia was '''bombed by NATO''' and withdrew from Kosovo (which is populated mostly by Albanians but considered to be the birthplace of the Serbian people and their church).

[[Image:Gradac_river_near_Valjevo.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Gradac River]]

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization - this group of countries includes most of western Europe, Canada and the USA.  At the end of the 1990s NATO bombed military and civilian targets in Serbia (and Montenegro) because of human rights violations in Kosovo.  Following these bombings Serbia withdrew from Kosovo.  In 2008 Kosovo declared itself independent.}}
==Serbia's Geography==
Serbia a [[w:landlocked|landlocked]] country in Central and South-eastern Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central part of the Balkan Peninsula. Serbia is bordered by Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; the Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to the west.

The Serbian climate varies between a continental climate in the north, with cold winters, and hot, humid summers, and a more Adriatic climate in the south with hot, dry summers and autumns and relatively cold winters with heavy inland snowfall.

At 2656 metres, '''[[w:Prokletije|Prokletije]] is Serbia's highest mountain''' although this mountain is located in Kosovo.   The highest mountain entirely within Serbia is [[w:Stara planina|Stara planina]] at 2168 metres.
==Serbia's People==
[[Image:Flag of Serbia (national).svg|200px|thumb|right|The national flag of Serbia.]]
The people of Serbia are a mixture of many nationalities.  '''7 million people live in Serbia'''.  The majority of people who live in Serbia are Serbian.  Other nationalities include Hungarians, Muslims (Serbian and Bosnian), Albanians, Slovaks and Roma.

The most spoken language is [[Wikijunior:Languages/Serbian|Serbian]] but many people speak other languages like [[Wikijunior:Languages/Hungarian|Hungarian]] and [[Wikijunior:Languages/Albanian|Albanian]].

Most people in Serbia are Orthodox [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Christians]] but there are also large numbers of [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Islam|Muslims]] and Catholics (especially in Vojvodina).  

[[Image:Saint Sava Temple.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[w:Cathedral of Saint Sava|Saint Sava Temple]] in Belgrade]]

==Serbia's Sights==
Tourism in Serbia is mostly focused on the villages and mountains of the country. The most famous mountain resorts are [[Wikipedia:Zlatibor|Zlatibor]], [[Wikipedia:Kopaonik|Kopaonik]], and the [[Wikipedia:Tara_Mountain|Tara]]. There are also many spas in Serbia, one the biggest of which is [[Wikipedia:Vrnjačka Banja|Vrnjačka Banja]]. Other spas include Soko Banja and Niška Banja. There is a significant amount of tourism in the largest cities like Belgrade, Novi Sad and Niš, but also in the rural parts of Serbia like the volcanic wonder of Đavolja varoš, Christian pilgrimage across the country and the cruises along the Danube, Sava or Tisza. There are several popular festivals held in Serbia, such as the '''EXIT Festival''' and the Guča trumpet festival.  Nightlife in Belgrade and Novi Sad is popular with locals and tourists alike and the largest clubs in Belgrade attract clubbers from all over south-eastern Europe.

There are 4 [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] in Serbia including a collection of monasteries and churches located in Kosovo.  '''Gamzigrad-Romuliana,  Palace of Galerius''' in the east of the country dates back to the 3rd Century CE and was built by the Romans.  Studenica Monastery, in the west, is Serbia's largest monastery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''odometry_track'' module implements the [[w:Odometry|odometry]] equations for a differential-drive vehicle and allows to track the robot's position (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;) over time.
[http://fosamaxclassaction.edublogs.org/ Fosamax Class Action blog]

== Synopsis ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Instantiate a track structure
struct sOdometryTrack ot;

// Initialize the module
odometry_track_init();

// Start tracking and set initial position
odometry_track_start(&amp;ot);
ot.result.x = 0;
ot.result.y = 0;
ot.result.theta = 0;

// Main loop
while (1) {
    ...

    // Call this frequently to update the position estimate
    odometry_track_step(&amp;ot);
    ... = ot.result.x;
    ... = ot.result.y;
    ... = ot.result.theta;

    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Description ==

'''odometry_track_start''' sets up a ''sOdometryTrack'' structure and reads the odometry calibration values from ''/etc/khepera/odometry''. If that file is not available (or does not contain a valid configuration), default values are used. After calling this function, the initial position can be changed by modifying the ''result'' fields of the structure. '''odometry_track_start''' also reads the current motor positions and should therefore be called immediately before entering the main loop.

Inside the main loop, '''odometry_track_step''' is called to read the new motor positions and update the position estimate in the ''result'' fields.

== Calibration ==

The default calibration values should give acceptable results on most Khepera III robots. Through a [[Khepera III Toolbox/Examples/odometry_calibration|calibration procedure]], the precision can be significantly improved, however.

== Providing Motor Positions from Other Sources ==

The functions mentioned above read the motor positions automatically with the ''khepera3_drive_getposition'' function. If this is not desired, the functions '''odometry_track_start_pos''' and '''odometry_track_step_pos''' can be used.

[[Image:Europe_location_AZE.png|thumb|250px|right|Map showing location of Azerbaijan (in green) in Europe]]
'''Azerbaijan''' is a medium-sized country in the South Caucasus region of Europe.  Until 1991, Azerbaijan was a part of the Soviet Union (USSR).  The capital city is '''[[w:Baku|Baku]]''' and the country shares borders with [[../Russia|Russia]], [[../Georgia|Georgia]], [[../Armenia|Armenia]], Iran and [[../Turkey|Turkey]].  Azerbaijan is not part of the [[../EU|European Union]] and uses the ''Manat'' as its currency.

==Azerbaijan's History==
[[Image:Flag_of_Azerbaijan.svg|thumb|left|250px|The flag of Azerbaijan.]]
[[File:Walls of the fortress of the Baku Old City (Azerbaijan) - 10-12centuries1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Walled City, Baku]]
The area of present-day Azerbaijan was settled beginning in about the 8th century BC by the Medes, an ancient Aryan tribe. It became part of the Persian Empire in the 6th century BC. Between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, the Romans conquered the area of present-day Azerbaijan. Christianity began to spread there in the 3rd century. In 1920 the Azerbaijani were taken over by the [[../USSR|Soviet Union]] or the USSR. In 1991 Azerbaijan became independent from the Soviet Union.  After becoming independent, Azerbaijan and Armenia fought as war called the '''Nagorno-Karabakh War''' which killed more than 30,000 people on both sides.  Since the 1990s Azerbaijan has become more prosperous, mostly because of large amounts of oil.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Soviet Union|The Soviet Union was a communist country which included 15 modern-day countries including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, Ukraine and many others}}

==Azerbaijan's Geography==
[[File:Gobustan_ancient_Azerbaycan_full.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Petroglyphs in Gobustan, Azerbaijan, dating back to 10,000 BC]]
Azerbaijan covers an area of about 86,600 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (about 33,400 sq mi). Azerbaijan borders the '''Caspian Sea''' to the east, Georgia and Russia to the north, Iran to the south, and Armenia to the south-west and west. The capital of Azerbaijan is the ancient city of Baku, which has the largest and best harbour on the Caspian Sea. 

Azerbaijan is located in both Europe and Asia.  The highest mountain in the country is [[w:Bazardüzü|Bazardüzü]] which is 4466 metres above sea level.  Another interesting feature of Azerbaijan are the [[w:mud volcano|mud volcanoes]] - half of all mud volcanoes in the world are situated in Azerbaijan.

==Azerbaijan's People==
The population of Azerbaijan is just under 10 million. Azerbaijani, [[Wikijunior:Languages/Russian|Russian]], Lezgin,and Talysh are the languages that are spoken by the people who live in the country. The national language is Azerbaijani or Azeri and almost 93 percent of the population speak it. 

People from Azerbaijan are called Azerbaijani or Azeris; Dagestanis and Russians are the largest minority groups in Azerbaijan, followed by Armenians. The majority of people in the country are considered [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Islam|Muslim]] but there are also small numbers of Orthodox [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Christians]].

Some adults in Azerbaijan can read and write. Education is required for the first eight years, but some children continue their education.

==Azerbaijan's Sights==
Azerbaijan has two [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]: '''The Walled City of Baku''' (and Shirvanshahs' Palace and the Maiden Tower) all in the capital, Baku and '''Gobustan Rock Art''' - a site full of ancient art from 4,000 to 40,000 years ago.

Tourism was extremely popular during the 1980s but because of wars in the 1990s tourists went elsewhere.  Tourism has only recently become important again in Azerbaijan.  Religious, spa and health care tourism is becoming more and more popular every year.  Castles, national parks, two Heritage Sites, skiing in the winter and swimming in the summer are activities that tourists can do while visiting Azerbaijan.

==1. Know the primary colors, the secondary colors, and how to mix the primary colors to obtain the secondary colors. ==
Red, Blue and Yellow are the primary colors. Green, Violet, and Orange are the secondary colors. Red and Blue make Violet. Blue and Yellow make Green. Red and Yellow make Orange.

{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Primary_and_secondary_colors}}

==2. Know the materials used in painting, mounting, and hanging a glass painting. ==
* Glass
* Paint
** transparent paints - allow light to pass through them
** opaque paints - achieve the desired color, but are not transparent
** Other mediums for frosted, iridescent, or crackling effects
* Paint brush
* Sponges - can be used instead of or in addition to paint brushes.  Good if you want to paint the entire surface a single color.
* Rubbing alcohol - for cleaning the glass before painting.  Don't paint dirty glass!
* Paper towel - also for cleaning.
* Sticky stencils (optional)
* Patterns - can be placed on the inside of a glass and then the design can be copied (similar to tracing).

==3. Make and display a glass painting for each of the following designs: animal, flower, and landscape or seascape. ==
Begin by thoroughly cleaning the glass with alcohol and a paper towel.  You can use a picture frame (paint right on the backside of the glass), a drinking glass, or a jar.  For glasses and jars, place the pattern on the inside of the vessel.  It will help if you tape the pattern to the glass (flat or round) so it doesn't move around as you paint.

Then begin your painting.  If you drip paint on the glass by accident do not despair.  Once it dries you can scrape it off with an X-acto knife, but care must be taken.  You don't want to cut yourself or scrape off too much of the surrounding work.  If paint drips on an unpainted section, you can simply wipe it off before it dries.

If painting on a round object, your painting surface will likely be oriented in a vertical position.  Be careful not to use too much paint in the brush, or dripping can almost be guaranteed.

If using a picture frame, a background can be cut from matte or poster board, and the paint can be applied on the reverse side of the glass.

When painting on the reverse side of the glass, the painting can be realistic or abstract. Realistic reverse paintings are more challenging to create as one must, for example, in painting a face, to put the pupil of an eye on the glass before the iris, exactly the opposite of normal painting. If this is neglected the artist will not be able to correct the error as he will not get in between the glass and the paint already applied.  In other words, you must work from the foreground to the background rather than painting the back ground and then laying a foreground over it.

==4. Make a silhouette painting and mount for hanging. ==
A silhouette is a view of an object or scene consisting of the outline and a featureless interior, with the silhouetted object usually being black. The term was initially applied in the 18th century to portraits or other pictorial representations cut from thin black card.

The term has been extended to describe the sight or image of a person, object or scene that is backlit, and appears dark against a lighter background.

To make a silhouette on glass, it is easiest to start with a picture frame.  Place a reverse-image pattern behind the glass and color it with opaque black paint on the reverse side of the glass.  Allow this to dry, and then (if desired) paint a background over the silhouette using colors.  As long as the original layer of black paint is dry, it will not be affected by the background you lay over it.  The finished product should be viewed from the front. 

The background is not necessary, or it can be a printed design on a piece of stock card or paper that lies behind the glass in a frame.  The silhouette can be the main feature of the piece, or it can be an accent if placed off to the side, in a corner, or along an edge of the glass.

Here is a small gallery of images to give you a few ideas:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Statue of Liberty, Silhouette.jpg
File:Wilhelm Gross-4.jpg
File:Makes me wanna jump.jpg
File:Bear-Cave.PNG
File:Bat shadow black.svg
File:Wolf.svg
File:Bactrian.camel.sideon.arp-2.png
File:Horseicon.svg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==5. Make a hand-painted mirror picture by removing the back coating of the mirror from the picture area and painting the design on the back of the mirror glass.==
Decide where on the mirror you would like to paint the design.  Do you want it in the center?  In a corner?  Once you decided, flip the mirror over and use masking tape to mask around the area you wish to paint.  Remember that this is a reverse-image, so if you wanted your picture to appear on the right, you will have to mark the area on the left.  Once the area is masked, apply some paint stripper to the area within the tape.  Read and follow the directions for the paint stripper.  It will tell you how long to let it set before scraping.  It will also tell you what kind of gloves you will need to protect your skin.

Once the paint stripper has done its work, you should be able to scrape most of the paint off and rinse the mirror.  If you can't get it all scraped off, use steel wool to get that last little bit.

With the mirror backing removed, you should now have a transparent area in which to paint your picture.  

Reverse painting on glass is an art form consisting of applying paint to a piece of glass and then viewing the image by turning the glass over and looking through the glass at the image.

This art form has been around for many years. A number of clock faces were created using this technique in the early to mid 1800s, but it started to become popular again in the late 1990s. The painting can be realistic or painting. Realistic reverse paintings are more challenging to create as one must, for example, in painting a face, to put the pupil of an eye on the glass before the iris, exactly the opposite of normal painting. If this is neglected the artist will not be able to correct the error as he will not get in between the glass and the paint already applied. No such care need be taken with the abstract form, but with this form you do not have a good idea what the piece will look like until you are finished painting it. This process is not like stained or leaded glass work in that it is not intended to hang in a window with light coming through the piece. Hanging on a wall, framed or unframed, with a lot of light directed towards the piece provides best viewing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Average fixed cost==
[[Image:HouFixedCost.png|400px]]

The above graph adopts the axes we will be using quite often in economics: quantity on the x and price on the y. Fixed costs for a firm are unchanging but are spread over additional units, resulting in lower average fixed costs.

==Total fixed cost==
[[Image:FixedCost2.png|400px]]

At any particular production point, we can show the total fixed cost as the pink rectangle. No matter where the gray line is placed, the area of the pink rectangle will be constant. Average is the height at a particular point; total is the area.

==Average and marginal variable cost==
[[Image:HouVariableCost.png| 400px]]

The green curve is the marginal cost, the cost of producing an additional unit of a good and includes only variable cost (no fixed cost). This curve starts very high but rapidly falls through increasing returns to scale (increasing productivity), then starts rising as resources become more scarce and costly and/or less suitable. The pink average variable cost curve trails the marginal cost, rising when marginal cost is higher than the average and falling when marginal cost is lower. The average variable cost is flat at the point when it is the same as the marginal cost.

==Individual Supply==
[[Image:VariableCost2.png|400px]]

The new pink line, average total cost, combines average fixed cost with average variable cost. This leads to the firm's individual supply curve, which is for intents identical to the marginal cost and so also colored green.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Firm's production position==
[[Image:HouFirmSupply.png|600px]]

(Review the section on firm's costs if this looks strange.) 

Long term, the firm produces at the point where marginal cost (and hence supply curve) intersects average total cost because at any higher point additional firms enter the industry and at any lower point the firm will earn negative profits (to be discussed later). This position is represented by the green point at Q*, equilibrium quantity. Extending this point to the y axis, we call this price P*, equilibrium price. The firm has to consider its fixed costs, which it satisfies at this level of output and price, along the green supply curve. 

==Market long run supply==
[[Image:HouSupply2.png|600px]]

In perfect competition, all the firms are more or less equal, in which the combination of their individual supply curves results in another market supply curve identical to them except that it is a multiple as large (stretched). (However, we will continue to show it as the same size.) We can remove everything else about the firm to see just this green supply curve. The 'common' component of the supply curve that textbooks often discuss is the positive-slope half, but we cannot ignore the first component. 

==Firm's short run minimum position==
[[Image:HouSupply3.png|600px]]

The minimum position at which the firm will produce instead of shutting down is shown by this alternative green point along its marginal cost / supply curve, where it intersects average variable cost. If a firm cannot sell for as much as what it costs to produce that additional unit (ignoring the fixed cost, which is unavoidable in the short run), and the units before that are unproductive as well, then the firm will close down and choose to suffer the fixed cost and not incur additional expenses from operating. 

==Firm's short and long run positions==
[[Image:HouSupply4.png|600px]]

Here both short and long run minimum positions for a firm's continued operation are shown. The long run position involves more output, indicating that a firm producing zero profits will produce at a higher level than one that is incurring losses from fixed costs will. It also requires a higher market price at P*, indicating that an industry has to be more profitable than the bare minimum for operating in the short run, in order to be worth it for the firm to not shut down. Producing at the long run position - where marginal cost/supply and hence market price (for supposedly all producers are doing the same thing) equals average total cost, ensures that the fixed costs are covered.

      <comment>/* Budgets at differing incomes */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Budget==
[[Image:Budget.png|600px]]

This is the basic budget curve (often a line). Its slope is an indication of relative prices (opportunity cost of one good for another) because at any point along the line one has to give up something for more of another. The point indicated by the gray lines is one way of dividing up the budget (in quantity of money terms) between two goods (in quantity terms).

==Budgets at differing incomes==
[[Image:HouBudget2.png|600px]]

Different incomes will have differing budget constraint positions. Lower incomes will be closer to the origin, while higher incomes are farther. As the graph shows, higher incomes allow one to buy more of one or both goods without necessarily having to give up some of any good.

==Budgets and changing prices==
[[Image:HouBudget3.png|600px]]

When the price of the good with price along x axis (good Q1 in this case) increases in comparison with the other good, the budget constraint rotates clockwise. This is because the budget can no longer buy as much of the first good (1). When the other good's (2) price increases, the constraint rotates counterclockwise, indicating fewer bought (Q2). 

==Increase in cost of good 1==
[[Image:HouBudget4.png|600px]]

When there is an increase in the cost of good 1, the consequences will be most severe for one who buys all good 1 and no good 2, while it will have no effect on those who buy all good 2, hence the y intersection does not change while the x intersection changes notably. The increase moves the new x intercept closer to the origin, indicating fewer can be bought. A decrease in price would move the new x intercept to the right. If the quantity of good 1 purchased is to remain constant, some of good 2 will be sacrificed, and vice versa.

==Increase in cost of good 2==
[[Image:HouBudget5.png|600px]]

When there is an increase in the cost of good 2, a similar situation occurs, except that the axes to which the changes act on are changed.

      <comment>/* Variations in alcohol */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Bloody Mary''' is a popular cocktail containing vodka, tomato juice, and usually other spices or flavorings such as [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]], [[Cookbook:Tabasco Sauce|Tabasco sauce]], beef consommé or [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|bouillon]], [[Cookbook:horseradish|horseradish]], [[Cookbook:celery|celery]], [[Cookbook:salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:pepper|black pepper]], [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]], [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]], and [[Cookbook:celery salt|celery salt]]. 

== Preparation and serving ==
A Bloody Mary, as well as the non-alcoholic Virgin Mary, is commonly served in the morning (as are mimosas and screwdrivers).

While there is not much complexity in mixing vodka and tomato juice, more elaborate versions of the drink have become trademarks of the bartenders who make them. A common garnish is a celery stalk when served in a tall glass, often over ice. A beer chaser may also be served with the Bloody Mary, although this varies from region to region.

=== Ingredients ===
Bloody Mary recipe courtesy of the New York School of Bartending:
* 1 oz. to 1 1/2 oz.vodka in a Highball glass filled with ice.
* Fill glass with tomato juice
* 1 dash celery salt
* 1 dash ground black pepper
* 1 dash Tabasco
* 2-4 dashes of Lea &amp; Perrin's Worcestershire sauce
* 1/8 tsp. horseradish (pure, never creamed)
* Dash of lemon or lime juice
Garnish with celery stalk.

May be shaken vigorously or stirred lazily, as desired. Garnish with a celery stalk; a skewer of olives, pickles, carrots, mushrooms, or other vegetables; or even meat or fish (salami, shrimp, etc.) and cheese (see photos). Occasionally, pickled asparagus spears or pickled beans are also used.

Prepackaged Bloody Mary mixes that combine the spicy, non-alcoholic components of a Bloody Mary are commercially available.

== Variations ==
=== Variations in alcohol ===
; Bloody Philip : Thailand Lao Khao (literally white liquor} 80 proof, rice distilled, replacing vodka in equal measure 
; Bloody Bishop : Sherry in equal measure to vodka
; Bloody Fairy, Red Fairy : Absinthe replacing the vodka.
; Bloody Geisha : Sake replacing vodka.
; Bloody Maria : Tequila replacing vodka.
; Brown Mary or Whiskey Mary : Whiskey replacing the vodka.
; Bloody Pirate : Dark rum replacing vodka. 
; Bloody Scotsman : Scotch replacing vodka.
; Bloody Maureen : Guinness replacing vodka.
; Michelada Clementina (or simply &quot;Chelada&quot;) : Mexican beer replacing vodka, usually flavored with a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce and Maggi Sauce and Tabasco sauce. Usually the proportion of beer equals the tomato juice.
; Ruddy Mary : Gin replacing vodka.
; Red Eye, Calgary Red Eye, or Saskatchewan Red Eye : Beer replacing vodka, usually in a 50/50 mixture with Clamato in place of the tomato juice.
; Red Eye: 1 Pint Glass, 1 Shot Of Vokda, Filled Half Way With Beer, Then Topped Up With Tomato Juice, Then An Egg Cracked In (DO NOT STIR) Then Drunk.
; Red Hammer : Through the 1950s in the north eastern USA, while vodka was scarce, gin instead of vodka was known as a ''Bloody Mary''; once vodka became readily available in those regions, the traditional vodka-based Bloody Mary was known as a '''Red Hammer''' for a time
; Virgin Mary, Bloody Shame, or Bloody Virgin : Without alcohol; the second term is commonly used in Australia.

=== Variations in mixers ===
; Bloody Bull : Beef bouillon and tomato juice. The drink originated at Brennan's restaurant in New Orleans and is served at Commander's Palace as well as other Brennan Family Restaurants.
; Bull Shot : Beef bouillon or beef consommé in place of tomato juice. It may also contain salt, pepper, lemon juice, Tabasco sauce and Worcestershire sauce.
; Caesar, Bloody Caesar, or Clammy Mary : Clamato replacing tomato juice, much more popular in Canada than the traditional Bloody Mary.
; Bloody Eight or Eight Ball : V8 replacing tomato juice, or a mixture, usually equal parts
; '''Harry's Original
The original Bloody Mary created at Harry's New York Bar in Paris, was only vodka and tomato juice

=== Variation in drink format ===
; Frozen Bloody Mary : Placed in a blender with ice.
; Flaming Bloody Mary : A small amount of 151 rum is floated on top and a string hangs outside the glass and is ignited for a cold weather drink.
; Flaming, Frozen Bloody Mary : A frozen Bloody Mary is topped with 151 rum and ignited. Also called &quot;Bloody Fire and Ice&quot;. (Note be sure to use a ceramic mug to avoid shattered glass)

=== Miscellaneous ===
; Bloodless Mary : Without tomato juice
; Bleeding Mary : Without tomato juice, 1:1 Tabasco to vodka.
; Screaming Emo : Traditional Bloody Mary, but with a habanero pepper added to it for more heat.
; Screw Mary : Equal parts vodka, orange juice, and tomato juice or V8, spiced to taste.

(Review material from the indifference curve section if this seems unfamiliar.)

From the indifference curves we can see that people value things differently and alter what they demand (no pun intended) to best utilize their money. This naturally leads to the demand curve, which in many ways is similar to the sum of many individuals' indifference curves (but not entirely). The curve is often shaped similarly. The blue line in this graph is the basic demand curve. Note that the y axis is P, not Q2.


==Quantity demanded==
[[Image:HouDemand2.png|600px]]

The quantity demanded is a specific quantity, given a demand curve and a price level. In this graph the price level of the market for the good, P*, has been extended to the y axis, price. At any quantity and given any demand curve, there should be only one natural equilibrium quantity demanded. This point is marked Q*. No trade occurs beyond this point.


==Consumer surplus==
[[Image:HouConsumer_surplus.png|600px]]

Consumer surplus is a measure of the benefit or welfare to the consumers of trading with a particular good. It can be defined as the amount of money that they save from making the transaction, or the amount that they are willing to pay to buy the good under discussion. Different consumers have different preferences (indifference curves) and thus obtain different levels of happiness with the trade. In graphs, they are always arranged so that the most happy consumer - the one willing to pay the highest price - is placed rightmost, while the least happy consumer - the one barely willing to make the trade - is placed leftmost (at the equilibrium point). 

In the graph, it is the area under the demand curve and above the price level, to the left of the equilibrium point, and is shaded blue. (To the left because no trade happens beyond the equilibrium.) At the equilibrium point the consumer is barely happy with the price offered and so there is no consumer surplus.

I am the owner of [http://wikis.ControlTheoryPro.com ControlTheoryPro.com].  Few web resources provide practical help on the design of real world controllers.  University courses speak in generalities about design.  So do most web sites.  I plan for ControlTheoryPro.com to be more design and modeling oriented.

==Abbreviated Resume==
I've worked in the Aerospace industry for more than 10 years.  During that time I've worked as a contractor to
*AlliedSignal (now Honeywell) in the aircraft engines division
*Lockheed Martin in Space Shuttle astronaut training

I've also worked directly for
*Boeing (twice)
**Embedded Software for the Apache attack helicopter
**Guidance, Navigation and Control subsystem for the International Space Station

I currently work for
*Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp. in pointing control for laser communications

While getting my BSME I worked for the Colorado Space Grant College on
*DATA-CHASER Space Shuttle payload
*2 University Explorer class satellite proposals

No question I like it.  At one stage the &quot;Welcome&quot; got rather too big.  Then it got hacked to death in a minimalist approach.  This is good.

The welcome is very helpful and useful (and welcoming). However, I think it would be even better (is that possible?) if there is a direct link on how to edit wiki articles (not just where the edit button is, but the code and everything).

== It's gigantic! ==

It is huge, and has lot I'll never ever look at. 

What I would want to see is how to use wikibook shortcuts, like &quot;use \{\{Clear\}\} rather than \&lt;\br\&gt;&quot;, how to do links, and the top 50 wiki codes that are used to markup typical real world text. 

I have found some of this by using some of the help links,  both from this template and the help menu on the side panels (nav), but still I can't seem to find something that's useful enough to print a few pages of and keep next to the computer as a cheat sheet, so make this your goal. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 04:22, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

== It's gigantic! (Take 2) ==

But now that it folds, it's fine for what it is.  When the big unfolded message appeared on my talk page I felt it was intrusive.  Overall I do still prefer the smaller [[Template:Welcome]].  For the majority of users I feel a genuine warm welcome rather than a fire-hose of information is going to do more good. --[[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesCrook|contribs]]) 11:41, 16 January 2011 (UTC)

== AGF link ==

&quot;''You can [[WB:BOLD|change just about anything]], and [[WB:AGF|changes can be made easily]].''&quot; I'm not clear on why [[WB:AGF]] is linked where it is. Perhaps it is intended to say that if your changes are reverted, you should assume that it was done in good faith, but that isn't clear from the wording. Something like &quot;''if your edits are reverted, you can discuss them''&quot; would be better. [[User:Belteshazzar|Belteshazzar]] ([[User talk:Belteshazzar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Belteshazzar|contribs]]) 02:15, 17 January 2011 (UTC)

: That was not my intention or meaning. Reverting was far from my mind because I consider reverts to be contrary to AGF. In a less compacted form what I was trying to get across is: You can change just about anything by being bold. You are encouraged and allowed to be bold because other people are expected to assume any changes you make is done in good faith. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:41, 17 January 2011 (UTC)

:: It's entirely possible &amp;mdash;depending on circumstances&amp;mdash; to believe an edit was made in good faith, and nevertheless reasonably revert it.  The more complex the edit in question, of course, the more opportunity for something other than a revert, but also the more difficult it is to work out an alternative (and the significance of that may vary with context &amp;mdash; Wikijunior? featured book?).  The larger the number of past edits that enter into the situation, the more useful the tool of AGF.

:::It's confusing that &quot;you can discuss them&quot; links to AGF. That sentence as a whole just doesn't flow well; it gives the impression (at least to me) that your edits ''will'' most likely be reverted - a rather discouraging statement!

The two consecutive links bothered me a bit, too.  So here's another try, and we'll see why we don't like this one.  Besides the main change, I've also incidentally unlinked &quot;Wikibooks&quot;, as (on reflection) I find it a bit unfocusing.

{{outdent|::::::}}

I hope I don't give the impression that the slight change is controversial. Is it grammatically correct though? I look at it and something seems a bit off. I guess it could be due to differences in participles and/or grammatical tense from the rest of the box as well. I think the rest uses simple verbs and adjectives in their present tense form, while it is using an adverb and present participle. Again this isn't intended to suggest the difference is controversial, maybe I am just being too much of a Grammar Nazi. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:58, 19 January 2011 (UTC)

: It's not grammatically incorrect.  It is structurally more complicated than the rest of the box, which makes a discernible contrast; myself, I'm still less bothered by that than by &quot;textbooks&quot; wrapping around onto a second line.  (BTW, for most of the life of the template, its first sentence was &quot;Wikibooks is for freely licensed collaboratively developed textbooks.&quot;  I prefer gerund &quot;developing&quot;, as it suggests an ongoing process.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 17:00, 20 January 2011 (UTC)

:: Fair enough. I prefer present tense and active voice, over other choices, because I believe it to be more inviting. I guess on some level I may also have been placing more emphasis on structure simplicity than I have before, ever since Simple English Wikibooks closed, because people that have difficulty understanding English are likely to have migrated here. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:08, 20 January 2011 (UTC)

:::To my ear, using the gerund in the altered sentence sounds a little awkward. (Both appear to be grammatically correct, however.) I have a 1024x768 resolution, and on full-screen, the bold text wraps around no matter what wording is used; does word-wrap really matter, if we're going to base a decision on that? Screen sizes and resolutions vary widely, after all. [[User talk:Tempodivalse#top|'''''Tempodivalse''''']] 19:07, 20 January 2011 (UTC)

::::I too have 1024x768; experimenting, with vector it wraps for me also.  (I use monobook because I loathe vector.)  I'll have to keep that in mind in future.  My heuristic had been that anything from my screen size on up should reasonably expect things will fit, while below my screen size there may reasonably be (graceful) degradation.

::::Well, if the admittedly slightly awkward phrasing isn't going to prevent wraparound anyway, how about we go back to '''Wikibooks is for [[WB:AGF|collaborative]] development {{nowrap|of free [[WB:WIW|textbooks]]'''}}, and specify that {{nowrap|&quot;of free textbooks&quot;}} should be all on one line; IMHO that's the place where wraparound reads best.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 21:50, 20 January 2011 (UTC)

== New to Wikibooks ==

∼I am new to Wikibooks and am continuing to learn editing rules. Thank you (Xania/ЗAНИA )for the information on continuing to add value to this massive project. I would like to point out that the following guidelines apply to any and all of my edits: any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. I have never and will never demean a contribution in such a flagrant manner.

I have had many global studies courses in college and am therefore sensitive to the global nature of the material in Wikibooks. Any additions are a reflection of that teaching I have received. Ethnocentrism does not have a valid placement under Wiki guidelines as I understand them. 

Any discussion or reference of information added should have the advantage of viewing these pages as a global entity. No one Ethnic guideline should be attributed to a 'general page' of information. IF the page is seeking to add value and information to a certain Ethnic population, then it should be a forgone conclusion that the article's titling would reflect that. I would hope that I can add value to the information stored herein. Thank you for your patience and continued direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''odometry_goto'' module implements a simple feedback algorithm a differential-drive vehicle to move towards a given position (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;). It uses the ''odometry_track'' module to estimate the current position of the robot.

== Synopsis ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Instantiate a track and a goto structure
struct sOdometryTrack ot;
struct sOdometryGoto og;

// Initialize the modules
odometry_track_init();
odometry_goto_init();

// Initializes tracking and goto structures
odometry_track_start(&amp;ot);
odometry_goto_start(&amp;og, &amp;ot);

// Set a target position
odometry_goto_set_goal(&amp;og, x, y);

// Move until the robot is close enough to the target position
while (og.result.atgoal == 0) {
	// Update position and calculate new speeds
	odometry_track_step(og.track);
	odometry_goto_step(&amp;og);

	// Set the wheel speed
	khepera3_drive_set_speed(og.result.speed_left, og.result.speed_right);
}

// The final position (which may be slightly different from the target position)
... = og.track-&gt;result.x;
... = og.track-&gt;result.y;
... = og.track-&gt;result.theta;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Description ==

This module is always used in combination with the ''odometry_track'' module.

'''odometry_goto_start''' sets up a ''sOdometryGoto'' structure and assigned a ''sOdometryTrack'' structure to it. The latter must have been initialized beforehand (but could have been initialized much earlier and used already).

The target position is set with '''odometry_goto_set_goal'''. Inside the main loop, '''odometry_goto_step''', called right after '''odometry_track_step''', calculates the new wheel speeds and put them inside the ''result'' structure. These speed values should be set '''khepera3_drive_set_speed'''. Note that the target position may be changed at any time. The '''odometry_goto_step''' function will calculate the motor speeds for the currently configured target position. 

In addition to the motor speeds, the ''result'' structure provides a two more useful fields:
* ''closetogoal'': Set as soon as the robot comes so close to the target position that it starts decelerating.
* ''atgoal'': Set if the robot has reached the target position.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Control Systems Design Page}}

Broadly speaking there are two fundamentally different types of control systems:
* '''Process control''' occurs typically in the chemical or food processing industry, oil and gas refineries, etc. These kind of installations have as components devices such as valves, temperature sensors, flow rate sensors, etc., and need to control the continuous flow of material through a large set of subsequent operations.
* '''System control''' deals with the appropriate functioning of (semi-)autonomous devices, i.e., making sure that it performs the expected set of actions at the appropriate times. This involves switching between various control actions, decision making under uncertainty, etc.
Another major difference between process and system control is the large ''scale'' at which the former is implemented. 

=Process control=
In general, looking at process control there will be multiple sensors, actuators and controllers distributed over a sometimes very large area. Such a system always has a lot of distributed hardware.

Despite this distributed nature, it is necessary to have a ''central'' control to oversee, manage and monitor everything at a distance. This does not how ever mean to ‘control’ everything. Every slave will mostly have its own processing capabilities to control its immediate surroundings. 

To use a metaphor: it can be seen as an army general and subordinate platoons. The general (central control) needs to know what is going on with each platoon in the battle field to make upper level strategic decisions and give orders. While each platoon (slaves) decides for itself how it will perform these orders and then report the result back to the general.

To bring it back into the engineering world. The central control will be used to monitor safety issues, functioning levels and set system levels and properties. This is also called the human-machine interface or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_machine_interface HMI].

Each slave in the plant or factory will be controlling the temperature, flow rate or volume of a smaller section of the whole. These are individually independent and are able to function as a complete unit on its own.

The actual control happens locally, with the SCADA main controller collecting and interpreting all the data throughout the complete system. Also the main controller is used to change and set operating levels.

Connecting all these independent systems is where it starts to get tricky. Everything has to function in combination, and means that information needs to be inter exchanged: information from an upstream or down stream slave may be necessary for it to make proper controlling decisions. 

There are many ways to implement such a distributed hardware-centralise controller system. One such an implementation is called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA SCADA]. 

==Design considerations==
During the design of a distributed hardware system, there are some designs considerations and decisions to be made that will have noticeable effects in the end product.

The four main aspects, although there are many others, to consider are: '''safety, cost, optimisation and robustness'''. In a design such as this, there is a definite link between these four, and changing one has an automatic effect on the rest. The designer is constantly faced by such trade-off decisions.

===Main considerations===
'''Safety''': As with any system where humans are involved safety is of very high importance. In some situations more so that in others: a nuclear energy plant vs. a water bottling plant for instance. 

With an increase in safety measures, there is also an increase of eventual implementation cost (extra shut valves, redundant controllers) and a decrease in robustness. Safety could also mean a better communication system to ensure that the correct data is transmitted between the central control and slaves, and between individual slaves. 

Implementing multiple master stations running in parallel for in case onse should fail, linking to a single SCADA main terminal.
Safety is, as control, also localised but not limited to being locally implemented. The main controller can and will have some safety control.  

'''Robustness''': It is wished for the system to keep functioning even with some interferences and non intentional events. Robustness means a decrease in safety.

The question then arises: Should small problems be allowed? Small issues can be corrected by the slaves themselves. If handled incorrectly, these small problems can lead to much bigger ones. Cascading failures of interconnected parts result from small problems not being correctly handled.

'''Cost''': Eventually it is wished for the design to be implemented, therefore costs kept to a minimum for the system to be lucrative to the market. But with cutting costs, you have a decrease in safety and robustness. 

'''Optimisation''': With this design factor the goal is to have an increase in quality, and cost minimisation (minimal product or raw material waste). With optimisation again comes the decrease of robustness.

Thus, the most difficult part of such a design is finding the optimal balance between cost, robustness, optimisation and safety for each project.

===Human influence/interface===
Due to the nature of this kind of systems and an ever changing environment (different products to be manufactured, or a change in the product mixture) there needs to be human interaction with the system. Also it is necessary for a human to be able to tell at a glance if a problem exists, where and what kind of problem.

The importance of proper human-machine interaction was shown in the [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Categories of system complexity#Distributed Hardware — Distributed Control | Three Mile Island accident]]. Incomplete and incorrect information is thought to be the eventual reason for an otherwise preventable accident.

This adds to the safety side of the design decisions, added redundancy, and then increase in cost. But from the Three Mile Island accident, the necessity of proper and timely system information can be seen.

Furthermore the human interface is an easily reachable tool for information or hardware that would otherwise be difficult to reach. It should also have an attention grabbing setup to be able to make a system assessment at a glance.

===Interdependency=== 
Although previously said that all the slaves can operate independently, in a major industrial system this is not the case for each and every part. Some are directly dependant on information from another slave.

For instance, if a valve is to control the flow rate into some container, it needs to know to shut off if the container gets full. It is therefore necessary to have a reliable inter-slave communication network.

This interdependency shifts some of the central systems responsibility to manage safety, to a more localised area.  

===Data handling===
Because eventually all the independent systems have to work together to form the final product, some sort of data handling system is necessary. This is where the central control system comes into play and fulfils its main role.

Due to the fact that lots of the actual control and safety is managed by the slaves system, a SCADA installation deals mostly with a bottom-up data structure. The main controller does not need all the information that is available in the complete system. 

The central controller can thus be seen as an information gathering unit. This data, other than the safety information, could be calculating trends and monitoring quality.

==Example ==
An example is the home beer brewing process of the [http://www.worthogbrewers.co.za/resources/ag4b/ag4b_introduction.html WortHog Brewers].

= System control =
Most of the examples in the rest of this Wikibook are system control applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Differences between entities==
[[Image:Trade5.png|600px]]

Different entities will have different possibility curves, which allow for trade to be done. In this case, each society might decide to produce at these two indicated positions because their output is relatively higher for those positions. However, should they choose to have the same output position, that position will be significantly lower than their optimal positions. This is the case for entities that do not trade.

==Trade==
[[Image:HouTrade4.png|600px]]

Trade between these two entities can be done after they each produce at their optimal (depending on where society wants to allot its resources) and then exchanging goods at a fair ratio. The result of fair exchange is the pink line connecting them. The result is a higher possibility for each society through trade than each can reach without, as shown by the comparison between the center gray point and the pink point.

==Specialization==
[[Image:HouTrade.png|600px]]

These different entities can then take actions to specialize in one field. Specialization causes the PPF to take the concave outward form as the graph shows, because choosing to produce more of one good allows one to produce far more combined goods.

==Trade with specialization==
[[Image:HouTrade3.png|600px]]

Specialization increases the benefits from trade. In these graphs, the benefit is the horizontal and vertical increase from the center gray point to the pink point. The specialized PPF curves are more separate, allowing the societies (or entities in general) to produce at more different positions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Graph reading==
[[Image:HouGraph.png|600px]]

The first step to understanding economics models is comprehending graphs. Here the x axis is Q, quantity, and the y axis is P, price. The point at the top right indicates Q* quantity of a good each being sold at price P*; the horizontal and vertical lines are there for facilitation/marker purposes. The point to its left has only half the extent x-axis-wise, and therefore involves half the quantity. The point below the first has only half the extent y-axis-wise, and therefore involves half the price.

This graph is used for demand / supply curves, and for production cost curves. 

The supply curve is an upsloping curve from left to right, and shows that whenever the market price of a good increases, more producers are willing to produce, and there for there is more goods produced for price 2, if price 2 is greater than price 1. 

The demand curve is a downsloping curve from left to right, and it shows that when the price is very high, there are few consumers demanding little quantity, but when the price is low, there are many more consumers , demanding more quantity. Ideally, if the price reaches zero, than infinite quantity is demanded.

Production costs curve show the Law of Diminishing Returns , which shows that total costs decline as more quantity is produced, because fixed costs are divided into more units. In fact , fixed costs always decline. Variable costs however, can decline because of gains in efficiency, but after a certain quantity, variable costs increase because of inefficiency e.g. due to congested access to fixed resources. Thus unit variable costs are drawn as a stretched out U shape. Unit total cost is a stretched out U shape, which sits above unit variable cost, and gets closer to it, because unit fixed cost is included in total cost, total cost never quite touches unit variable cost.
Marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit, and unlike unit total cost and unit variable cost, it is not an average unit cost, but determines the direction of change of average cost for the next unit. 
If the marginal cost equals the average total cost, than after the next unit is produced, the average total cost doesn't change, but if it is less than the average, then next average cost will be lower than the current average cost. Conversely, if marginal cost is greater than the average cost, than the next average cost will rise.
This means marginal cost, which represents to the change in total cost over the change in quantity, or the additional total cost to produce 1 more unit, doesn't incorporate the fixed cost , as none of the additional total cost is additional fixed cost. So marginal cost will intersect average total cost at its minimum point, because average total cost will rise when the marginal cost is greater than the average total cost, and in fact , the same can be applied to average variable cost.

==Graph reading continued==
[[Image:HouGraph2.png|600px]]

This may appear to be a similar graph, but it is entirely different because here the y axis is the quantity Q2 of another good. The top right point involves Q* of good 1 and Q2* of good 2. The point to its left involves half as much of good 1, while the point below it involves half as much of good 2.

This graph is called the a graph of possible production, where shared available resources are used to produce two alternatives at varying quantities. If more of good 1 is produced, less of good 2 is produced. The characteristics of the curve is that:
# convex quarter shape, from 12pm to 3pm
# convex shape is explained by suitability of some resources for good 1 , and some for good 2, so that more quantity is produced of good 1 and good 2 when Q1 = Q2, because specialised resources are allocated most efficiently.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ordinary goods==
[[Image:HouGood.png|600px]]

Ordinary goods have the indifference curves you have so far seen. As one has more of a good, one obtains less marginal utility from another of that good; the reverse is true for goods that one is relatively lacking. Remember that in these problems the utility results from the use of goods, not how much the goods can be sold for.

==Perfect complements==
[[Image:HouGood2.png|600px]]

Perfect complements are goods that are useless without the other. Therefore, having more of a good than is required by the other good brings no benefit whatsoever. This is demonstrated in the graph, where having more of good 1 while holding good 2 constant does not increase utility.

==Perfect substitutes==
[[Image:HouGood3.png|600px]]

Perfect substitutes are goods that exactly substitute for one another at a certain ratio. Having relatively more of a good does not reduce marginal utility because there is no 'relatively more'; you have the same amount of the one substitutable (combined) good.

Ordinary goods often fall in between these two extremes. It's easy to imagine a mostly complementary set of goods to have curve with a rather pointy edge, while a mostly substitutable set of goods would have a curve that is barely bent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is this? If I need to copy a line segment here is what i would do. Measure the existing line segment AB, go to the point T and with my ruler I draw another line segment of length equal to AB. Why do I have to go through all these circle drawings? Why does my simple solution not work?
: Good question. The reason is the Greek &quot;rules of the game&quot;.
: See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_and_straightedge_constructions Compass and straightedge constructions]
: The ruler to be used is assumed to be infinite in length, has no markings on it and only one edge, and is known as a straightedge. [[User:APH|APH]] ([[User talk:APH|talk]])

I also think this construction method is unnecessary. If all you need is to copy line AB to T at any direction, use a compass to measure the length of AB, draw a circle centerred at T with radius AB. You can have as many lines as you need that are equal to AB, i.e. all lines from T to any point on the circle. 

To copy a line with the same direction, simply construct a parallelogram BATC, where AB equals TC. (This takes about three steps.)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Increase in price of good 1==
[[Image:HouSubs.png|600px]]

In this case an increase in the price of good 1 (along x axis) shifts the budget curve (black) inward. One can no longer obtain as high an indifference curve (blue) as before; the new indifference curve is closer to the origin and entails a lower utility than the original. 


==Compensated budget==
[[Image:HouSubs2.png|600px]]

We can draw a compensated budget, compensating one for the increase in the price of a good by increasing their money overall. However, such a double change will lead to a shift in the way the consumer allocates resources between the two goods. The compensated budget curve (which looks like a line), pink in the graph, has the same slope as the new budget curve but has an optimal point on the original indifference curve (just like the original budget). This new compensated budget allows a consumer to attain exactly the same level of utility despite the fact that the price of a good has increased.


==Income and substitution effects==
[[Image:HouSubs3.png|600px]]

The key position of the compensated budget is the position of resource (money) apportionment that a consumer would make, here labeled with the purple point. The compensated budget offers effectively the same income as the original budget (because it is compensated and the same utility as before is reachable). Therefore, any change in the allotment of what goods a consumer wants to buy, going from the original point to the compensated point, must come entirely from the '''substitution effect'''.

Because any shift from original to new budget must result from the combined effect of substitution and income effect, the remainder of the shift is attributable to the income effect. Alternatively, the shift from the purple point to the left blue point (final budget optimal point) involves no change in resource apportionment ratios because the new and compensated budget curves have the same slope (a unit of good 1 is worth the same multiple as much as a unit of good 2). Hence we come to the same conclusion.

If the final blue point is to the left of the purple point, the two effects are acting in harmony and the good along the x axis is considered a '''normal good'''.


==Contradicting effects==
[[Image:HouSubs5.png|600px]]

For this consumer, the indifference curves look significantly different. The compensatory budget is still placed in the same location. The main difference is that now the new optimal allocation with the new budget - the lower blue point - is to the right of the purple point.


==Contradicting effects part 2==
[[Image:HouSubs4.png|600px]]

The purple substitution effect does not change because the first blue point and purple point remain in the same positions. However, the blue income effect now goes counter to the substitution effect (though it is still smaller than the substitution effect). In other words, the two effects are acting in opposite directions. 

If the final blue point is to the right of the purple point but to the left of the initial blue point, the two effects are acting in opposite directions, the substitution effect is stronger, and the good along the x axis is considered an '''inferior good'''.

If the final blue point is to the right of the initial blue point, the two effects are acting in opposite directions, the income effect is stronger, and the good along the x axis is considered a '''giffen good'''. A giffen good is one where a consumer buys more of it when the price increases - very, very rare but possible in certain very limited cases (often involving poverty).

== Pages ==

Hello Spradlig, welcome to wikibooks!

I've seen your pages [[Semilog]] and [[Loglog]]. These pages are supposed to be part of the [[MATLAB Programming]] book, correct? To make sure that a page is inside a book (and not floating around by itself) you have to title the pages like this: &quot;Book Name/Page Name&quot;. For instance, you should write:

*[[MATLAB Programming/Semilog]] not [[Semilog]]
*[[MATLAB Programming/Loglog]] not [[Loglog]]

Pages that aren't properly inserted in a book could end up getting lost or deleted. If you need any help fixing this, or if you have questions, let me know [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]]. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:51, 22 April 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks for the reply! You like control systems? I've written most of the [[Control Systems]] book myself, and have helped a class project at [[Embedded Control Systems Design]]. Moving pages is easy, you don't need to be an admin. Click the '''move''' tab at the top of the page, and change the titles to include &quot;MATLAB Programming/&quot; in front of the page names.
:When you create a link inside the MATLAB book, you can use the shorthand: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Page Name/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; This will automatically put the page inside the MATLAB book, and you don't need to worry about moving it or adding the book title to the link. If you need help, don't hesitate to ask! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:59, 22 April 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What Countries Did They Live In? ==

The Toltec civilization began in what is now southern Mexico then spread north through the rest of Mexico.

== What did their buildings look like? ==

== What did they eat? ==

== What did they wear? ==

== What did their writing look like? ==

== What did they believe? ==

The Toltec believed in two gods. One was Quetzalcoatl, the “Sovereign Plumed Serpent”. This was the god of learning, culture, philosophy, fertility, holiness, and gentility. The other god is Tezcatlipoca, the “Smoked Mirror”. This god was war-like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/latinamerica/meso/cultures/toltec.html|title=The Toltecs|publisher=Minnesota State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Are some of them famous even today? ==

== What is left of them today? ==

== When did their civilization exist? ==

== Who did they battle with? ==
The Toltecs were pre-Columbian Native Americans. They took over most of central Mexico between the 10th and 12th century. Toltecs once ruled the Mayans. The Mayans and the Toltecs clashed. They tried to compromise but the Toltecs took over. The Toltecs were later taken over by the Chichimecs in 1200 A.D.

      <comment>[[Talk:A Wikimanual of Gardening/Vinca]] moved to [[Talk:Horticulture/Vinca]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">It is amusing to see that vinca is considered an invasive weed in parts of the U.S., as I have a customer with a large hillside vinca groundcover that has been ailing over the past two years.  It is an important plant in her landscape as it provides erosion control and is (or at least has been) relatively easy to care for.

I am wondering what soil conditions and annual rainfall is normative in its native range.  What sort of soil type, soil pH, and irrigation regimen should I expect vinca to flourish under?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Marginal product of labor==
[[File:HouMPL.png|600px]]

In firms, people start off rather productive, but as more people are added, specialization occurs, with the result that the marginal product of labor (the next worker's labor productivity) increases. After the critical point at which this has reached its maximum, the MPL begins to decline as additional workers become less productive. In the short run this is most acute, where a constant amount of available capital limits productivity. After a certain point, adding workers begins to reduce overall (total) productivity; this is reflected by a negative MPL.


== Firms' production frontier ==
[[File:HouPF.png|600px]]

The gold line is the typical firm's production frontier. It is the sum of each worker's marginal productivity (taking the integral of MPL from 0 to L). At first the production frontier increases faster, then it increases slower, then it stops increasing, before beginning a decline (which should never happen if the firm is money-conscious). 


== Isoprofit lines set ==
[[File:HouPF3.png|600px]]

Isoprofit lines are lines composed of amounts of labor and its total output that yield the same amount of profit for the firm. There are an infinite number of isoprofit lines, one above another, similarly to how there are an infinite number of indifference curves. The isoprofit line that is tangent to the production frontier is also the highest isoprofit line that the firm can reach. 


== Isoprofit lines part 2 ==
[[File:HouPF2.png|600px]]

There are a variety of isoprofit lines that may be drawn. Realistically, their slopes will be flatter than the ones shown here, and their y axis will be higher. 

The slope is equal to wage divided by price of output.

The y intercept is profit divided by price of output.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Firm's isoprofit line==
[[Image:HouPF4.png|600px]]

This purple isoprofit line is more realistic of a firm, for it intersects the production frontier somewhere to the right of the maximum marginal product of labor. The y intercept is the profit to the firm after subtracting costs of hiring labor. However, this amount does not translate to economic profit; in perfect competition the default height of the y intercept (the intermediate profit) is equal to the fixed cost of the firm, with the result that there is no economic profit. 

==Labor hired==
[[Image:HouPF5.png|600px]]

The point where the highest isoprofit line overlaps with the production frontier is where the firm will produce. Any higher isoprofit line is unattainable and any lower isoprofit line will generate less than optimal profits. The result is that more workers are hired than the one that helps increase profit the most (has the highest marginal product of labor, MPL). The slope of the isoprofit line determines where this position actually is. The right brown point is the position of the firm's labor hired.

==Wage rate==
[[Image:HouPF6.png|600px]]

In perfect competition, firms can only afford to hire workers at the same amount of profit they can generate for the firm. Extending the right brown point (position at which hiring stops) gives the wage rate. Supposedly, all firms in the industry are equally productive and thus reach this same point, which brings about labor equilibrium. First, we must multiply the graph, which is in terms of units production in the y axis, to currency (P). This changes the '''marginal product of labor MPL''' into '''marginal revenue product MRP''' (or '''marginal revenue of labor MRL'''). The MRL definition is clearest because in perfect competition it makes clear sense for a firm to hire workers - marginal cost of labor - at the same amount as the marginal revenue of labor.

==Wage loss and surplus==
[[Image:HouPF7.png|600px]]

A firm's loss and profit can also be shown through the MPL. Since MRP reflects earnings and the wage rate W* reflects expenses, the firm's surplus is the green area in the graph - the area under the MRP but above W*. The firm's losses is the red area in the graph - the area under W* but above MRP. Since the firm stops hiring at the far right corner of the surplus area, there is no additional loss pass that point. In perfect competition the two areas (loss and surplus) cancel each other out, but with the green area exactly fixed cost larger than the red area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== OCT$ == 

=== Function ===
(+)	Appearance		(+)	Standard		(+)	Console	

=== Syntax === 
&lt;pre&gt;
octalString$ = OCT$(expr)
&lt;/pre&gt; 

=== Description === 
This function is a string of octal (base-8) digits which represent the integer value of expr. The returned string will consist of either 3, 6 or 11 characters, depending on which of DEFSTR BYTE, DEFSTR WORD or DEFSTR LONG is currently in effect. 

Note that if the value of expr is too large to fit in the currently selected DEFSTR size, the string returned by OCT$ will not represent the true value of expr. In FB, integers are stored in standard &quot;2's-complement&quot; format, and the values returnet by OCT$ reflect this storage scheme. You need to keep this in mind when interpreting the results of OCT$, especially when expr is a negative number. 

For example: 
&lt;pre&gt;
OCT$(-3) returns &quot;775&quot; when DEFSTR BYTE is in effect; &quot;777775&quot; when DESTR WORD is in effect; and &quot;77777777775&quot; when DEFSTR LONG is in effect.
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
Note:
To convert a string of octal digits into an integer, use the following technique: ÊÊÊintVar = VAL&amp;(&quot;&amp;o&quot; + octalString$) intVar can be a (signed or unsigned) byte variable, short-integer variable or long-integer variable. See Appendix C: Data Types and Data Representation, to determine the range of values that can be stored in different types of integer variables.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== OFFSETOF == 

=== Function ===
(+)	Appearance		(+)	Standard		(+)	Console	

=== Syntax === 
&lt;pre&gt;
byteOffset = OFFSETOF(fieldName IN {recordType|trueRecVar})
byteOffset = OFFSETOF(const [IN pseudoRecVar]) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description === 
Use this function to find where a particular field begins within a record. OFFSETOF returns the field's offset as a number of bytes past the beginning of the record. In the first syntax, recordType is the name of a &quot;true record&quot; type as defined in a BEGIN RECORD statement; trueRecVar is a variable declared as a &quot;true record&quot; type; fieldName is the name of a field within that &quot;true record&quot; type. In the second syntax, const is a symbolic integer constant, without its leading underscore character. Typically, this will be a constant which was defined within a DIM RECORD...DIM END RECORD block. pseudoRecVar.recLen is a &quot;pseudo-record&quot; variable declared as DIM psuedoRecVar.recLen. When you use the second syntax, OFFSETOF just returns the value of const. Because a symbolic constant always has a global scope, the IN pseudoRecVar clause is not required. The value passed as fieldName is seen by the compiler as a constant. You do not use type designator suffixes like $,&amp;,#, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ON APPLEEVENT == 

=== Statement ===
(+)	Appearance		(+)	Standard			Console	

=== Syntax === 
&lt;pre&gt;
ON APPLEEVENT (eventtype&amp;,eventClass&amp;)Â{FN userFunction|GOSUB{lineNumber|&quot;stmtLabel&quot;}} 
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised === 
May, 2001 (Release 5) 

=== Description === 
AppleEvents are used for communication between applications. (In dealing with Apple Events, you will often see applications referred to as processes.) Use this FB statement to set up and track specific types of Apple Events. Event types and classes that are to tracked are part of the ON APPLEEVENT parameters. Types and Classes
Apple events are divided into general groups called Types. Those groups are subdivided into specific classes. As an example, you may have heard of Apple core events. There are events which every application should understand and handle. The class for this group is called _coreEventType. the long integer constant for this type is _&quot;core&quot;. Either of these two forms of address is acceptable in FB, but only one (_&quot;core&quot;) is case sensitive. If you wanted to deal with core events, you would have to tell the Apple Event Manager which of four classes might be of interest. As an example, you might want to know if the Finder (or some other process) sent a message to you to open a document. In such a case the class would be _kAEOpenDocuments or _&quot;odoc&quot;. An event handler set up for this type and class would be entered as follows: 
&lt;pre&gt;
ON APPLEEVENT(_coreEventType,_kAEOpenDocuments) ÂFN myODocHandler 
&lt;/pre&gt;
FB recognizes a special event class of _&quot;TEXT&quot;. When this class in encountered, the contents of the event parameter may be more easily accessed using the APPLEEVENTMESSAGE$ function. The following simple example shows how your ON APPLEEVENT handler might look for incoming text. 
&lt;pre&gt;
LOCAL FN doAppleEvent PRINT &quot;Message received:&quot; PRINT APPLEEVENTMESSAGE$ END FN ON appleevent(_&quot;buba&quot;,_&quot;TEXT&quot;) FN doAppleEvent 
&lt;/pre&gt;
It is often convenient to pass large blocks of data via Apple Events as handles. FB processes this automatically by pulling the data from the Apple Event and transferring it to your application as a handle. FB always copies the data, so when you are finished, you must manage disposal on your own. The following fragment shows how a handle is received and disposed. To show that the data was accepted, this routine prints the first fifty characters of the handle as ASCII text. 
&lt;pre&gt;
LOCAL
DIM AERec as AERecord
DIM @OSErr
DIM dataHandle as handle
DIM n
LOCAL FN doAppleEvent
OSErr = FN AEGETPARAMDESC(gFBAEEvent&amp;,Â
_keyDirectObject, _&quot;CLAS&quot;, AERec)
dataHandle = AERec.dataHandle
CLS
PRINT &quot;Rec'd at &quot;;TIME$
FOR n = 1 TO 50
PRINT CHR$(PEEK([dataHandle]+n));
NEXT
CALL DISPOSEHANDLE(dataHandle)
END FN 
&lt;/pre&gt;
When this handler was set up, the class parameter for ON APPLEEVENT was _&quot;CLAS&quot;. You can see that it was required for use in FN AEGETPARAMDESC. Note:
Some handlers (like the example above) are already built in to most of the FB runtimes. In order to override a behavior, you will first have to use KILL APPLEEVENT. Only one Apple Event vector is allowed. If you create multiple ON APPLEEVENT vectors, each one overwrites the previous, so the last vector will be used. To handle multiple eventClasses and/or types in the one application, set up a vector for each, pointing all to the one handler. The handler can determine which class it has received by examining the global variable gFBAEType&amp;. (See KILL APPLEVENT for the proper method of replacing an event vector.) 

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
CD Example: AppleEvents Folder 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Introduction'''

Web 2.0 is a term describing a new era in the way users interact with the World Wide Web. The term ‘Web 2.0’ was officially coined in 2004 by Dale Dougherty, a vice president of O’Reilly Media Inc. (the company famous for its technology-related conferences and books) during a team discussion on a potential future conference on the Web . The team wanted to get everyone re-excited about the Web despite the dot-com bust.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 

There are a number of Web-based services and applications that demonstrate the foundations of the Web 2.0 concept. Some of these include blogs, wikis, Facebook, and YouTube. The services vary from data ‘mash-ups’, tracking, aggregation, and content filtering to social networking and collaboration services.

Whereas Web 1.0 can be thought of as static, consumptive, and individualistic, Web 2.0 can be thought of as dynamic, participatory and social. The primary tenet of Web 2.0 is that users add value. Although there is some debate whether the name Web 2.0 is deserved, there is no denying that change has occurred in the way the Web is used.


'''Impact on Education'''

The impact of Web 2.0 services and technologies on education is profound.

Web 2.0 services and technologies expand the learning options available to educators. For example, Wiki technology enables collaborative learning as users (e.g., students) collectively create, edit, link, and share web content. Blog (Web Log) technology enables active, reflective learning as users regularly publish personal content to the web and invite comments back to expand on and share experiences. Wikis, Blogs and similar Web 2.0 technologies provide a means for users to easily participate in the creation of new knowledge rather than consume pre-existing knowledge. These technologies also provide alternative assessment options for educators. The result is often a more engaging and collaborative teaching and learning experience.

Web 2.0 services and technologies foster a more open approach to learning. The ability to easily access and share educational materials, create derivative works, republish and redistribute these works provides access to a wide variety of learning materials and enables teachers and learners alike to meet specific learning needs and focus on specific outcomes. The result is often a more empowering learning experience. This openness expands beyond content. Web 2.0 services and technologies allow users to tap into the affordances of social networking. Here learners construct identities and foster wide ranging relationships resulting in a more community oriented approach to inquiry and practice.

As Web 2.0 services and technologies become more commonplace and become easier to use, particularly in the educational milieu, educators can shift their attention away from the technology itself to the pedagogy to find the best value and most appropriate uses of Web 2.0 technology in enhancing teaching and learning.


'''Issues and Implications'''

Although there are several advantages in using Web 2.0 technologies, there are also several issues that require awareness and attention. Some of these issues include: equal access, information control, intellectual property, copyright, authorship, trust, privacy, security and cultural considerations.

Web 2.0 technologies allow users to participate and express themselves; however most producers are individuals and organizations with access to technology, computer skills, and money, resulting in what has come to be known as a ‘digital divide’ been haves and have-nots with respect to digital technologies. The great strength of Web 2.0 is its participatory nature, but if one cannot participate then its effectiveness is lost. In collaborative environments (such as Wikis) questions of credibility, accuracy, authorship, and vandalism have arisen. Although open content is seen as a panacea for information and knowledge sharing, lines are being blurred in terms of rightful ownership, authorship, and copyright. Further, social networking brings to the fore issues of trust, privacy and security. The social and cultural impact of Web 2.0 technology is not yet fully understood. As such, as more and more of us adopt Web 2.0 technologies, we need to remain informed and aware of the changing nature of the Web and the benefits and drawbacks made possible by such technologies.


'''The Future'''

Tim-Berners Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, and his colleagues at MIT propose the emergence of “Web Science” as a discipline. The goal of Web Science is to understand the growth of the Web, to describe emergent trends and patterns within it, to develop new scientific approaches to studying it, and to perform research to understand its social impact.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;   

This raises a question about the future of Web 2.0; that is, what’s next? Web 3.0 has been proposed as a possible future and consists of the integration of high-powered graphics (Scalable Vector Graphics or SVG) and semantic data . There have also been discussions around 3-D social networking systems and immersive 3-D internet environments that will take the best of virtual worlds (such as Second Life) and gaming environments and merge them with the Web . Others argue that Web 3.0 will be a backlash to Web 2.0 where software will ‘clean up’ after you, erasing your digital identity and path if needed . Regardless, it will be very interesting to see what the future holds.


'''Conclusion'''

The World Wide Web is evolving, and as such the way users interact with it is changing. Web 2.0 is a term used to describe a change to a more dynamic, participatory and social Web. Education is a beneficiary of such change. Web 2.0 services and technologies afford more empowering, engaging, and open learning experiences that foster more social, community-driven lines of inquiry and practice. Nonetheless, there are issues that require our awareness and attention; not the least of which revolve around privacy, security, and credibility, particularly within an educational context. The use of Web 2.0 services and technologies is becoming commonplace and is shaping the way think about and participate in the world. What is certain is the Web will continue to evolve in ways that we can in some respects predict, but in others can’t imagine. Regardless, it will be most interesting to see how it all unfolds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Rise of Net Generation''' 


	For much of our recent history, the Baby Boomer Generation (29 % of population) was the biggest population wave ever until it was surpassed by the Net Generation (30% of population). 


'''A Brief History'''


Several factors explain the rise in population during the Baby Boom (1946-1964). The economy was quite strong after the war giving families the confidence and stability to have babies. The United States was considered land of promise, attracting many immigrants who were procreating with large numbers. 
While computer and the internet may be the technologies that have shaped the Net Generation, the television shaped the generation of the Baby Boomers. TV created a real-time world and began to consume a significant part of the day. TV was the era’s most powerful communication tool. Not only did the TV spark controversy (i.e. Elvis Presley), but it mobilized and sent messages across the world (i.e. Viet Nam war). 

Immediately followed by the Baby Boom was the Baby Bust (1965-1976). During this time-period there was a great decrease in population.  The Baby Boom Echo (1977-1997) followed the Bust, and resulted in the fact that many women were postponing having children to prolong youth and to advance careers. The Echo becomes the Net Generation (1990s). 
The Net Generation is shaped by the Web browser, e-mail (1994), cyber kids, interactive technology pours into schools; computers become indispensable, and complete social transformation results. 
Children growing up in the Net Generation are developing in an environment extremely different from their parents, thus causing the idea of the digital divide.

Today’s youth taking control of communication revolution. They are searching rather than viewing information; they are questioning the unchallenged; information becomes knowledge; and they are fostering critical thinking skills 



'''Net Generation Learning'''''

	
Dan Tapscott in his critically acclaimed work growing up digital: The Rise of the Net Generation reminds educators and all readers alike, that it is high time that we abandoned the “Broadcast model of education and focus all educational endeavours on a more “Interactive” approach to learning.
	
Tapscott defines the broadcast method of learning as one in which the teacher is someone who is considered to be an expert, someone who dispenses information en masse to groups of students. It is the receptacle theory of education if you will, one in which children/students are passive recipients of the knowledge that is transmitted to them by their teachers and is then stored in the active working memory bank. The lecture, textbook and myriad homework assignments that are dispensed at will are factors that are indicative of a broadcast method of instruction.
	
In a Broadcast method of instruction, the curricula is created by a group ‘experts’ in a format that is believed to deliver a program that is drenched in age old tradition, tried and true methodologies that help all children learn all of the subjects in the same way. The program is executed in such a way so that all children receive the same curriculum in the same format- a one size fits all mentality much like a broadcast which when delivered reaches all people in the same way. Also, much like in a broadcast, the learning is unilateral and does not allow for an open dialogue in which the listener or student can contribute or participate in their own education.


'''The Interactive Learning Model'''


In order to meet the needs of students in the 21st century, Tapscott (1998) delineates steps that should be taken or  
at the very least considered in order to make the paradigm shift to an interactive learning model. 
(Tapscott, 1998)

1.	From linear to hypermedia learning

2.	From instruction to construction and discovery

3.	From teacher centered to learner centered education

4.	From absorbing material to learning how to navigate and how to learn.

5.	From school to lifelong learning

6.	From one-size fits all to customized learning

7.	From learning as torture as learning as fun

8.	From the teacher as transmitter to the teacher as facilitator


'''The Net Generation @ Play'''


In the past, online gaming and video games were not considered to be beneficial.  Some games were considered to be very violent and many parents found video game playing to be more harmful than a violent movie or television show because the child is initiating the actions.  Parents developed the fear that their children would become numb to violence and may resort to violence in everyday situations.  However, one must consider the ratings of games; that should give a good idea of whether or not it is appropriate for children.  Today, computer games and non-violent video games are being regarded more positively.  It is believed that children have the opportunity to play with ideas, images and develop relationships with other people.  They allow for playful brainstorming &amp; playful construction of ideas.  Games cater to the multiple intelligences and help children develop a healthy attitude.  They provide a zest for life and openness to new, interactive experiences, help develop hand-eye motor skills and give the child a sense of accomplishment.  In addition, “boys” culture is traditionally violent and aggressive.  Video games help displace that violence.  The net generation also greatly participates in online chatting, emailing and often develop online relationships.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ADP Alliance is the group responsible for the production of the w.e.b.Suite 1000 (WS1000) system. WS1000 may or may not be located at the Dealership. If it is located at the dealership, it is colloquially called ''Alliance'', if it hosted by ADP it is colloquially called ''Web Suite 1000''.

The Alliance is a native windows system, and as such does not have dial-in terminal access. It might however have dial-in PCAnywhere access if you bought that package from ADP.

For off-site Alliance information please refer to the [[../WS1000/|w.e.b.Suite 1000]].

The Alliance's customer support can be reached at: 1.866.668.5394

== Exporting Inventory ==
Using an Alliance Web 1000, you can run the inventory using a little-known ADP application ''vminvent''. It takes two arguements, a start date DDMMYYYY and an end date.
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
s:/alliance/vehw/vmdown vminvent 00000000 99999999
&lt;/source&gt;

It will output a mutilated csv file to &lt;tt&gt;C:\vmimvent&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Accessing ==
Because the on-site version is not by default globally accessible you will have to find or create a means to access it from outside of the Dealership.

* Many systems have Norton's PCAnywhere. With PCAnywhere you can remote into and take control of their machine with their IP and the Username and Password.
* If you have access to the ADP VPN network, you can surely get access to the system.
* All methods will of accessing the Alliance will require the dealer to supply you with credentials and the IP Address. ADP can tell you the address of the server on the ADP VPN if you furnish the phone number of the dealer or the ''ADP Client Number''.
* If all else fails use Citrix's [http://www.gotoassist.com/|GoToAssist] and take control of their machine in that fashion.

== Technical ==
* Pervasive SQL 8.x backend (.btr file store)
* Often NetCOBOL interface

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book discusses the philosophical and practical issues revolving around the subject of suicide. This book aims to be a scholarly discussion of the subject and not a debate or guide. Just as with other causes of death, accidental or inflicted, suicides are emotional issues and not surprisingly different societies have arrived at different attitudes and points of view regarding suicide and these have varied throughout history.

As a reminder, this book will touch upon issues that some may find disturbing or taboo.  Remember that some of the material may be [[WB:CENSOR|inappropriate for minors]].

Finally, this book is a work in progress. Currently it has had few contributors so what text there is has had little review. Please [[WB:BOLD|feel free]] to contribute where you can in order to improve it.

==Defining Suicide==

Colloquially it is the act of taking ones own life, but a close examination of this definition quickly leads one to many questions. A better definition can be stated as it being the act of ending all bodily systems/function of oneself, through one's action or direction.

In this sections we will explore different definitions of suicide and discuss their merits.  We will examine
*Sub-intentional suicide
*Self Sacrifice made for the benefit of others
*Suicide as part of different cultures
*Depression and other mental illness

== Suicide as a means to an end ==
Suicide has been practiced for a long time as a means to an end. While the individual does not gain anything from the act, they may often find a goal (the advancement of an idea or ideology, the survival of family or friends, or the defense of their land) worth sacrificing their own life.

* [[/Self-Sacrifice/]]
* Suicide in Nature (non human)
* Suicide in [[/Christianity/]]
* Suicide in [[/Radical Islam/]]
* The Japanese [[/Kamikaze/]]

== Honor ==
*[[/Seppuku/]] in Japan.

== Flight from suffering ==

A major reason for suicides is the flight from some form of suffering. This can be emotional or physical suffering but either way, the thought of continued living is so overwhelming to some people that they choose to end their lives.

There are arguments for and against such a decision. These include:
* the potential for recovery which would make the person willing to continue later on
* the feelings of those who would lose their loved one
* [[/The Right to Die|the moral right to die]]

*[[/Moral Reasoning/]] (Note: the bit at the end should be moved to a page linked to from the the &quot;means to an end&quot; page.

=== Common triggers ===
Thoughts of suicide are often brought on by external triggers. These can be crises in an individual's personal or professional life, but can be aggravated by other factors.

* Drugs
** Alcohol
** Prescription drugs
* Environmental
** Mental torture
* Influence of Others
** Peer pressure
* Hormonal dysfunction, such as during adolescence
* Mental Condition

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Concept of Blended Learning'''

''The definition of blended learning''

With the advent of digital technology blended learning takes on new dimensions and merges the best features of conventional face-to-face instruction and online learning (Graham, 2006). Today’s framework of blended learning  replete with various blends and models that makes it difficult for educators to concur with a single definition of blended learning (Graham, 2006; Procter, 2003).  The most common definition of blended learning is a combination of face-to-face instruction combined with computer-mediated instruction to facilitate interactive and reflective higher-order learning (Graham, 2006).

''The types of blends''

Blended learning is about a mixture of instructional modalities, delivery media, instructional methods, and web-based technologies (Graham, 2006). Blends of instructional modalities usually include a balanced mixture of onsite, web-based, and self-paced learning (Martyn, 2004; Picciano, 2006; Rossett, Douglis, &amp; Frazee, 2003). To make blended learning more powerful, educators can blend various media delivery types, for instance, classroom trainings, seminars, web-based courses, CD-ROMs, video, computer simulations, books, study guides, the Internet, PowerPoint slides, etc (Bersin, 2003). In most cases, blended learning is designed with the use of synchronous and asynchronous web-based technologies, such as chat rooms, wikis, threaded discussions, virtual classrooms, instant messaging, conferencing tools, bulletin boards, computer conferencing, blogs, etc (Graham, 2006). Some researchers believe that incorporation of new pedagogies, learning theories, and instructional methods transform conceptually models of teaching and learning in blended learning environments (Carman, 2005). The choice of a blend is usually determined by several factors: the nature of the course content and instructional goals, student characteristics and learning preferences, instructor experience and teaching style, online resources and others (Dziuban, Hartman, Moskal, 2005).

''The principles of blended learning methodology''

Through the literature review, four main principles of educational design for blended learning are identified: (a) a thoughtful integration of face-to-face and fully online instructional components; (b) innovative use of technology; (c) reconceptualization of the learning paradigm; and (d) sustained assessment and evaluation of blended learning . The first principle is intended to maximize the advantages of both environments and better address the diverse students’ needs and preferences (Carman, 2005; Martyn, 2003). The innovative use of technology means that any technology should be applied in a pedagogically appropriate way and used for creating and maintaining socially situated and highly interactive learning (Vaughan, 2007). A reconceptualization of the learning paradigm entails the incorporation of new pedagogies and learning theories (e.g., student-centered, social constructivism), the development of new understandings and knowledge through students’ social interactions with a community of peers, and new roles of students (e.g., active author of content, self-paced learner) and teachers (e.g., mentors, coaches) (Dziuban, Moskal, &amp; Hartman, 2004). And, the fourth principle of sustained assessment and evaluation of blended learning solutions is aimed to ensure the quality of education (Graham, 2006).

''Benefits and challenges posed by blended learning'' 

Potential benefits of blended learning include pedagogical richness (shifting from a presentational format to active learning); greater access to personalized learning, to resources and experts; greater flexibility and persona agency; greater accommodation for learners and teachers of diverse backgrounds; increased interaction and sense of community; and increased cost-effectiveness (e.g., reduced seat time, decreased costs)(Albrecht, 2006; Dziuban, Moskal, &amp; Hartman, 2004; Moore, 2004; Owston, Wideman, &amp; Murphy, 2008; Picciano, 2006; Vaughan, 2007) 

Most universities face challenges to transform their instruction into a blended learning format. The four main barriers are identified:  administrative challenges (lack of awareness, policies, plans, goals, support related to blended learning), re-designing courses and/or programs, faculty preparedness, and quality assurance (Cook, Owston, &amp; Garrison, 2004; Dziuban, Moskal, &amp; Hartman, 2004).

In conclusion, it needs to be stressed that blended learning is not just a mixture of strategies and technologies, but a holistic didactical method that combines “the effectiveness and socialization opportunities of the classroom with the technologically enhanced active learning possibilities of the online environment, rather than ratio of delivery modalities” (Dziuban, Hartman, Moskal, 2004).

'''Blended Learning in the Workplace'''

''
Adult Learning Theories''

Adult learners in the workplace have very specific learning needs.  Knowles, the father of adult learning,  posited that adults preferred learning when learning is relevant, self-directed, experienced based, problem based (rather than subject based) and delivered in a social context.  (Knowles, 1990)   Experiential learning theorist Kolb, postulated that adult learning occurs in a cyclical pattern, where the learning takes place through the steps of experience, reflection, conceptualization and then application in the workplace. (Kolb, 1984)  Finally, research by Wenger on learning as social participation, suggests that the social context of learning is important to adults. (Wenger, 1998)  These three theories establish the backbone of workplace course design today and are the basis for the interest in blended learning.  

''Organizational Drivers and Needs for Blended Learning''

Workplace training evolves as employers continuously seek ways to optimize their training investments.  In the development of his Learning Management Maturity Model, Moore noted that companies mature through the stages of the learning management process.  Least mature companies are at an ad hoc level, and develop through managed-learning, competency-driven learning, integrated-performance and end at the highest level of maturity, an optimized-workforce.  He explained that organizations have various degrees of sophistication in how they plan, direct, and account for resources, participants and outcomes of learning activities within their learning management systems.(Moore, 2003)   Because organizations are at different maturity levels they require different learning solutions.  Workforce size, budget, geographical location, organizational performance objectives, learning content and learners’ individual needs dictate learning design.(Singh and Reed, 2001)  
''
Benefits of Blended Learning''

Adult learning principles, organizational maturity and advances in technology collectively point to blended learning as in increasingly optimal method for workplace learning.  Numerous studies have demonstrated that blended learning can outperformed instructor-led and e-learning programs in accuracy and speed of job performance. (Thompson Job Impact Study, 2003)  Blended learning can capitalize on adult learning needs and workplace maturity by providing self-directed, relevant experiential learning, social interaction, and access to knowledge, at the same time as being cost effective and efficient.  For the organization, blended learning can also extend the reach of the program, optimize development costs and time and accelerate the dissemination to knowledge to vital channels.(Singh and Reed, 2001)  Basically, blended learning can deliver workplace learning to the organization and the learner in a highly flexible and customized manner.

''Strategic Blending: A conceptual framework''

In the context of optimizing organizational performance while engaging the learner, Yoon and Lim redefine blended learning as Strategic Blended-Learning and Performance Solutions.  They suggest that this type of blended learning is:
“…a purposeful mix of delivery media (particularly face-to-face and various forms of technologies) to improve learning/performance solutions which are derived from the goals and needs of an organization.”  (Yoon and Lim, 2007)

Yoon and Lim design a conceptual framework that considers five interrelated phases that form a strategic connection between the goals and needs of an organization,  performance solutions and delivery methods (instructional and non-instructional). 

''The five procedural phases include'': 

1)	'''Strategy and needs analysis''' -  In this phase long term business and human resource strategies are reviewed, along with tasks, employee needs, work systems, costs and benefits and existing technology infrastructure.
  
2)	'''Performance solutions''' – Both instructional and non-instructions modes of learning reinforcement are considered at this phase.  Non-instructional techniques might include feedback, reward systems, resources or institutional support.     Based on the performance objectives of the organization; learning theories and component display theory point to the balance of face-to-face vs technology that should be employed in the blended learning strategy.

3)	'''Delivery media''' – It is at this point of the process that the specific e-learning technologies and face-to- face learning design techniques are identified.   The authors use the e-learning structures identified by Driscoll (Driscoll, 2002) and Rossett (Rossett et al, 2003) to determine the right mix of approaches.

4)	'''Strategic blending''' -  Instructional effectiveness, budget, frequency of need, and learner expectations are considered at this phase in the context of the organization’s performance goals.

5)	'''Evaluation and improvement''' – In this phase, the inputs and outputs of the strategic blended learning activity are evaluated.  The solution would be evaluated on efficiency, effectiveness, cost and the ultimate achievement of the performance outcomes. (Yoon and Lim, 2007)

''Practical Application''

According to a 2003 survey of “Blended Learning Best Practices” by The Learning Guild, over 85% of organizations are using blended learning for the creation and/or delivery of educational content.  The experience of respondents has been positive, with more than 76% saying blended learning was more effective than classroom training, and 73% suggesting that blended learning had a higher learner value/impact than non-blended processes.  Over 36% of the respondents used 6 to 10 different components in their blended program.  The top five components were classroom instruction, interactive web-based training, email communication, self-paced content, and threaded discussion. (The Learning Guild, 2003) 

Conversely, survey respondents indicated that their top five obstacles to implementing blended learning were lack of budget, choosing the right strategy, lack of senior management buy-in, inability of developers and/or trainers, and inadequate technical infrastructure. 

''Summary''

Blended learning is a widely used and effective method of workplace training in companies with mature learning management systems.  It is more effective than classroom training and meets the needs of adult learning styles.  To optimize its impact it should be tied to the organization’s strategic performance goals.  Over time, as costs decrease and awareness of these systems increase, it is likely that blended learning will become the mainstay for workplace training.

'''&lt;u&gt;Blended Learning in the EFL Setting&lt;/u&gt;''' 

''
Blended Learning Definitions for EFL''

Blended learning is a relatively new ‘pedagogical’ approach to instruction. In the English as a foreign language (EFL) setting blended learning (BL) is only just beginning to take stride. There are many definitions of BL but at the core of all the BL definitions implies a combination of face-to-face and online as components of the pedagogy (Graham, 2006). In the EFL setting social interaction is needed to facilitate language outcomes (Vygotsky, 1987). Therefore blended learning in the EFL setting can be defined as a pedagogical approach that combines the effectiveness and socialization opportunities of the classroom with the technologically enhanced active learning possibilities of the online environment (Dziuban, Hartman, Moskal, 2004). What are the learners’ needs teachers should be aware of when implementing BL in the EFL setting? What are some constraints of BL that teachers need to understanding? How does the methodology enhance the learning and thus facilitate the students overcoming the constraints of the EFL setting?	

''The Needs of the EFL Setting''

The EFL setting differs from the ESL setting in that most EFL countries the students have little or no access to the target language community (Cummins, 2001; Baker, 2000; Graddol, 2006). This means understanding of socio-pragmatic discourse, cultural understanding (Duff, P. &amp; Uchida, Y. 1997) which affects literacy, speaking and listening, and exposure to literacy genres is limited or non-existent (Al-Jarf, 2006). Therefore students’ who may be grammatically correct when speaking lacks experience with the proper meaning and context of the language.  The EFL learner differs from the ESL learner in three important aspects: a) a lack of socio-cultural exposure b) the lack of chance to practice meaningfully (Oxford, 1990; Spada &amp; Lightbown, 1996) c) the lack of high frequency exposure of English (Lee, K., 2000, O’Donnell, T.). As we will see later BL can eliminate or at least diminish many of these constraints. First, teacher awareness within this new pedagogy will be examined. 

''Constraints for the Learners''

There are three areas that can constrain the learner and they are; the design and content of the program, the teacher training, and awareness of how the student is processing the new language learning environment.   When designing a program the teacher should remember that the context of learning might not always be culturally appropriate for the students (Duff, P. &amp; Uchida, Y., 1997). Another factor in the design of the program that needs consideration is for the standardizing of content and testing. The teacher needs to upgrade and learn technology skills. This is so they are aware of how to properly utilize the tolls so to avoid a mismatch of the learning content and technology. A big mistake teachers should avoid is using technology for non-target reasons (das Neves Seesink, T., Dissertation, 2007). Finally teacher must become aware to check in with the students feelings about the programs (das Neves Seesink, T., Dissertation, 2007). Research has shown that sometimes e-learning produces anxiety in students (das Neves Seesink, T., Dissertation, 2007). Language learning is ultimately about communication therefore the teachers need to balance face-to-face with online so to avoid anxiety (Al-Jarf, 2006). 

''Benefits of Blended Learning for the EFL learner''

One thing absent in the EFL setting is the target language culture. E-learning can allow access to target language culture through the use of Youtube videos, meaningful situational interacting videos, blogs, chat rooms etc. (Duff, P. &amp; Uchida, Y. 1997). These ‘tools’ enable the EFL student to have more access to native speakers. Using tools such as blogging, wiki pages, and brainstorming aid the student with overcoming academic literacy issues (Al-Jarf, 2006).Not only can blended learning provide safe way to practice chatting without the fear of the native speaker presence. The distance created from the online atmosphere helps to relax the student’s research has found (Al-Jarf, 2006). This real life online exposure can enables strategy use in the process of reading and writing (Al-Jarf, 2006). Strategy use to solve a problem facilitates the increase in self-direct learning (Barenfanger, O., 2007). The 24 access nature of online learning coupled with the reality practice of face-to-face allows for more practice (O’Donnell, 2006). Researchers have found that the e-learning component of the blended course gives the student a chance to revisit lectures (Graham, C.,). Overall blended learning offers more affordances than constraints.

''Pitfalls of Blended learning that EFL Teachers Should Avoid''

When designing a blended learning program the needs of the students must be balanced with the outcomes expected by the institution. Teachers as good as they may be in the traditional classroom need further training so that implementation of the course is not hampered by a mismatch of content and technology. Finally the teacher and the students need to understand the collaborative nature of the new learning endeavor so that a balance will be struck and motivation to learn will remain.

'''&lt;u&gt;Blackboard Systems-Does The System Meet the Seven Principles of Good Practice in Education?&lt;/u&gt;'''

Recently university EFL programs have been using  blended learning to enhance the language learning experience. The majority of the university programs use course management systems. The most widely used of which is Blackboard (based on marketshare). Many have criticized these types of systems as being too mechanistic in their approaches to learning (Owston, 2008). Chickering,and Gamson,(1987) created an excellent list of principles with which to guide educators. In designing or revising a course, faculties are faced with at least three crucial decisions: what to teach, how to teach it, and how to ensure that students are learning what is being taught. Often, the most difficult step in preparing or revising a course is deciding which topics must be excluded if the whole is to be manageable (Davis, B. 1993, Tools for Teaching, San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, p.1). This paper will not evaluate whether or not these course management systems are well constructed as this author doesn’t have sufficient technical knowledge. Rather, this paper will critique how the Blackboard management system can be used when applying the seven principles for the EFL University setting. First, a quick evaluation of the specific needs of the EFL situation while occur.

''EFL University Needs''

Language is essentially about communication therefore learning alone in a vacuum is not an ideal learning situation. Students who learn outside of the target language community are referred to as English as a foreign language learners (EFL).  The greatest constraint in learning a language outside of the target language community is the lack of exposure to that community. It is difficult for the student if the only access to the target language community is the classroom teacher who is seen once a day or in some cases only once a week.  Research has shown that, the student needs a high frequency of exposure. Learning a new item without being able to go back and practice in a meaningful way is not effective manner of teaching. This leads to the issue of practice in the EFL setting. It has been stated that a student needs 15,000 hours of exposure to meet the basic level or proficiency. Finally the last constraint the EFL learner must deal with is learning to solve their own problems through learning strategies. These are the major needs of the EFL setting. These constraints, when implemented properly by the teacher, may be assisted by blended learning. Blended learning provides various tools that can compensate for the various deficiencies in the EFL setting.  Next there will be an examination based on the seven principles for good practice examination as to whether the teacher can utilize Black board so that all the EFL learners needs are met. One thing that is important for educators to remember is not how to use the tools but rather what teachers need to do to choose the most effective tools to bring out the learning outcomes desired. 

''Contact'' 
	
The first principle is to encourage contact. In the past it has been discussed that even though blackboard is designed for communication there is no consistency as Proctor (2004) states:
Lecturers and the way they interpreted blended learning on the individual modules. Simply using Blackboard instead of web pages to deliver the handouts and presentations and combining it with discussion boards resulted in some staff stating that we were not really doing any e-learning on the course which is a communication and support tool, it is not a learning tool.” (Reflections on the Use of Blended Learning, Education in A Changing Environment, 14th Conference Proceedings, p.6). Recently Blackboard training has tried to overcome this by including in the training section discussion rubics (see Appendix A). Handing this out to students will allow them to understand the importance of using the discussion boards as it is not just for fun. Chat groups and virtual chats can be defined and facilitated by the lecturer so that there is a meaningful outcome to using these features. For example one can assign students into chat groups. Within these groups there are specific topics to explore. Moreover the instructor could monitor and add components to guide the direction the conversation flows. This same technique is used during the conversation section of an ESL/EFL class. Later the information can be discussed in the F-2-F section of the class. This ensures people are processing the information chatted about as the student needs to relay again later. This also enhances the practice component by reusing the vocabulary learned or shared during the chat.

''Reciprocity and Cooperation'' 

How can the use of blackboard allow for the fostering of reciprocity and cooperation? On blackboard not only can you set up students as moderators but also grade their postings. For the EFL setting this allows the instructor to have the students work together. This is done by having the students take turns to moderate discussions. Also giving them netiquette allows them to understand the parameters of using the system (see appendix b). As stated in the netiquette page: 

“Facilitators should remind students that others may interpret their email, messages, and discussion posts differently due to the lack of physical contact during their communication. As a result, online communities have developed tools to assist members in sharing their facial expressions, emotional reactions, and other feelings” (Netiquette taken from Blackboard training session June, 6th, 2008) 

Teachers need to relay to students that the tools in communication should mirror human interaction and not to hide be hide the mechanistic framework of the tools.

''Active Learning''

Active learning is important. Teachers perceive Blackboard to encourage active learning with functional student centered flexibility. The problem with using digital technology is the lack of transparency of student effort. As discussed in Proctor (2004) they also believed that students abused the flexibility issue:

I asked them to read things… they weren’t doing it. … Well that is then the nub of the course, it is the expectation of the student of what they [students] are expected to do [by a student centered course]. If they [students] think by coming in half as many hours a week as a traditional part time course it is to do half as much work, we haven’t really achieved what we were initially trying to achieve. What we are expecting them to do is quite a bit more on their own, aren’t we? Using whatever resources we provide them. (p. 7)

Yet a way to overcome this is to make learning not just giving activities but to discuss them in a group in the F-2-F setting. Facilitating discussion as to how the student felt, what they learned, what confused or frustrated them and informing the students that the activities will be assessed is important.

''Feedback''

Research has shown that feedback is essential in language learning (Spade &amp; Lightbown, 1996). Therefore EFL lecturers must remember to use this function effectively and consistently. Every time a student posts in a discussion correction by the teacher of content, structure, and form of the language is essential in aiding the students learning. After the posting the teacher is able to e-mail back the postee and discuss the necessary corrections needed. 

''Emphasis on task''

Diligence in forcing students to spend the needed time for an activity is crucial in the success of blended learning. Blackboard has all types of functions that can allow the teacher to assign language activities. Teachers must be cognitive of implementing guidelines and parameters such as there must be 3 posting a week, group discussions must each contain at least written lines, and all on-line activities will be discussed in the F-2-F class. These parameters set up specific time to spend on a task. 

''High Expectations''

For the EFL student this is important because practice and spending time communicating allows students to acquire language.Often students and teachers have preconceived expectations of what blended learning can accomplish. Teachers need to state what is expected of them upfront. Also in the face to face first meeting teachers should collaborate with the students to set up a contract of what is expected of the teacher and what is expected of the learner. This process eliminates misunderstandings created both by instructors and students of what and how blended learning works. 

''Respect for ways of learning''

The final principle of encouraging respect of diverse ways of learning is hallmark in EFL pedagogy. This is a major component in language learning. 

''Conclusion''

The black board program was analyzed for two things; first to see if teachers can instruct following the good practices framework, and also does blackboard have the ability to enable the teacher to facilitate students overcoming the constraints inherent in the EFL setting. My experience is that the technical tools do so but it is up to the teacher to become aware of the constraints hidden in technology and use good practices to avoid these pitfalls. For the EFL setting blended learning can be defined as a pedagogical approach that combines the effectiveness and socialization opportunities of the classroom with the technologically enhanced active learning possibilities of the online environment (Dziuban, Hartman, Moskal, 2004). This interactive socialization needs to be kept in mind when implementing a blended learning program. Relying just on the structure of a course management system such as blackboard would be a pedagogical mistake.

'''Online Discussion Forums'''

There has been a push to embrace collaborative learning in education.  Simultaneously, there is also an increasing demand for the integration of digital technology in education.  As a result, the online discussion group has emerged.  The online discussion group is a tool that allows participants to engage in collaborative learning within a digital environment, and has been established as a popular method to apply accepted learning theories through technology.  Drawing on Vygotsky’s social development theory, the online discussion group provides a space for participants to engage in dialogue and develop a dynamic learning community which enhances and enriches understanding of content (Kayler and Weller, 2007).

Two major forms have come to typify online discussion: the chat and the forum.  The chat is characterized as a synchronous conversation that occurs between multiple participants who are online at the same time, allowing questions and responses to be posted simultaneously.  The forum, however, is asynchronous and does not occur in real-time.  Therefore, participants are afforded the flexibility and convenience to provide reflective and thoughtful contributions to an online discussion at their leisure (Wall Williams et al., 2001).

	Online discussions have been heralded in education for a variety of reasons.  Perhaps the most valuable is the claim that online discussions allow for an enriched learning experience that results in a higher order of thinking.  In her research, Meyer (2003) observed that students involved in a threaded, asynchronous online discussion tend to exhibit a higher level of thinking that may not be seen in the classroom, particularly when they contribute comments that are exploratory in nature.  Meyer (2004) also identifies the value in the written document that is produced in an online discussion that can be referred to and analyzed by both student and teacher at any time for assessment purposes.

	The nature of online connectivity to transform time and space has also influenced the application of the online discussion group.  Research conducted by Kayler and Weller (2007) indicated that utilizing a web-based learning community is an effective means to expand teacher-student interaction time and classroom pedagogy beyond face-to-face opportunities, thereby extending the boundaries of the educational arena.  Other research has indicated that online discussion, particularly asynchronous forums, allows for “unrestrained, comfortable, and flexible participation, in addition to allowing unlimited space for participants to express viewpoints as well as being able to read other group member's contributions and build on them” (Wall Williams et al., 2001, p. 151).  The opportunity for students to read, analyze, and respond to the work of their peers is one that is relatively unique, and helps foster a supportive and encouraging atmosphere as well as allows students to see how others write, reflect, inquire and debate.

	Like all technology, online discussion is not without its challenges.  Perhaps the greatest challenge is that it has proven time consuming.  Successful and meaningful online discussion requires effective planning, reading and responding to contributions, and monitoring and directing the discussion, all of which can be very time-consuming and lead to a less positive experience for both teacher and student (Parra, 2000; Meyer, 2003).  In addition, a lack of participation or the tendency for simple, shallow contributions can also diminish the meaning and success of an online discussion (Kayler and Weller, 2007).

Another challenge lies in the very nature of online interaction.  Online interaction can be perceived as distant and impersonal, lacking the body-language and visual cues that contribute to making meaning in a face-to-face encounter.  Depending on the preferred learning style of a student or their comfort level with digital technology, opportunities for misunderstanding and miscommunication may arise (Wall Williams et al., 2001; Meyer, 2003).  Other challenges hinging around accessibility and the technological skills students and teachers require to engage in online discussions also need to be considered.

'''Moderating'''

Being a good moderator is a very difficult role.  Moderators act in numerous ways to not only police an online discussion, but are also act as administrators and work to keep discussion going when it starts to falter.  According to Collins and Berge (1997), “Findings included indicators of the roles of moderators acting a different times and for different lists as a filter, firefighter, facilitator, administrator, editor, promoter, expert, helper, participant, and marketer.”  Feenberg and Xin add, “Teachers must adopt a dialogic style  involving students actively in the electronic classroom. Collaborative learning theory finds its most compelling realization in this setting. Online teachers must exploit this potential of the medium to create an educational experience comparable in quality to the conventional classroom. Properly performed, the moderating role in the online discussion forum can serve as a basis for this new type of collaborative learning.”

Moderators lead the way in making sure that a conference or discussion is successful.  They need to act to keep the discussion on track as well as limit hurtful, unconstructive or off topic discourse.  They key to being a good moderator is to develop a set of specific and explicit rules regard the behaviour of site users.  These codes of behaviour should be agreed upon by all users.  Furthermore, in order to create a cohesive community and improve discussion, the users themselves should help to create these rules.
 
It is important to understand that good moderators act as teachers, facilitating discussions toward specific outcomes.  It is important to understand that the skills needed to be successful in this task face-to-face can be very different from those needed online.  As Chao says, “Moderating online conferencing is as important as conducting discussion in class. You want to create a friendly, non-threatening atmosphere so students feel free to speak of their minds. You want to make sure the discussion is on topic and everyone participates equally. There are even tactics to increase participation and to avoid potential conflicts between diverse perspectives. The need for moderating discussion in class and on line is the same but the techniques vary significantly.”

While the need for moderators in online discussion groups is significant when dealing with classrooms moving to online spaces, more and more message boards and online discussion forums (youtube, myspace, facebook, etc.) employ few moderators.  Instead they rely on users to self-moderate, or to effectively use peer pressure to help keep the discussion flowing and safe for all users.  This is similar to Wikipedia in that while one user can do a lot of damage by vandalizing an article, any other user can easily and quickly undo the damage at any time.  Online discussion groups rely on these moral users to police their message boards.

Moderators walk a fine line in online discussion groups.  Yet it is only through their use that elearning communities can flourish.  While self-moderating works for general discussion boards, any system devoted to learning must allow for facilitators to model proper interactions and keep the peace.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;'''What is Web Accessibility?'''&lt;/u&gt;

Web accessibility in an extension of the inclusion movement whereby all components within society and the environment in which we live are available and readily accessible to everyone, including people with a disability.   “It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities.”  (WAI, p.2)

&quot;The potential of the Internet is access for anyone to anything from anywhere at anytime.&quot; (Wall &amp; Sarver, 2003, p. 1)   In the age of technology, the internet has opened up the world to everyone, in particular for those individuals with a disability.  The internet has provided unprecedented opportunities for individuals to access information, make life choices and improve the quality of life.  According to Berry (1998) “the Web is becoming an everyday part of life for many people” (p.1).    


&lt;u&gt;'''Magnitude of the Issue'''&lt;/u&gt;

According to Statistics Canada (2006) there are 4.4 millions Canadians (1 in 7) with a disability.   Disability is multi-faceted and can include a visual or auditory impairment, physical limitations, cognitive issues, speech impairment, a neurological issue and/or multiple diagnoses.  Not all individuals with a disability encounter issues when using the internet or other forms of technology, however a significant number require some type of assistance.


&lt;u&gt;'''World Wide Web Consortium'''&lt;/u&gt;

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was established in the 1990s to serve as the governing body for the web.   The Web Accessibility Initiative, stemming from the W3C, was established in 1997 for the purpose of promoting web functionality for people with disabilities and establishing accessibility guidelines for use by web developers. (Introduction to Web Accessibility (n.d.)) 


&lt;u&gt;'''Students with a Disability and Postsecondary Education'''&lt;/u&gt;

For students with a disability the issue of access to education has become very important, in particular access in relation “to the environment of the Internet”  (Rowland, 2000, p.1).    According to Rowland (2000), “the web is a fundamental tool in postsecondary education” (p.3).   Rowland (2000) further adds that “the intent of postsecondary education is to help prepare an educated citizenry to become participatory, productive members of our country’s workforce and society” (p.3).  If the internet is not accessible to students with a disability then it limits the student experience and the capacity to learn and succeed.     

Wall and Sarver (2003) stated that “a postsecondary education is no longer a luxury of the wealth but a necessity for anyone who wants to enjoy a decent lifestyle” (p.282).   In 2005, the Government of Ontario implemented the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.  Within this legislation, all businesses and organizations, including institutions of higher learning will be required to eliminate all barriers which limit accessibility.  (Government of Ontario, 2005)  

Educational administrators need to be aware of the legal, economic and social ramifications for not providing access to barrier-free educational opportunities.   Administrators and students alike must work together to ensure that an accessible education includes appropriate access to the internet.  As stated by Wall and Sarver (2003) “Use of the internet means access to a world of information.  Thus, it is important that students with disabilities have the same access to the internet as other students.” (p.278)

&lt;u&gt;'''Tools and Parameters for the Design of Accessible Web Sites'''&lt;/u&gt; 

''“The power of the web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.”''  Tim Berners-Lee

In this Web 2.0 environment, attention (and criticism) has turned to how design of online environment must be aware of the diverse needs of the segment of users with disabilities. Of late, there has been a deluge of academic papers on this subject offering many solutions to this social and technological challenge. “Technological” because it is often that assistive technology is required to overcome the lack of access for disabled users.

''““Technical accessibility is not enough to make a website easy to use. The real question is whether users can get what they want from a website in a reasonable amount of time and whether the visit is pleasant for them. Users with disabilities are human and need easy and simple user interfaces just like anybody else.”''  Jakob Nielsen

When considering the creating and designing of accessible website, the designer(s) must consider the following criteria in order to evaluate and finally measure, the approachability and usability of the site:

'''• Content 
• Organization and Navigation
• Performance 
• Compatibility 
• Interaction 
• Visual Design'''

To define the word design, one must be aware that in the online environment, design needs to be considered from the following points of view:

'''• Graphic design''': Visual communication of information
'''• Information design:''' Identifying groups of related content; structuring info into a coherent whole
'''• Navigation design:''' Designing methods of finding one’s way around the info structure
'''• User interface design/Info Architecture:''' Primarily, the design of navigation systems; combination of info design and navigation design

And in some cases,

'''• User experience design:''' More esoteric design based on the psychology of online consumer behaviour and buying habits

Examples of sites who have employees responsible for this burgeoning area of design include: ''Amazon, EBay, Apple, Nike, Mercedes-Benz, Mac Cosmetics, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts'' and other category leaders that rely on a personal relationship sell and corresponding user loyalty. 

Tools of Web Design

The majority of web deign is conducted using a small cadre of the actual software available. They include, but are not limited to: 

• Macromedia ''Director, Flash''
• Adobe ''Illustrator''
• ''Photoshop
• Dreamweaver
• Visio
• BBEdit''

Further, the range of products that can be used for specific needs and areas of customization is almost limitless and includes many other nascent digital tools.

Assistive technologies to permit a range of disabled persons to interact with websites are now available and have revolutionized the impact with the disabled segment. Visually impaired, hearing impaired and many other users who have up until now, been marginalized because of a lack of creative and technological vision, are expecting to be able to use most major web sites who have seized the opportunity to attract and retain new customers/users.

''“In most projects, accessibility has fairly low priority because project managers underestimate the number of people who are impacted by design problems…”''
		Jakob Nielsen

The revenue generated by this group of people, by online participation, is estimated in the billions (See Danielle Chateau’s posted presentation on accessibility for citation.). Partly due to this progress is being made on a number of fronts when analyzing online communications for disabled users. However, of concern to note anecdotally, in the 2nd edition of the very popular series “Web Design For Dummies”, there is absolutely no mention of accessibility and/or usability in the entire 316-page book. This indicates a significant disconnect between what many governments have mandated (President Clinton’s online accessibility bill, for example) and the marketplace in general. In time, I have confidence that this will change. The most powerful force in today’s society–the consumer– will demand it.

The Reality of Internet Filtering/Blocking 
 
By G. Chabrol.

While every educator will agree that the value of the computer and the Internet as an educational aid to learning is no longer debatable, there remain grave concerns about how much inappropriate material is on the Internet and how best to avoid it reaching students.  As students become more computer savvy, this situation becomes more acute as they soon find ways to access it anyway.  Besides the social (communication) and political (freedom of speech) ramifications of this issue, an additional problem is that digital technology is not static.  It is constantly evolving, changing and expanding.  As soon as a solution protocol is found, the technology improves and the issue of filtering is exacerbated.  But is Internet filtering/blocking desirable?  The overwhelming point of view in the literature suggests that it is not desireable.

The issue is succinctly stated by T. A. Callister Jr. et el. In, Just Give It To Me Straight: A Case Against Filtering The Internet:

“One of the most controversial and contentious issues surrounding the use of new information and communication technologies, especially in schools and libraries, is whether or not authorities should filter students’ access to the Internet.  Like other kinds of “filter”, Internet filters keep out “bad” content while allowing “good” content to pass through (Callister et el.2004).   

Callaister et el. Agrees that every parent has a right to monitor what their children are exposed to on the Internet and television.  But “Schools and libraries, on the other hand, have a wider educational responsibility to expose students to a broader rang of ideas, experiences and point of views” (Callister et el.).  More schools than ever are being equipped with computers with access to the internet.  This is both a good thing and a problematic in other ways.  It is good for the purpose of education and learning as students are hooked up to the world and there is no limit to research potential.  Conversely, they can and will in all likelihood be exposed to inappropriate material, often unsolicited.   It then must fall on the teacher/school to ensure a secure screening method is used.  They must screen for content and be aware of the Board’s policies on this matter.  Many Boards for instance have policies prohibiting the use of inappropriate language, hate material, racist comments, sexism, etc.  

There are any numbers of ways to do this.  For instance, computers in the lab/class could be blocked by the teacher to certain sites which are deemed inappropriate.  Or, the computer could be loaded only with specific material peculiar to the curriculum thus excluding the need to use the internet.  Some schools use site licenses to load DVD’s and run all programmes from it.  Alternatively, where Boards of education may have their own servers, as many of them do today, access to certain sites are blocked centrally.  What level of access is desired is determined by such things as grade level and Board policy.  However, the practice of denial of access is a controversial issue.  For instance, as noted in her book, “Access Denied”, Lynn Sutton (2006), from as far back as 2000, “the Commission On Online Child Protection presented its final report (COPA, 200) to the congress” (Sutton, p.11).  Essentially, “The report stated that the best internet filtering technologies can be highly effective in directly blocking access to content that is harmful to minors, but noted that there are significant concerns about first amendment issues when filters are used in libraries and schools” (Sutton, p.11).  By and large, “the vast majority of content is blocked because it is sexually explicit, though chat rooms, email and software downloads are also formats that are commonly blocked” (Sutton, p.11).

In 2004, L.B Ayre conducted a study that also looked at the status of filtering technology (Sutton, p.11).  He noted that filters used several methods for blocking data: word blocking…and site blocking, which matches URLs against a list of predetermined sites (Rosenburg, 2001) (Sutton, p.11).  Another commission to study the use of Internet filtering technology was the Committee to Study Tools and Strategies for Protecting Kids from Pornography and Their Applicability to Other Inappropriate Internet Content” of the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Resource Council” (Sutton, p.11).  They found that “due to the nature of filters, ‘underblocking’ and ‘overblocking’ errors are inevitable” (Sutton, p.11).  Based on this study, one of their findings was that “while the issue of underblocking and overblocking should not, in and of in itself, rule out filters as a useful tool, the extent of underblocking and overblocking is a significant factor in understanding and deciding the use of filter” (Sutton, p.12) (Thornburg ).  They further noted legal challenges to government – mandated filters focused primarily on underblocking and overblocking problems” (Sutton, p.12).  But perhaps their more telling conclusion is that “social and educational strategies”, more than technologies are most useful. (Sutton, p.12)

At the same time, schools, perhaps motivated among other things, by the fear of liable suites, are increasingly installing filtering technology ostensibly for the protection of students.  For instance, “since 2001, the children internet protection act requires schools receiving the federal communication commissions universal service e-rate discount to install “technology protection measures” (i.e. filters) on computers with internet access” (Sutton, p.12).  Because of this action, “according to Cattague and Farris (2001), the e-rate program has been largely responsible for the increase in internet access in public schools” (Sutton, p.12).  This notwithstanding, Sutton argues, the individual rights to free speech remains important and would be challenged if the government should impose limits.  The advantages of filters in school libraries was studied by Josh (2001), Powell and Bailey (1999).  They found that the reduced chances of a student accessing “inappropriate material must be balanced against the knowledge that any kind of commercial filter will almost certainly block appropriate material, with a corresponding risk of violating students’ “first amendment right” (Sutton, p.13).  This position is not unanimous however.  According to some speech advocates such as Callister and Burbules, (2003); Knanich (2004) and Willard, (2003), they are quite open in their assertion that using filters are over-protective and “damaging in the long run” (Sutton, p.12).

All of this is not lost on the students.  As more students become technologically savvy, they are becoming increasingly more frustrated with limitations on their Internet access in schools” (Sutton, p.13). Levin and Arafeh (2000) conducted studies that looked at the attitudes and behaviours of students using the Internet in schools.  In their work, they used qualitative methods to describe these students’ reactions.  They summarize the frustration by students this way: “while many students recognize the need and or desire to shelter teenagers from inappropriate material and adult-orientated commercial ads, they complain that blocking and filtering software raise significant barriers to their legitimate, educational use of the internet” (p.19) (Sutton, p.13).  

In her book, “Access Denied”, Lynn Sutton (2006), noted “[B]ecause of the legal controversies surrounding the Children’s Internet Protection Act in recent years, the literature has been filled with various kinds of studies and opinion pieces on the effectiveness of filters” (p.13).  She noted that the Kaiser study that is reported in Richardson, et el., 2002, looked at the differences that filters made in removing a large amount of harmless material (p.13). The authors of this study focussed their attention on adolescents’ use of the Internet for health reasons.  “The objective of the study was to measure how much pornography-blocking software used in schools and libraries limits access to health information Web sites” (p.13).  They found that: 

“The use of filtering software in public schools is of special concern, because adolescents’ health concerns often focus on issues related to sexuality, and because those who do not have computers at home rely on schools and libraries for Internet access (p. 2888) (p.15). 

The author (of this study) also stated that there is a “surprising lack of empirical studies on blocking errors” (p.15).  As a methodology, they used simulations of searching of health information questions.  What they found was surprising.  “The results showed only minimal overblocking of litigitimate health sites at the “least restrictive” level, but significantly more overblocking at the “most restrictive” level”. (Sutton, p.14).  They also noted that the amount of overblocking varied according to the topic, but such topics as “safe sex’ was blocked much more extensively than others such as breast cancer, for instance.  These findings prompted the authors of the study to put forth the following warning:   
There may be principled reasons why some schools or libraries choose to block more than pornography, including some kinds of health information.  These decisions, however, should be viewed as important policy decisions and not mere technical configuration issues to be left to network administrators” (p. 2893).

The importance of this argument is emblematic of the discourse in this field.  For instance, as Sutton (2006) points out, “in a statement to the Kaiser Study, noted free speech activist Nancy Williard (2002) emphasized the dangers of oveblocking at the most restrictive level and states “this study clearly demonstrates the concerns about placing reliance on filtering software” (p.3).  Countering this position, H. Auld, author of the article “Filters work: Get over it” in American Libraries (2003) believes that he study’s findings indicated that filters, when operated at their least restricted setting, posed only a minor impediment to searching for health information (for instance)” (Sutton, p.15)   Another impediment to access is that schools that implement internet blocking software will block at a minimum tens of thousands of sites inappropriately because the Web pages are miscategorised (p.15).  So in effect, “the level of filter settings can be identified as a key element in the overall effectiveness of a filtering program”(Sutton, p.15).  

So in conclusion, although Internet filtering/blocking software has been subjected to some intellectual scrutiny in recent years, it is fair to say that, given that there is no clear consensus on its usability, and given that the proliferation of inappropriate material is not likely to end any time soon, a good deal more needs to be done if a viable solution is to be found.  In all likelihood, total agreement on this issue will not be found as the issue is too complex.  But whatever is developed, a crucial caveat must be adhered to according to Kaiser.  He warns “Any complete discussion of the literature on filtering technology must include an accounting of legal challenges to government-ordered restrictions on Internet speech” (p.16).  As is agreed by all, protection of our children is crucial.  How we go about doing this remains the challenge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''What is a Virtual Environment And How did it come to be?'''

A virtual learning environment (VLE) or virtual world, can be defined as an interactive simulated environment accessed by multiple users through an online interface. In order to fully appreciate he capacity of a VLE one must go back to the inception of the Internet. In 1969 The United States Defense Department created ARPANET a precursor to the Internet. Fifteen years later Islands of Kesmai, the first commercial MMORPG (massive, multiplayer, role play games) was launched on Compuserve. This is an example of early &quot;coming together&quot; on the Internet. At this time William Gibson publishes Neuromancer. In this work Gibson explores artificial intelligence, virtual reality, genetic engineering, and multinational overpowering corporations long before these ideas entered popular culture. By using words like &quot;cyber speak&quot; and &quot;cyberspace,&quot; Gibson provided the vernacular for an emerging technology and a generation. By 1992 Neal Stephenson's novel Snow Crash is published and in this work, a new vision of virtual worlds is created, contenting ideas about history, linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, religion, computer science, politics, cryptography and philosophy. In the late nineties most virtual worlds fade because the hardware and bandwidth requirements are too stringent and dot-com funding dries up at the end of the millennium. 

 

'''7 Commonalities to all Virtual Environments/Worlds'''

1. All virtual environments are populated by avatars. An avatar is a computer user's representation of himself or herself, whether in the form of a 3D model or a 2D icon. In English, the word avatar has come to mean &quot;an embodiment or an bodily manifestation of the Divine.&quot; However, the Sanskrit word Avatara mean &quot;The descent of God&quot; or simply &quot;incarnation.&quot; 

2. All virtual environments provide a shared space. A place that allows many users from around the world to interact at once.

3. All virtual environments host a graphical user interface. The world depicts space visually, ranging in style from 2D &quot;cartoon&quot; imagery to more immersive 3D environments.

4. All the action in virtual environments takes place in real time.

5. All virtual environments are interactive, and users can alter, develop and build with the environment.

6. All virtual environments will continue if the user is not logged in.

7. All virtual environments allow and encourage the formation of in-world social groups, teams, guilds, clubs, cliques, housemates, neighborhoods, etc.

'''Why are Virtual Environments created?''' 

Virtual environments have also been built for purposes other than gaming. The following section summarizes a few ways in which virtual environments are currently being used:

'''Commercial Gaming:''' Tends to focus on a singular fictional theme and consistently follows formal conventions such as character-focused avatars, progression through an interactive narrative storyline, and a series of competitive events. These environments are strongly influenced by fantasy, science fiction, and anime genres of literature and film. The majority of virtual environments in existence today are commercial gaming world. • 

'''Socializing/ Online community building:''' These environments emphasize socializing rather than gaming. This environment offers a more open-ended experience and is strongly influenced by the cultures of text-based chat rooms. Although small-scale, casual games may be incorporated into a social world, participants are not necessarily there to win or play a game, but rather to socialize with other and in many cases create and decorate a personal space such as a home, room, or apartment. Social worlds tend to use settings based on idealized versions of reality. Most provide some basic building tools and the ability to host activities and events that revolve around a wide variety of topics. 

'''Education:''' In most cases, educational worlds are sponsored by academic institutions or nonprofit organizations, although some educational worlds are sponsored by corporations. Educational worlds come in a wide variety of forms, including 3D recreations of museum and gallery spaces, computer programming tutorials, virtual libraries, and meeting spaces for online university courses.

'''Military Training:''' Governments are using virtual environments to train their troops. Soldiers can practice high-risk combat situations in a safe, affordable environment. A variety of situations can be programmed, and depending on human interaction, different outcomes can be explored and addressed.    



'''Virtual Environments: Second Life''' 


'''Second Life: Introduction''' 

One of the virtual environments that has been popularized recently is Second Life. Second Life was launched on June 23, 2003 by Linden Labs. It is widely popular with individuals in their early 30s (Generation X), and, according to the Kzero research group, it has 13 million registered accounts, which makes it one of the largest virtual environments.  To understand Second Life, it is important to make the distinction between virtual environments and Massively Mulitplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG).  Whereas MMORPG are games where content is designed by developers and consumed by players, virtual environments are places where residents co-construct physical and social content through socialization and collaboration. The content of many virtual environments and in this case Second Life is co-constructed collaboratively by residents through creativity, invention, taking on identities, and experimentation. “Practices of the participants, their actions, conversations, movements, and exchanges come to define the world and continually infuse it with new meanings” (Thomas &amp; Brown, 2007). 


'''Second Life: Environment’s Characteristics''' 

'''Distributed Networks''' 

Second Life is a complex visual and audio-based 3D environment which is characterized by distributed networks as its residents are geographically, demographically, and generationally dispersed. Thomas &amp; Brown (2007) also suggest that the distributed networks are, at the same time, co-present as, for any interaction to take place, residents’ avatars are in the same space. 

 
'''Participatory Culture and Interaction''' 

According to Ondrejka (2008), another characteristic that makes Second Life unique is its participatory culture (culture of interacting, sharing, and collaborating) characterized by innovation and creativity.  Participatory culture is integral for Second Life to function as the social and physical content of the environment is collaboratively authored, preserved, modified, and maintained by its residents (Robbins quoted in Arreguin, 2007) through the process of what Yowell (Yowell quoted in Arreguin, 2007) and Thomas &amp; Brown (2007) call networked imagination.  To explain this further, it is the collective or network imagination of Second Life residents that leads to the creation of urban and natural spaces where the residents congregate, and it is the collective imagination of the residents that results in defining the purpose to meet in those spaces. These purposes can range from social gatherings to educational initiatives such as lectures or workshops.  Because it is the residents of Second Life who are the creators and developers of the physical and social content, the quality and complexity of this virtual environment depend entirely on residents’ agency, that is, their willingness, frequency, and quality of interactions. 

It is up to the residents to decide to what degree they become involved in this space. This, according to Ondrejka (2008), largely depends on residents’ needs, desires, and constraints.  It is also worthy to point out that, in contrast to interaction in other Web 2.0 applications such as blogging, wikis, or microblogging which is sequential, the interaction in Second Life and other similar virtual environments is always synchronous.


'''Learning as Social Practice''' 

Because the content is co-constructed by its residents, Second Life is an environment where learning occurs through social interaction.  Ondrejka (2008) labels it as peer-to-peer pedagogy, learning which is modeled on the apprenticeship model put forward by Vygotsky (Vygotsky, 1978) and which takes place in communities of practice created by learners (Wenger, 1998).  “Rather than requiring learners to become proficient in all Second Life skills, students are encouraged to become dependent on each other’s talents and strengths to the point of leading and teaching each other” (Arreguin, 2007).  Learning in Second Life is predominantly driven by the needs of the individual.  Ondrejka (2008) points out that there is no pre-set curriculum and that learning is regulated primarily by the needs of the learners. According to Robbins (Robbins quoted in Arreguin, 2007) knowledge is pulled by the learners rather than pushed at a student.  Robbins also stresses that the roles of the learner and instructor change as a result of this; the learner becomes an instructor and the instructor becomes a learner. Learning in Second Life occurs through formal and informal instances that include conventions, conferences, workshops and demonstrations organized and led by more experienced residents or through informal peer-to-peer synchronous voice or text chats. Learning in Second Life is also supported by exchange of knowledge, expertise, and information through a mush-up of technologies that are adjacent to Second Life. Thus, Second Life residents continue to learn by interacting outside of Second Life by writing blogs, collaborating on wikis, joining facebook groups, exchanging twits on twitter or other microblogging applications, or participating in conversations on listservs, sharing images on flickr, and sharing resources on delicious or other social networking sites. 


'''Second Life: New Learner/Shift in Learning''' 

Researchers who are exploring virtual environments point out that these environments are important to analyze for educators to understand what the characteristics of the 21st century learners are and how learning is changing as a result of these learners’ participating in these environments.  Thomas &amp; Brown (2007) argue that virtual environments exemplify a new type of learner and a significant shift in learning. Because residents can create new identities and take on new roles, the concept of identity expands. According to Thomas &amp; Brown (2007), learner’s identity cannot be considered binary anymore (real life vs. virtual reality identity), rather, they argue, an individual’s virtual reality identity is supplemental to real world identity.  Because of the semiotic characteristics of virtual environments, knowledge acquisition is also conceptualized differently. According to Thomas &amp; Brown (2007), residents learn to BE rather than learn ABOUT concepts and ideas as it is done via traditional models of learning.  Furthermore, they argue that knowledge gained in/required to function in virtual environments should not be treated in binary terms (virtual reality knowledge vs. real world knowledge) but it is supplemental to real life knowledge. Thus, virtual world residents construct their identity and knowledge both/and (not either outside/either inside the world) (Thomas &amp; Brown, 2007). This new conceptualization of learner’s identity and the purpose of knowledge acquisition has led Thomas &amp; Brown to believe that virtual environments such as Second Life and other spaces are important spaces to study as they are making a significant impact on today’s learners and their learning.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

Simply Molecular orbital theory:
does it need to contain the formula?  -no beginning student would use it.  only mentioning the concept of overlaping and combining th orbitals is important
How much history is needed? Cut most out.
Overview:  Good content, but long.  The end parts(Methane, Benzene) have excess detail.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ON BREAK == 

=== Statement ===
(+)	Appearance		(+)	Standard			Console	

=== Syntax === 
&lt;pre&gt;
ON BREAK {FN userFunction|GOSUB{lineNumber|&quot;stmtLabel&quot;}} 
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description === 
This statement designates a particular function or subroutine as a break-event handling routine. A break-event handling routine is called in response to a cmd-period keypress by the user. After a cmd-period keypress event occurs, FB does not call your designated routine immediately. Instead, your program continues executing until it reaches a HANDLEEVENTS statement; at that time, HANDLEEVENTS will call your designated routine. If the user presses cmd-period but you have not designated any break-event handling routine, your program continues executing until a HANDLEEVENTS is reached; FB then displays an alert asking the user whether to continue or to stop. If the user elects to stop, FB next calls your &quot;stop-event&quot; handling routine, if any (see ON STOP); and then your program stops. If the user elects to continue, the program continues executing at the first statement following the HANDLEEVENTS. One common use for a break-event handling routine is to prevent the user from stopping your program by means of cmd-period. 

Your routine can be as simple as this: 
&lt;pre&gt;
LOCAL FN DoBreak
END FN 
&lt;/pre&gt;
This function does nothing, but if you designate it in an &quot;ON BREAK FN DoBreak&quot; statement, then cmd-period keypresses will be &quot;routed&quot; to this function rather than causing the &quot;Stop or Continue&quot; alert to be displayed. 

Note:

If you use the ON BREAK FN userFunction syntax, then userFunction must refer to a function which was defined or prototyped at an earlier location in the source code. Your break-event handling function should not take any parameters, nor return a result.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ON DIALOG == 

=== Statement ===
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console	

=== Syntax === 
&lt;pre&gt;
ON DIALOG {FN userFunction|GOSUB{lineNumber|&quot;stmtLabel&quot;}} 
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description === 
This statement designates a particular function or subroutine as a dialog-event handling routine. A dialog-event handling routine is called in response to a number of different kinds of user actions and internal events; see the DIALOG function for more information. After a dialog event occurs, FB does not call your designated routine immediately. Instead, your program continues executing until a HANDLEEVENTS statement is reached. At that time, HANDLEEVENTS will call your designated routine once for each dialog event that occurred; your designated routine should examine the DIALOG(0) and DIALOG(evnt) functions to get information about the event. If you have not designated any dialog-event handling routine, FB ignores events of this kind. 

Note:
If you use the ON DIALOG FN userFunction syntax, then userFunction must refer to a function which was defined or prototyped at an earlier location in the source code. Your dialog-event handling function should not take any parameters, nor return a result.

[[Image:SDShift.png|600px]]

If the supply curve increases (such as an excise tax burden), the new equilibrium will have higher quantity and lower price; if it is lowered, the reverse happens. 


==Shift in demand==
[[Image:HouSDShift3.png|600px]]

If the demand curve increases (such as something being in fashion), the new equilibrium will have higher quantity and higher price; if it is lowered, the reverse happens. 


==Shift in supply and demand==
[[Image:HouSDShift2.png|600px]]

If both curves shift, their individual effects are added, although with slight alterations due to warping in the shape of the curves. If both curves increase, quantity increases for sure but price is indeterminate; if both curves decrease, quantity decreases for sure but price is indeterminate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hostile environment is understood as every possible factor that prevents a system (of any complexity or at any level) from performing its function correctly. 

As an embedded systems designer one should make sure that hostile environment is taken in account during the development stage. Although existing systems encountering hostile environments can perfectly be protected as well, it is helpful to take hostile environment into consideration already in the design stage, in order not to introduce hostile environment yourself by faulty system design.
Apart from their positive effect on system performance, the countermeasures to hostile environments may have negative effects on other system parameters, e.g. rising economical cost, weight, power consumption, etc.
But even if a design contains the necessary countermeasures to hostile environment, a failure of the system is not always inevitable. In case of failure, there are several manners in which a system fails. That is where [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Failure_modes_and_prevention|failure modes]] turn up. When countermeasures against hostile environment fail, the failure modes need to be observed in a correct way.

In this section we will try to present some basic design rules to deal with hostile environment.

==Examples of hostile environments==
Below is an inexhaustive list of possible hostile environments

*	Extreme temperatures (aerospace: -200°C to +150°C)
*	Excessive current, [[w:Overvoltage|overvoltage]] due to thunderstorm or due to starting electromotors
*	[[w:Electromagnetic_radiation|Electromagnetic radiation]] of other devices
*	Interference of the [[w:Power_grid|power grid]] (50 Hz or 60 Hz) 
*	[[w:Electrostatic_discharge|Electrostatic discharge]]
*	[[w:Robocup|Robocup]] robots experience negative counteraction of the opposing football team
*	Software virusses and other [[w:Malware|malware]]
*	Adjustment of embedded control systems by end users in order to alter performance of a device (e.g. [[w:Chip_tuning|tuning]] the electronic control unit or engine control unit ([[w:Engine_Control_Unit|ECU]]) of a car can devastate its exhaust emissions performance)
*	Communication signals ([[w:Gps|GPS]], [[w:Cell_phone|cell phone]]) are not picked up inside tunnels or elevators ([[w:Faraday_cage|Faraday’s cage]])
*	Improper use by end user (unintentional generation of [[w:Buffer_overflow|overflow]])
*	[[w:Power_blackout|Power blackout]]
*	Mechanical shock

In the following discussion we will take a closer look to some of the topics of the list above. 

==Consequences of a hostile environment==
Possible consequences of an improperly functioning system are
* System damage
* Substantial economical costs because of production standstill
* Life threats to the users of the particular system

==Electromagnetic compatibility==
[[w:Electromagnetic_compatibility|EMC]] is broadly discussed on Wikipedia. Here we make a brief summary of the phenomenon in order to get as soon as possible to the design countermeasures. 
The proper functionality of an electrical device might be influenced by unwanted generation, propagation or reception of [[w:Electromagnetic_radiation|electromagnetic radiation]]. Electromagnetic radiation can thus form a hostile environment. In order not to get influenced by electromagnetic radiation a device needs to be electromagnetically compatible with its environment. EMC can be divided in two phenomena: emission and immunity. This subdivision means that a device shouldn’t emit to much radiation but on the other hand should be immune to the radiation emitted by others. It is a design requirement for embedded control systems to overcome these two phenomena. In the European Union it is advised by EU directive 2004/108/CE to check a device for EMC before placing a [[w:CE_mark|CE-label]].

===Sources of electromagnetic waves===
*	FM-radio’s
*	[[w:Wifi|Wifi]]
*	[[w:Electronic_article_surveillance|Anti-shoplifting devices]] 
*	Electronic hardware: Inductive coupling between lines on a printed circuit board that are separated by less than a wavelength of their transmitted signals. 
*	Lightning strikes can induce electromagnetic waves in telecommunication lines.
*	Interference of the [[w:Power_grid|power grid]] (50 Hz or 60 Hz)
*	[[w:Fluorescent_lighting|Fluorescent lighting]] (100 Hz or 120 Hz)
*	[[w:Solar_flares|Solar flares]]

===Hazards===
*	Electromagnetic radiation originated at the sun’s surface can reach earth’s atmosphere and interfere with terrestrial communication. Professor Paul Kintner Jr. en Alessandro Cerruti (Cornell University [http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Sept06/solar.flares.gps.TO.html]) discovered that GPS signals were interrupted for several minutes on the dayside of the earth due to solar flares. There is only a minor inconvenience for automotive navigation, but it can be dangerous for aerospace navigation and stabilization of oil rigs. Aerospace industries have built in redundancy by using gyroscopes as a backup. In fact the gyro’s date from the pre GPS era. Also the more expensive automotive navigation systems can be equipped with gyro’s as a backup in tunnels where the signal is low. In future designs of aerospace embedded control systems the designer should concern about these solar flares as they are expected to cut the GPS signal for several hours in the years 2011-2012. 
*	Medical applications exposed to electromagnetic waves can pose life threat, e.g. cardiac pacemakers.
*	Photodiodes experience a 100 Hz noise component (2 times net frequency) of fluorescent lighting tubes. Possibly causing faulty decision taking in an infra red communication device.
*	Data loss if a communication cable is influenced by a nearby power line (50 Hz or 60 Hz)

===Solutions===
As explained before, EMC problems manifest at two domains: i.e. emission and immunity. It is self-explanatory that countermeasures can be made at both domains. Furthermore, a countermeasure to emission is often as effective as to the immunity of the device and the other way around. 

====Emission solutions====
*	Avoid unnecessary operations. Necessary switching should be done as slowly as technically possible. 
*	Noisy circuits (with a lot of switching activity) should be physically separated from the rest of the design.
*	Use harmonic wave filters.

====Immunity solutions====
*	Fuses, trip switches and circuit breakers.
*	Transient absorbers.

====Mutual solutions====
*	[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Hardware_peripherals#Tips_and_tricks|Decoupling capacitors]] ( 1 to 100 µF) (small localized energy reservoir; these supply the circuit with current during transient, high current demand periods, preventing the voltage on the power supply rail from being pulled down by the momentary current load) (Line filter, Signal filter) 
*	[[w:Choke_%28electronics%29|RF chokes]]: Choke coils are inductances that isolate alternating current from certain areas of a radio circuit.
*	[[w:RC_circuit|RC elements]]: RC-low-pass-filters can filter AC.
*	[[w:Electromagnetic_shielding|Shield]] Housings and lines: always exist out of conducting material. Although not all conducting materials are metals, shield housings mostly are made out of metal. Electromagnetic shields act as [[w:Faraday_cage|Faraday’s cages]]. Faraday’s cages shield electromagnetic radiation from the inside to the outside en the other way around, thus providing mutual protection. The mesh size of the cage should be smaller than the wavelengths to be blocked. Applications of [[w:Faraday_cage|Faraday’s cages]] are 
**	A microwave oven is equipped with a grid in front of the window. The mesh size of this grid is smaller than the wavelength of typical microwaves (1mm – 1m). However, visible light (400-700nm) can still pass trough in order to offer the user a clear view of the food being processed.
**	Plastic housings don’t act as a Faraday’s cage, but are aesthetically more suitable for consumer products than metal housings. Both aesthetics and EMC can be combined by coating a plastic housing with a metallic spray on the inside. Make sure that antenna’s have a proper access to the outside world of this housing.
**	Shoplifters often wrap the RFID chip in aluminium foil. That forms a Faraday’s cage as well, preventing the alarm from being triggered. 
**	US passports are equipped with an RFID chip that can be read remotely at airport customs. However, to protect the owner's privacy, this passport shouldn’t be read at any time. That’s why these passports are provided in a shielding sleeve, acting as a Faraday’s cage.
*	Avoid antenna structures in PCB Design, such as loops of circulating current or unbalanced transmission lines.
*	Keep in mind that radio communication (GPS, etc.) can be interrupted by nature (solar flares) or by humans (military enemies, terrorists). Therefore in systems of vital importance, (e.g. airplanes, military vehicles) one should build in some redundancy. In the specific case of GPS navigation gyroscopes are often used to overcome dead signal periods. 
*	Raise the transmitting power of the signal source. Note that this can be constrained by health regulations.
*	Implement weak signal-tracking algorithms in the receivers, so that they can detect a signal in worse circumstances such as solar winds. Mind that this measure can contradict other parameters, e.g. the economical cost, weight, power consumption, etc. of the receiver.

==Power blackout==
A [[w:Power_blackout|power interruption]] can take from several milliseconds to several hours or even days. Long blackouts can be overcome by installation of an uninterruptible power supply ([[w:Uninterruptible_power_supply|UPS]]). Al sorts and sizes of UPS’s are available. For small electronic devices a battery will do the job, for large plants, hospitals and systems of systems (telecommunication networks) diesel generators are commonly used. Selection and control of UPS’s is a discipline in itself and is widely available on the web and in literature. 

==Voltage Dips==
When the supply voltage only reduces for a couple of milliseconds, it is referred to as a voltage dip or a [[w:Power_blackout|dropout]]. These short interruptions are far more frequent than long time blackouts. According to [Schneider, p. 51-58] interruptions of 10ms are likely to occur every 200h in contrast to long time interruptions that occur around once every 10,000h. Voltage dips could lead to production halts that last much longer than the dip itself. According to [Terörde, p. 282] voltage dips of 100ms duration can lead to production halts of 24 hours.

===Hazards===
Drives of electric AC motors are very sensitive to voltage dips. The AC engine itself can perfectly cope with a transient in the supply. There is DC bus between de AC supply and the AC motor which contains a large capacitor to flatten the DC. When a voltage dip occurs at the supply side, the energy in this capacitor is consumed by the motor within a few milliseconds. The control loops of the engine drive draw their power from this DC bus. As soon as this DC bus goes under a predetermined voltage, the inverter shuts down in order to avoid possible damage. With an offline controller, the motor and production process remain uncontrolled, which can cause economical damage. 

===Solutions===
*	One might enlarge the capacitor in the DC link. But this capacitor is already a major cost item. Enlarging it would make the drive even more expensive. Furthermore one might wonder if there exists any capacitor that can feed the hunger of multi-kW electromotors.
*	Ride-through scheme or kinetic buffering: The most interesting way of overcoming a voltage dip is to recover mechanical energy stored in the rotating masses of the motor and its load. In case of a voltage dip, the motor will be used in generator mode and will generate a minor amount of electrical power to maintain the DC bus and to keep the control logic alive. Actually this comes down to [[w:Regenerative_breaking|regenerative breaking]]. In essence there’s a dip detection mechanism that activates a preprogrammed ride-through scheme. This reverses the power flow in a matter of milliseconds. Of course the motor will slow down as this is regenerative breaking. The amount of kinetic energy in the motor is exhaustive, but should suffice for the duration of the voltage dip. When the power failure persists the motor will lose all its mechanical energy and won’t be able to restart. Eventually the control logic will shut down. But at least the process could be halted in a controlled way, without major damage. This concept is innovative and not yet common practice in the industries, but it could be in the future. Extensive explanations can be found in [Terörde p. 283].

I edited two mistakes. One, han was not written out in in the trascipt (hiragana) section. And two, &quot;yo&quot; was written in the transcription, but not the original dialouge. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:61.7.11.141|61.7.11.141]] ([[User talk:61.7.11.141|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/61.7.11.141|contribs]])  19:26, 30 September 2005  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

== Incorrect information about use of 何（なに・なん） ==

In this lesson, there is an information about &quot;nan&quot; and &quot;nani&quot; work same as &quot;what is&quot; and &quot;what's&quot;. It's not true. The use of &quot;nan&quot; or &quot;nani&quot; depends on the next sound. If the next sound is a consonnant, 何 is said &quot;nan&quot;. if the sound is a vowel, 何 is said as &quot;nani&quot;.
This is a simple explanation, as there are exceptions and maybe other things. Someone with better knowledge than me should correct the article. --[[User:Luis Sergio Moura|Luis Sergio Moura]] ([[User talk:Luis Sergio Moura|talk]]) 14:36, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

== X till Y ==

06:45 would be 七時十五分前, if I'm not mistaken. Adding how to state X till Y would be a nice addition here.</text>

== Lab 1: Investigating passive resistive circuits by Microlab system ==


== [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|Lab 2]]: The genuine Ohm's experiment ==

''Tuesday, March 18, 2008, 10.30 h''

'''History.''' What did Ohm carry out in 1826? Do you know? ''Students: No...'' Please, let's someone write in the Google's window &quot;Ohm's experiment&quot; or &quot;Ohm's law&quot; to see what is written about the topic. Thank you ......... (insert your name here and make comments to obtain credits); please, make a folder in &quot;Favorites&quot; named &quot;Ohm's law&quot; and put there the most remarkable links.

Let's first consider his genuine experiment and then reproduce it here, in this laboratory, almost three centuries later. This is the first of all the ten exercises of this cycle; so, let's try to reproduce it in the most original form. So, what do we need to carry out it? ''Silence...''

'''Building the laboratory setup.''' As far as I know, Ohm has discovered the local voltages along a copper wire that was supplied by a strong voltage source. So, we need a '''wire''', a '''power supply''', a '''voltmeter''' and an '''ammeter'''. But what kind of wire we need? Bare or insulated? Copper, silver, iron, or other? ''Student: Silver will work excellent... '' We haven't a silver wire, let's try with a copper one:) ''Oh, it has welded!?!'' It is so well that the power supply has a current limitiing circuit (2.5 A)! That is why Ohm made a strong voltage source by applying the just invented by Seebek thermoelectric effect! Now, it is clear we need a resistive wire (nitinol, NiChrome, etc.); so, let's unwind a piece of wire (about 50 cm) from a heater. ...... (insert your name here), please, meausure its resistance. ''The resistance is 10 Ω, so we have 0.2Ω/cm.''

'''Experiment 1.''' Now, fix the two ends of the wire in porcelain insulated terminals (holders) and apply a voltage (for instance, 10 V) first to the left end of the wire. What can we investigate now in this arrangement? What do we measure with the voltmeter? The usual viewpoint is to think of a resistor as a point, as a something that has not dimensions, as a two-terminal element that has only a property of resistance. But here we have the unique chance to peep inside the &quot;resistor&quot;! What will you &quot;see&quot; along the wire? What will the voltmeter show when we slide it from right to left? What are the local voltages along a resistor, if there is no current? ''Student 1: Zero... Student 2: 10 V...'' What is the voltage at the right? ''Zero...'' And what is it at the middle? ''Zero...''

[[Image:Ohm's_law_crocodile_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;&quot;Walking&quot; along the resistive wire by a crocodile clip as a slider.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Well, let's try. Just touch the wire by the voltmeter probe and move it along the wire to measure all the voltage drops (for now, regarding to the ground)! If you are tired, stick a crocodile clips on the probe, &quot;bite&quot; the wire and move this &quot;slider&quot; along it! The result: everywhere local voltages are 10 V!

'''Experiment 2.''' Now, ground the right end of the wire. Oh! The wire is hot! Have I instructed you about all the dangers in the laboratory:)? Include this one: do not touch a hot wire! See the ammeter - it shows 1 A; so, the power is P = V.I = V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/R = I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.R = 10 W. By the way, are these calculations right (has the resistance a constant value)? We see, it is too hard for this thin wire to dissipate the power to the ehviroment and it is heating.

Now, move again the &quot;crocodile slider&quot; along the wire and measure the local voltage drops. As far as I know, Ohm did exactly the same. He moved the probe from one position to other, measured the corresponding potentials, made the difference between them and calculated the ratio (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/(L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/(r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = dV/dR = I. Thus he has established that this ratio (it was the current I) is constant along the wire; so, Ohm has concluded that V/R = I.

We can see that moving the &quot;crocodile slider&quot; the voltage drops decrease gradually from 10 to 0 volts. What is the input and what is the output quantity here? Eureka!  Using the &quot;slider&quot; movement as an input and measuring the voltage drop as an output we have &quot;invented&quot; the legendary (but misnamed) potentiometer,  movement-to-voltage converter, sensor... Is it a linear converter? Why? A hint: the resistance is distributed linearly along the wire.

'''Experiment 3.''' But why do not we change the role of the quantites? With the same success we can stop the &quot;crocodile slider&quot; at the middle of the wire and then to vary the input voltage as an input and, as before, to measure the voltage drop (regarding to the ground) as an output. Eureka (again)! Now we have &quot;invented&quot; the legendary voltage divider (voltage-to-voltage converter)! What is the relation between the input and output voltage (the so-called &quot;transfer ratio&quot;? We can see directly that V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;.L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/(L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). 

[[Image:Ohm's_law_flying.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Supplying an LED by a voltage drop across a part of wire.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Experiment 4.''' We are ready to do more sophisticated experiments... Are there more interesting points (different from the ubiquitous ground) to fix the negative voltage probe? Of course, we may touch any wire point! Well, let's begin with the middle point: &quot;bite&quot; it with the black (negative) negative &quot;aligator&quot; and slide the red (positive) &quot;aligator&quot; along the wire. Only, first change the unipolar voltmeter with a bipolar one. Why? What might we expect? The result is more than surprising: the output voltage varies from -5 V to +5 V! Eureka! We have obtained a bipolar movement-to-voltage sensor!

'''Experiment 5.''' What happens, if we move simultaneously both the voltmeter probes in the same direction? ''Students: The voltage will not change...'' Right! They name this &quot;common mode input signal&quot;.

'''Experiment 6.''' And what happens, if we move simultaneously both the voltmeter probes in opposite direction? ''Students: The voltage will change...'' Right! It will even change more rapidly than above. They name this &quot;differential input signal&quot;.

'''Experiment 7.''' Now stop both the &quot;sliders&quot; and wiggle the input voltage. This is a quite odd voltage divider with flying output. What is the relation between the input and output voltage (the transfer ratio? We can see directly that V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;.(L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/L. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

We can measure the voltage drops along the resistive wire by using more unusual indicators, e.g. electric bulbs. What do you think, is there any problem to supply a bulb in this exotic way? If yes, when and why?

[[Image:Ohm's_law_bulb_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Measuring the voltage drop across a part of resistive wire by a bulb...&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Ohm's_law_probe_bulb_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Measuring the voltage drop across a resistive wire by a probe bulb...&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Applications.''' Where may we see this phenomenon in life? The answer is simple: everywhere where a current flow through bad conductors. In all these cases, a gradually decreasing voltage drop appears across the &quot;conductor&quot;.  A &quot;car example&quot;: if you move the probe lamp along the heater of the rear window, you will see the voltage drop across the resistive wire.

=== What is op-amp? ===

[[Image:Op-amp_notion_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;How to drive and supply an op-amp.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Inputs.''' Grounded voltage source... What is ''single-ended input''? Floating voltage source... What is ''differential input''? Why do we need a differential input? Input resistance... Do input currents flow? How does a non-inverting input behave? How does an inverting input behave?

'''Output.''' How the op-amp output is made? What is the idea of a complementary, push-pull emitter follower? Output resistance...

'''Supplying.''' The idea of bipolar (split) supply (+12 V and -12 V here)... Why do we need a bipolar supply? Where currents flow?

'''Gain.''' Typical value is A &gt; 200000. It seems too high. What is the maximum input voltage to keep the op-amp in the active region (assume 10 V maximum output voltage)? Can we use a bare op-amp as an amplifier? Or we can use it as another useful device having analog inputs and descrete output (write its name here)? We may conclude: If we use the op-amp as an amplifier, the voltage difference between its inputs is zero. But if we use it as a ''comparator'', the input voltage might be whatever.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

'''Transfer characteristic.''' Microlab can help us to obtain this curve on the screen. There is no time in this graphical presentation; there is only input and output quantities. We might discern three regions on this curve: negative saturation (large), active region (narrow) and positive saturation (large).

[[Image:Non-inverting_comparator_screen_65a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A transfer characteristic on the screen.&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Op-amp_transfer_char_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The op-amp transfer characteristic is extremely precipitous.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

We are students from [http://www.tu-sofia.bg/fksu/fksu1.htm Faculty of Computer Systems], [http://www.tu-sofia.bg/index.html Technical University of Sofia]. Our 66 group is divided into two sub-groups; we constitute the first - 66a. Here are our names:

== Lab 1: Investigating passive resistive circuits by ''Microlab'' system ==


== [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|Lab 2]]: Improving the genuine Ohm's experiment ==

''Tuesday, March 18, 2008, 13.45 h''

=== Using the heritage of group 65a ===

Welcome to the laboratory. The picture on the whiteboard represents the laboratory setup that your colleagues from group [[#Group 65a (Tuesday, March 18, 2008, 10.30 h)|65a]] have used for reproducing the genuine Ohm's experiment. You can use the results of their laboratory experiment to introduce the next great idea named ''voltage diagram''. It will help us to visualize the voltages that your colleagues have measured along the resistive film.

=== Introducing the idea of pressure diagram (an opened water circuit) ===

[[Image:Pressure_diagram_1_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;The local pressures along the tapped pipe are equal to the input pressure.&lt;/center&gt;]]

By the way, we can derive this idea from the well-known hydraulic analogy (plumbing) that we can see everywhere around us. For example, imagine a large vessel filled of water that supplies a long thin pipe; let's first the pipe to be tapped. The question is: &quot;What is the pressure inside the pipe?&quot; And more precisely speaking, &quot;What are the local pressures along the pipe?&quot;

We can get to know, if we drill small holes at equal intervals along the pipe (if we want to be more precise, we might stick vertically thin glass pipes acting as local manometers). The result is expectable for us: all the water levels (accordingly, all the local pressures along the pipe) are equal. This picture shows the pressure distribution along the pipe; we can name it &quot;pressure diagram&quot;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== The pressure diagram of a closed water circuit ===

[[Image:Pressure_diagram_2_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;The local pressures along the opened pipe decrease gradually (incomplete...)&lt;/center&gt;]]

Now open the pipe; the water will begin flowing. What are the local pressures along the pipe now? At the left end the pressure is maximum; at the right end it is minimum. Our intuition suggests that the local pressures will decrease gradually from left to the right.

Really, the levels of the water bars (accordingly, the local pressures along the pipe) decrease gradually from left to the right. The envelope of the pressure diagram is a triangle.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Conveying the idea of pressure diagram to voltage one ===

Let's now apply this powerful idea to draw the analogous electrical voltage diagrams. The idea is obvious: if we think of voltage as a kind of pressure, we may present the local voltages by local voltage bars in exactly the same way as we have presented the local pressures along a pipe by a local water bars! As above, the lengths of the voltage bars are proportional to the magnitudes of the local voltages regarding to ground (we might set the zero voltage level at the height of the resistor and then to draw the positive voltage bars above and the negative voltage bars below the resistor's level). The set of these voltage bars forms the whole voltage diagram. We can  use the envelope of the voltage diagram instead the very set of voltage bars, in order to simplify the image.

[[Image:Voltage_diagram_open_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The local voltages along the resistive film of an opened circuit are the same.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Voltage_diagram_l-to-v_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The local voltages along the resistive film of a closed circuit decrease gradually.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Making a computer draw a &quot;living&quot; voltage diagram on the screen ===

'''Basic idea.''' But it is too hard and boring for us, human beings, to draw all the voltage diagrams when the circuit attributes (voltages and resistances) vary. Because these diagrams have to be not static, dead pictures; they have to be &quot;living&quot; diagrams (animations) that change accordingly to the circuit state. So, wee need a computer that &quot;watches&quot; closely what we do with the circuit under test and builds the according &quot;living&quot; voltage diagram on the screen. Then, let's build such a computer-based system and leave it to do this donkey work:). Then we will only look at the picture on the screen and think about the circuit phenomena behind it!

'''Components.'''  First at all, we need some computer. It may be humble enough, if only it has some graphical possibilities (for example, the computer that is used in this laboratory to build ''Microlab'' system in 1986 is a version of the famous [[w:Apple II series|Apple II]]). Then we have only to connect to the PC buses a few analog-to-digital converters (ADC's) acting as analog inputs and a few analog-to-digital converters (ADC's) acting as analog inputs and our computer-based system ''Microlab'' is ready!

[[Image:Microlab_setup_1000.jpg|left|thumb|785px|&lt;center&gt;How we can carry out a computer-based Ohm's experiment by using Microlab system.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Power supply.''' Note that the analog-digital periphery &quot;sucks&quot; energy directly from the poor computer:); so, it acts not only as a computer but it supplies the periphery too. Then can we supply the very resistive object as well? Can we use the very DAC's to supply the resistor under test? This will allow the computer to control the obect! Only, the DAC's can give maximum 10 mA by their op-amp outputs. So, we can't supply the low-resistive (10 Ω) wire of group 65a!

[[Image:Microlab1.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A computer-based system &quot;Microlab&quot;&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Ohm's_law_microlab_480.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Visualizing the voltage diagram on the screen&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot;/&gt;

'''Resistor.''' Do you remember the linear 4.7 kΩ varying resistor from the previous laboratory exercise? As far as I can remember, we carried out a &quot;reverse engineering&quot; then taking it to pieces:) What do we do now? Suggest a solution! '' A student: Yes, I do...'' Obviously the colleague suggests to supply such a resistor by the DAC's 10 mA outputs without any problem (calculate the maximum current). Thus we can use it instead the low-resistive wire. Then we supplied only the one of the resistor's terminals. Now, let's complicate the arrangement and make it more confusing:) by supplying both the ends (we suspect it might be very interesting). Well, connect AO1 (DAC1) to the right and AO2 (DAC2) to the left end of the resistor.

[[Image:Real grounds 1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Any point inside a compound voltage source can act as a real ground]]&lt;/center&gt;

'''Voltmeters.''' What do you think, wheather to connect the two old-fashioned but attractive bipolar voltmeters V1 and V2 to observe the input voltages? Or to rely only on the abstract digit VOM's and on the screen digit meausements? I see, you like the good old meters maybe because they are something &quot;live&quot;, moving, geometrical, spatial, real... People trust such genuine things... But is there any problem as these &quot;antiques&quot; have 20 kΩ internal resistance)?

'''Ground.''' Now, let's say also some words about ground. But what is ground? We can find a possible answer in the [[w:Virtual ground#Virtual ground serving as a power ground|Wikipedia article about virtual ground]]. Shortly, ground is a reference point, regarding to which we measure voltages. The PC power supply that we use is the so called &quot;split supply&quot;. It consists of two 12 V supplies connected in series (- + &gt;&gt;&gt; - +). The middle point serves as ground in this arrangement. The DAC's grounds are connected internally to this ground. We have also to connect the black test ends of our voltmeters to this ground.

'''Software.''' More than twenty years ago, I prepared a program that can visualize the voltage diagram on the screen as a &quot;living&quot; animation. For this purpose, the program make computer &quot;interest&quot; in the local voltages in three key points - the left end point, the slider intermideate point and the right end point. Let's then satisfy its curiosity:) by connecting, for a start, the DAC1's output to the ADC1's input and the DAC2's output to the ADC2's input.

[[Image:Op-amp_notion_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;How to drive and supply an op-amp.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Inputs.''' Grounded voltage source... What is ''single-ended input''? Floating voltage source... What is ''differential input''? Why do we need a differential input? Input resistance... Do input currents flow? How does a non-inverting input behave? How does an inverting input behave? Can we use an op-amp with a differential input as an op-amp with single-ended (inverting or non-inverting) input? What do we do in these cases?

'''Output.''' How the op-amp output is made? What is the idea of a complementary, push-pull emitter follower? Output resistance...

'''Supplying.''' The idea of bipolar (split) supply (+12 V and -12 V here)... Why do we need a bipolar supply? Where currents flow? We can imagine the output part of the op-amp consists of two parts - a positive and a negative. Each of them works when its output voltage has the according polarity. By the way, is it possible to supply the op-amp with only one (e.g., positive) voltage and, at the same time, to obtain the opposite (negative) output voltage? And can the op-amp output voltage exceed the supply voltage? Maybe, it would be possible, if there were capacitive or inductive differentiating circuits inside the op-amp... But (for now) an op-amp contains only resistive and active components:(

[[Image:Op-amp_transfer_char_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The op-amp transfer characteristic is extremely precipitous.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Gain.''' Typical value is A &gt; 200000. It seems too high. Can we manage to utilize all this gain? What is the maximum input voltage to keep the op-amp in the active region (assume 10 V maximum output voltage)? Can we use a bare op-amp as an amplifier? Or we can use it as another useful device having analog inputs and descrete output (write its name here)? We may conclude: If we use the op-amp as an amplifier, the voltage difference between its inputs is zero. But if we use it as a ''comparator'', the input voltage might be whatever.

'''Transfer characteristic.''' Microlab can help us to obtain this curve on the screen. There is no time in this graphical presentation; there is only input and output quantities. We might discern three regions on this curve: negative saturation (large), active region (narrow) and positive saturation (large).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

'''Generalization.''' What does the op-amp actually do? A possible answer is: ''an op-amp converts the steady power supply into varying voltage source; it acts as a voltage-controlled voltage source.''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building a general negative feedback follower ===

==== Analogies ====

[[Image:Negative_feedback_follower_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A negative feedback follower consists of only three components.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Driving:''' keeping up a constant speed, direction, temperature, volume...
More negative feedback analogies: studying, teaching, keeping up a room temperature (body weight, mental equilibrium...) In all these cases we do all that is possible to realize our goals, to move toward the goal...

==== Structure (block diagram) ====

So, the simplest negative feedback follower consists of only three components: power (energy) source E, regulating element R and a subtractor (-).


==== Operation ====

This humble device operates according to a simple algorithm: if X &gt; Y, then increase Y; if X &lt; Y, decrease Y; if X = Y, do nothing. As a result, always X = Y. So, this is an &quot;active copying&quot; principle and this device is an &quot;active follower&quot;. This &quot;algorithm&quot; is so simple that humble devices (tubes, transistors, op-amps...) having no any intelect can perform it.

==== Advantages ====

Why do we make followers in this odd way? What are the advantages of this &quot;negative feedback&quot; approach?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building an op-amp follower ===

==== Passive electric follower ====

[[Image:Passive_electric_follower_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A humble wire is the simplest but imperfect voltage &quot;follower&quot;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Now, we have only to convey this powerful idea from real life to electronics. Well, let's begin.

V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; will represent X in our electric follower; accordingly, V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; will represent Y. But let's first persuade ourselves what is the use of building such an active follower instead a &quot;passive&quot; one.

What is the simplest voltage follower? Of course, a piece of wire can act as a humle voltage follower. It works perfectly, if there is no load (there is no current flowing). Only, is it still a follower, if we connect a big load at the end of the wire (especially, if it is a thin and long wire)? And imagine what happens, if the load and wire resistances vary... For example, the wire length can vary...

Another nasty problem of the passive voltage follower is that ''the load consumes energy from the input voltage source''.; so, it droops when loaded.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Op-amp negative feedback follower ====

[[Image:Op-amp_follower_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;An op-amp follower.&lt;/center&gt;]]

No, the bare wire is not a perfect follower in all the cases; so, it is worth the trouble to build an active negative feedback follower...

First, we connect a power supply - a voltage source V representing the power source E from the block diagram. We assume a bipolar input voltage; so, we get a bipolar (split) power supply. Then, we connect an op-amp OA acting as the regulating element R. Finally, we need a voltage subtractor to make the op-amp compare its output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. What is the simplest voltage [[Circuit Idea/Series Voltage Summer|subtractor]]? Of course, this is the bare loop (a piece of wire) according to Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). In other words, we have to connect the two voltage sources in series and in opposite directions (+ -, - +) traversing the loop, in order to subtract their voltages. Then, we have to cut the loop and to feed the op-amp input by the voltage difference.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Investigating the circuit by Microlab ====

[[Image:Op-amp_follower_66a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;An op-amp follower investigated by Microlab (a set up).&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Operation ====

[[Image:Students3_66a_lab4_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Where currents flow? Thinking about current loops.&lt;/center&gt;]]

We are human beings, not computers... It seems strange but, in order to understand what the abstract op-amp really does in this circuit, we have to think of the op-amp as a &quot;slow-thinking&quot; device, not as a fast, non-inertial, instant device... From this human viewpoint, the op-amp compares continuously its output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and changes V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; in the right direction so that to keep almost zero difference V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. It does exactly the same what we, human beings, were doing in all the analogies above.

Where currents flow in this circuit? Draw them with whole loops in the two cases - at a positive and a negative input voltage. Remember: ''a current always arrives at the point from where it has gone''. Another tip: ''in the two cases (at positive and negative input voltage) the load current will flow through different power supplies (accordingly, through the positive and negative voltage sources)''. Imagine also the complementary output emitter follower inside the op-amp: the upper n-p-n transistor will &quot;blows&quot; the output current when the op-amp &quot;wants&quot; to produce a positive voltage and the lower p-n-p transistor will &quot;sucks&quot; the output current when the op-amp &quot;wants&quot; to produce a negative voltage.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Disturbing the negative feedback follower ===

Let's now &quot;provoke&quot; our op-amp by various disturbancies to see how it will react:) Firstly, we may introduce and vary a line resistance. Then, we may vary the load resistance. Finally, we might vary both the resistances. If we are curious enough, we can vary the voltages of the power supply as well (the one, the other and both).

[[Image:Op-amp_follower_resistor_66a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Trying to disturb the  op-amp follower by a single resistor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Op-amp_follower_screen_66a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A single resistor cannot disturb the op-amp follower (waveforms).&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Non-inverting_amplifier_screen_65a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A disturbed op-amp follower investigated by Microlab (waveforms).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Non-inverting_amplifier_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;An op-amp follower disturbed.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

'''Output resistance.''' Can we say that we have realized one eternal dream of electricians - to build a varying perfect voltage source:)? Can we think of an op-amp follower as an (almost) ideal voltage source?

Conclusion: ''in electronics, we make ideal devices by appllying negative feedback.''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Lab 4a: How to make perfect circuits by series NFB ==

=== Is the real diode a perfect component? ===

[[Image:Real_diode_single.jpg|left|thumb|210px|&lt;center&gt;A &quot;harmful&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; across a diode.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Diodes are two-terminal semiconductor elements, characterized by allowing the current to flow in the forward direction when the voltage is positive but not in the reverse one when the voltage is negative. So diodes represent the action of a valve and so were they called in the past. However, the diode needs a little (approximately 0.5-0.7V) voltage-push in order the current to start flowing freely. The result is small but noticeable voltage drop - V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. What is this voltage drop - useful or harmful? Sometimes it is useful; other times it is harmful...

'''&quot;Useful&quot; examples.''' When we make voltage stabilizers, we need this voltage drop. In these cases we do all that is possible to create and increase this useful voltage drop appearing across various diode component: diodes, LEDs, zeners, multiple diodes connected in series...

'''&quot;Harmful&quot; examples.''' In other cases, when we use a diode as a switching element, we do all that is possible to remove and to remove this harmful voltage drop... Then we need an ideal diode without forvard voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Making the simplest series diode rectifier ===

[[Image:Series_diode_limiter_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The forward voltage drop VF across a diode disturbs the input source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

A rectifier is an electical element that converts alternating current to direct current. Rectifiers form the basis for electronic power supplies and battery-charging circuits. Furthermore, they are used in signal processing to demodulate radio signals and in the precision conversion of AC to DC voltage in electronic voltmeters. However, keeping in mind that the diode allows a current to flow in one (positive) direction but not in the other (negative), we can easily use the term &quot;rectifier&quot; to name a diode.

So let's make the diode perform as a rectifier and thus participating in a half-wave rectifier circuit (the sircuit diagram is shown on the left). We have a sinusoidal source (for the experiment it is 1V) and a resistive load.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Series_diode_waveforms_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The voltage drop VF enervates the input voltage.&lt;/center&gt;]]

When the source voltage is positive, the diode is in the so-called forward-bias region. If the diode was ideal the source voltage will appear across the load. However, the diode we have is not ideal; so it performs a voltage drop equal to the push-up voltage of the diode (approximately 0.5 - 0.7V). So during the positive wave the output voltage is less than the source voltage (for our example it will be V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3V. The result is shown in the diagram on the right.

During the negative wave of the sinusoidal voltage the diode is in its reverse-bias region and no current flows through the load. Thus only the positive half-cycles result on the load, which makes the diode suitable as a rectifier.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Making an &quot;ideal&quot; diode without V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; ===

==== Deriving the basic idea from our human routine ====

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Making an almost ideal &quot;op-amp&quot; series diode rectifier ====

[[Image:Dist_follower_diode_66a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Compensating the harmful forward voltage drop VF across a real diode by surplus voltage.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What can act as a varying voltage source in our electronic circuit? What can &quot;help&quot; the imperfect diode by adding so much voltage to the input voltage as it loses across the diode? At last ''Lab 3'' we were using transistors for such a purpose; let's now, for the sake of change, use an op-amp...

Now the op-amp has to &quot;insert&quot; the &quot;helping&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; into the circuit; so, how to connect it?

[[Image:Dist_follower_diode_microlab_884.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the &quot;ideal&quot; diode by ''Microlab''.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Eureka! We have invented an (almost) ideal diode without (any) forvard voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;! Let's investigate it by ''Microlab'' system.

Firstly, let's remind what an operational amplifier (op-amp) is: it's a device having a differential input (it may be current, voltage, mechanical motion?!?[[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 18:09, 7 May 2008 (UTC), etc.) and the output that varies according to the input but with a larger amplitude. Almost always they are used with negative feedback (the output signal is returned to the input in opposite direction to the source signal). However, they may be also used with a positive feedback (the output signal that is returned is summed with the input original signal) but much rarely. For ideal OA in a negative-feedback circuit, the network returns a fraction of the output to the inverting input and thus makes the differential input voltage toward zero.

So let's now go back to our experiment. What we are trying to do is to compensate the harmful fordward voltage drop on a real diode with a operational amplifier. But isn't the result of this try an ideal operational amplifier?!

We have a source voltage V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; and at the point named &quot;1&quot; we will have that voltage. However, if we want to compensate the voltage drop across the diode, we should use an op-amp that will have on its output a voltage equal to the source voltage plus an additional amount that is equal to this voltage drop. This will be the voltage we will have at point &quot;2&quot;. If this increased voltage is applied before the diode, the voltage after the diode will be the same as our initial source voltage and that is what we have at point &quot;3&quot;. Which is our purpose!  

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Enlarging the powerful &quot;surplus&quot; idea by overcoming... ===

== Lab 1: Investigating passive resistive circuits by ''Microlab'' ==


== [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|Lab 2]]: The genuine Ohm's experiment ==

''Tuesday, March 18, 2008, 16.45 h''

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%&quot;&gt;'''The theme of the practical lesson is: Walking along the resistive film'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The first thing we did on this practical lesson was to reproduce Ohm's experiment, because Ohm's law is the base of the electronics we study. The idea of our practical and theoretical lessons in our course of electronics is to invent everything, every single element (even the resistor). So we started imagining how Ohm did his famous experiment and found the fundamental relationship between the current, voltage and resistance. He did his experiment in the beginning of the 19th century. This means only thing he could use as a power supply was the forerunner of the electrical battery, created by Alessandro Volta. Unfortunately this experiment failed, because Ohm used a wire with very low resistance so the power source was loaded. 
For reproducing Ohm's experiment we used a resistive wire. In the lab we used a power supply (maximum current 2.5A, maximum voltage 10V), voltmeter and ammeter. So we started the experiments.

'''Experiment N1: '''
The scheme we were examining is shown on fig.4 in the main module.
We move the voltmeter in this way: one of its ends is connected with the ground and the other is walking on the resistive film by a crocodile clip as a slider. 
Apparently the measured voltage is 10V no matter where the crocodile clip is along the resistive film.

'''Experiment N2:''' 
The scheme we were examining is shown on fig.5 in the main module.
Now we have a change in the measurement of the voltmeter. We can see change is linear. 

So now is appropriate to make the hydraulic analog: the tapped pipe and the opened pipe. The illustrations are shown at the main module. 

We slide the crocodile clip along the resistive film. This is equal to using a potentiometer. The potentiometer is practically a movement-to-voltage converter. According to the fact that the resistance is distributed linearly along the wire, we can conclude that this converter is linear.
So there was a new idea: why don't we stop moving the crocodile slider, leaving it in a certain point on the resistive wire and start changing the input voltage?

'''Experiment N3:''' We have 2 voltage sources. One of them (the left one) varies and the other is constant. 
We see the results on the screen of the computer. You can see the illustration attached it the subtopic in the main module: '''V1 varies: a left-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter'''. 

&lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \frac{r2}{r1+r2}.Vin1 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Experiment N4:''' Now the right one varies and the left one is constant.
We see the results on the screen of the computer. You can see the illustration attached it the subtopic in the main module: '''V2 varies: a right-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter'''. 

&lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \frac{r1}{r1+r2}.Vin2 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Experiment N5:''' Now both of the voltage sources vary. 
We see the results on the screen of the computer. You can see the illustration attached in the subtopic in the main module: '''Both V1 and V2 vary: a resistive summer'''.

&lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \ \frac{r2}{r1+r2}.Vin1\ + \frac{r1}{r1+r2}.Vin2 &lt;/math&gt;

As we can see this is a summer with coefficients:

&lt;math&gt;\ a = \frac{r2}{r1+r2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ b = \frac{r1}{r1+r2} &lt;/math&gt;
 
Since now we have seen the results only when the input voltages are positive. Now we change the polarity.

'''We can see that there is one point we can see on the screen on the computer with zero-potential. This is the famous virtual ground. This point  moves on the horizontal axis. So there was a new question – can we make this moving point a fixed one? The answer is yes. There is one element that controls its output in according with the input voltage. This is the operational amplifier. This element keeps the virtual ground at point A. See the illustration: a passive resistive subtractor and of course the negative feedback game.'''

== [[Circuit Idea/Building an Emitter Follower|Lab 3]]: Building an emitter follower ==

''Tuesday, April 01, 2008, 16.45 h''

authors: Angel,Virginia &amp; Vladimir
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building a negative feedback follower ===

==== Looking for analogies of negative feedback phenomenon ====

'''Speaking.''' We are getting started with an explanation of the term ''negative feedback''. The first thing we ask each other is if there is a similar phenomenon in real life. Thus we have found we might consider human speech as an example: you have to listen to your voice in order to control its volume. In this way you are able to communicate with those around you appropriately. The noisier the surrounding environment is, the louder your voice becomes and vice versa. This basic idea explains roughly the essence of negative feedback.

'''Driving.''' Another example of the idea of negative feedback might also be the following situation. Imagine you are getting in your car and striving to drive with 50km/h. Let us now suppose that we have a current state X and we want to achieve another goal state Y. In order to complete this task we should monitor the process of its development and control it in a desirable way by adjusting all necessary parametres. You are in state X and you would like to achieve state Y. But what do you need?

==== Generalizing the analogies into a block diagram ====

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:X_Y_ENERGY.PNG|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;A negative feedback follower consists of power source E, a regulating element R and a subtractor (-).&lt;/center&gt;]] --&gt;


The first thing you need is ENERGY. It's necessary but not enough. You need also a visualization of your speed in order to control it. In other words you need a REGULATOR.

But what is the regulator doing? It compares the difference between the ''purpose state'' and the ''current state''; then, it does what can do to eliminate it. When this difference is equal to zero, we have an equilibrium – this shows that the goal state has been achieved.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building an electrical follower ===

The most simple regulator is the so called ''follower''. Now we have to think about how we can realize a follower.

==== Is the humble wire a follower? ====

An obvious example of electric follower is... a simple wire (?!?). This remedy is simple: if you want the potential of point B to follow the potential of point A, just connect them to each other by piece of wire. But is that wire a perfect follower? The answer is “no”. We will provide reasons why with the next example.

[[Image:IS THE WIRE A FOLLOWER1.PNG|center|thumb|700px|&lt;center&gt;The bare wire is a perfect follower only, if there is not a load connected to the end of wire.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The wire as you know has its own resistance. Let us now connect a resistor (1 ohm), our wire (1 ohm) and a voltage source(10V) like it is shown in the second picture. After measuring the output voltage we see that it has been reduced with the voltage drop caused by the wire’s internal resistance. The reason for this is clear – the current flowing in the circuit.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building an emitter follower on the whiteboard ===

So we decide to make use of another (this time more “perfect”) regulator – an emitter follower. Having already come to the idea of constant regulating and adjusting a desired value according to the changes in its environment, we proceed with a real scheme with a transistor. The transistor here acts as the regulating element of the negative feedback follower above. The essence is that it “observes” the potential in point A and changes the potential in point B (by changing its own resistance) so that to keep an almost zero difference between them. But let's  give a description of our practical laboratory exercise.

=== Putting the powerful idea into practice ===

''(How our laboratory exercise passed over)''

[[Image:Clipboard01_sources.png|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;The transistor acts as a regulating element.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Preparation.''' In order to reveal to us the &quot;secrets&quot; of ubiquitous transistor, our teacher [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Cyril Mechkov]] provided us with the opportunity to build our own test circuit and observe its behaviour. As curious students who usually enjoy taking things apart, we were desperate to &quot;invent&quot; our own emitter follower and get a preconception of the so called ''negative feedback''. We already knew some of the basic applications of the transistor having already studied digital circuitry but most of us lacked any practical experience. Having realized that, firstly prof. Mechkov briefly outlined the idea of the laboratory session and then gave us a soldering iron, a test board and all the necessary equipment to carry out the investigation of our device. The old Apple II based PC proved ideal for the experiment - it not only served as a power supply:) but together with the MicroLab system was able to &quot;watch&quot; our scheme and draw real-time voltage diagrams. Armed with this powerful &quot;weaponry&quot; we felt like real inventors!

[[Image:Clipboard02_grafika121.png|right|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;The emitter voltage follows the base one shifted by V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Investigation.''' Some of the girls were terrified when Miroslav (a colleague) switched on the scheme, but fortunately nothing exploded;) Everything was well under control. After connecting our newly constructed emitter follower to the prototyping board we started the investigation by gradually varying its power supply (ranging from -10 to 10 Volts). As you can see from the pictures in the region of the positive values the transistor's behaviour coincides with theory. The voltage drop of the emitter-base junction always &quot;strives&quot; to remain the same - exactly 0,7 Volts. In accordance with Kirchoff's laws the potential of the output emitter was just like we expected - the input voltage minus the voltage drop. By analogy, the same linear dependency was observed in the negative input range. The lab results in that case are reproduced in the picture below.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Clipboard03_next_source.png|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;The imperfect voltmeter &quot;pulls&quot; up the transistor's emitter.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Problem.''' However, quite unexpectedly we suggested double-checking the scheme by connecting an old-fashioned analogue votmeter in parallel to the digital VOM. Miroslav then attached one of the crocodile clips to the emitter and the other to the ground of the board (notice that the emitter - collector power supply is bipolar). At first, the new result on the screen seemed quite strange - in the negative region there was a section with a constant potential. Something had made the emitter base junction reverse biased. Professor Mechkov smiled being aware of the &quot;mischevous intruder&quot; in the voltage diagram but wanted us to find out the cause. We didn't hesitate for long and changed the old-fashioned voltmeter with a Chinese 3$ one.

Voila! The key to the &quot;mystery&quot; was finally discovered - the reason for switching off the transistor was the voltmeter's internal resistance. In the case of the old electromagnetic device it was about 20 kOhms. This internal resistance had become the main reason for the advent of a current flow through one of the power supplies, our load and the voltmeter. This newly appeared current kept the potential at the output unchanging when the base supply was low enough (see the picture). We realized the n-p-n transistor can only &quot;source&quot; current; it can't sink current.

[[Image:Clipboard04_grakika2.png|right|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;There is a clipping on the output curve because of backbiasing of the base-emitter junction.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Clipboard05_shema5.png|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;There is a clipping on the output curve because of backbiasing of the base-emitter junction.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Strengthening the problem.''' Having discovered this effect, we decided to replace the voltmeter with a lower resistor (100 Ohms) in order to simulate a voltage breakdown through the reverse biased base-emitter junction. In that particular case the transistor acted like a zener diode stabilizing the output voltage in certain ranges. A reproduced PC based simulation is shown on the last picture. 

[[Image:Clipboard06_poslednagrakika.png|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt;A zener voltage breakdown occurred when we went too far with backbiasing...&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Conclusions ===

'''The final conclusion from the laboratory exercise was that a simple emitter follower might not be so simple and predictable in certain situations. We gathered some really valuable experience by observing the changes in our transistor's behaviour - at first it acted as an emitter follower, then it became a zener diode finally it turned into a voltage controlled switch. The small transistor was like a skilful magician but one playing tricks with current. Electronics is really fascinating, isn't it!'''

Authors: [[User:Angel 67gr|Angel]] with the help of [[User:Vsj 67gr|Virginia]]




[[Image:Angel_67a.jpg|right|thumb|150px|&lt;center&gt;[[User:Angel 67gr|Angel]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

Do you remember our scheme from the previous exercise? We used a single transistor as an emitter follower illustrating in this way the concept of the negative feedback. We also noticed that our device was a bit more perfect compared to the most primitive voltage follower - a single piece of wire. However, when we put our obedient transistor to tests, we discovered that it felt a constant &quot;hunger&quot; - drawing power from the input and thus causing a voltage drop of 0,7 Volts. For the purpose of the laboratory experiment that was acceptable, but what would you say about implementing this scheme in real, extremely precise devices? Of course, it depends on the application, but one thing is certain - our emitter follower is not &quot;ideal&quot; simply because it disturbs the input.



If we look around ourselves in reality everything abides by these laws of nature. For example, if we have to complete a specific task, we need a proportional amount of energy. This energy is not given &quot;for free&quot;, it has been accumulated as a result of previous activities which in their own turn have come to fruition thanks to the efforts of others and so on. The same regularity is valid for electronics. Perhaps, the basic philosophical principle of each human activity and schemotechnics too, in our context, is converting and processing some kind of input energy (usually represented by an electrical quantity) into a desired output. In this way we are able to represent, process and store information in electrical circuits in various ways. However, we should always be aware of the &quot;losses&quot; in our circuitry because in order to function properly each element requires sufficient resources.



After these introductory reflections, you might ask the following question. What is an ideal scheme and could it actually exist? Some people would suppose that such schemes are virtually non-existent because they cannot be practically constructed. Others would conclude that the term ideal is a bit imaginary - ideal things are in fact our own ideas of how things should function in the best possible conditions. Still others may qualify ideal elements as fairly theoretical - as an abstraction of mathematics and science. In fact all these three different groups of people would be right to a certain extent. Absolutely ideal elements may never come to life, but don't you think that our aspiration for developing more and more efficient utilities matters even more? Isn't that desire the main driving force that pushes forward all aspects of human creativity? These were some of the questions we asked ourselves at the fourth exercise in specialized computer electonics. Such kind of discussion was necessary because we had to examine the next step in the evolution of schemotechnics - his majesty - the operational amplifier.



Professor Mechkov challenged us by further developing the topic from the previous session. His main aim was to prepare us for the introduction to this both mysterious and powerful electronic component. Having already understood the role of the negative feedback, we felt it was the right time to study the principles of the op amp schemes and their practical applications. At first, we were a bit baffled because we had already encountered the op amp in other disciplines in the form of complete circuits. The problem was that nobody had explained to us the philosophy behind these circuits. Just remembering several facts or block schemes by heart is not quite useful for future engineers like us. Professor Mechkov knew that pretty well, so in order to make us more familiar with the topic he fostered our imagination giving us a simple but yet effective description of the behavior and advantages of the operational amplifier. In short an op amp may be compared to a strong and obedient weight-lifter. Imagine you have to move some quite heavy furniture at home but unfortunately you lack the power. On top of that you have to carry out the task very carefully so as not to scratch the wooden floor. Suddenly you remember that you can call one of your friends for help - he is a professional well trained weight-lifter. In five minutes he comes and thanks to your directions finishes the job in time. You are very happy and treat him a drink for his efforts. Of course this is a very basic and broad illustration but in fact it quite well represents &quot;the abilities&quot; of the op amp. So, with this figurative idea in mind we may proceed with a formal description of the operational amplifier.  It refers to a division of high-gain DC coupled amplifiers with two inputs and a single-ended output. Some of its most significant characteristics are its extremely high gain - typically 200 000 or even a million, its very high input impedance and low output impedance, and last but not least the need for a split power supply (+/-12 Volts for example). We won't go into further details about the internal structure because this is not our goal. We will just mention that a typical op amp is built up of several resistors and transistors connected in a special way.


So, for the sake of practice we should know that an op amp is able to work with two types of input signals – either single-ended or differential ones. Similarly to the transistor an op amp actually doesn't amplify anything - what it is doing is precisely controlling its output according to the changes of the inputs boosting the output from its own power supply. The op amp needs external energy in order to do this trick. Remember that the principle we outlined at the beginning of the text always remains valid! What deserves mentioning here is that the term amplification is used not literally but has appeared perhaps as a result of the overall effect of the functioning of the op amp. The idea is again simple but genius! We use a relatively weak signal or electrical magnitude so as to command a more powerful circuit. This time, however, in contrast to the transistor, we don't draw energy directly from the input, but use an external bipolar power supply. In this way, the op amp is able to respond to the variations of the inputs and adjust qiute precisely its output.



[[Image:OPAmP_Scheme01.png|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;OP AMP as a comparator.&lt;/center&gt;]]


'''Comparator'''


Let us now look back at the exercise. Having the above mentioned ideas in mind professor Mechkov described the first and maybe most logical application of the op amp - its usage as a comparator. The scheme we discussed is shown in the next picture.


We observe that the potential of the non-inverting input is lower than that on the inverting. In this particular case we say that the input is differential. Judging by the simulation, we realized that if there was even a tiny difference between V1 and V2 the output was either driven to +VCC or -VCC depending on the magnitude of the inputs. Practically, the output voltage is determined as a multiplication of the voltage difference and the so called open-loop gain. This dependency is illustrated in the following diagram.



[[Image:OPAMP_GRAPHICS01.png|right|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;OP AMP as a comparator.&lt;/center&gt;]]


As a whole, perhaps the main disadvantage of the scheme is that its operating range is extremely narrow due to the op amp's high sensitivity. At some point the output remains the same - this means that the op amp has reached its upper or lower saturation threshold.




[[Image:OPAmP_Scheme11.png|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;OP AMP as a VOLTAGE FOLLOWER.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Voltage Follower'''


Next, thinking on how we can &quot;disturb&quot; the op amp so as to build a voltage follower, we came to the idea of the negative feedback. What we did was to take part of the output signal back to the input but with negative sign. Again the same well known principle but this time realized in an almost perfect way (or let's say the most ideal known nowadays :)). By connecting the output to the negative input and applying some potential to the positive one, we managed to &quot;invent&quot; an immaculate voltage follower. The interesting thing here was that the op amp always strive to keep the difference between the input potentials zero - this is the so called virtual ground. Of course this happens only if you have applied some kind of feedback. We also found out that the inputs drew almost no current - as a result of the op amp's extremely high input impedance.

The scheme and the simulation are the following. Notice that this kind of voltage follower has a gain equal to one.

[[Image:OPAMP_GRAPHICS11.png|right|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;OP AMP as a VOLTAGE FOLLOWER.&lt;/center&gt;]]




[[Image:OPAmP_Scheme21.png|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;OP AMP as a non-inverting amplifier.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Non-inverting Amplifier'''

After these tasks we decided to increase the gain of the negative feedback schemes. For that reason, we put a resistor in the circuit of the feedback trying to cheat our humble op amp in such a way so that it would pull up the potential of its output twice or even more. This case illustrated the so called compensatory mechanism and the respective device is called a non-inverting amplifier. Vout/Vin = 1 + R1/R2

[[Image:OPAMP_GRAPHICS21.png|right|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;OP AMP as a as a non-inverting amplifier.&lt;/center&gt;]]





[[Image:SCHMITT31.png|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Schmitt trigger.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Positive Feedback'''


Last but not of least importance was the simulation of the infamous Schmitt trigger. Until now we were discussing schemes with negative feedback, so we decided to see what would happen if we had a positive feedback. Look at the next diagram.

[[Image:SCHMITT_GRAPHICS1.png|right|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;Schmitt trigger switched on.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:SCHMITT_GRAPHICS2.png|right|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;Schmitt trigger switched off.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Let us mark the highest voltage the operational amplifier can produce ±Vmax.  
The negative input is connected to the ground and bearing in mind that the op amp keeps the potential difference between its inputs equal to zero, we can conclude the potential in point A is zero or Va=0V. 


I1 = ±(Vin – Va) /R1 = ±Vin/R1 

(depends on the polarity of the input voltage)


I2 =± (Vout – Va)/R2= ±Vout/R2  

(depends on the polarity of the output voltage)


Let us now assume that this scheme is currently in its higher state +Vmax.

Therefore I2=Vmax/R2. As we already mentioned the op amp's most simple role is to function as a comparator, so if we take the input voltage with positive polarity - therefore I1 = Vin/R1. Again knowing that the op amp inputs draw almost no current we can say the I1=-I2. Then Vmax/R2=- I1 = Vin/R1 &lt;=&gt; Vin= -Vmax.R1/R2  - so Vin should drop below −(R1/R2)Vmax to get the output switched. Once the comparator output has switched to −VS, the threshold becomes +(R1/R2)VS to switch back to the higher state. After these preliminary notes we can observe from the simulation that this is a circuit with hysteresis.

What is the good thing about that hysteresis and why is the op amp called a trigger? The device is called a trigger because it keeps its output unchanged until the input changes are sufficient to trigger a change. That's why we say that op amps with positive feedback have &quot;memory&quot;.


Now let's pay attention on the hysteresis: its main advantage is that it has two limiting thresholds.
If we have a device with one threshold and a noisy input signal, the device may change its output in very unwanted ways - of course these changes might be very fast. In contrast, if we have a Schmitt trigger the scheme will be much more reliable and resistant to any input deviations because of its &quot;improved&quot; characteristics.


'''Final Words'''

After all, operational amplifiers are not so dreadful as their name suggests, are they! In fact these little &quot;smarties&quot; are so versatile and powerful that there are widely used in many areas of practical electronics. Thanks to professor Mechkov we have managed to find our way through the &quot;jungle&quot; of op amps and represent our &quot;discoveries&quot; on this page. We hope that our brief description has helped you gain a better understanding of the topic. If you have any ideas or suggestions we would be happy if you - our readers, take part in the discussion!


:[[User:Angel 67gr|Angel]] and [[User:Vsj 67gr|Virginia]], your essay was so exciting that, believe me, it moved me to cry! If only a few students of every group were as you, I will be no end happy!

== [[Talk:Circuit Idea/How to Make a Perfect Op-amp RC-integrator|Lab 5A]]: Building the op-amp inverting integrator (student's version:) ==
During our laboratory course we have already carried out experiments with passive &quot;mischevous&quot; elements(resistors for example) and active ones (transistors and op amps) being able to command their output according to the variations of the input signals. Having understood the role of each of these groups we may be able to &quot;harness&quot; their potential to a maximum extent only if we examine their behaviour in more complex time-dependent schemes. Why time-dependent? - you might ask? The answer is simply because the representation of time as a variable is what we need in combination with the input and output values in order to simulate or examine all kinds of real-life phenomena. Thus, &quot;playing&quot; around with our electric building blocks we will be able to construct an endless number of various useful circuits.  During the fifth exercise we developed the above-mentioned conception of time-sensitive schemes by constructing an inverting op-amp integrator. The &quot;main characters&quot; in that session were the op-amp from the previuos lab and a new &quot;actor&quot; - a capacitor - acting as a current driven voltage integrator. The role of a typical integrator as its name suggests is to function as an accumulator of a particular value. In this way depending on the physical essence of accumulation, we may be able to measure time intervals or even more precisey work with time in general. A single passive voltage integrator as the one shown below in professor Mechkov's description is imperfect mainly because of the non-linear voltage drop across the capacitor which disturbs the input source. In fact, this is the typical &quot;disadvantage&quot; of all kinds of passive schemes - their behaviour influences the input. However, according to the application this effect may be either useful or unwanted. What is more important here is grasping the idea and trying to perfect its practical realization. Following the principles from the previous two laboratory exercises, we came to the idea of connecting a single capacitor in the series of the negative feedback. This time the op-amp was &quot;deluded&quot; in an unconevtional way - the change in the negative input was exponential in itself but thanks to the op-amp's extremely high gain - the output changed in a linear way(not infinitely of course). Observing this effect, we concluded that it would be quite easy for us to construct a universal measuring device, allowing us to explore and even improve the behaviour of all kinds of electronic components - diodes, resistors, etc. All we need is a suitable power supply, an op-amp and a little imagination. Pure mathematical formulae or boring readily-built schemes cannot do the trick ;)

== Lab 5B: &quot;Inventing&quot; the op-amp inverting integrator (a teacher's version:) ==

=== Current-to-voltage C integrator ===

[[Image:Integrator_step1_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;A humble capacitor can act as an ideal current-to-voltage integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What is the most elementary electrical integrator? Of course, this is the humble capacitor. So, if we drive a capacitor C by a constant current source I, it acts as an ideal current-to-voltage integrator with a current input I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and a voltage output V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that the output voltage changes linearly through the time.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Voltage-to-voltage RC integrator ===

[[Image:Integrator_step2_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;V-to-I converter + I-to-V integrator = V-to-V integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Only, we need usually an integrator with voltage input and voltage output (voltage-to-voltage integrator). For this purpose, we can build a compound voltage integrator just connecting a voltage-to-current converter (a resistor) before the integrator:

''V-to-I converter + I-to-V integrator = V-to-V integrator''


Only, a problem arises here - the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; across the capacitor C &quot;enervates&quot; the input voltage thus decreasing the input current. As a result, the output voltage changes exponentially through the time.

=== Active RC integrator ===

[[Image:Integrator_step3_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;A remedy: connect an additional &quot;helping&quot; voltage source that adds as much voltage to the input voltage as it loses across the capacitor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Remember what we do in real life when an obstacle stands in our way - we remove it by an equivalent useful &quot;antidisturbance&quot;. Following this recipe, we may remove the &quot;harmful&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; by an &quot;antivoltage&quot; -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. That means to connect an additional varying voltage source and to make its voltge equal to -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the &quot;harmful&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; disappears and the upper point becomes a virtual ground! The compound current source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;-R is &quot;fooled&quot;: it doesn't &quot;understand&quot; that there is a capacitor connected; it &quot;thinks&quot; that its output is shorted.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Integrator_step3a_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Only, where to take an output from?&lt;/center&gt;]]

But where to take an output from? We have three possibilities.

First, we might use the old output; but we have already destroyed this voltage!

Second, we may use the &quot;original&quot; voltage as an output. It is possible but bad solution to connect the load across the capacitor for two reasons: the load has to have a differential output; the load will shunt the capacitor thus affecting the current.

Finally, we can use the &quot;copy&quot; voltage as an output! What a great idea! First, the load will be connected to the common ground; second, it will consume energy from the supplementary source instead from the input one!

[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/build_integrator.html Building an op-amp inverting integrator] - go to step 3

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Op-amp inverting RC integrator ===

Finally, we have only to replace the varying voltage source with a real one. Now the op-amp doses the voltage of the power supply thus producing a compensating voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, the combination of an op-amp and a steady battery acts as a varying voltage source.

[[Image:Integrator_step4_whiteboard_1000.jpg|center|thumb|780px|&lt;center&gt;In the circuit of an op-amp inverting integrator the op-amp adds compensating voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; to the input voltage source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The op-amp &quot;observes&quot; the potential of the virtual ground (the difference between the two voltages) and changes instantly its output voltage so that this point to stay always at zero volts. Doing that, the op-amp compensates the &quot;harmful&quot; voltage drop across the capacitor by copying and adding it to the voltage of the input source; doing that, the op-amp &quot;helps&quot; the input source.

[[Image:Ideal_capacitor_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;The &quot;imperfect&quot; capacitor has become an ideal infinite one.&lt;/center&gt;]]

It's time to make conclusions. What have we actually done here? How does it operate? What is the final result?

The answer is amazing: we have made a &quot;botomless&quot; capacitor having infinite capacitance. Looking from the side of the input source this &quot;ideal&quot; capacitor acts just... as a piece of wire...?!? What do you think about this speculation? Is it always right?

We are already true magicians as we can transform any imperfect component into an almost ideal one! In this lab, we have transmuted the &quot;imperfect&quot; capacitor into a perfect infinite one  having no any voltage drop across it although a current flows continuously through it! But with the same success we can make an ideal diode, zero resistance, etc... For this purpose, we just incorporate a varying battery to the imperfect component that compensate the losses inside the component. Remember: all the op-amp inverting circuits exploit this clever trick. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 16:50, 6 May 2008 (UTC)

[[Image:Ohm's law foam white board 1 1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A setup for investigating the voltage distribution of a conductive foam.&lt;/center&gt;]]

A wire itself, unlike resistors, has a length; that's why Ohm, the great scientist in electric circuits, has used it in his experiments. You can touch a wire to feel how it reacts on bigger current. In this particular exercise we have conducted experiments by investigating the voltage distribution along conductive foam as shown on the picture. As you can see, we have connected wires to two of the foam edges and put voltages from DAC1 and DAC2. We have made a lot of measurements with the 'probe' to investigate the voltage distribution along the conductive foam.
  
[[Image:Ohm's law foam 1 1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the voltage distribution of a conductive foam by Microlab.&lt;/center&gt;]]

After using the computer-based system ''Microlab'' and analyzing the result, we found that we have made a ''parallel voltage summing circuit''. If we put two voltages having the same magnitudes but  different polarities (the one + and the other -), we will see that in the center point the voltage will be 0 volts.
 
[[Image:Ohm's law foam 2 1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the voltage distribution of a conductive foam.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The conductive foam is very interesting for investigation because we can see how the voltage is distributed across it. [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

=== Investigating an LED ===

[[Image:Investigating led whiteboard 64a 1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating an LED on the whiteboard.&lt;/center&gt;]]

In this exercise, we have recreated the famous circuit of ''full-wave bridge''. In order to visualize its operation (where currents flow), we have decided to replace the ordinary rectifying diodes by LEDs with different colors. Also, we have used another LED for a load. Firstly, we have investigated the very LED to make ourselves familiar with its behavior. We have found that its performance is good for our purposes, it would shine and work without problems. It was clear that we had to connect a protecting resistor in series with the bridge circuit. [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building the circuit on the whiteboard ===

[[Image:Full-wave led bridge whiteboard1 64a 1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Building the circuit on the whiteboard (Step 1).&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Step 1.''' We started building the circuit on the whiteboard by connecting the ''load'' (the tested red LED). Here we assumed that DAC 1 was producing a positive voltage from 0 up to 10 V (this was the positive half-wave). Note how we have outlined the inverse S shape of the &quot;positive&quot; part of the future bridge. [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

[[Image:Full-wave led bridge whiteboard2 64a 1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Building the circuit on the whiteboard (Step 2).&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Step 2.''' Then we assumed that DAC 1 was producing a negative voltage from 0 up to -10 V (this was the negative half-wave) and connected the true S shape of the rest &quot;negative&quot; part of the future bridge. Only, a short-circuit turned out:( What should we do then? We began thinking...&lt;br&gt;
We had already known that diodes can act as decoupling elements (switches); so, we put two red-colored LEDs in the two opposite &quot;positive&quot; bridge legs acting as rectifying and visualizing diodes for the positive half-wave. We expected that since all the three diodes (including the &quot;load&quot;) were connected in the same direction they would enable the current to flow in the right direction and would shine during the positive half-wave.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Full-wave led bridge whiteboard3 64a 1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Building the circuit on the whiteboard (Step 3).&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Step 3.''' But it was not sufficient...:( To remove the conflict, we had to put further two (now, green-colored) LEDs in the two opposite &quot;negative&quot; bridge legs acting again as rectifying and visualizing diodes for the negative half-wave. We solved the short-circuit problem; we managed to &quot;invent&quot; the famous ''full-wave bridge'' rectifying circuit!

You can see on the picture how we made the full wave bridge – never mind if the current  flows from –  to  +  or from + to -, our red load LED will always shine! Now we can carry out a real experiment to see if our circuit will really work. [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

=== Mounting the circuit on a prototyping PCB ===

[[Image:Full-wave led bridge mounted 64a 1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A full-wave bridge rectifier implemented by LEDs.&lt;/center&gt;]]

This was a true hands-on exercise where we mounted the real circuit on a real prototyping PCB; we soldered the two rectifying LEDs and the LED load on the board and connected them by wires. Thus we finally got a real full-wave bridge rectifier that didn't need any measuring devices. Imagine it should indicate its state (the current direction) by the very diodes! We were eager to get to know, if it would work really as we had assumed? It would be very interesting to test it. [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

=== Investigating the circuit by ''Microlab'' ===

[[Image:Full-wave led bridge acting 64a 1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the LED rectifier by ''Microlab'' system.&lt;/center&gt;]]

After we supplied the circuit by ''Microlab'' system we were ready to investigate the circuit operation.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Positive input voltage ====

[[Image:Full-wave led bridge board1 64a 1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the LED rectifier by ''Microlab'' (positive input voltage).&lt;/center&gt;]]

It was working as we expected - the three red LEDs were lighting when we put a positive input voltage, the other two LEDs were extinguished. Everything was OK, as we wanted to be. [[User:PavlinPanev 64]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Negative input voltage ====

[[Image:Full-wave led bridge board2 64a 1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the LED rectifier by ''Microlab'' (negative input voltage).&lt;/center&gt;]]

Then we tested the circuit at negative input voltage; again the result was excellent as we had  expected. We were content with ourselves as we did our job very good. The famous full-wave bridge was working not only in theory but in real! [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

== Lab 4: Op-amp circuits with positive feedback ==
=== Quick Introduction Of Op-Amp===
Operational Amplifier or Op-Amp for short is one of the basic elements in the electronic circuits. In fact it is one abstraction. Under the word Op-Amp we understand an differential amplifier with very good properties like huge A&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; - the differential-mode gain, Megaohm resistance and so long. On the picture below is one differential amplifier, which I have made with the OrCad instrument. 

We have two bipolar transistors connected to the power source V1. The transistor Q2 has a constant base power source, while the transistor Q1 has a variable base power source. Let's see the time diagram generated by PSpice:

At time t=0 both the base source power are equal to 2V, and the Voltage of Q1 and Q2 are approximately equal. Then the V3 source is starting very slowly to decrease its voltage. As a result of this action the resistance of Q1 is increasing and Iq1 emitter is decreasing. According to first Kirchoff law the other Iq2 emitter current is increasing with the same value the Iq1 going down. In the generated time diagram you could see that when source power is decreasing the Uce of Q1 is increasing until saturation, and symmetrically Uce of Q2 is decreasing. When V3 is fall with 0.5V, the Vout is changed with 10V. 

Now We replaced our discrate differential amplifier with Op-Amp:

And the time diagram:

The green line is for differential amp. Here we could see that op-amp is slightly different from my diff-amp. It has very improved dynamical characteristic from the usual amplifier, improved frequency characterist, and so long, all at the cost of more and more transistor, and high complexity. The conclusion is that op-amp for us is one abstraction. We don't concern what is in the op-amp, but the function which op-amp does. Like Prof. Anant Agarwal from MIT had said &quot;...the analog of op-amp in programming is printf() function...&quot; very simple to use, but if we look at its implementation the things will change rapidly.

=== What negative feedback is ===

[[Image:Nfb block-diagram.jpg|left|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;The simplest negative feedback follower.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Non-inverting amplifier 65a 1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A non-inverting amplifier is a typical negative feedback circuit.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The idea of the negative feedback is to manage to keep the balance. The circuit with negative feedback actually takes the role of ''active regulating element'' – never mind what the resistance is it keeps this balance (what do you mean here? [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 17:09, 27 April 2008 (UTC)). All that an op-amp tries to do is simply to act as a real thinking human being.

Look at the picture. The difference ∆V between the input voltage Vin and the output voltage Vout is applied to the op-amp differential input. The thing is that the op-amp tries to keep ∆V very close to 0 volts so that the op-amp compensates the difference. However it cannot be more than the voltage on the amplifier itself (what do you mean here? [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 17:09, 27 April 2008 (UTC)). Hote that the op-amp does not take energy from the input voltage source to supply the load; instead, it uses its own power supply. The input currents are very low (nano- and pico-ampers); so, we can say they are voltage inputs.

The negative feedback follower just repeats the input value, no matter what the obstacles are. In this way, it acts as a real human being. [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

===Generic Negative Feedback Circuits ===
After Pavlin has introduced us the negative feedback concepts it is time to create and examine real circuits with negative feedback. I will use again the ''OrCad'' system to simulate two of the most popular kinds of feedback. The basic rule for this sort of schemes is: 

'''&quot;V- is less or equal to V+&quot;'''

The first circuit is the ideal voltage divider (why it is ideal, what does it mean?) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 06:18, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

According to the rule mentioned above V-=0. Then the volage of R9 is V8-0. The current I1 is
:&lt;math&gt;I1=\frac{V8-0}{R8}&lt;/math&gt;

The voltage of R10 is:
:&lt;math&gt;I1*R10=-Vout&lt;/math&gt;

This lead us to:
:&lt;math&gt;Vout=-Vin*\frac{R10}{R8}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case Vout = -Vin, because R10=R8=1k. The time diagram is shown below:

=== Converting a negative into a positive feedback circuit ===
==== General idea ====

What happens, if we make a mistake when apply a feedback from the output to the input of the subtractor and, as a result, it becomes a summer? In life this means to fool someone to do things in the wrong direction (for example, to do something bad instead to do something useful and v.v.). He/she &quot;thinks&quot; that he/she reacts in a proper way but actually he/she does exactly the opposite!

We can reproduce this situation in electronics, if we swap (usually, involuntarily) the op-amp's inputs. As a result, the op-amp is &quot;disoriented&quot;; like human beings, it &quot;thinks&quot; that it reacts in a proper way but actually it does exactly the opposite.

In this way, we can introduce the great idea of the positive feedback. It is extremely useful (for example, all the flip-flop RAMs are based on this powerful idea). [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

==== Converting a non-inverting amplifier into an inverting comparator with hysteresis ====

Similarly, what happens, if we make a mistake when build a non-inverting amplifier swapping the inverting and non-inverting inputs? Let's try.

[[Image:Neg to pos feedback 64a 1000.jpg|right|thumb|780px|&lt;center&gt;Misleading the op-amp of a non-inverting amplifier to convert the circuit into a positive feedback one.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

====Schmitt Trigger====
Returning from the world of abstractions, I would like to show you that there is no magic, live, or something similar in positive feedback, but only a pure physics based on very strong mathematical fundations. The positive feedback is classically explained with the equivalent model of the op-amp. 

And now if we gronuded V-, and connect V+ with the dependency source we are going to create something which in mathematics and programing is called recursion.

Meaning, V+=A*V+. Where is the end of recursion? This is when the op-amp get saturated.
Knowing this, we could create a comparator, which compare the V+ value with zero and, if it is greater forms plus impulse otherwise minus impulse. With this comparator we could form a square signal from a sinus wave.

== TINAE (essay) about diodes (by Zdravko64) ==
=== The concept behind diode ===

The first thing that a man is feeling, when he has heard an unfamiliar word is a confusion. He tries to understand what that word means, and after fails in this point he tries to connect this word with  analogies. The word &quot;diode&quot; is coming from Greek and it means two electrode or two &quot;ode&quot;. The first electrode is called an anode: in Greek  ana- + hodos, a way up, and the second electrode is called a cathode: in Greek kathodos, descent. Ok, so we have one word, which actually means something like a hill or a rising ground, and if we have a bicycle we can descent from the way up without any additional efforts. But when we try to climb this hill it could be difficult to reach the end, and probably we would start walking with very low speed or going in the backward direction. Returning to the world of electricity the electrons are the villagers with bicycles, and the diode is the hill. The electric circuit with a diode could be presented as ski piste. The skiers are very happy when the lift is working in the direction from the bottom to the top, but if we change the directions of the lift all skiers are wondering what's going on, and nobody is down hill skiing.

The next questions are, &quot;Why do we need such a part?&quot; and &quot;What were the electric circuits before the diodes?&quot; These answers require some historical ideas to be introduced. [[User:Zdravko64|Zdravko64]]

=== Circuits before the invention of diode ===

Let me take you back in the beginning of the 19th century, and in this chapter I would like to enter in the minds of the great physicists, or as they called in that time the great nature philosophers of that time. In 1800 was made one great invention by the Venetian nature philosophers Count Alessandro Giuseppe and Antonio Anastasio Volta. All began with one dispute with his colleague Luigi Galvani. After a series of experiments with animals Galvani found out that muscle contractions occurred, if a metal scalpel was touched to a certain leg nerve during dissection. He thought that in the body is conducted some kind of &quot;vital electricity&quot; which is flowing through the nerves. Volta was not on the same opinion. In 1792 he wrote, 

&quot;I am persuaded that the electric fluid is never excited and moved by the proper action of the organs, or by any vital force, or extended to be brought from one part of the animal to another, but that it is determined and constrained by virtue of an impulse which it receives in the place where the metals join.&quot; 
[http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Physics/Electromagnetism/Electrostatics/Electricfield/Newelectricity/Newelectricity.htm]

Isn't it incredible how they were thinking? Volta was the thought, that the electric current was some kind of a fluid. He didn't know that there is something like electron, further more he didn't know that the elements are consisted of atoms, because this was approved in 1827, when the botanist Robert Brown used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically — a phenomenon that became known as &quot;Brownian motion&quot;. The scientists suspected that this was not a usual fluid. Volta replace the legs of the frog with different chemical elements and discovered that the elements and aggregates (electrodes) which dissociate in electrolyte (galvanic element) gains a determined electrochemical potential (see [[w:Electrochemical series|Electrochemical_series]]). All Volta had to do is to connect two galvanic elements with different electrochemical potentials. The positive electrode of galvanic element was called ''cathode'', and the negative - ''anode''. So the reasonable question here is, &quot;Is the [[:Image:battery.bmp|battery]] a diode?&quot; [[User:Zdravko64|Zdravko64]]

:[[User:Zdravko64|Zdravko64]], your question is proper for my educational purposes as I intend to ask my students during the next lecture on Wednesday, April 9, the reverse question: &quot;Is a diode a battery?&quot; I will be happy, if you answer this question in your essay about diodes and at the lecture as well. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 16:01, 7 April 2008 (UTC)

::[[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]], when I started to write this kind of article my intentions was to create a really helpful and serious work, similar to some kind of scientific work, but not so complicatedly expressed. Now I am realizing, that this has become more like an essay. I am expecting, that we are going to do some teamwork and you give me a directions how to improve my reasonings to achieve my point. I would be thankful, if someone told me how to add pictures here, and I could add it from my lectures notebook and my notes from the laboratories. Thanks in advance. [[User:Zdravko64|Zdravko64]] 19:26, 14 April 2008

We have the potential difference that creates our hill. But the next keyword - exhaustion, comes here. The main disadvantage of the Volta battery is irreversible moving of the charges. When we connect cathode with anode, we take ''Zn'' ion from the anode, which displace the weaker ''2H'' ions from the sulfuric acid. The hydrogen ions give charges with cathode, turn into atoms, and fly away. The charge in cathode move to the anode (the direction is accepted to be from plus to minus by Benjamin Franklin), the anode become positive and more ''Zn'' negative ions are thrown. It is obvious that in some time either the anode will vanish or the acid will become salt. Anyway the process will stop. Then the battery will turn into dielectric. OK, but if the battery is ideal it is never going to exhaust. The battery has a fixed potential difference, and with the appropriate opposite high voltage we could manage to pass the hill. According to the superposition principle the two voltage would either add or substract, depending of the directions of the two sources. This means that we are descending from the first hill, and entering the second, if that hill is with the same raise I increase my speed and kinetic energy. Otherwise my kinetic energy is turning into potential one, if it is enough I'm passing or stop at the end, but if it is not enough I'm turning back, and pass through the first hill. 

Volta has found out another interesting thing. He noticed that the battery has the ability to transfer the electric charges from anode to cathode. That force was called electromotive force (emf). In the handing case emf is provided by the process of dissociation. This force is missing in the diode. But in the voltaic battery, if we remove the emf, meaning remove the salt bridge or placing a wall between anode and cathode in the acid, the two electrode will equals their potential difference at once. As a result the electrode will become neutral. How we could prevent this happen? [[User:Zdravko64|Zdravko64]]

In 1827 Ohm's law appeared in the famous book '&quot;Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet&quot;' (The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically) in which he gave his complete theory of electricity. Unfortunately the biggest part of his theory was completely ruined by greats mind like Fourier and Navier, for that Ohm believed that the communication of electricity occurred between &quot;contiguous particles&quot;. Although, his experiments were certainly valid as well as his law. Eighteen years later Gustav Kirchhoff generalized work by Georg Ohm in his two laws. The circuits at this time was measurement bridges like the Wheatstone bridge in 1843, the Kelvin double bridge, and RC circuits. Two great discoveries occurred in 1832. The first was the electromagnetic induction discovering made independently by Faraday [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday] and Joseph Henry [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry], and the second was the invention of telegraph by Baron Schilling von Canstatt [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_telegraph]. The discovering of electromagnetic induction show us, that the electric current is something slightly different from fluid. The electric current create a magnetic field around the wire through it flows, and also changing magnetic field produces an electric field:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} = - {{d\Phi_B} \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

'where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the electromotive force in volts, &lt;math&gt;{Phi_B}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic flux in werbs'. This law is telling, that &quot;the magnetic fluid&quot;, which is also called a magnetic field produced an emf equal to minus the speed of flux change. Two type of inductance were found 'mutual inductance' and 'self inductance'. Not longer after that Hippolyte Pixii [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolyte_Pixii] created the first dynamo machine [[Image:Electrical generator]]. 

The electric circuits start to include the element inductance, and RL circuits appears. The statement 

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = L \frac{di}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

leads to:

::&lt;math&gt;i(t) = \frac{1}{L}   \int_0^tv(\tau) d\tau + i(0)&lt;/math&gt;.

That means we could use the inductance to slow the increasing rate of &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:The invention of telegraph is very interesting from engineering point. You can see that in 1898 there was a telegraph lines between Europe, America, Africa and Asia.[[Image:Telegraph Lines]][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:1891_Telegraph_Lines.jpg#file]. And two questions were arising:
:1.How to support these thousand of kilometers telegraph wires.
:2.How to use our electric generator and power stations for telegraph supplying.

In other words could we use that new fluid, which Faraday was called a field for Morzse code transferring. Maxwell started to philosophize about the magnetic and electric phenomena in his articles &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot;[http://vacuum-physics.com/Maxwell/maxwell_oplf.pdf] (I recommend to read that remarkable work), and realized that electric and magnetic field are part of one electromagnetic wave. We don't need mechanical medium for this wave, because in this case the energy is oscillating. That is the beginning of RLC circuits.[[Image:Picture of RLC]]

The RLC circuit creates the magnetic and electric parts of the electromagnetic wave, and for that this circuit is call resonant circuit or tuned circuit. The natural frequency of em wave is:
::&lt;math&gt;\omega_o = {1 \over \sqrt{L C}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== The reason for development of diode. Evolution or genius revolution ===

A little of electron history. My point is to show, that there is nothing incidentally in the diode invention. In 1803 John Dalton use the forgotten theory of Democritus for explaining, why the elements are combined with a fixed mass, or in other words why we have SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but never S0&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt; or Na&lt;sub&gt;2.1&lt;/sub&gt;O, which Dalaton had formulated like &quot;Law of multiple proportions&quot;. After that in 1827 Robert Brown made his historical experiments, in order J. Desaulx to suggest fifty years later in 1877, that this phenomena was caused by the thermal motions of water molecules. . In 1883, Thomas Edison observed that a current flowed between the filament of an incandescent lamp and a plate in the vacuum near it [here I what to place a lamp figure], when the plate was connected to the positive end of the filament, but not when the plate was connected to the negative side. He was also rediscovering of thermionic diode principle. The idea is as following: if we heated the anode 
at a specific temperature some electrons could possible gain enough energy to split from the metal plate and reach the cathode through the vacuum. [[Here I want to place the thermionic diode figure]]

''If you wonder, how in this distance time, Edison was succeeded to isolate vacuum , and from where the world know about the electrons, years before the J.J.Thomson experiment follow this links:

1.[http:[//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray]]
 
2.[http:[//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron]]''

So the discovering of Edison was telling us something very important, and after it hystorics said, that electrical engineers was beginning to differentiate from the physicists, this think is: &quot;The electrons are our soldiers, and we could control them&quot;. Of course, the process which is equivalent to operation of heated vacuum tube diode is the evaporation''[here one picture of evaporation, and next to it picture of operation of thermionoc diode]'' In the first case the evaporation the fluid rise his temperature, which in macro level means that molecules rise their kinetic energy and fly away, when it reach an appropriate level. The second case has to work at the same principle, but Edison didn't know, what kind of a bond or energy is holding the electrons, surly it wasn't a chemical bond or gravity. The phenomena was called electron emission. Electron as a '''part of the atom''' was discovered in 1898 by Sir John Joseph Thomson
''[More about the three Thomson experiments [http:[//http://www.egglescliffe.org.uk/physics/particles/electron/electron.html]]]]''.
In his Nobel Lecture &quot;Carries Of Negative Electricity&quot;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/thomson-lecture.html], which I recommend every interested man to read (only 9 pages;)), he is talking about the abstraction of the diode operation principle, as we are going to see in the next section.

===Lab 1: Investigating passive resistive circuits by Microlab system ===

In this laboratory exercise we were talking about how we can build a converters and how we may investigate them with MicroLab system. First, the instructor introduced to us what converter means.

Converter is a device that changes the continuous fluctuations in voltage from an analog device (such as a microphone) into digital information (?!?! [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 06:29, 19 May 2008 (UTC)) that can be stored or processed in a sampler, digital signal processor, or digital recording device. Converters are generally two types:Voltage-to-current converers and Current-to-voltage converters.

=== [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|Lab 2]]: The genuine Ohm's experiment ===

In this laboratory exercise we went centuries ago. We felt like in Ohm primitive laboratory. Georg Simon Ohm lived in 1789 - 1854. His inventions are amazing. Even nowadays we know him as one of the most excentric and most creative people. During one of his experiments he took a piece of conductor. He stretched it in two ends. He started measuring voltage and current in the ends. But in these years there was not modern instruments nor such comforts like these we can use - he made the history of the electricity with primitive things. So he took a compass to measure current and an electroscope to measure voltage.

Following his ideas we tried to repeat his experiment with laboratory conditions. 
We decided to make our scientific experiment more interesting and more attractive.Instead of conductor we used graphitе. Graphite has impedance consequently it has voltage. 
We found out that, if we measure two ends of conductor - one of sites has 0V and the another has max V. [[User:Hristina Malakova68|Hristina Malakova68]] ([[User talk:Hristina Malakova68|talk]])

In the beginning of the laboratory exercise, we talked about the structure of the Wheatstone bridge, which consists of a common voltage source that connects two parallel branches containing four resistors. As we take a deep look in this structure we came to a conclusion that it is made of two voltage dividers. Then we constructed the Wheatstone Bridge using two pencil’s graphites acting as voltage dividers and then investigated it. It was very interesting for all the students of our group and for the lecturer also :)

of clashing egos and top secret research.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;
	  	  	 

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The problem started in the 1907 when the AT&amp;T (American Telephone and Telegraph) faced the competition erupting from the expiration of Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patents. And the solution was transcontinental telephone service. In 1906, the eccentric American inventor Lee De Forest developed a triode in a vacuum tube. It was a device that could amplify signals, including, it was hoped, signals on telephone lines as they were transferred across the country from one switch box to another. AT&amp;T bought De Forest's patent and vastly improved the tube. It allowed the signal to be amplified regularly along the line, meaning that a telephone conversation could go on across any distance as long as there were amplifiers along the way. But the vacuum tubes that made that amplification possible were extremely unreliable, used too much power and produced too much heat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;
After the end of World War II, a team of scientists was collected to develop a solid-state semiconductor switch to replace the problematic vacuum tube.  This team included a mix of physicists, chemists and engineers. On November 17, 1947, Walter Brattain, an experimental physicist who could build or fix just about anything, made an experiment into a thermos of water. The silicon contraption he'd built was supposed to help him study how electrons acted on the surface of a semiconductor. The wet device created the largest amplification Brattain had seen so far. By turning on a positive voltage he increased the effect even more; turning it to negative could get rid of it completely. It seemed that whatever those electrons had been doing on the surface to block amplification had somehow been canceled out by the water - the greatest obstacle to building an amplifier had been overcome.
Unfortunately this giant jump in amplification only worked for certain types of current - ones with very low frequencies. That wouldn't work for a phone line, which has to handle all the complex frequencies of a person's voice. So the next step was to get it to work at all kinds of frequencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;
In fact the device worked as if there was no oxide layer at all. And as Brattain poked the gold contact in again and again, he realized that's because there wasn't an oxide layer. He had washed it off by accident. Brattain was furious with himself, but decided to fiddle with the point contact anyway. To his surprise, he actually got some voltage amplification - and more importantly he could get it at all frequencies! The gold contact was putting holes into the germanium and these holes canceled out the effect of the electrons at the surface, the same way the water had. But this was much better than the version that used water, because now, the device was increasing the current at all frequencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;
Brattain had managed to get a large amplification at some frequencies and he'd gotten a small amplification for all frequencies - now he just had to combine the two. He knew that the key components were a slab of germanium and two gold point contacts just fractions of a millimeter apart. Walter Brattain put a ribbon of gold foil around a plastic triangle, and sliced it through at one of the points. By putting the point of the triangle gently down on the germanium, he saw a fantastic effect - signal came in through one gold contact and increased as as it raced out the other. The first point-contact transistor had been made.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;
He showed this little plastic triangle at a group meeting on December 23. It was official - this tiny bit of germanium, plastic and gold was the first working solid state amplifier.

==== Building the circuit on the whiteboard ====

===== Transistor as an amplifier =====

[[Image:Transistor_switch_whiteboard_68a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Building a transistor switch on the whiteboard.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The first part of this laboratory exercise was to build a transistor switch on the whiteboard. And we started with a conversation about the behavior of the transistor. The lecturer asked us what are the real functions of a transistor and what a transistor consists of. Those who knew it were just few. What we knew from the previous year was that the transistor amplifies electrical current. But in the exercise we took a deep look in its structure and understood that the transistor is nothing more than electrically driven resistor. Actually there is no real amplification. The real function of a transistor is to regulate not to amplify. (The text is written by [[Radoslav Danchev]])&lt;/p&gt;

In laboratory classes we imagined transistors the way they are normally explained in electronics - like a variable resistors. They are electrically-managed resistors, known as active transistors. Normally, the voltage across the transistor would increase its value, but actually it fades. The transistor decreases the supply voltage. It seems that the transistor can regulates it - this is one of the main funcions of transistors.

===== Making transistor act as a switch =====

After discussion of what is transistor, we started talking about the meaning of the transistor switch. We concluded that this is an element with two states - OFF and ON. When the switch is off, no current flows through it, and therefore the transistor is off. The depletion region across the emitter-base junction is large. There is no potential differences between the base and emitter. The emitter-collector terminals act as open. The second state is ON - then the transistor turns on as hard as it can. A voltage is present across the base-emitter junction. The depletion region across the emitter-base junction shrinks as much as possible. 
Here is a presentation about transistor switch : http://www.wisc-online.com/objects/index_tj.asp?objID=SSE3703 
It is very interesting! Take a look!

Eventually, we understood what exactly transistor and transistor switch are, along with their general purpose. So we started building one. The building scheme is in the photo. [[User:Hristina Malakova68|Hristina Malakova68]] ([[User talk:Hristina Malakova68|talk]])

===== Assembling a transistor switch by simpler converters =====

:Here are some questions about the circuit of the transistor switch. What does the base resistor R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; actually do in this circuit? Can we apply 1000 V or even more to the transistor switch input? What does the collector resistor R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; actually do in this circuit? A tip: present the transistor switch as a circuit composed by three converters (a [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter#V-to-I converter acting as an input device|voltage-to-current]], a current-to-current and a [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter#I-to-V converter acting as an output device|current-to-voltage]] converter). See the pictures below. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 14:32, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

[[Image:I-to-v_trans_switch_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The collector resistor Rc acts as a current-to-voltage converter&lt;/center&gt;]]

==== Mounting the circuit on a prototyping PCB ====

[[Image:Transistor_switch_pcb_68a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A transistor switch on a prototyping PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The picture above shows how we have built a transistor switch. It was very interesting task for us. Some of my colleagues took part in this. I watched them with extreme attention. First, the lecturer found a prototyping printed circuit board (PCB), which he gave to us. After that we started building up our &quot;invention&quot;. We soldered the supply voltage to the PCB. Then we put n-p-n transistor on the board. It was very difficult to solder its pins... but we made it!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Investigating the circuit ====

Then we put a lamp to use it like a collector load. The lamp had current charge of 100mA. We attached a button to control switching on and off the lamp. We soldered the button between the plus of the supply and the base of the transistor. When the lamp is off then the button is off, too. The transistor in this case is cut off. We attached also a contact point where we could measure the output (collector) voltage of our transistor switch. This was the final touch we made on our &quot;invention&quot;. Our transistor switch worked very well and we tested it a couple of times. It was quite amazing. It was worth doing it.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Drawing conclusions ====

Finally we concluded that if we want our transistor switch to work properly, we have to observe some circumstances:

#The transistor must be saturated very well. Otherwise it would start warming up.
#If Rb isn't small enough, the transistor would be blocked and it would start warming up. Its behavior would be like an amplifier.
#The transistor must be in its two final states - saturated (fully ON state) or cut off (OFF state).

A problem: false switching.

In this laboratory exercise we had the chance to talk about one of the most interesting electrical elements- amplifier and especially operating amplifier.
The operating amplifier can be with or without back connection. Those ampplifiers which do not have back connection are super sensitive. The lecture told us the simplest amplifier without back connection is comparator. This device function is to render an account of the current when it passes through the amplifier. Comparator is  a logical signal which means: “+” corresponds to “1” and “-“corresponds to “0”.

=== Introducing a hysteresis into the circuit ===

A system with hysteresis can be summarised as a system that may be in any number of states, independent of the inputs to the system. Many physical systems naturally exhibit hysteresis. Human-designed systems will sometimes intentionally exhibit hysteresis. For example, consider a thermostat that controls a furnace. The furnace is either off or on, with nothing in between. The thermostat is a system; the input is the temperature, and the output is the furnace state. If we wish to maintain a temperature of 23 degrees, then we might set the thermostat to turn the furnace on when the temperature drops below 21 degrees, and turn it off when the temperature exceeds 25 degrees. This thermostat has hysteresis. Let us say that the temperature is 24 degrees. Given this information, we cannot predict whether the furnace will be on or off; it's not possible to predict the instantaneous output of the thermostat, knowing only its instantaneous input.(The text is written by [[Eleonora Todorova]])

[[Image:Student2_68a.jpg|left|thumb|230px|&lt;center&gt;Thinking about hysteresis.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Schmitt_whiteboard1_68a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|520px|&lt;center&gt;Introducing a hysteresis into the op-amp comparator (discussion on the whiteboard).&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

How we said earlier when the operating amplifier has no back connection it is super sensitive  and its voltage-ampere characteristic varies. To ignore this variety it is used the phenomenon called histeresis. Histeresis actually is a positive back connection. It works like a pen-push down or push up. There is no average state-pen is either push-up or push-down and this is the mechanism of the histerezis. It enhances performance of the amplifier on the same direction and that is how the varies disappear. To use the histerezis   in the comparator scheme we drew it is necessary to change the kind of source. It must not to be a hard source but a source that the schema (operating amplifier) can use to control by itself in positive direction. We put e voltage divider to our schema. This allows the current to pass through the resistors R1 and R2 which values are equal.

[[Image:Waveform1_68a.jpg|right|thumb|235px|&lt;center&gt;Waveforms on the whiteboard.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

This is a Schmidtt trigger, which is made by an operational amplifier. As you can see on the pictures, first we draw its transfer characteristic on the whiteboard. Then, one of my colleagues and the teacher made a demo at the whiteboard showing to us how exactly voltages were changing. It was like an animation.

=== Illustrating the circuit operation by a hysteresis curve ===

[[Image:Students1_68a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|515px|&lt;center&gt;Thinking about the hysteresis curve: What does it mean?&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Hysteresis_curve_68a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|240px|&lt;center&gt;Introducing the hysteresis curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Hysteresis represent the history dependence of physical systems. If you push on something, it will yield: when you release, does it spring back completely? If it doesn't, it is exhibiting hysteresis, in some broad sense. The term is most commonly applied, as Webster implies, to magnetic materials: as the external field with the signal from the microphone is turned off, the little magnetic domains in the tape don't return to their original configuration (by design, otherwise your record of the music would disappear!) Hysteresis happens in lots of other systems: if you place a large force on your fork while cutting a tough piece of meat, it doesn't always return to its original shape: the shape of the fork depends on its history.
&lt;br/&gt;Hysteresis can be used to filter signals so that the output reacts slowly by taking recent history into account. (The text is written by [[Eleonora Todorova]])

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== What is Schmitt trigger? ===

[[Image:Scmit1.gif|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;A hysteresis curve of Schmitt trigger.&lt;/center&gt;]] 

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;The Schmitt trigger is a comparator application, which switches the output negative when the input passes upward through a positive reference voltage. It then uses negative feedback to prevent switching back to the other state until the input passes through a lower threshold voltage, thus stabilizing the switching against rapid triggering by noise as it passes the trigger point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;In the top diagram, the input voltage increases from zero, along the bottom horizontal line. The output voltage remains at zero on the vertical line. However, when the input voltage reaches 1.7 volts, the output shoots up from zero to 5 volts. Reducing the input voltage, as shown in the top horizontal line does not cause the output to drop to zero immediately. This only happens when the input voltage is reduced to 0.9 volts. The input level at which the output increases to maximum, and the level at which it drops to zero are different (the text is written by [[Radoslav Danchev]]).&lt;/p&gt;

:[[Radoslav Danchev|Radoslav]], I do not yet understand why the hysteresis curve is inclined to right. Please, elucidate me. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 13:44, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

::Well, now I agree... [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 06:31, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Scmit2.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;The hysteresis eliminates false switching.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;In the lower diagram Schmitt Trigger action is demonstrated in another manner. The black graph represents a noisy logic signal. This is the input to the Schmitt Trigger. The green graph is the output signal. The output remains at zero until the input exceeds 1.7 volts. The output then shoots up to 5 volts and remains at 5 volts until the input drops to 0.9 volts. The output then drops to zero. An almost perfect output is recovered from a very noisy input (the text is written by [[Radoslav Danchev]]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== A problem: How do we make it memorize? ===

At the end of the exercise we were talking about a very interesting thing - how exactly we can make a device to memorize. This was very exciting for us because like a future computer engineers we had to get an idea about the problem how exactly a computer RAM is built in?
The recipe of this creation is as follows:

The goal is to make a RS trigger (latch, flip-flop) that can memorize the signals applied to it. To get a trigger we have to get a 100% positive back connection (a feedback). Thus we can get an amplifier with back positive connection that means we have to create a hysteresis. To get a positive feedback we have to connect consecutively two invertors.

The secret of one trigger is to supply 10V  for logical 1 and to supply -10V for logical 0 in the input and at definite moment trigger switch over one to another state.
We have also to supply biasing voltage and that means that the incoming signal has to get a value which is in the middle of the hysteresis cycle. It said in another way this value has to be between two thresholds. [[User:Hristina Malakova68|Hristina Malakova68]] ([[User talk:Hristina Malakova68|talk]])

== Lab 4: How to make perfect circuits by series NFB ==

=== Is the real diode a perfect component? ===

[[Image:Real_diode_single.jpg|left|thumb|210px|&lt;center&gt;A &quot;harmful&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; across a diode.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Diodes are two-terminal semiconductor elements, characterized by allowing the current to flow in the forward direction when the voltage is positive but not in the reverse one when the voltage is negative. So diodes represent the action of a valve and so were they called in the past. However, the diode needs a little (approximately 0.5-0.7V) voltage-push in order the current to start flowing freely. The result is small but noticeable voltage drop - V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. What is this voltage drop - useful or harmful? Sometimes it is useful; other times it is harmful...

'''&quot;Useful&quot; examples.''' When we make voltage stabilizers, we need this voltage drop. In these cases we do all that is possible to create and increase this useful voltage drop appearing across various diode component: diodes, LEDs, zeners, multiple diodes connected in series...

'''&quot;Harmful&quot; examples.''' In other cases, when we use a diode as a switching element, we do all that is possible to remove and to remove this harmful voltage drop... Then we need an ideal diode without forward voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Making the simplest series diode rectifier ===

[[Image:Series_diode_limiter_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The forward voltage drop VF across a diode disturbs the input source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

A rectifier is an electrical element that converts alternating current to direct current. Rectifiers form the basis for electronic power supplies and battery-charging circuits. Furthermore, they are used in signal processing to demodulate radio signals and in the precision conversion of AC to DC voltage in electronic voltmeters. However, keeping in mind that the diode allows a current to flow in one (positive) direction but not in the other (negative), we can easily use the term &quot;rectifier&quot; to name a diode.

So let's make the diode perform as a rectifier and thus participating in a half-wave rectifier circuit (the circuit diagram is shown on the left). We have a sinusoidal source (for the experiment it is 1V) and a resistive load. [[User:Maya.zhecheva|Maya.zhecheva]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Series_diode_waveforms_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The voltage drop VF enervates the input voltage.&lt;/center&gt;]]

When the source voltage is positive, the diode is in the so-called forward-bias region. If the diode was ideal the source voltage will appear across the load. However, the diode we have is not ideal; so it performs a voltage drop equal to the push-up voltage of the diode (approximately 0.5 - 0.7V). So during the positive wave the output voltage is less than the source voltage (for our example it will be V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3V. The result is shown in the diagram on the right.

During the negative wave of the sinusoidal voltage the diode is in its reverse-bias region and no current flows through the load. Thus only the positive half-cycles result on the load, which makes the diode suitable as a rectifier. [[User:Maya.zhecheva|Maya.zhecheva]]

[[Image:Dist_follower_diode_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Compensating the harmful forward voltage drop VF across a real diode by surplus voltage.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What can act as a varying voltage source in our electronic circuit? What can &quot;help&quot; the imperfect diode by adding so much voltage to the input voltage as it loses across the diode? At last ''Lab 3'' we were using transistors for such a purpose; let's now, for the sake of change, use an op-amp...

Now the op-amp has to &quot;insert&quot; the &quot;helping&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; into the circuit; so, how to connect it?

[[Image:Dist_follower_diode_microlab_884.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the &quot;ideal&quot; diode by ''Microlab''.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Eureka! We have invented an (almost) ideal diode without (any) forward voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;! Let's investigate it by ''Microlab'' system.

Firstly, let's remind what an operational amplifier (op-amp) is: it's a device having a differential input (it may be current, voltage, mechanical motion?!?[[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 18:09, 7 May 2008 (UTC), etc.) and the output that varies according to the input but with a larger amplitude. Almost always they are used with negative feedback (the output signal is returned to the input in opposite direction to the source signal). However, they may be also used with a positive feedback (the output signal that is returned is summed with the input original signal) but much rarely. For ideal OA in a negative-feedback circuit, the network returns a fraction of the output to the inverting input and thus makes the differential input voltage toward zero.

So let's now go back to our experiment. What we are trying to do is to compensate the harmful forward voltage drop on a real diode with a operational amplifier. But isn't the result of this try an ideal operational amplifier?!

We have a source voltage V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; and at the point named &quot;1&quot; we will have that voltage. However, if we want to compensate the voltage drop across the diode, we should use an op-amp that will have on its output a voltage equal to the source voltage plus an additional amount that is equal to this voltage drop. This will be the voltage we will have at point &quot;2&quot;. If this increased voltage is applied before the diode, the voltage after the diode will be the same as our initial source voltage and that is what we have at point &quot;3&quot;. Which is our purpose!

In addition to the positive and negative terminals it has also two mystic terminals named NFB. What are they? Why and when do we need them? Describe here and draw a picture about a possible application of this arrangement.

== [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|Lab 2]]: The genuine Ohm's experiment ==

''Thursday, March 27, 2008, 16.45 h''

In the beginning, we had an &quot;accident&quot; with a $3 Chinese multimeter (VOM) - when we plugged its black test lead into the jack it just went down and &quot;disappeared&quot;. Then we decided to take advantage of this opportunity and began applying a kind of [[w:Reverse engineering|reverse engineering]] to it:) Tell here what you have seen inside the multimeter...


[[Image:Ohm's_P1070013.JPG|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Inside the Chinese multimeter (the picture is made by [[User:Lkirilova|Lora_Kirilova]])&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]
[[Image:Ohm's_P1070030.JPG|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;After that we used the multimeter for measuring, but one of our colleagues had to retain hold of the jacks (the picture is made by [[User:Lkirilova|Lora_Kirilova]])&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]
[[Image:Ohm's_P1070005.JPG|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The idea of finding the virtual ground (the picture is made by [[User:Lkirilova|Lora_Kirilova]])&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]
[[Image:Ohm's_4.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Exercise 2: Ohm's law (the picture is made by [[User:Jordan Slavov|maniac_353W]]) &lt;/center&gt;|380px]]
[[Image:Ohm's_P1070041.JPG|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The higher the voltage is (its absolute value), the brighter the probe bulb is (the picture is made by [[User:Lkirilova|Lora_Kirilova]])&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]
[[Image:Ohm's_2.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt; When we applied too high voltage to the wire it became red hot (the picture is made by [[User:Jordan Slavov|maniac_353W]])&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]
[[Image:Ohm's_P1070054.JPG|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Then we tried to cut a pen... (the picture is made by [[User:Lkirilova|Lora_Kirilova]])&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]
[[Image:Ohm's_P1070044.JPG|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Supplying a small DC motor by a voltage drop across a part of the resistive wire (the picture is made by [[User:Lkirilova|Lora_Kirilova]]).&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]
[[Image:Ohm's_P1070058.JPG|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;...and the result was - cut again. Also we had a sheet of paper catch fire, but fortunately, we put the fire out quickly! (the picture is made by [[User:Lkirilova|Lora_Kirilova]])&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]
[[Image:Ohm's_P1070389.JPG|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Depending on the polarity of the voltage drop and the distance between the two crocodile clips the DC motor spins around its axis in different directions and with different speed - getting closer to the 'ends' (+10V/-10V) it speeds up!

A forward voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; appears across a real diode when a current flows through it... What is this voltage drop - useful or harmful? Sometimes it is useful; other times it is harmful...

'''&quot;Useful&quot; examples.''' When we make voltage stabilizers, we need this voltage drop. In these cases we do all that is possible to create and increase this useful voltage drop appearing across various diode component: diodes, LEDs, zeners, multiple diodes connected in series...

'''&quot;Harmful&quot; examples.''' In other cases, when we use a diode as a switching element, we do all that is possible to decrease and even to remove this harmful voltage drop... Then we need an ideal diode without forvard voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Making the simplest parallel diode limiter ===

[[Image:Imp_diode_step1_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;The forward voltage drop VF across a real diode disturbs the input source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What does the combination (V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; + R) represent? What is it?

[[Image:Ideal_diode_idea_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;The imperfect real diode has become an almost ideal one.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What have we actually done here? How does it operate? What is the final result?

The answer is amazing: we have made just... a piece of wire...?!? What do you think about this speculation? Is it always right? [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 06:59, 26 April 2008 (UTC)

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Making an almost ideal &quot;op-amp&quot; diode ====

===== An op-amp acting as a varying voltage source =====

What can act as a varying voltage source in our electronic circuit? What can &quot;help&quot; the imperfect diode by adding so much voltage as it loses across the diode? At last [[#Lab 3: &quot;Inventing&quot; a negative feedback BJT current source|Lab 3]] we were using transistors for such a purpose; let's now, for the sake of change, use an op-amp...

[[Image:Op-amp_ideal_diode_intro_step3_1000.jpg|left|thumb|780px|&lt;center&gt;An op-amp can &quot;help&quot; the imperfect diode by adding a voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; in series with the input voltage source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Now the op-amp has to &quot;insert&quot; the &quot;helping&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; into the circuit; so, how to connect it?

===== Finishing the op-amp circuit =====

Eureka! We have invented an (almost) ideal diode without (any) forvard voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;!

Here we have connected a photoresistor in the feedback loop...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Generalizing the powerful &quot;helping&quot; idea ===

[[Image:Ideal_diode_idea_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;A recipe: ''imperfect component + varying battery = perfect element''.&lt;/center&gt;]]

We are already true magicians as we can transform any imperfect component into an almost ideal one! In this lab, we have transmuted a real diode (ordinary, LED, zener, any combinations of them, etc.), a resistor and a photoresistor into... a piece of wire:) having no any voltage drop across it! But with the same success we can make a &quot;botomless&quot; capacitor (an op-amp inverting integrator)... For this purpose, we just incorporate a varying battery to the imperfect component that compensated the losses inside the component. All the op-amp inverting circuits exploit this clever trick.

== A dedication to my students ==

''I dedicate this exciting story to my students from Faculty of Computer Systems, Technical University of Sofia, spring 2008, that have inspired me to carry out this incredible experiment on the laboratory and to tell about it on [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] wikibook. [[User:circuit-fantasist|Cyril]]''


[[Image:Voltage diagram 1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;The voltage diagram shows the voltage distribution along the resistive film.&lt;/center&gt;]]

I have been teaching analog circuitry for more than 20 years. During this period, my students and I have been carrying out many and many times an attractive computer-based experiment (it is my favorite experiment): ''visualizing the voltage distribution along a linear resistive film'' that is supplied by two voltage sources connected to the two sides of the resistor. For this purpose, we use all kinds of &quot;resistors&quot;, some of them quite odd: resistive wires, pencil's graphites, conductive foam and rubber, and of course, opened potentiometers and the good old rheostats. By sliding on the resistive surface and varying consecutively the two supply voltages, we &quot;invent&quot; various legendary resistive devices: movement sensors, voltage dividers, resistive summers, subtractors, Wheatstone bridge, op-amp inverting, non-inverting and differential amplifier, etc.

In addition, this marvelous experiment presents in an attractive non-traditional way the famous [[w:Ohm's law|Ohm's law]], [[w:Virtual ground|virtual ground concept]], [[w:Negative resistance|negative resistance phenomenon]], etc. to curious students. It even shows directly in a &quot;geometrical&quot; way classical relations between the electrical quantities (I = V/R, U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = -R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.) Furthermore, this experiment establishes a connection between the elementary passive resistive circuits (voltage divider, resistive summer, etc.) and the more sophisticated electronic op-amp circuits (non-inverting amplifier, inverting amplifier, etc.)

I have been having responsive, clever, curious and capable students that have been helping and inspiring me in my pursuit of revealing the truth about resistive circuits through these years. That is why, I have decided to place this experiment first on my site of [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com circuit-fantasia.com] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/current-ske-3.htm Compound passive converters with voltage output]&lt;/ref&gt; and then on this wikibook.

== Implementation of the web experiment ==

=== Students ===

[[Image:Lecture_03_19_2008_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;In the lecture hall (March 19, 2008).&lt;/center&gt;]]

During this term I teach basic circuitry (both lectures and laboratory exercises) to 150 students from Faculty of Computer Systems, Technical University of Sofia. They are divided into 
five groups (64, 65, 66, 67, 68), each of them containing 30 students. Further, for the purposes of the laboratory exercises, these groups are divided into sub-groups of 15 students. Each laboratory cycle lasts two weeks: the first five sub-groups (64a, 65a, 66a, 67a, 68a) conduct laboratory exercises during every even week; the other five sub-groups (64b, 65b, 66b, 67b, 68b) conduct laboratory exercises during every odd week. My general idea is to carry out the same experiment in the laboratory consecutively with all the student groups during the present cycle (March 17 - 29, 2008).

=== Organization ===

'''Preparation.''' First, in the beginning of the week, I started this story on Circuit idea. For this purpose, I outlined briefly (about 25%) the [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|future page]]: I traced out the contents by inserting the main subtitles; then, I placed semi-drawn pictures and a little explanatory text. By the way, it was very hard for me to refrain from making the whole page...

In the laboratory, I prepared all kinds of resistive elements (wires, pencil's graphites, conductive foam, etc.), power supplies, movements, VOM's, holders, etc. and arranged the laboratory equipment according to the future experiment's purposes.

I also prepared all kinds of recording equipment - a small solid state recorder (for quite a while I have recording my lessons, classes and laboratory exercises), camera and mobile phone. Maybe, next year I have to use a web camera:)?

I have also begun thinking who of famous web writers (mainly, university and college teachers) to invite to join this educational web initiative. For now, I have in mind Tony Kuphaldt ([http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits Lessons in electric circuits]), [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~thayes/phys123/ Tom Hayes] ([http://frank.harvard.edu/aoe/sm/index.htm Student manual for the art of electronics] - great book!), William Beauty ([http://amasci.com Science hobbyist]] - great site!)...

'''Announcement.''' Then, in the lecture hall, I announced my intention to conduct such a web experiment to students and showed them how can we carry out it. I told them what is the great Wiki idea and how they can join the wikibook [[Circuit Idea]]. I suggested to students to choose meaningful user names consisting of student name and group number (thus I can observe their web achievements and add more credits to the rating).

== During the laboratory exercises ==

In the student group pages, my students and I describe step-by-step how the laboratory exercises have passed. The great mass of the written is extracted from the records but there is also some fragments that is written directly to this page in the laboratory during the exercises. Note that students make their reports in real time at the laboratory; I make also my &quot;report&quot; on the white board (ten times during the cycle!), snap it from time to time and write it on this page. Students and I make a lot of photos during the exercises; they show drafts on the whiteboard, screen shots, laboratory setups and, of course, the very students. 

The idea is first to write up here chronologically what is done in the laboratory; then to systematize and polish these raw materials and place them in the main story. We will use here (and why not in the main page?) a quite informal style. I will mark student's insertions by italic to distinguish them from my teacher's text. Well, let's start!

We are students from [http://www.tu-sofia.bg/fksu/fksu1.htm Faculty of Computer Systems], [http://www.tu-sofia.bg/index.html Technical University of Sofia]. Our 66 group is divided into two sub-groups; we constitute the second - 66b - one. Here are our names:

Borislav Bozhanov; Aydin Hafizoglu; Nicklay Lyubenov; Miroslav Otsedarski; Georgi Upalov; Zapyan Dimitrov; Borislav Borisov; Vanya Shiderova; Konstantin Lalov; Lyudmila Nenkova; Ana Ivanova; Yanita Petkova;

== Lab 1: Investigating passive resistive devices ==

In this section we will explain and show some of our work during the Lab1:

The following picture presents the scheme that we work during the laboratory exercise. It has the following elements:

-	DAC1,DAC2 (DAC3,DAC4) : Digital-to-analog converters;

-	ADC1,AC2(ADC3,ADC4) : Analog-to-digital converters; 

-	V1,V2,V3 : three voltmeters;

-	R = 4,7KΩ : A rheostat

-	A computer where we observe the diagrams

We have two input voltages that we are operating with (Vin1 and Vin2):

[[Image:Sheme1.jpg]]

'''1.	Graphic presentation ot Potential Diagram.'''



[[Image:Sheme2.jpg]]

'''2.	Moving the wiper of the rheostat (Vin1 = const, Vin2 = 0).  '''


In this case we have a “moving-to-voltage” conversion. That means that while we move the wiper we change the output voltage.


 [[Image:Sheme3.jpg]]

'''3.	Changing Vin1 (the rheostat resistance is constant, Vin2 = const).'''

In this case we have a “voltage-to-voltage” conversion. While we are changing the voltage Vin1, we are changing Vout. In other words, this is a “voltage-to-voltage” converter that is controlled from the left hand side.

[[Image:Sheme4.jpg]]


'''4.	Changing both Vin1 and Vin2.'''

In this case we have “invented” the voltage summer. 


[[Image:Sheme5.jpg]]

If these voltages have opposite polarities, our scheme becomes a comparing device. Somewhere on the rheostat we have a point with zero potential, that is named “virtual ground”.

[[Image:Sheme6.jpg]]

Here, we have inserted some Wikipedia considerations about virtual ground point. 

[[w:Virtual ground|Virtual ground]] (or ''virtual earth'') is a node of the circuit that is maintained at a steady reference potential, without being connected directly to the reference potential. In some cases the reference potential is considered to be the surface of the earth, and the reference node is called &quot;ground&quot; or &quot;earth&quot; as a consequence.

The virtual ground concept aids circuit analysis in operational amplifier and other circuits and provides useful practical circuit effects that would be difficult to achieve in other ways.

In circuit theory, a node may have any value of current or voltage but physical implementations of a virtual ground will have limitations of current handling ability and a non-zero impedance which may have practical side effects.

== [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|Lab 2]]: Improving the genuine Ohm's experiment ==

''Tuesday, March 18, 2008, 13.45 h''

=== Ohm's law ===

1. Ohm's Law deals with the relationship between voltage and current in an ideal conductor. This relationship states that the potential difference (voltage) across an ideal conductor is proportional to the current through it. The constant of proportionality is called &quot;resistance&quot;, R. 
Ohm's Law is given by: ''V = I.R'' where V is the potential difference between two points, which include a resistance R. I is the current flowing through the resistance. For biological work, it is often preferable to use the conductance, g = 1/R; in this form Ohm's Law is: 
I = g.V
2. Material that obeys Ohm's Law is called &quot;ohmic&quot; or &quot;linear&quot;  because the potential difference across it varies linearly with the current. 

3. Ohm's Law can be used to solve simple circuits. A complete circuit is one which is a closed loop. It contains at least one source of voltage (thus providing an increase of potential energy), and at least one potential drop i.e., a place where potential energy decreases. The sum of the voltages around a complete circuit is zero. 

4. An increase of potential energy in a circuit causes a charge to move from a lower to a higher potential (i.e. voltage). Note the difference between potential energy and potential. 
Because of the electrostatic force, which tries to move a positive charge from a higher to a lower potential, there must be another 'force' to move charge from a lower potential to a higher inside the battery. This so-called force is called the electromotive force, or ''emf''. The SI unit for the ''emf'' is a volt (and thus this is not really a force, despite its name). We will use a script E, the symbol, to represent the emf.

A decrease of potential energy can occur by various means. For example, heat lost in a circuit due to some electrical resistance could be one source of energy drop. Because energy is conserved, the potential difference across an ''emf'' must be equal to the potential difference across the rest of the circuit. That is, Ohm's Law will be satisfied: ε = I.R.

5. Here is a nice [http://www.physics.uoguelph.ca/phyjlh/Fendt/phe/ohmslaw.htm simulated experiment on Ohm's Law] for you to test your understanding of this concept.

== Lab 3: Transistor circuits (trying to create a &quot;diode&quot; current mirror) ==

''Tuesday, April 08, 2008, 13.45 h'' ''(extracted from the lab records made by a solid-state recorder)'' [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 18:56, 29 May 2008 (UTC)


[[Image:Simplest_trans_current_source_whiteboard2_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Creating a simple transistor current source (on the whiteboard).&lt;/center&gt;]]

The idea of this lab is to transform the [[Circuit Idea/Simplest Transistor Current Source|simplest transistor current source]] (that your colleagues from [[Circuit Idea/Group 65b#Lab 3: Transistor circuits (building the simplest transistor current source)|group 65b]] made an hour ago) into a ''current mirror'' circuit. You can see what they have discussed on the whiteboard and what they have made on the prototyping PCB. Well, let's first examine and discuss their creation and then try to metamorphose it to the desired circuit.

Look at the circuit on the whiteboard that is left from your colleagues. What do you see there? What is it? What is the idea of this circuit? What does the transistor do there? What is its behavior? What does the potentiometer do? What are these steady resistors? Why have they connected them in series with the varying ones? What does every component do in this circuit?

Well, let's begin reasoning to reveal the secret of this typical transistor circuit...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Understanding the transistor ===

We have to begin from somewhere; we need some idea to start the discussion... So, let's first consider the ubiquitous transistor. It is a three-terminal device... How have they connected it here? How do we connect three-terminal elements? They have connected one of its leads to the ground; so, the three-lead transistor is connected as a four-lead device. Also, in order to understand the more complex three-terminal transistor, we can break down it into simpler two-terminal parts. For example, we can first separate the output collector-emitter part as a two-terminal &quot;element&quot; and the input base-emitter part as another two-terminal &quot;element&quot;; then, to begin reasoning what does the transistor do.

==== Varying the input current ====

The simplest way to drive the transistor is by current. For this purpose, we have to connect only a base resistor Rb between the power supply and the transistor's base; for simplicity let's connect the same load resistor R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Rb. Only, as a result, we get a current amplifier (Ic = βIb) instead the desired current mirror (Ic = Ib). How do we equalize the currents?

==== Varying the input voltage ====

We can connect a second resistor (actually, a potentiometer) in parallel to the base-emitter junction to divert the excessive current from the base to the ground. Where can we drive a transistor from? What is the input? The voltage between the base and the emitter drives the transistor. We can recognize in the left part of the circuit the ubiquitiuos potentiometer and a steady resistor connected in series. So, obviously the idea is to drive the transistor by a voltage. What is the mode of the transistor operation (saturated, active or cut off)? There are also measuring devices connected - two voltmeters and a (milli)ammeter.

[[Image:Simplest_trans_current_source_pcb_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Mounting and investigating the transistor cirrent source on a prototyping printed circuit board (PCB).&lt;/center&gt;]]

What can we do with this circuit? We can vary its attributes one after another and observe its reaction to our intervention. Let's begin varying the input voltage. What happens, if we move the P's slider downwards to the end position? What is the input voltage then? ''Zero''.  Yes, there is no any input voltage. The output collector-emitter part of the transistor is in cut-off condition. The resistance between the collector and the emitter is infinite; no current flows in the output circuit. So, you can think of a transistor just as a varying resistor that has infinite resistance at these conditions (zero input voltage). Why the voltmeter V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; shows maximum voltage (equal to the supply voltage)? It is not so simple to explain why... Well, we have already discussed this phenomenon. We have a resistor whose upper end is connected to the positive rail of the power supply. What is the potential (the voltage regarding to the ground) of its lower end?

One possible viewpoint is to think of this circuit as a voltage divider with R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ∞ (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; so, K ≈ 1. Another viewpoint is to see that the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; does not resist since there is nothing to resist (no current flows). Actually, there is no transistor connected in the circuit; we may erase it from the whiteboard...

===== The transistor is just a varying resistor =====

Now begin moving the potentiometer's slider up. At given moment the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; begins lower; stop when it becomes somewhere between the supply rails (0 - 10 V), for instance in the middle (5 V). What is the mode of the transistor (saturated, active or cut off)? It is a &quot;semi-opened&quot;; so, it is in ''active'' mode. How does the transistor do this magic? Does it do something special? No, the transistor does not do anything supernatural in this region, it does the same what a tube, an FET, a rheostat, etc. would do, if they were at its place - ''it just changes its present resistance''. So, the transistor is a varying resistor; only, it is an electrically controlled resistor. Well, if we have set a total load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 kΩ and V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; = 5 V, what has the transistor done? It has set its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 kΩ as well. It is just the same resistor as the collector one. Think of this circuit as a voltage divider with two identical resistors; its transfer ratio is K = 0.5.

This is the notion about a transistor that we need to understand how transistor circuits operate. All the active elements do the same; they are electrically controlled resistors. So, all the transistor circuits contain both ordinary resistors and electrically controlled resistors (active elements). They form the well-known voltage divider where transistors are put on the place of R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or the both.

If you continue moving up the slider, you will probably reach the saturation where V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∞ 0 V and the transistor is opened totally. What is the current now? It has a maximum value according to Ohm's law: I = V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

==== Varying the load resistance ====

[[Image:Trans_output_va_2_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Transistor acting as a current-stable resistor (both RL and RT vary).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Trans_current-stable_resistor_demo_68b_lab3_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Demonstrating how a BJT acts as a current-stable resistor (by [[User:Lkirilova|Lora]]).&lt;/center&gt;]]

How have we arrived at a conclusion that the output part of the transistor behaves as a constant current source? We have somehow to check this speculation. For this purpose, we have to provoke the circuit and to see how it will react to our intervention. Well, what will we see if we vary the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;? The output transistor characteristic can give us the answer. Do you remember the subject of semiconductor devices? These characteristics are favorite topic for them. Only, they do not show how to use this transistor behavior. ''A student: the characteristic is horizontal; so, the current will not change, if the load varies''. Yes, it is right. But what does the transistor do, what is its behavior to obtain such a characteristic?

Does the current change, if we vary the load resistance? ''A student: Yes, it does...'' But how do you explain it? Because the answer is exactly opposite - the current does not vary... Obviously, there are things that contradict our intuition and this is one of them... Well, look at the picture on the right (from [[Circuit Idea/Group 68b|Group 68b]]); it shows graphically how the transistor does this magic. Two IV characteristics are superimposed on a common coordinate system. The first curve is an IV characteristic of a real voltage source having a voltage V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; and an internal resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (they name it &quot;load line&quot;). The slope of this curve depends on R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. If R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, it is a vertical line; if R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0 it inclines proportionally to the resistance. The second curve represents the present output transistor resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; or shortly, R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;).

The transistor does the following trick: if we try to decrease/increase the load resistance (to set upright the load line), it does the opposite - increases/decreases its present resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; or shortly, R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) so that the crossing  (operating) point moves along the almost horizontal output characteristic of the transistor. As a result, the current stays almost constant. You can see how simple the idea of this dynamic constant current source is. It consists only of two elements: a voltage source and a dynamic resistor connected in series with the resistive load. The resistance of the dynamic resistor supplements the load resistance to a constant value (R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = const); so, the current is constant - I = V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;). Shortly, the dynamic resistor keeps up a constant total sum of the resistances.

A conclusion: ''If you connect in series a transistor and a resistor and begin varying the resistance of the resistor, the transistor will also begin changing its present resistance so that the sum of resistances to stay constant; as a result, the current stays constant. The transistor acts as a dynamic resistor that varies, as a '''current-stable resistor''' (an element that has the property to keep up a constant current)''.

And what about the voltage drop across the resistor? Does it vary? Move the slider and look at V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If we lower R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; across the load lowers as well. But the transistor increases its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; across it increases as well. And vice versa; if we increase R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; across the load increases as well. Now, the transistor lowers its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; across it lowers as well.

''A conclusion: If we vary the load resistance, the current stays constant but the voltages vary in wide limits.''

However, at given moment the transistor depletes its reserve of resistance; it saturates and the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; across it becomes zero. The magic of dynamization ceases and if you continue changing the load resistance, the current will change according to Ohm's law.

==== Varying the supply voltage ====

Besides the load resistance, we can vary the supply voltage as well. Look at the picture on the whiteboard again and answer the question, &quot;Will the current stay constant, if we vary the supply voltage V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;?&quot; Well, try it on the lab set up. As we can see, the current varies. Why? What is the problem?

When we vary the supply voltage, the transistor would react to this new &quot;intervention&quot; as before: if we increase V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;, it would increase its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and v.v. The transistor would keep up a constant ratio V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). But still the current varies... What is the reason?'' A student: The input voltage varies.'' Yes, this is the reason... The tragedy of this circuit is that they have supplied the input voltage divider by the same power supply. But we have not another power supply. What do we do then so that the current to stay constant when we vary the common supply voltage?

''A student: ...to add another transistor...'' I don't know; tell where you will place this additional transistor. You have to have some idea to place it. What does a transistor stabilize? Do all colleagues understand that a transistor stabilizes current? A transistor is a current stabilizer while a diode is a voltage stabilizer. The characteristic of such a voltage-stable element is a vertical line. All the voltage-stable elements (diodes, zeners, LEDs, etc.) have such a characteristic; they behave as a voltage source.

=== A true diode sets the input current ===

[[Image:Current_mirror_diode_student1_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Trying to add a true diode in the current-setting part...&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Current_mirror_diode_student2_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Adding correctly a true diode in the current-setting part.&lt;/center&gt;]]

''Another student:...to place a diode...'' Yes, this is the right answer, to place a diode but now you have to say where. Please, write it on the whiteboard; here are whiteboard markers. Do not are confused that it looks not so pretty because we &quot;invent&quot; the circuit scribbling on the whiteboard. The other alternative is to show &quot;cut-and-dried&quot; pretty circuits on slides or ''Power point'' presentations...

Well, your colleague begins drawing a diode; is she drawing it in the right direction? By the way, I know there are diodes that are usually connected in a reverse direction. What are they? ''Students: ...zener diodes...'' Right but let's use an ordinary diode. Only, let's connect it correctly... Is the circuit written correctly?

''Another student: Let's erase the potentiometer...'' Go and draw what you mean. Maybe, it is better not to remove the potentiometer; instead, draw it higher up and connect it properly, as a rheostat (do not forget to connect the slider). Leave it as an element that allows us to regulate the input current. It is time to make some shots. This room is not so suitable to make photos as a Hollywood studio but your colleagues do something great; so, they deserve to be perpetuated:) 

Don't you think it's time to discover the web for similar solutions? For this purpose, write [http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGIH,GGIH:2006-52,GGIH:en&amp;q=%22current+mirror%22 &quot;current mirror&quot;] in the Google window. As usual, the corresponding [[w:Current mirror|Wikipedia page]] (too formal and boring) stays at the first position.

Let's then see Tony Kuphaldt's page about [http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_3/chpt_4/12.html current mirrors]. In the beginning, he is reasoning about Ebers-Moll diode equation. We can see the load and the transistor and now we exclaim with surprise - here is the same diode! Tony Kuphaldt has proposed what our colleagues has proposed as well - to improve the circuit by connecting a forward biased diode in parallel to the base-emitter junction. Then, the author begins telling what the profit is in connecting an ordinary diode.

Let's scrutinize the Tony Kuphaldt's circuit since I have the following idea. As he is a very good teacher and an excellent web writer, I intend to write an email to him where to describe our Wikibooks &quot;open student project&quot; and to invite him to join it. More concretely, I will tell him how you and I, all together, have arrived at his idea; then, how we have checked it and have found out that it is right (or not, now we have to decide). That is why it is so important to judge his circuit.

Tony claims that the output current flowing through the load is equal to the input current flowing through the diode: ''&quot;Current through resistor Rload is therefore a function of current set by the bias resistor, the two being nearly equal.&quot;'' But is it true? Let's try it.

Who can solder? Choose a diode, solder it on the prototyping PCB and measure the currents. As I can remember, your colleague has told that a transistor consists of two diodes. Here we need a diode whose IV curve is identical to the IV curve of the transistor driving the load. What an idea can arise then? Imagine we have not an ordinary diode; we have only transistors...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== A base-emitter transistor &quot;diode&quot; sets the input current ===

==== Replacing the true diode with a base-emitter transistor junction ====

[[Image:Current_mirror_trans_diode_student3_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Setting the input current by a base-emitter transistor &quot;diode&quot;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Current_mirror_trans_diode_pcb_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The circuit mounted on the PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Can we use the transistor as a diode? Yes, we can. In this case we can connect the base-emitter junction of an identical transistor (leaving the collector no connected) as a diode. ''A student: Yes, this was the lower circuit of Tony Kuphaldt...''

They frequently use this &quot;trick&quot;... Even the transistor can be &quot;semi-damaged&quot;; we can use only one of its junctions (in this case wee need exactly the base-emitter junction). Who will draw the new circuit? Let's the colleague to draw it. Leave the collector non-connected. Try to draw the circuit more symmetrically and turn it with the base to the other base; thus we will arrive easier to the great current mirror circuit. Finally, draw where currents flow by green current loops. All the currents begin from the positive lead of the supply voltage source and return to the negative one. First, an input current comes down from the positive rail, flows through the base resistor and arrived at the common point between the two bases. Here it strikes two p-n junctions connected in parallel (we have supposed they are identical). So, what will it do? The current will branch out into two directions - on the left and on the right; there are two base currents I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.

What is the idea of Tony Kuphaldt? It asserts that, if we create an input voltage by a stabilizer containing a resistor and a diode (or a base-emitter junction) acting as a voltage-stable element and apply this voltage to the base-emitter junction of another transistor, the two currents (the input and the output one) would be almost equal. Shortly, the two currents are equal since the two voltages are equal.  

Then look for another but the same transistor and solder it. Who will show oneself? Only, let's connect another milliammeter in the input circuit. Can we expect that the two currents will be absolutely equal? No, we cannot since the two transistors are not absolutely identical; they are not selcted. They made this structure exceptionally in integrated circuits. Who will solder? Look at the circuit on the whiteboard and implement it on the prototyping board. Do not remove the steady resistor connected in series to the potentiometer. Why is it there? It protects the base-emitter junctions of the transistors in a case when someone set zero resistance.

By the way, [[User:Circuit-fantasist|I]] have not ever carried out this experiment; so, I don't know what will happens. The result may be positive but maybe negative... And what do you think about the currents? Are they equal? Well, will check them later. Let's now tidy the measuring devices. Leave the voltmeter across the output transistor; we need it to know, if the transistor is in the active region. The two milliammeters will whow the two currents.

Now increase the input current by moving up the slider of the input rheostat. What about the output current? It does not &quot;move&quot;; it stays constant (about 2 mA). Why? Measure the input voltage (between the bases and emitters) to know why. As we can see, it is about 0.65 V. What does it mean? Maybe that the transistor is saturated... To make sure measure also the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; across the output resistor. You need a voltmeter; switch the ammeter as a voltmeter and connect it across the collector-emitter part of the second transistor. Only, close the loop by a piece of wire (use wires with aligators at the two ends)...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== A problem appears: the transistor smokes! ====

[[Image:Current_mirror_trans_diode_whiteboard_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The transistor smokes; there is something wrong in this connection...&lt;/center&gt;]]

Oh! The transistor begins smoking! It is warm! But why? What happens? It is impossible! If your circuit is the circuit that is drawn on the whiteboard, the transistor should not warm since there are &quot;protecting&quot; resistors of 3.9 kΩ connected in the base and in the collector circuits! There is another cause and you have to find it because it is very useful for us. IMO, there is some wrong connection... You can check the protecting resistors, if they are 3.9 kΩ. Yes, they are.

''A student: I have found the cause - we have bypassed all the resistors connected in the collector! Maybe, the transistor is not damaged?''

Well, let's check it. Alas! There is no voltage across the collector-emitter part; it seems the transistor is damaged. Or it is just saturated?

Only, our lab is finished. Your colleagues from the next [[Circuit Idea/Group 67b#A negative feedback transistor &quot;diode&quot; sets the input current|Group 67b]] will continue your work.

== Lab 4: Op-amp inverting amplifier ==

''Tuesday, April 22, 2008, 13.45 h''

'''1.Principles of Negative Feedback (NFB)'''

The main idea of negative feedback is returning of the output ('''Y''') back to the input ('''X''') of the device (Image 1). In other words, we can think of this idea as a sort of active &quot;tracing&quot; or &quot;following&quot;. Every device with negative feedback &quot;solves&quot; the equation '''X=Y'''. In order to do this, we need first ''energy'' ('''E'''). Also, we need a ''regulating element'' ('''R''') to control the output quantity '''Y'''. The third element in our NFB device is a ''comparator'' ('''-'''), which will &quot;analyse&quot; the difference between '''X''' and '''Y''' and will give the result to the regulating element that have to reduce the difference to zero.

''Devices and systems use NFB to compensate any disturbances that may occur during the working process.''

Image 1:[http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y12/yanita_bsb/NFB-shema.jpg]


'''2.Voltage Follower'''

This is the simpliest operational amplifier configuration. It follows the voltage that is sent in. It is a very useful little cicuit. You can use it to protect circuity of being overloaded. The voltage follower with an ideal op amp gives simply Vout = Vin. 
First, we have a Op-amp with NBF: Image 2:[http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y12/yanita_bsb/vf_sch1.jpg]
Then we add 2 resistors: Image 3:[http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y12/yanita_bsb/vf_sch2.jpg] and now we have a Voltage Follower!!!

It's good to know that 2 resistors in series have the ability to subtrack 2 volteges: Image 4:[http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y12/yanita_bsb/schema.jpg].
An interesting fact is, that while trying to compensate the disturbances the follower is turning into an op-amp.

Here we can see a resistive summer in ideal circuit:Image 5:[http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y12/yanita_bsb/rezistivensumator-schema.jpg]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;
We are students from [http://www.tu-sofia.bg/fksu/fksu1.htm Faculty of Computer Systems], [http://www.tu-sofia.bg/index.html Technical University of Sofia]. Our 65 group is divided into two sub-groups. We constitute the second one - 65b . Here are our names:

== Lab 1: Investigating passive resistive circuits by Microlab system. ==

[[Image:resistor-symbols1.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;The Europe and American resistor symbols differ (a scan from [[User:Silviya Karaivanova|Silviya's]] notebook).&lt;/center&gt;]]


=== The resistor as a component ===
 
'''What is resistor?''' It is defined by several parameters:

* Resistance in Ohms (Ω)
* Heat dissipation in Watts (W)
* Manufacturing tolerance (%)

'''How to make a resistor?''' Electricity experimenters in the early 1800's used turns of wire of high resistance composition or compressed carbon granules to make resistances for their experiments.

'''What does resistor do?''' In electronics we use a resistor when we need to reduce the voltage applied to a circuit.

'''How does a resistor work?''' ... [[User:Silviya Karaivanova|Silviya Karaivanova]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Can a single resistor decrease voltage? ===

''(try to explain the phenomenon)'' [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 07:56, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

To decrease a voltage we need at least two resistors. Let's discuss the two possible cases.

R1 = 0. As we know:   

&lt;center&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;= (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; /( R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) )*V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
      
&lt;center&gt;If    R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=0 --&gt;       R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;= 1&lt;/center&gt;

R2 = ∞. ''(explain...)'' [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 12:42, 18 May 2008 (UTC)

So, we can finally conclude that ''one resistor couldn't decrease the voltage''.
  
We know that the resistor converts the current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; into a proportional voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;. So,

V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;=R*I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;  and V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;=R*I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;   --&gt; V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;=V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;

The resistor R acts as a simple voltage-to–current converter.

[[Image:voltage-to-current1.jpg|thumb|380px|left|&lt;center&gt;Voltage-to-current converter (a scan from [[User:Silviya Karaivanova|Silviya's]] notebook)&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:current-to-voltage1.jpg|thumb|380px|right|&lt;center&gt;Current-to-voltage converter (a scan from [[User:Silviya Karaivanova|Silviya's]] notebook)&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building a voltage divider by two resistors ===

[[Image:voltage-to-voltage.jpg|thumb|380px|right|&lt;center&gt;Voltage-to-voltage converter (a scan from [[User:Silviya Karaivanova|Silviya's]] notebook)&lt;/center&gt;]]

Two resistors can be used to set a specific voltage. For example, if two resistors are connected as shown and a voltage of 10 volts is applied to the ends, then if both resistors are of equal value, the voltage at the middle point connection point will be 5 volts. The voltage is divided between the two resistors.

A three-terminal resistive voltage divider is sometimes also called a potentiometer. But what is potentiometer? Since it is a &quot;meter&quot;, what does it measure? [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]])

Basically a potentiometer is used to alter the potential difference in circuits. As we probably all know have so many definitions about the potentiometer. Some of them are:

1.	Potentiometer   is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider.

2.	Potentiometer  is a measuring instrument for measuring direct current electromotive forces 

3.	Potentiometer  is a resistor with three terminals, the third being an adjustable center terminal; used to adjust voltages in radios and TV sets

4.	A device that controls the amount of current that flows through a circuit, such as a volume switch on a radio.       Example: A volume control is usually a potentiometer.

5.	Potentiometer   is a variable resistor. It usually has three terminals: the two end terminals, across which the entire resistance appears, and a third terminal, the &quot;wiper&quot;, which moves to a different spot on the resistor as the shaft is turned. ...

How a variable resistor works ? A variable resistor is a length of resistive material (wire, carbon, etc.) connected to the ends; a sliding connection makes the electrical connection. The resistance between the two connections is determined by the length of resistive material between the two connections. The closer the slider is to the end the lower the resistance is between this end and the slider and v.v.

A typical example is the volume control of audio equipment - there the resistive material is wrapped into an incomplete circle and the slider moves in an arc over the resistive material.

What do we need to carry out a computer-based experiment? First, we need a computer; after that we have only to connect to this computer a few analog-to-digital converters (ADC's) acting as analog inputs and a few digital-to-analog converters (DAC's) acting as analog outputs and our simple computer-based system Microlab is ready! Of course, we need the very voltage divider (or a potentiometer) that consists of at least two resistors. [[User:Silviya Karaivanova|Silviya Karaivanova]]

=== What a current source is ===

[[Image:Ideal_current_source_65b.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;How does a constant current source behave?&lt;/center&gt;]]

We begin our lab with general questions: &quot;What is a current source? What do we want it to do?&quot; How does a current source behave? How do we figure out that some device is a current source? How do we make a current source?&quot; Simply speaking, we have to form a notion about ''constant current source''.

What have you known about the current source from the basic course of electricity? Here is the well-known symbol of a current source (see the picture). How to make a good guess that it is a current source? If I give to you a (black) box with two leads and I say that it is a current source, how do you convince yourselves that it is really a current source? ''Vladimir: It will begin warming...'' Why do you think so? And what will happen, if we connect the two leads (a short circuit - case 1 on the picture)? Is it dangerous for the current source (comparing with a voltage one)? ''Vladimir: Yes, it is... Atanas: No, it isn't...'' Indeed, there is nothing dangerous for a current source, if we short its two leads. As the current source is designed for a given current, it keeps up (limits) the current thus protecting itself.

Then, maybe the opposite condition - an open circuit (case 3 on the picture) - will be dangerous as the current source will try to pass the same current as before. In this situation, the current source is misled: it doesn't see the open circuit; it &quot;thinks&quot; there is something connected there. It just &quot;sees&quot; that no current flows and raises its internal voltage up with the &quot;hope&quot; to pass a current through the harmful &quot;thing&quot;. Of course, the current source does not manage to pass any current through the open circuit and reaches the final (compliance) voltage; a saturation and even a breakdown occurs. Thus, the compliance voltage represents the maximum voltage that the current source can reach when strives to produce the desired current.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Passive current source ===

[[Image:Simplest_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Building the simplest current source (a draft).&lt;/center&gt;]]

''Atanas'' has said that, if we connect a resistor in series to the voltage source there will no problem with the short connection. Well, let's place a resistor; thus we obtain the simplest current source. Choose for concreteness the favorite pretty values for the electrical quantities: V = 10 V and R = 10 kΩ to obtain I = 1 mA.

'''Ideal load.''' First, make a short connection at the output of the circuit. Since there is no voltage drop across the load, all the input voltage V is applied across the resistor R. As a result, the current is exactly as Ohm's law says:

&lt;center&gt;I = V/R = 10 V/10 kΩ = 1 mA&lt;/center&gt;


[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step2 Keeping a constant current by using an ideal current load]&lt;br&gt;
[[Circuit_Idea/Passive_Voltage-to-Current_Converter#Basic_electrical_idea:_Voltage_causes_current|Passive voltage-to-current converter (voltage causes current)]]

[[Image:Passive_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;The load decreases the current (a draft).&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Imperfections.''' What are the problems of this humble circuit? Let's connect a load having some resistance to see what happens. As we can see, a voltage drop appears across the load and the current decreases.

The real load introduces some voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, which affects the excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, not all the input voltage is applied across the current-setting resistor R but only the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, here the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; determines the current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; instead the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the current decreases:

&lt;center&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/R = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/(R +  R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;

This passive circuit is imperfect; it can't stand against the load &quot;intervention&quot; especially, if the load varies. It is a static, fixed, non-adaptable circuit... What do we do then?

=== Dynamic current sources ===

==== Discovering the web ====

What a new idea might arise now? Maybe, we will find out it on the web? Then let's write &quot;current source&quot; in the Google window. No one knows why Google has chosen the [[w:Current_source|Wikipedia page]] about current source from about 2,000,000 pages and put it at the first place. Well, open it to see what the truth about constant current source is. Alas! The page look quite cluttered and all that we can see here are definitions and specific circuit solutions. There is no philosophy; there are no basic ideas shown... For these cases they say, &quot;Can't see the forest for the trees&quot;. Oh, the [[w:Talk:Current_source|discussion]] page is quite more interesting! Even someone has suggested here a new structure of the page - the idea is first to reveal the basic idea and then to show the specific circuit solutions; that was in June, 2006...

==== Basic idea ====

Obviously, we have to reveal the truth by ourselves; let's then begin reasoning. The problem pops up when we connect a load and, what is worse, if we begin varying its resistance. Note the load may be not only a steady or varying resistor; it might be a capacitor that is charging, a diode (ordinary, zener, LED, base-emitter junction, etc.) or even a voltage source (e.g., a rechargeable battery)... It is not so important what exactly the load is; it is only important that a voltage drop appears across the load and this voltage drop confuses things.

If we look around, we can see that most things in this world are changeable, adaptable, dynamic... According to this observation, we have to make our current source react somehow to the load &quot;intervention&quot;, to resist to its attemption to lower the current. That means something inside the current source has to change, in order to compensate the disturbing voltage drop across the load. What can change in this simple electric circuit?

===== Varying (dynamic) internal voltage =====

[[Image:Bootstrapped_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Keeping up a constant current by a dynamic voltage source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

''Vladimir: We might change the voltage...'' Yes, it is the one possible solution. Vladimir suggests, if the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; across the load begins rising, the internal voltage V&lt;sub&gt;VAR&lt;/sub&gt; of the current source to begin rising as well in the same direction with the same rate so that the difference V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; between them to stay constant. This is the first idea: dynamic current source with following internal voltage. Till when will this magic continue? Of course, until V&lt;sub&gt;VAR&lt;/sub&gt; finally reaches the positive supply rail. After that point, our wonderful &quot;voltage-dynamic&quot; current source becomes an ordinary passive one.

Have you heard the legend about [[w:Baron Munchhausen|Baron Munchhausen]] that was using his own boot straps to pull himself out of the sea? Our circuit is just one possible implementation of Munchhausen's [[w:bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]] idea in electronics.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

===== Varying (dynamic) internal resistance =====

[[Image:R_dynamic_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Keeping up a constant current by a dynamic resistor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Do you have another idea? What else can change in this humble circuit when the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; rises and, as a result, the current lowers? ''Atanas: Let's vary the resistance R...'' Great idea! The resistance R is another attribute that can change to keep the current constant.

Actually, we have to make the current source change its internal resistance so that to keep a constant sum R + R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; as a result, the current I = V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt;/(R + R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) will stay constant. Again, till when will this magic continue? If R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; reises, R will lower until it becomes finally zero. After that point, our wonderful &quot;resistance-dynamic&quot; current source becomes an ordinary one.

Since the resistor R has the property to keep up a constant current, they name it ''current-stable resistor''. Let's realize this idea as it is simpler and more obvious than the idea of a dynamic voltage source considered above.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== A transistor acting as a current-stable resistor ====

[[Image:Trans_output_whiteboard1_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;How does the transistor's output part behave?&lt;/center&gt;]]

What electronic component has such a current-stable behavior? ''A student: The operational amplifier...'' No, no, it has to be a simpler element. Remember in this lab cicle we consider diode and transistor circuits; so, it has to be a diode or a transistor. A hint: the one has a behavior of a voltage source (more precisely, of a voltage-stable element); the other has a behavior of a current source (current-stable element). Well, which of the two behaves as a current-stable element? Of course, the transistor...

Well, let's then see why the transistor has such a behavior. You have already studied  a subject about semiconductor elements; so, you have to know how it behaves. Do you have any reminiscence of it? What can a transistor do? ''A student: ...to amplify...'' No, it might sound paradoxical but the transistor does not amplify; it attenuates!?! The only thing that a transistor can do is to change its present resistance thus dissipating a power and, as a result, regulating the current through or the voltage across the load.

Here is an n-p-n transistor connected in series with a load R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and a power supply V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a three-terminal element (a ''triode'') while a diode is a two-terminal element. A triode is too complicated for our reasoning:) so, we break down it into two two-terminal parts: an ''input base-emitter part'' and an ''output collector-emitter part''. Each of them has an IV characteristic; now we are interested in the output characteristic of the collector-emitter part. Why they name it &quot;IV characteristic&quot;? Because we can do two things with it: to apply a voltage across it and to measure the current through it or to pass a current through it and to measure the voltage drop across it. Also, they name this curve ''output characteristic'' because it represents the output transistor's part. How does it look? Let's present the circuit operation graphically.

For this purpose, we have to superimpose two characteristics - one of the source and one of the load. First, let's draw the IV characteristic of the voltage source acting here as a power supply. What is it? It is a vertical line that is shifted with the magnitude of the voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, we have to show the presence of the load by inclining the line to the left according to the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. The resulting curve represents an IV characteristic of a real voltage source having a voltage V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; and an internal resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (they name it &quot;load line&quot;). After, we have to plot the transistor's output characteristic on the same coordinate system. The crossing point is known as an ''operating point''; it represents the present magnitudes of the voltage and the current.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Trans_output_va_1_65b_lab3.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;IV curves (RL varies).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Trans_output_va_2_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;IV curves (both RL and RT vary).&lt;/center&gt;]]

When we vary the load, the load line rotates and the operating point moves horizontally along the transistor's output characteristic. But why? How does it do this magic? What does the transistor actually do to achieve such an effect? Can someone explain? Let's try.

When we lower the load resistance the load line stands up; the transistor does the opposite - it increases its present collector-emitter resistance R&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; (or just R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) so that to keep up a constant total circuit resistance. We may show R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; by another line that begins from the coordinate system origin (the trick is to think of the present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; as an ohmic one). So, this line will rotate around the origin and incline as well.
As a result, the crossing point moves along a new almost horizontal line - the output transistor characteristic. This line is imaginary, unreal, artificial but we can see only this line; it represents the behavior of a current-stable resistor.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

''The text below is written by a [[User:V.konushliev|student]] from this group:''

The BJT transistor as a three-legged creature  looks much like a light switch (2 legs for IN and OUT, and one for the ON/OFF button), and basically that's what it is - a switch. But this one here is like those fancy light switches with a rotating knob or even the more fancy ones - with a metal &quot;touch-plate&quot;, which can be used to set a different light intensity in a continuous range by rotating the knob, or keeping your finger on the metal plate for a short time. But unlike these mechanically controlled switches, the transistor is an electrically controlled one - on this scheme the output collector-emitter(C-E) current is controlled by the input base current or the base voltage, whichever suits us more.

So here comes the simple idea - if we apply a constant base voltage, we will set a constant C-E current. When the C-E voltage increases (e.g. due to decrease in voltage on the load resistor R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;) the C-E resistance will increase too (remember we set the C-E current to constant using a constant base voltage). So what do we get - a dynamic varying resistor which keeps a constant current flow. In short - a ''current-stable resistor''. Which is exactly what we need in order to make a constant current source. 

This behaviour is shown on the '''IV''' diagrams below. They can be explained as a mechanism with the '''I''' line acting as a &quot;fixed rail&quot;, on which the crossing of the two &quot;pivots&quot; - '''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' lines - point '''A''' slides.  As we decrease the load ('''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' that is) point '''A''' slides down the '''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' line, up the '''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' line, and to the right on the '''I''' line. This means that the transistor resistance increases, so the whole resistance of the circuit remains the same, and therefore the current flow remains the same. As we do the opposite - guess what - exactly the opposite things happen ;)

Looks scary at first sight :) But none of the elements involved bites, and everyone has it's role.

In the middle, surrounded by a blue line is the &quot;boss&quot; of the circuit - the varying load resistor '''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'''. It's he who leads the concert, and the whole circuit is built for him - to satisfy his needs and desires for constant current.
The nameless resistor just beneath the boss is his &quot;bodyguard&quot; - just in case someone curious moves the slider of the &quot;boss resistor&quot; to its very end and try to short-circuit the power source through the transistor.

Everything outside the blue line is the BJT current source itself - a whole team of elements working for the &quot;boss&quot;. There's the &quot;hero&quot; of the curciut - the workhorse - the mighty '''bipolar junction transistor (BJT)''', who does all the dirty job (donkey work:) of keeping the constant current. Connected to its base is his &quot;manager&quot; (modern heroes need to have managers), the varying resistor (potentiometer) '''P''', who is basically a varying voltage divider, and by the means of base voltage '''V&lt;sub&gt;b''' &lt;/sub&gt; tells the transistor what to do. In this case - using a constant base voltage the manager tells him to keep the current flow at a constant rate. The &quot;manager&quot; also has a &quot;bodyguard&quot; - '''R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''' keeping the power source safe from short-circuit's caused by someone playing with the potentiometer '''P'''.

Then there are our watchfull eyes - the voltmeter V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, used to keep an eye on the voltage drop on the load resistor (the boss), another voltmeter V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, watching over the voltage drop on the transistor's collector-emitter junction, and an ammeter, which gives us a sneak-peak on the current flow.

Last, but not least - the power source '''V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;''', who brings the whole circuit to life :) -- [[User:V.konushliev|V.konushliev]] ([[User talk:V.konushliev|talk]]) 13:22, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

=== Mounting the circuit on a PCB ===

It was easy so far but now we have to materialize the circuit on a prototyping printed circuit board. Can someone solder? If yes, please! Here are soldering iron and solder. How do we solder? Look at this links: [http://www.aaroncake.net/electronics/solder.htm 1], [http://www.mediacollege.com/misc/solder/ 2]. You may use also various tools...

The transistor is n-p-n type packed in metallic body. The collector is connected to the body; so, you might measure the collector voltage by touching the body. You may supply the circuit by the computer or by an external power supply. What do you prefer? If you use the PC supply, there are two fixed voltages (+12 V and -12 V). Maybe, it is better to use the two varying lab supplies because we might provoke our transistor current source by varying the supply voltage. If you prefer, you might use a single power supply...

[[Image:Students1_65b_lab3.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Mounting the simplest BJT current source on a PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Student1_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Mounting the simplest BJT current source on a PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

For our educational purposes it is preferable to arrange the elements in a similar way to the circuit diagram drawn on the whiteboard. For example, place the negative rail at the bottom and the positive one at the top; drive the transistor from the left and take the output from the right, etc. Now, let's make some photos..

[[Image:Student2_65b_lab3.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Mounting the simplest BJT current source on a PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Simplest_trans_current_source_pcb_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The simplest BJT current source is already mounted on a PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What do we connect as a load? Let's it to be something varying - this 10 kΩ rotating &quot;potentiometer&quot; will suit us. Connect it as a rheostat (a two-terminal varying resistor). By the way, why the slider is connected to the one end? What is the idea of this connection? Also, as it is very likely someone to burn out it, connect a protecting resistor in series with the potentiometer.

How to set the input voltage? How to make a lower voltage by a higher one? Of course, by another potentiometer supplied by the same power supply (here it is connected as a real potentiometer).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Investigating the circuit... ===

In the beginning, we may draw and superimpose the current loops over the circuit diagram. Then, in order to measure the currents and voltages, we have to connect ammeters and voltmeters.

I have an idea for a syncrinised presentation - I will &quot;move&quot; the slider of the input potentiometer on the whiteboard; at the same time, you will move the real slider on the PCB. In the beginning, the input voltage is 0 V; so, no any base current flows. The transistor is &quot;closed&quot;. Increase carefully the input voltage and look at the input transistor characteristic; imagine we walk along it:) At some moment, a current will begin flowing through the base-emitter junction and β times bigger collector current will flows through the load.

What happens, if you go too far? The transistor will saturate. So, we have to stay in the middle where the transistor operates in the active region.

What elements constitute our current source? These are all the elements excluding the very load, of course... Well, now we have to see, if it is a constant current source. How?
We have to disturb, &quot;provoke&quot; it and to observe its reaction to our &quot;intervention&quot;. But let's afford an opportunity to [[User:V.konushliev|Vladimir]] to tell what has happened in the laboratory (he can do it very well). [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 19:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)

''The text below is written by a [[User:V.konushliev|student]] from this group:''

Everything here is based on the simple law of Ohm &lt;math&gt;R=V/I&lt;/math&gt;

==== ...by varying the load resistance RL... ====

[[Image:Multimeters_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Two voltmeters and one ammeter help us to investigate the circuit.&lt;/center&gt;]]

... we observe a change in V1 and V2, but no change in the ammeter. We're happy: the current flow is constant :) How did that happen?

When we increase the load resistance '''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' so does its voltage drop, which can be seen on voltmeter V2 (logically simple - more resistance generates more pressure). As V2 shows an increment, V1 respectively shows a decrement (their sum represents the voltage of the power sourse Vcc). Since we made the transistor act as a current-stable resistor, it &quot;senses&quot; the decrement of the C-E voltage drop and obediently reduces its resistance, so the sum of resistances in the circuit branch remains the same. Therefore the current flow remains the same too.

When we decrease the load resistance, exactly the opposite happens (V2 shows a decrement, V1 shows an increment, the transistor rises its resistance, the sum of resistance remains the same, and so does the current flow).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== ...by varying the supply voltage VCC ====

...we observe the same pleasing facts: no change in the ammeter, although V1 and V2 show changes. We're happy again: the current flow is still constant :)

This time both the voltmeters V1 and V2 showed increments of voltage drops, with the increment of the supply voltage '''Vcc'''. The transistor again &quot;senses&quot; the change in voltage drop and rises its resistance. But if the transistor reacts the same way as in the case above, how does the current remain the same, if there is no change in '''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'''?
The difference comes with the fact, that the &quot;manager&quot; of the transistor tells him to rise it's resistance even more, by applying a larger base-emitter voltage (is it true? [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]]). Of course this is due to the fact, that the &quot;manager&quot;, as a simple voltage divider, divides a larger voltage ('''Vcc'''), and therefore gives a larger result ('''Vbe''').
At the end, the sum resistance of the circuit branch rises enough to compensate the increment in supply voltage '''Vcc''' and keep the current flow the same.

And again, with the opposite input (decrement of '''Vcc''') the opposite phenomena is observed, but the result stays the same - constant current flow. A job well done by the BJT and it's &quot;team&quot; :)

:[[User:V.konushliev|Vladimir]], now I am realizing that I have misled you to some extent in this experiment. The circuit is not as correct as it seems. It would be more consistent, if we have made all the possible to make the input &quot;manager&quot; keep a constant voltage. Here we rely on the constant power supply; so, we shouldn't change its voltage. We should supply the potentiometer by another voltage source or replace the input ''voltage-divider circuit'' by a ''voltage-stabilizing one'' (e.g., by connecting a diode into the lower leg). This would be a prelude to the famous current mirror circuit (see [[Circuit Idea/Group 66b#Lab 3: Trying to create a &quot;diode&quot; current mirror|group 66b]] and [[Circuit Idea/Group 67b#Lab 3: &quot;Inventing&quot; a BJT current mirror|group 67b]]). Please, edit your explanation according to these circumstances.

:[[User:V.konushliev|Vladimir]], I have a suggestion to. Would you contribute the ''Circuit idea'' [[Circuit Idea/Simplest Transistor Current Source|story]] about the simplest transistor constant current source (and not only it)? Your writing style is unique; so, you might tell your lively story in a separate page as a different viewpoint at this famous circuit.

:::Hi [[User:V.konushliev|Vladimir]]! Thank you for your willingness for contribution and giving me the so valuable feedback that I need. Frankly, I was surprised by your insertion since the term has passed over and the most of my students (including you:) are already rated. I know from my experience that, as a rule, students (even the best of them) loose interest in the subject after passing the examination. But obviously you are not one of them:)

:::Your remark sounds intriguing and I am eager to find out what you will send me as a feedback; I can only guess now. As for stories about the &quot;Wikibooks student open project&quot; that you, your colleagues and I, all together, have realized this term, I have started for discussion two [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] stories:

:::*[[Circuit Idea/Joining Students of TU Sofia|Involving Students from Technical University of Sofia in ''Circuit Idea'' Wikibook]] - a concrete teacher's story.

:::As I have already said to you, I intend to present a paper version of the second story at the conference [http://csconf.org/csconf/ COMPUTER SCIENCE' 2008] that will be conducted during 18 - 19 September, 2008 in Kavala, Greece. My idea is simple - to tell how I have managed to make students reason by involving them in Wikibooks. In this connection, I have a suggestion to you.

:::Why don't we (a teacher and a student) write this paper together? I will expose my teacher's viewpoint and you will show your student's viewpoint at the conducted web experiment.

''Tuesday, April 22, 2008, 10.30 h''

=== What is negative feedback? ===

==== Analogies ====

'''Driving:''' keeping up a constant speed, direction, temperature, volume...
More negative feedback analogies: studying, teaching, keeping up a room temperature (body weight, mental equilibrium...) Thermostat control is a very popular example for using the negative feedback. When the temperature reaches certain value the heating (or the cooling) is switched on/off and soon we have again the temperature we want ([[User:Tencho65|Tencho65]]). In all these cases we do all that is possible to realize our goals, to move toward the goal...

[[Image:Lab4_students1_65b_1000.jpg|left|thumb|425px|&lt;center&gt;Starting a discussion about negative feedback phenomenon...&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Nfb_block-diagram_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|325px|&lt;center&gt;...by drawing a block diagram of the simplest negative feedback follower.&lt;/center&gt;]]

==== Structure (block diagram) ====

So, the simplest negative feedback follower consists of only three components: power (energy) source E, regulating element R and a subtractor (-). Negative feedback connects the system output (inverted) with the system input. In response to some  disturbance &quot;attacking&quot; the system, the negative feedback tends to re-establish equilibrium again. We can already draw a pretty block diagram. [[User:Tencho65|Tencho65]]

[[File:Negative feedback follower.jpg|right|thumb|325px|&lt;center&gt;A block diagram of a negative feedback follower.&lt;/center&gt;]]

==== Operation ====

This humble device operates according to a simple algorithm: if X &gt; Y, then increase Y; if X &lt; Y, decrease Y; if X = Y, do nothing. As a result, always X = Y. So, this is an &quot;active copying&quot; principle and this device is an &quot;active follower&quot;. This &quot;algorithm&quot; is so simple that humble devices (tubes, transistors, op-amps...) having no any intellect can perform it.

==== Advantages ====

Why do we make followers in this odd way? What are the advantages of this &quot;negative feedback&quot; approach?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== What is op-amp? ===

How let's say some words about the main component of a negative feedback system - the operational amplifier (op-amp).

[[Image:Op-amp_notion_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;How to drive and supply an op-amp.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Inputs.''' Grounded voltage source... What is ''single-ended input''? Floating voltage source... What is ''differential input''? Why do we need a differential input? Input resistance... Do input currents flow? How does a non-inverting input behave? How does an inverting input behave? Can we use an op-amp with a differential input as an op-amp with single-ended (inverting or non-inverting) input? What do we do in these cases?

'''Output.''' How the op-amp output is made? What is the idea of a complementary, push-pull emitter follower? Output resistance...

'''Supplying.''' The idea of bipolar (split) supply (+12 V and -12 V here)... Why do we need a bipolar supply? Where currents flow? We can imagine the output part of the op-amp consists of two parts - a positive and a negative. Each of them works when its output voltage has the according polarity. By the way, is it possible to supply the op-amp with only one (e.g., positive) voltage and, at the same time, to obtain the opposite (negative) output voltage? And can the op-amp output voltage exceed the supply voltage? Maybe, it would be possible, if there were capacitive or inductive differentiating circuits inside the op-amp... But (for now) an op-amp contains only resistive and active components:(

'''Gain.''' Typical value is A &gt; 200000. It seems too high. Can we manage to utilize all this gain? What is the maximum input voltage to keep the op-amp in the active region (assume 10 V maximum output voltage)? Can we use a bare op-amp as an amplifier? Or we can use it as another useful device having analog inputs and descrete output (write its name here)? We may conclude: If we use the op-amp as an amplifier, the voltage difference between its inputs is zero. But if we use it as a ''comparator'', the input voltage might be whatever.

'''Transfer characteristic.''' Microlab can help us to obtain this curve on the screen. There is no time in this graphical presentation; there is only input and output quantities. We might discern three regions on this curve: negative saturation (large), active region (narrow) and positive saturation (large).

'''Generalization.''' What does the op-amp actually do? A possible answer is: ''an op-amp converts the steady power supply into varying voltage source; it acts as a voltage-controlled voltage source.''

=== Building an op-amp follower (inverter) ===

==== Passive electric follower ====

[[Image:Passive_electric_follower_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A humble wire is the simplest but imperfect voltage &quot;follower&quot;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Now, we have only to convey this powerful idea from real life to electronics. Well, let's begin.

V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; will represent X in our electric follower; accordingly, V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; will represent Y. But let's first persuade ourselves what is the use of building such an active follower instead a &quot;passive&quot; one.

What is the simplest voltage follower? Of course, a piece of wire can act as a humle voltage follower. It works perfectly, if there is no load (there is no current flowing). Only, is it still a follower, if we connect a big load at the end of the wire (especially, if it is a thin and long wire)? And imagine what happens, if the load and wire resistances vary... For example, the wire length can vary...

Another nasty problem of the passive voltage follower is that ''the load consumes energy from the input voltage source''.; so, it droops when loaded.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Op-amp negative feedback inverter ====
What does the parallel inverter do?
First,we use the resistive parallel amplifier.We use this component for comparing  Uin and Uout voltages.It is the system with a negative feedback.There are two resistors wich are used for comparing voltages.
If R1-R2=0 then Uout =Uin,but if R1 is not equal to R2 then the amplifier receives the difference between Vin and Vout on its input.
And also if Vin is PLUS and Vout is MINUS then there is a &quot;virtual ground&quot;.
'''Uout/Uin=-R2/R1'''

===== Building the circuit on the whiteboard =====

[[Image:Op-amp_follower_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;An op-amp follower.&lt;/center&gt;]]

No, the bare wire is not a perfect follower in all the cases; so, it is worth the trouble to build an active negative feedback follower... Let's see how the students from [[Circuit Idea/Group 65a|group 65a]], [[Circuit Idea/Group 66a|66a]] and [[Circuit Idea/Group 67a| 67a]] have build such a follower by using an op-amp with differential input. 

First, we connect a power supply - a voltage source V representing the power source E from the block diagram. We assume a bipolar input voltage; so, we get a bipolar (split) power supply. Then, we connect an op-amp OA acting as the regulating element R. Finally, we need a voltage subtractor to make the op-amp compare its output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. Wh at is the simplest voltage [[Circuit Idea/Series Voltage Summer|subtractor]]? Of course, this is the bare loop (a piece of wire) according to Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). In other words, we have to connect the two voltage sources in series and in opposite directions (+ -, - +) traversing the loop, in order to subtract their voltages. Then, we have to cut the loop and to feed the op-amp input by the voltage difference.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Single-ended_op-amp_lab4_65b.jpg|left|thumb|200|&lt;center&gt;Single-ended op-amp input.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Static_virtual_ground_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 19. If V1 and V2 have opposite polarities, a virtual ground appears.&lt;/center&gt;]]
But here we have a big problem: our op-amp has not a differential input; it has a single-ended input. How do we solve this problem?

It's time to remember the famous [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|Ohm's experiment]] that we have conducted in our laboratory during Lab 2. See at the end of the page where we have invented the so useful [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film#A passive resistive subtractor|parallel voltage summer]] (subtractor). Eureka! We can use it as a subtractor with single-ended inputs in our inverting circuit! Let's do it.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Building_inv_amplifier_whiteboard_65b_1000.jpg|left|thumb|780px|&lt;center&gt;Building an op-amp inverter on the whiteboard (sorry, it looks quite scattered).&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Voltage_follower.JPG|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;If R1=R2, we have an inverter &lt;/center&gt;]]

In practice, we usually connect separate resistors; thus we obtain the classic circuit diagram of the inverting amplifier. We have already known what the transfer ratio is:


&lt;math&gt;\frac{Vout}{Vin}= - \frac{R2}{R1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

===== Investigating the circuit by ''Microlab'' =====

[[Image:PIC_4743.jpg|right|380px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Complete work :)&lt;/center&gt;]]

===== Explaining the circuit operation =====

'''''(please, do it in a human-friendly manner!)'''''

[[Image:Student3_65b_microlab.jpg|right|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Thinking about op-amp behavior...&lt;/center&gt;]]

We are human beings, not computers... It seems strange but, in order to understand what the abstract op-amp really does in this circuit, we have to think of the op-amp as a &quot;slow-thinking&quot; device, not as a fast, non-inertial, instant device... From this human viewpoint, the op-amp compares continuously its output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and changes V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; in the right direction so that to keep almost zero difference V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. It does exactly the same what we, human beings, were doing in all the analogies above.

Where currents flow in this circuit? Draw them with whole loops in the two cases - at a positive and a negative input voltage. Remember: ''a current always arrives at the point from where it has gone''. Another tip: ''in the two cases (at positive and negative input voltage) the load current will flow through different power supplies (accordingly, through the positive and negative voltage sources)''. Imagine also the complementary output emitter follower inside the op-amp: the upper n-p-n transistor will &quot;blows&quot; the output current when the op-amp &quot;wants&quot; to produce a positive voltage and the lower p-n-p transistor will &quot;sucks&quot; the output current when the op-amp &quot;wants&quot; to produce a negative voltage.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Disturbing the negative feedback inverter ===

Let's now make difficult the op-amp's action. How can we disturb it?

Explain here the unique property of all the negative feedback system to overcome various disturbances... See also how the &quot;magicians&quot; from [[Circuit Idea/Group 68b#Lab 4: How to make perfect components by parallel NFB|group 68b]] have made almost ideal components by applying a parallel NFB. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 13:17, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

=== Converting the NFB follower into an amplifier ===

We have already seen how an op-amp overcomes various disturbances. Can we use its reaction to the disturbance as an output? Is this the idea needed to convert the inverter (K = -1) into an amplifier (K &gt; -1)? Have you seen this phenomenon in your day's routine?

== [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|Lab 2]]: Computer-based Ohm's experiment ==

''Tuesday, March 25, 2008, 16.45 h''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:lab2rs2.jpg|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The voltage input is only from the one side of the resistive layer. ([[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]]&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]

[[Image:lab2rs4.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Here two voltage sources are connected into one point. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]]&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]

In this lab exercise we tried to &quot;invent&quot; new analog devices using our knowledges for the famous Ohm's experiment. In order to see the graphics of our &quot;new&quot; devices, we used [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Circuit_Idea Microlab] - PC Apple2 connected to 4 DACs and 4 ADCs. We made a couple of experiments and these are the schemes we were analysing.
First the voltage source is connected only to the one end of the resistor and we measure the potential along the resistive layer(1st picture). Thus we make a linear transference-to-voltage converter.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;
In order to carry out Ohm's experiment, we needed some kind of resistive wire. Our teacher gave us a heater wire, so we start expemimenting with it. When we connected it with conductors, power supply, voltmeter and an ammeter we start measuring it's resistance.We were also using two kinds of voltmeters and ammeters - old-fashioned movement ones and new digital devices.
After our successes in building and connecting the scheme, we were very excited to find it actually worked. 
The images around show our scheme and progress.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

When there are two voltage sources, and both of them are with the same polarity, we have a parallel voltage summer.Here V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/(r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; + r&lt;sub&gt;2/&lt;/sub&gt;(r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt;. 

If we have voltages with different polarity and V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; are selected so that V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;=0 (point known as &quot;virtual ground&quot;) we have a comparing device,like in the scheme in the third picture:V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; = -(r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).To keep V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 we can use operational amplifier(down).Here I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=(V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;=-R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Introduction ===

This Tuesday, three student groups in all are carrying out experiments in this laboratory dedicated to transistor circuits producing constant current. First, your colleagues from [[Circuit Idea/Group 65b#Lab 3: Transistor circuits (building the simplest transistor current source)|Group 65b]] were building and investigating the simplest transistor current source. The students from the next [[Circuit Idea/Group 66b#Lab 3: Transistor circuits (trying to create a &quot;diode&quot; current mirror)|Group 66b]] continued their work trying to transform the simplest transistor current source into a BJT current mirror circuit. But they did not manage to do it since an accident happened at the end of the lab - the main transistor began to smoke and they had to find out why. The honor fell to your Group 67b to finish their work...

=== What the transistor is ===

[[Image:Current_mirror_trans_diode_whiteboard_66b.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;The transistor smokes; there is something wrong in this connection...&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Trans_output_whiteboard1_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;What does a transistor actually do?&lt;/center&gt;]]

We have to clarify some philosophical questions in the beginning of this lab. What is a transistor? What does it do? What notion do you have about the transistor? Is it a supernatural and &quot;divine&quot; device as they frequently present it and, for this purpose, they veil it by sophisticated equations and analyses? Or it is something simple, clear and intuitive that everyone (even a child) can understand?

''A student: A transistor consists of two n-p junctions...'' But there are transistors without junctions (e.g., a MOS transistor does not contain junctions in the input part). Let's say it in a more general way. ''Another student: The transistor can amplify...'' But what does this  mean? ''The student: If we apply an input signal, a large signal appears at the output.'' But this is impossible; there is no amplification in nature. We cannot amplify energy. I would like to say more precise that there is not amplification. We cannot obtain more energy from less energy; it is just impossible.

Then what does a transistor actually do? Well, look at the last picture (on the left) of your colleagues from the previous [[Circuit Idea/Group 66b#A problem appears: the transistor smokes!|Group 66b]]. As you can see, we have drawn arrows going out of the transistor. They represent the heat that the transistor was dissipating since they were made a short connection in the collector circuit. So, I ask you again, &quot;What does the transistor do? As you can see, we have broken the three-terminal transistor into two 2-terminal devices and now we discuss the one of them - the output collector-emitter &quot;device&quot;. Here is this &quot;device&quot;, I have held it. It has two leads and it is connected by these two leads in an electrical circuit... I ask you again, &quot;What does it do in this circuit?&quot;, &quot;What does the transistor do with its output part?&quot;

''A student: The transistor behaves as a resistor.'' Yes, it is exactly what I would like to hear - &quot;resistor&quot; in a broad sense of this word. Excepting the most popular sources, they usually do not explain the transistor in this manner; they refrain from giving such intuitive explanations (maybe, because a transistor behaves as a non-linear instead as an ohmic resistor). But yet, this is the simplest and the most powerful viewpoint at the transistor. So, if someone ask you what a transistor do or can do you can answer: the only thing that a transistor can do is to &quot;insert&quot; a resistance in the circuit where it is connected, to dissipate power, to throw out it in the space and, in this way, to impede the current, to regulate the load voltage, current and power. A transistor does not do anything else than this varying resistor (a rheostat) in front of us does. Of course, there is also a capacitance and an inductance but they are parasitic and negligible.

What are the differences between the transistor and the humble rheostat? First, a transistor is an electrically controlled resistor while the rheostat is a mechanically controlled one. There are also light-controlled resistors - photoresistors, sound-controlled resistors - carbon microphones, temperature-controlled resistors - thermoresistors, etc.) For example, connect this photoresistor to an ohmmeter and light up or shade it; thus you can measure the minimum (4 kΩ) and maximum (300 kΩ) resistance of this light-controlled resistor. In the same way we control the resistance of a transistor, only electrically.

Second, as we have mentioned above, the transistor is a non-linear current-stable resistor while the rheostat is an ohmic one. When they say &quot;resistor&quot; we implicitly understand &quot;ohmic resistor&quot;; so, the transistor is a resistor in a broad sense of the word. Well, let's draw the two kinds of characteristics. When we vary the resistance of an ohmic resistor, its IV characteristic inclines; when we vary the base-emitter voltage of a BJ transistor, its output characteristic moves vertically remaining parallel to itself.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== A transistor acting as a current-stable resistor ====

Our final purpose is to create a current source controlled by another current. So, we have to understand how a transistor can keep up a constant current. We were considering this topic more consistently with your colleagues from [[Circuit Idea/Group 65b#Lab 3: Transistor circuits (building the simplest transistor current source)|group 65b]] a few hours ago. We began solving the problem &quot;producing a constant current&quot; by creating the [[Circuit Idea/Group 65b#Passive current source|simplest passive current source]] (a voltage source and a resistor connected in series). Then we ascertained how imperfect it is (if the load varies, the current varies as well).
So, we began reasoning how to make a perfect constant current source. We remembered how they have solved this problem in electricity - by increasing the voltage and the resistance up to infinity so that to suppress the load influence. Only, we noted that this approach is imperfect since the resistor dissipated plenty of energy. Then, we moved in the area of electronics where this problem is solved more cleverly. Can you guess what the idea was?

Well, you have a circuit consisting of three connected in series elements: a voltage source, a current-setting resistor R and a load with varying resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. As the load resistance varies, what do we have to do, in order to keep up a constant current? What is the clever idea? ''A student: ...transistor, op-amp...'' Maybe, but these are very concrete solutions; we are still at &quot;idea&quot; level. ''Another student: ...feedback...'' But we do not still know what a feedback is.

[[Image:Trans_output_va_1_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;IV curves (RL varies).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Trans_output_va_2_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;IV curves (both RL and RT vary).&lt;/center&gt;]]

Let's continue reasoning in human friendly manner... For example, if the load resistance increases and, as a result, the current lowers, what do we do to restore the current? ''Students: ...we have to lower the current-setting resistor R!'' And vice versa, if R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; decreases... ''Students: ...we have to increase R!'' It turns out a strange resistor stays at this place that have the unique property to change its resistance depending on the current flowing through it. The resistor R is not an ordinary &quot;static&quot; resistor; it is a kind of varying, ''dynamic'' resistor. It is still ''ohmic'' but ''varying ohmic'' resistor. They name such odd elements ''current-stable'' resistors.

We can see this ''dynamization'' idea everywhere in our human routine. Some people have a &quot;static&quot; behavior; they do not react to various interventions. Other people are more flexible, adaptable, dynamic; they win.

We begin looking for such an element. In electricity, a bulb has a similar behavior (there were so called barretters - thermistors having positive temperature coefficient of resistivity). In electronics, we find out that transistors (both BJT and FET) have such a behavior. See the picture where your colleagues have visualized how the transistor behaves. What is the idea of such a grapnical presentation? They have presented the output part of the circuit as two 2-terminal elements connected to each other - a real source and a load (according to the Thevenin's model, we can present every circuit in this manner). The real source is a compound one; it consists of two 2-terminal elements - an ideal voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; having a vertical IV characteristic and an internal resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; having an IV characteristic that is inclined to the right and begins from the coordinate origin. The difference between the two characteristics represents the effective IV characteristic of the compound real source. As you can see, it is shifted to the right by the magnitude of V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; and it is inclined to the left according to R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. It might seem strange but in this presentation the transistor plays the role of a load while R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; plays the role of an internal source resistance?!? Do you agree to this viewpoint?

As you can see, the output transistor characteristic is similar to the characteristic of a constant current source. The crossing point of the two characteristics is named ''operating point''; it represents the present voltage across and the current flowing through the two elements.

===== Varying the load resistance =====

Let's now begin reasoning what happens when we begin varying R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. If we decrease it, the source curve rises and v.v., if we increase the resistance, the source curve lies down. And, as they usually say in classical electronics courses, since the transistor's output characteristic is almost horizontal the operating point moves almost horizontally along it; the current variations are insignificant. This explanation works of a sort but we would like to know how the transistor actually does this magic; how its output characteristic is obtained. But nobody answers these questions...

See the second picture on the right above. What is shown there? We can see another line beginning from the coordinate origin. What is this line? What does it represent? As you probably quess it represents the present ohmic transistor's resistance. Remember how we presented the transistor above - as a varying resistor having a present ohmic resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. And if you begin decreasing R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, this &quot;resistor&quot; begins increasing its resistance and v.v. So, it behaves as a varying ohmic resistor. It is not a static but a dynamic, a self-changing resistor and it does it in such a way so that the crossing (operating) point moves along an almost horizontal line - the output characteristic. This line represents the trajectory of the operating point; it is an unreal, an imaginary, an artificial curve. Only the two crossing lines are real.

This explanation was an attempt to explain what a dynamic (non-linear) resistor is. So, let's draw a conclusion: a dynamic (non-linear) resistor is actually a &quot;self-varying&quot; ohmic resistor. The current flowing through it or the voltage across it changes its present resistance.

Other elements (e.g., diodes) have the opposite characteristic. When we vary R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, such an element would change its present resistance in the same direction so that to keep a constant voltage. So, they behave as ''voltage-stable elements''.

===== Varying the supply voltage =====

According to the explanations above, if we begin varying the supply voltage, the current would stay constant: if we increase the voltage, the transistor will increase its present resistance so that the ratio I = V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; to stay constant as well and v.v. But it does not stay constant. Why? What is wrong in this arrangement? ''A student: ...the input voltage varies as well...'' Yes, that is right. Your colleague feels the things very well... Obviously, the problem is that we have taken the input (reference) voltage from the same voltage source instead from a separate one. This is incorrect and the result is obvious: when we vary the supply voltage, the &quot;reference&quot; voltage varies as well.

It turns out that in practice, there is no separate source or, what occurs more frequently, we prefer to use a common source (for example, a car has only one battery supplying a lot of electric and electronic devices). Obviously, we have to arrange things so that when the supply voltage varies, the input (reference) base-emitter voltage does not change.

==== Building the simplest transistor current source ====

Look at the picture below to see how we began solving this problem with your colleagues from [[Circuit Idea/Group 66b#Lab 3: Transistor circuits (trying to create a &quot;diode&quot; current mirror)|Group 66b]]. What is the problem? What do we want to keep constant? We want to keep up a steady base-emitter voltage even if the supply voltage varies because the horizontal output BJT characteristic is at given base-emitter voltage. So far, a voltage divider produces this voltage; but a voltage divider is a proportional device. Then, what kind of device do we need?

[[Image:Simplest_trans_current_source_whiteboard2_65b_lab3.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Setting the input current by a voltage divider (on the whiteboard).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Simplest_trans_current_source_pcb_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Mounting and investigating the cirrent mirror circuit on a prototyping printed circuit board (PCB).&lt;/center&gt;]]

Looking at a new circuit we discern more familiar &quot;sub-devices&quot;; here, we identify the well-known voltage divider. Only, we want to make it does not change its output voltage when its input voltage varyes. In other words, we have solved the problem ''keeping up a steady current''; now, we have to solve the problem ''keeping up a steady voltage''. Let's generalize these thoughts.

The simplest transistor current source exploits the inherent ability of the transistor to stabilize the current when the base-emitter voltage is fixed. What do we need to build the simplest transistor current source according to this idea? First, we have to set a constant voltage to the base-emitter junction; so, we need a constant voltage source. Your colleagues from [[Circuit Idea/Group 65b#Lab 3: Transistor circuits (building the simplest transistor current source)|group 65b]] have made it by a voltage divider. Note that there is also a protecting resistor (3.9 kΩ) connected in series with the potentiometer; it limits the base current (up to 3 mA) in a case when someone moves the slider to the end of the rheostat. This humble resistive circuit allows us to set some input voltage and, in this way, to move the output characteristic to a given position. Thus we make the transistor pass the desired current through the load and keep it constant according to the explanations above. The transistor opposes to our intervention by changing its present resistance, by a dynamic resistance connected in series to the load. The total resistance and the supply voltage stay constant; as a result, the current stays constant as well. In this way, in electronics we are smart enough to make perfect current sources.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== A true diode sets the input current ===

So, we need a ''voltage-stable element'', we need a '''''diode''''' to obtain the needed voltage drop. How do we connect it? ''A student: it has to be forward-biased...'' Before we had to adjust the voltage; now it is axactly as much as we need. More precisely speaking, we will adjust it by changing the current flowing through it; this voltage will vary slightly when we change the current significantly.

[[Image:Current_mirror_diode_student1_66b.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Trying to add a true diode in the current-setting part...&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Current_mirror_diode_student2_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Adding correctly a true diode in the current-setting part.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

Your colleagues from [[Circuit Idea/Group 66b#Lab 3: Transistor circuits (trying to create a &quot;diode&quot; current mirror)|Group 66b]] have found the same solution in Tony Kuphaldt's page about [http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_3/chpt_4/12.html current mirrors].

=== A base-emitter transistor &quot;diode&quot; sets the input current ===

==== Replacing the true diode by a base-emitter transistor junction ====

[[Image:Current_mirror_trans_diode_student3_66b.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Setting the input current by a base-emitter transistor &quot;diode&quot;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Current_mirror_trans_diode_pcb_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The circuit mounted on the PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]


But we need not only an output current; we need a ''mirror output current'' whose magnitude is equal to the input current. Thinking about the problem we realize the two elements have to have identical characteristics. As soon as the input behaves as a p-n junction don't we use another p-n junction to set the voltage? For this purpose, we may use the base-emitter junction of another transistor as such an element. As in the &quot;diode&quot; case above, there isn't need to adjust the reference voltages as we had to do that in the case of voltage divider. The technology of integrated circuit manufacturing allows to make the two elements absolutely identical.

So, the better solution is to connect the base-emitter junction of an identical transistor (leaving the collector no connected).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== A problem appears ====

[[Image:Current_mirror_trans_diode_whiteboard_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;But there is something wrong in this solution...&lt;/center&gt;]]

Only, a problem appears - the output transistor is saturated! Why? Let's see again the Tony Kuphaldt's page about [http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_3/chpt_4/12.html current mirrors] and try to find the answer of this question. Tony claims that the output current flowing through the load is equal to the input current flowing through the diode: ''&quot;Current through resistor Rload is therefore a function of current set by the bias resistor, the two being nearly equal.&quot;'' He think the two output currents are equal because the two input base-emitter voltages are equal. But is it true? We have to prove this ascertion here...

What do you think, are the two currents equal? Obviously, the input voltages are equal as the two base-emitter junctions are connected in parallel. But does it mean the two output currents are equal? We can find out the current-setting diode diverts only &quot;one&quot; base current Ib = V/2Rbias and the corresponding collector current of T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is β/2 times bigger - Ic = I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = β.V/2Rbias.

We can conclude that the &quot;diode&quot; current mirror acts as a current amplifier (I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;) but not as a true current mirror (I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;)!

Now let's remember the beginning of our exercise and clarify the role of the potentiometer by reazoning as follows. Imagine we connect two identical resistors - a base resistor Rb and a load resistor R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Rb. As a result we get a current amplifier (Ic = βIb) instead the desired current mirror (Ic = Ib). Then, let's connect a second resistor (actually, a potentiometer) in parallel to the base-emitter junction to divert the excessive current from the base to the ground. 

Well, let's continue developing the current mirror circuit...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== A negative feedback transistor &quot;diode&quot; sets the input current ===

Thus we arrive at the powerful idea to connect the non-used collector to the transistor bases with the purpose to divert the excessive base current to the ground.

==== Drawing the diagram on the whiteboard ====

[[Image:Current_mirror_67b_whiteboard.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Setting the input current by a negative feedback transistor &quot;diode&quot;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

In this way, we have revealed the role of the input current-setting transistor T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; it take away the great amount -- (1 + β)Ib -- from the input current and leaves only the small Ib for the output transistor T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the input and the output currents are almost identical.

Eureka! We have &quot;invented&quot; the famous but never explained circuit of BJT current mirror! We have even disprove a widespread misconception about the simple BJT current mirror - the possibility to set the input current by a forward-biased diode or a base-emitter junction! 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Lab 4: Endowing circuits with memory ==

''Tuesday, April 22, 2008, 16.45 h''

In this exercise we are going to reinvent legendary circuits - flip-flops. First, we will reveal the general idea of memorizing; then, we will build an RS flip-flop by using NPN transistors and an op-amp flip-flop. In order to do this, we need to know what flip-flops can be used for and how we want our &quot;invention&quot; to work. I am sure that every student at the Technical University is familiar with these devices but since this book is meant to explain the idea of electronics to everyone who is interested I will provide some general information on the subject.

=== What a flip-flop is (a conventional viewpoint) ===

[[Image:RS_FF.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt; RS Flip Flop block&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]

Flip-flops (FFs) are devices used in the digital field for a variety of purposes. When properly connected, flip-flops may be used to store data temporarily, to multiply or divide, to count operations, or to receive and transfer information. Every FF has two to five inputs depending on its type. What is common for all types of FFs is that they have two distinct outputs usually marked Q and /Q. They can either have a &quot;0&quot; state or &quot;1&quot; state and should always be complementary. This means that if the state of Q is &quot;1&quot; the /Q's state is &quot;0&quot; and vice versa.
The RS flip-flop in particular is used to temporarily hold or store information until it is needed. A single RS FF will store one binary digit, either a 1 or a 0. It has two standard inputs - R, which stands for &quot;reset&quot; and sets the Q output in &quot;0&quot;, and S, which stands for &quot;set&quot; and sets the Q output in &quot;1&quot; ([[User:Raya Yunakova|Raya Yunakova]], 67).

We can see on the picture above the inputs and the outputs but we are not able to understand how the flip-flop actually works. Our main goal in this exercise is to reveal what's in that &quot;black box&quot;. Basically RS flip-flop is the simplest practical memory device based on NOR gates connected in a feedback configuration. Anyone in TU knows the truth table of that flip-flop so we are not going to bore you with that stuff. The general question is: How to make something &quot;remember&quot;, &quot;memorize&quot;? If we find that answer, then we will know the exact mechanism of creating any kinds of flip-flops.(Reneta Stoycheva and Sofiya Shtarbova)

=== How do we make devices memorize? ===

==== The basic idea behind memorizing: positive feedback ====

Describe here situations (analogies) derived from our human daily routine where someone (something) having no memory begins memorizing. Examples: a dog bitten its tail:), an enraged man working himself into a fury:), a snow avalanche, etc. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 16:14, 18 May 2008 (UTC)

=== A transistor flip-flop ===

=== Building a transistor switch === 

[[Image:Transitor1.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Initial idea...&lt;/center&gt;|380px]]

Here is where we start. We have a bipolar junction transistor, whose emitter is common to both the input and the output. The input is controlled by the transistor's base and its collector serves as the output. We control the input with the button marked with *. When the button is pressed the input circuit is closed and the transistor is active. When the button is not pressed the transistor is inactive and we can not get any output signal.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Making the transistor switch memorize ===

[[Image:snimka7.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt; &lt;/center&gt;|380px]]

'''Structure.''' This is the normal working routine of a BJT. In our case however, this is not good enough since our goal is to &quot;invent&quot; a device which doesn't change its state when there is no input. But how? It is obvious that we need to add something to our circuit that will keep influencing the input (base) of the transistor. What if we get a second transistor and connect it to the first one like this?

The first transistor's output is connected to the second transistor's input (its base) whose output is connected to the first one's input. The collectors of both elements are connected to a constant voltage source through resistors. The emitters are grounded. ([[User:Raya Yunakova|Raya Yunakova]], 67)

'''Operation.''' How does our circuit operate? When we put the circuit into operation the transistor on the left is inactive. However, current which is high enough to activate the transistor on the right flows through resistor Rc1 (remember we've connected a voltage source). Its emitter-base junction is forward biased and therefore we have output which is equal to the ground potential. This output influences the first transistor's input but it is not high enough to activate the first element. We continue to have a logical &quot;1&quot; on its output which keeps the situation in our circuit exactly the same as it was before. And wasn't that what we wanted to happen in the first place?

It seems that we have completed our goal and we have made the transistor &quot;remember&quot;! Using this approach we can create almost any kind of memory device to serve our purposes. We have actually implemented a mechanism called &quot;positive feedback&quot;. It is largely used in electronics to change the parameters of an amplifier like voltage gain, input and output impedance, stability and bandwidth.([[User:Raya Yunakova|Raya Yunakova]], 67)

{{Answer |

&lt;math&gt; \rho  = 200/250 = 0.8 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Part (A) '''

What is the probability that it is half-full, empty, full?

Half-full

&lt;math&gt;
P(n) = \frac{{\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}{{1 - \rho ^{N + 1} }}\left( \rho  \right)^n  \to P(20) = \frac{{\left( {1 - 0.8} \right)}}{{1 - 0.8^{40 + 1} }}\left( {0.8} \right)^{20}  = 0.0023
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Empty

&lt;math&gt;
P(n) = \frac{{\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}{{1 - \rho ^{N + 1} }}\left( \rho  \right)^n  \to P(0) = \frac{{\left( {1 - 0.8} \right)}}{{1 - 0.8^{40 + 1} }}\left( {0.8} \right)^0  = 0.20
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Full

&lt;math&gt;
P(n) = \frac{{\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}{{1 - \rho ^{N + 1} }}\left( \rho  \right)^n  \to P(40) = \frac{{\left( {1 - 0.8} \right)}}{{1 - 0.8^{40 + 1} }}\left( {0.8} \right)^{40}  = 2.65*10^{ - 5} 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Part (B) '''

How many cars do we expect on the ramp?

&lt;math&gt;
 E(n) = \frac{{\left( \rho  \right)}}{{\left( {1 - \rho } \right)^{} }}\frac{{1 - \left( {N + 1} \right)\left( \rho  \right)^N  + N\rho ^{N + 1} }}{{1 - \rho ^{N + 1} }}   = \frac{{\left( {0.8} \right)}}{{\left( {1 - 0.8} \right)^{} }}\frac{{1 - \left( {40 + 1} \right)\left( {0.8} \right)^{40}  + 40\left( {0.8} \right)^{40 + 1} }}{{1 - \left( {0.8} \right)^{40 + 1} }} = 4

P(n) = \frac{{\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}{{1 - \rho ^{N + 1} }}\left( \rho  \right)^n  = \frac{{\left( {1 - 0.75} \right)}}{{1 - 0.75^{16} }}\left( {0.75} \right)^5  = 0.06 = 6\% 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Part B '''

Percent of time ramp is full (i.e. 15 cars), 

&lt;math&gt;
P(n) = \frac{{\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}{{1 - \rho ^{N + 1} }}\left( \rho  \right)^n  = \frac{{\left( {1 - 0.75} \right)}}{{1 - 0.75^{16} }}\left( {0.75} \right)^{15}  = 0.0033 = 0.33\% 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Part C '''

Expected number of vehicles on ramp in peak hour.

&lt;math&gt;
E(n) = \frac{{\left( \rho  \right)}}{{\left( {1 - \rho } \right)^{} }}\frac{{1 - \left( {N + 1} \right)\left( \rho  \right)^N  + N\rho ^{N + 1} }}{{1 - \rho ^{N + 1} }} = \frac{{\left( {0.75} \right)}}{{\left( {1 - 0.75} \right)^{} }}\frac{{1 - \left( {15 + 1} \right)\left( \rho  \right)^{15}  + 15\rho ^{16} }}{{1 - \rho ^{16} }} = 2.81 \approx 3
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Conclusion, ramp is large enough to hold most queues, though 12 seconds an hour, there will be some ramp spillover. It is a policy question as to whether that is acceptable.

==Introduction to Protein Aggregation==

Protein Aggregation has become a topic of growing interest in recent years, especially in pharmaceutical research. Protein aggregation is often encountered during late research stages or manufacturing of biopharma. The presence of aggregates often leads to an immune response to reject the product, and can sometimes interfere with the body’s vital functions. Aggregation causes several serious diseases such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease Alzheimer’s] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2 Type II Diabetes] &lt;ref name=&quot;dubay&quot;&gt; &quot;Prediction of the absolute aggregation rates of amyloidogenic polypeptide chains.&quot; Dubay, K. F., Pawar, A. P., Chiti, F., Zurdo, J., Dobson, C. M., &amp; Vendruscolo, M. (2004). J. Mol. Biol. 341, 1317-1326. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15302561?ordinalpos=2&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;. Antibodies or other small molecules that are developed for research can sometimes aggregate when over-expressed costing companies’ time and money. Many companies are taking advantage of bioinformatics techniques to predict aggregation. Such approaches are just predictions, but are still very useful for analyses during research and development.

==What is Aggregation?==

===Aggregation and Amyloid Fibrils===

Protein aggregation can be described as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril fibrilization] or formation of insoluble structures from completely or partially unfolded [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptides peptides] &lt;ref name=&quot;thirumalai&quot;&gt;&quot;Emerging ideas on the molecular basis of protein and peptide aggregation.&quot; Thirumalai, D., Klimov, D. K., &amp; Dima, R. I. (2003). Current Opinion in Structural Biology. 13, 146-159. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=search&amp;term=Thirumalai%20Klimov%20Dima Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;. A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptides peptide] can bind to itself or to other proteins in the cell in an unnatural way. This often occurs when proteins are over-expressed. There is more than one type of protein aggregation; however the best-studied type is amyloid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril fibrilization]. Amyloid fibrils are primarily composed of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_sheets beta sheets] and the main chain dominates the protein’s structure. These [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril fibrils] are highly organized structures stabilized by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bonds hydrogen bonds] &lt;ref name=&quot;dobson1&quot;&gt;&quot;Experimental investigation of protein folding and misfolding.&quot; Dobson, C. M. (2004). Methods.  34, 4-14. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15283911?ordinalpos=6&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;. Amyloid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril fibrils] are usually 10nm in diameter and consist of approximately 2-6 “protofibrils” twisted around one another. Protofibrils are the precursors to amyloid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril fibrils] and are the most toxic to the cell. The protofibrils are made up of a cross-beta structure. In a cross-beta structure, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_sheets beta sheets] are assembled from beta strands that run perpendicular to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril fibrils]. An image of an amyloid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril fibrils] is shown in Figure 1 &lt;ref name=&quot;glab&quot;&gt;[http://thglab.lbl.gov/ thglab.lbl.gov] Accessed 27 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

''Figure 1: Small Amyloid Fibril''
 
[[Image:SmallAmyloidFibril.PNG|thumb|500px|center|''Figure 1'' - Figure 1 shows an amyloid fibril. It can be seen that the fibril is composed of 2 protofibrils twisted around one another. The protofibrils are composed of the cross-beta structure with the beta sheets running perpendicular to the fibril.]]


The native state of a protein that yields proper function is usually the most energetically favorable form of the protein at environmental conditions. Protein aggregation occurs when inter-chain contacts with other parts of that protein or other proteins. Because of this, these aggregates are thought to be as energetically favorable or more energetically favorable than the native state. There are several diseases linked to protein aggregation.  This discussion will examine [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease Alzheimer's disease] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin Transthyretin] related diseases &lt;ref name=&quot;glab&quot;/&gt;.

===Different Types of Aggregates===

Many different types of aggregation can occur. They are classified based on types of interactions and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility solubility]. Soluble aggregates are invisible particles and cannot be removed with a filter. Insoluble aggregates can be removed by filtration and are often visible to the human eye. Both types of aggregates cause problems in biopharma development. Covalent aggregates arise from the formation of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bonds covalent bond] between multiple monomers of a given [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide peptide]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide_bonds Disulfide bond] formation of free [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiols thiols] is a common mechanism for covalent aggregation. Oxidation of tyrosine residues can lead to formation of bityrosine which often results in aggregation. Reversible protein aggregation typically results from weaker protein interactions. The reversibility of this type of aggregation can change when environmental factors such as protein concentration, salt concentration, or pH are varied &lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;&gt;[http://www.aapsj.org/view.asp?art=aapsj080366 Protein Aggregation and Bioprocessing] Accessed 21 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Advancements in Understanding of Protein Folding===

In order for us to understand protein aggregation, we need to understand more about protein folding in general. It would not be feasible to understand and account for all factors involved in aggregation when developing a prediction tool. However, the more that is understood about such factors, the better a prediction model may be. Advances have been made in understanding the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding protein folding] process. These advances can help us to understand how the process &quot;goes wrong&quot; and results in aggregation. Figure 2 shows an image of an unfolded peptide chain and its corresponding native folded state [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide peptide].

''Figure 2: Protein Folding'' 

[[Image:Protein folding.png|thumb|400px|center|''Figure 2'' - Figure 2 shows an unfolded polypeptide and its transition to a fully folded peptide &lt;ref name=&quot;pfold&quot;&gt;“Protein Folding.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Protein_folding.png Accessed 2 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;.]]

The general folding process of a protein can be described as a “stochastic search” for the native state &lt;ref name=&quot;dobson1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dobson2&quot;&gt;&quot;Principles of protein folding, misfolding and aggregation.&quot; Dobson, C. M. (2004). Seminars in Cell &amp; Developmental Biology. 15, 3-16.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15036202?ordinalpos=10&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;. The native state is usually a stable, low energy conformation. More specifically, smaller proteins fold by a nucleation-condensation mechanism, and larger proteins fold in modules or smaller parts &lt;ref name=&quot;dobson2&quot;/&gt;. Nucleation-condensation is the formation of a folding nucleus, about which the rest of the structure condenses or collapses. As more is understood about the folding process, the less need there will be for prediction models such as these. However, in the mean time such models can be created to increase the understanding of aggregation and perhaps protein folding in general.

===Factors Affecting Aggregation===

It has been suggested that a few general principles or protein characteristics may govern aggregation and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril fibrilization] &lt;ref name=&quot;dobson2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thirumalai&quot;/&gt;. Although it has been shown that any generic protein under suitable external conditions has the ability to form aggregates resembling amyloid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril fibrils], aggregation depends on characteristics of the sequence as well. Aside from external conditions such as temperature and characteristics of the sequence itself, characteristics of peptide monomers may not give insight into the aggregation propensity of their polymer versions because interpeptide chain interactions may cause conformational changes &lt;ref name=&quot;thirumalai&quot;/&gt;. Regardless of all factors involved, much is known about what factors can be utilized to predict aggregation. Known intrinsic properties that can effect aggregation include [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_%28physics%29 charge], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic hydrophobicity], hydrophobic/hydrophilic patterns, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure secondary structure] propensities.  

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic Hydrophobic] surfaces that become exposed upon [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denaturation_%28biochemistry%29 denaturation] are highly vulnerable to promiscuous interactions that can lead to protein aggregation. These surfaces act as &quot;sticky&quot; spots and try to interact with whatever they can. High [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix helix] secondary structure propensities significantly decrease the probability of aggregation, whereas high [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_sheets beta sheet] propensities significantly increase aggregation. Charged residues have also been shown to decrease aggregation.  Extrinsic factors such as ionic strength, temperature, pH, protein concentration, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_proteins chaperones], quality control, and pressure have been shown to have an effect of aggregation &lt;ref name=&quot;dubay&quot;/&gt;. The presence of some ligands and ions, can increase aggregation. Stress applied to the protein can result in denaturation which can lead to subsequent aggregation. Some of these stresses include freezing, exposure to air, or interactions with metal surfaces – many of which are involved in development of biopharma. Because of the involvement of these stresses in drug development, the more we understand aggregation, the better control we have in drug development. Physicochemical properties such as polar or non-polar [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessible_surface_area accessible surface areas], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_dipole_moment dipole moment], and aromatic residues are also important &lt;ref name = &quot;tart1&quot;&gt;&quot;The role of aromaticity, exposed surface, and dipole moment in determining protein aggregation rates&quot; Tartaglia, G. G., Cavalli, A., Pellarin, R., &amp; Caflisch, A. (2004). Protein Sci. 13, 1939-1941. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=15169952 Full Text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;tart2&quot;&gt;Tartaglia, G. G., Cavalli, A., Pellarin, R., &amp; Caflisch, A. (2004). Protein Sci. 14, 2723-2734.&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been shown that inward pointing charged residues and fewer dangling [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bonds hydrogen bonds] will decrease the amount of protein aggregation &lt;ref name=&quot;thirumalai&quot;/&gt;. Utilizing all of this knowledge, we can determine how likely a given protein is to aggregate. These factors can, and have been utilized to predict protein aggregation. 

When a protein is being expressed, drastic increases in protein concentration can lead to intracellular aggregation. This is either due to interactions of unfolded protein molecules or poor recognition of the nascent chain by molecular [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_proteins chaperones].

Of course, there is still the problem of the natural means by which an organism prevents aggregation. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_proteins Chaperones] proteins assist in the folding of proteins. Gatekeeper residues may also help prevent aggregation &lt;ref name=&quot;dubay&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dobson1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dobson2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thirumalai&quot;/&gt;. Extrinsic factors such as these are nearly impossible to utilize when creating a prediction model.

===Aggregation-Related Diseases===

====Alzheimer’s Disease====
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease Alzheimer's disease] is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegenerative_disease neurodegenerative disease] caused by the aggregation of the beta-amyloid peptide. Beta–amyloid peptide is prone to aggregation in the human body as well as in experimental conditions. The native state of this peptide is relatively unstable leading to aggregation. Aggregation of this peptide in the brain leads to the formation of aggregate plaques. Figure 3 shows these plaques in the cerebral cortex of an Alzheimer’s patient. 

''Figure 3: Beta-amyloid Plaques''
 
[[Image:Alzheimer dementia (3) presenile onset.jpg|thumb|500px|center|''Figure 3'' - Figure 3 shows Beta-amyloid plaques in the cerebral cortex of a patient with Alzheimer’s Disease. &lt;ref name=&quot;alz&quot;&gt;“Alzheimer’s Disease.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease Accessed 2 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Beta-amyloid monomers are thought to form a hexagonal arrangement, and then proceed to form amyloid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril fibrils]. The exact structure of the intermediate steps has not been determined &lt;ref name=&quot;glab&quot;/&gt;.

====TTR-related Diseases====
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin Transthyretin], or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin TTR], is a protein that when aggregated causes senile systemic amyloidosis, familial amyloidotic neuropathy, and some other rare [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegenerative_disease neurodegenerative diseases]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin Transthyretin] is found in the Central nervous system. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin TTR] is a serum protein in the cerebrospinal fluid and carries thyroxine, a thyroid hormone. In the blood, albumin usually carries out this function, but albumin is not present in cerebrospinal fluid. Many of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin TTR] diseases have been shown to be caused by point mutations in the peptide sequence. These mutations change the intrinsic properties of the sequence increasing the propensity for aggregation. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin TTR] is a tetramer and aggregation begins when the tetramer dissociates. After the separation, the peptide chains make energetically favorable contacts that favor fibrilization. From this point, aggregation of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin TTR] monomers proceeds rapidly. The intermediate structures have not been determined with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin TTR] aggregation &lt;ref name=&quot;glab&quot;/&gt;.

===Created Prediction Models===

In an effort to better understand and predict protein aggregation, several research groups have been developing predictive models based on different principles. 

The prediction method created by Tartaglia et al. is based on physicochemical properties. The method is an ab initio prediction method based on polar and non-polar [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessible_surface_area accessible surface areas], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_dipole_moment dipole moment], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_%28physics%29 charge], aromatic residues, and beta-sheet propensity. The prediction gives an aggregation rate and “amyloid spectrum.” This method scans each sequence with a determined window size, moving the window one amino acid at a time. Each stretch is ranked using the aggregation propensity. The positions of the three highest ranking stretches are stored. This method yielded an impressive 95% correlation with experimental aggregation rates &lt;ref name=&quot;tart1&quot;/&gt;.

The AGGRESCAN method is based on experimentally derived aggregation propensities of individual amino acids. A sliding window is used to calculate the average aggregation propensity of the window and the value is assigned to the center amino acid. This gives a profile of “hot spots” for aggregation. The method gives a graphical representation of the aggregation profile including hot spots, peak areas, and aggregation values &lt;ref name=&quot;conc&quot;&gt;AGGRESCAN: a server for the prediction and evaluation of &quot;hot spots&quot; of aggregation in polypeptides&quot; Conchillo-Sole, O., de Groot, N. S., Aviles, F. X., Vendrell, J., Daura, X., &amp; Ventura, S. (2007). BMC Bioinformatics. 8, 65-81. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=17324296 Full Text]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The TANGO method is a statistical mechanisms algorithm that identifies regions of a sequence that are prone to aggregation. The method considers several different types of intrinsic structural tendencies of the polypeptide sequence and determines which is the most likely conformation for a sliding window of varying length. This method was between 87-92% correct for the prediction of aggregation in general but like most aggregation prediction tools does not distinguish amyloid formation from amorphous aggregation. &lt;ref name=&quot;Fernandez-Escamilla&quot;&gt;&quot;Fernandez-Escamilla, A. M., Rousseau, F., Schymkowitz, J. &amp; Serrano, L. (2004). Prediction of sequence-dependent and mutational effects on the aggregation of peptides and proteins. Nat Biotechnol 22, 1302-6. [http://tango.crg.es/]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The method created by Pawar et al. uses intrinsic properties of a sequence to find aggregation prone and aggregation susceptible areas. The method utilizes [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix alpha-helix] propensity, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_sheet beta-sheet] propensity, charge, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic hydrophobicity], and hydrophobic/hydrophilic patterns to predict aggregation prone and aggregation susceptible areas of a sequence. An overall aggregation propensity, z-score for propensity, aggregation rate, and rate or propensity profile can be calculated with this method. When calculating a profile, each amino acid is mutated to all other possibilities and the rate or propensity is calculated. The maximum, minimum and wild type values are stored and these profiles are smoothed over a sliding window of 7 amino acids &lt;ref name=&quot;pawar&quot;&gt;&quot;Prediction of &quot;aggregation-prone&quot; and &quot;aggregation-susceptible&quot; regions in proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases.&quot; Pawar, A. P., Dubay, K. F., Zurdo, J., Chiti, F., Vendruscolo, M., &amp; Dobson, C. M. (2005). J. Mol. Biol. 350, 379-392.[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WK7-4G3K8B1-2&amp;_user=47004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=47004&amp;md5=b0522a83d8ac5c7b0a74b4f87af9da4c Full Text]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Can the sequence characteristics of a peptide provide insights into the sites that harbor amyloid tendencies? Known diseases associated with aggregation give us a research basis upon which to start pattern searching. From what has been seen with bioinformatics approaches in this area so far, sequence characteristics do tell us a lot about the aggregation of a protein. However, no perfect model has been built, so it is clear that we do not understand every aspect of protein aggregation. The hope is to understand protein aggregation and to learn how to prevent it.

      <comment>/* Putting it together */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Transportation is multi-modal, multi-disciplinary field that requires the efforts of people from a spectrum of backgrounds.  Planners, engineers and policy makers are the primary groups, but architects, economists, and operations researchers serve in roles that benefit the industry.  In order for an idea to become a road, it must go through several planning and design stages.  This section serves as a conclusion for this wikibook as well as a summary of the building process for a roadway.

== Connecting Places ==

* Planning
* Assessing Needs: Testing Alternatives (Hypotheses)
* Predicting Demand
* Trip Generation
* Trip Distribution
* Mode Choice
* Route Assignment

== Determining Road Capacity (Width) ==
* Level of service
* Design to satisfy standard
* Understand implications of traffic (queues, shockwaves, congestion)

== Determining Road Alignment (Length) ==

* Properties of drivers, vehicles, roadway
* Maximum grade associated with speed, vehicle type
* Stopping sight distance
* Vertical alignment (sags &amp; crests)
* Horizontal alignment

== Determining Road Strength (Depth) ==

* Given load on the road, how long can the road hold up.
* Design pavement depth to satisfy predicted traffic.

== Putting it together ==
Planning determines origin/destination demand by vehicle type … feeds into Level of Service
* LOS feeds into in-depth traffic analysis and determines number of lanes
* Truck demand determines maximum grade
* Stopping sight distance determines horizontal and vertical curvatures.
* Truck demand determines pavement thickness

== Implications ==

Fraction of demand (trucks) is determining design characteristics (grade, depth)

Fraction of demand (peak hour traffic) is determining width.

1. Financing should consider this

2. Design should consider this. Maybe cars and trucks should have separate routes. (car-only highways would be cheaper, separation would be safer).

3. We don’t ask one building to serve all needs, why should one road?

== Thought Question ==

How does an idea become a road? Explain how an idea becomes a road. Illustrate your explanation with a consistent set of examples for all of the major steps of analysis that are required (i.e. the output of one example should be the input to the next example).

As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sight Distance''' is a length of road surface which a particular driver can see with an acceptable level of clarity.  Sight distance plays an important role in geometric highway design because it establishes an acceptable design speed, based on a driver's ability to visually identify and stop for a particular, unforeseen roadway hazard or pass a slower vehicle without being in conflict with opposing traffic.  As velocities on a roadway are increased, the design must be catered to allowing additional viewing distances to allow for adequate time to stop.  The two types of sight distance are (1) stopping sight distance and (2) passing sight distance.

== Derivations ==

===Stopping Sight Distance===
[[Image:AASHTOSSD.png|thumb|Forces acting on a vehicle that is braking]]

Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) is the viewable distance required for a driver to see so that he or she can make a complete stop in the event of an unforeseen hazard.  SSD is made up of two components: (1) Braking Distance and (2) Perception-Reaction Time.

For highway design, analysis of braking is simplified by assuming that deceleration is caused by the resisting force of friction against skidding tires.  This is applicable to both an uphill or a downhill situation.  A vehicle can be modeled as an object with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; sliding on a surface inclined at angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. 

While the force of gravity pulls the vehicle down, the force of friction resists that movement. The forces acting this vehicle can be simplified to:

&lt;math&gt;
F = W\left( {\sin \left( \theta  \right) - f\cos \left( \theta  \right)} \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where 
* &lt;math&gt;W = mg\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = object’s weight, 
* &lt;math&gt;f \,\!&lt;/math&gt; = coefficient of friction. 

Using Newton’s second law we can conclude then that the acceleration (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;)  of the object is

&lt;math&gt;
a = g\left( {\sin \left( \theta  \right) - f\cos \left( \theta  \right)} \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Using our basic equations to solve for braking distance (&lt;math&gt;d_b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) in terms of initial speed (&lt;math&gt;v_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) and ending speed (&lt;math&gt;v_e\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) gives 

&lt;math&gt;
d_b  = \frac{{v_i ^2  - v_e ^2 }}{{ - 2a}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and substituting for the acceleration yields

&lt;math&gt;
d_b  = \frac{{v_i ^2  - v_e ^2 }}{{2g\left( {f\cos \left( \theta  \right) - \sin \left( \theta  \right)} \right)}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:I-90_floating_bridges_looking_east.JPG|thumb|Ample Stopping Sight Distance | 350px]]

For angles commonly encountered on roads, &lt;math&gt;cos(\theta)\approx1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;sin(\theta)\approx tan(\theta)=G&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called the road’s grade.  This gives

&lt;math&gt;
d_b  = \frac{{v_i ^2  - v_e ^2 }}{{2g\left( {f \pm G} \right)}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Using simply the braking formula assumes that a driver reacts instantaneously to a hazard.  However, there is an inherent delay between the time a driver identifies a hazard and when he or she mentally determines an appropriate reaction.  This amount of time is called perception-reaction time.  For a vehicle in motion, this inherent delay translates to a distance covered in the meanwhile.  This extra distance must be accounted for.



For a vehicle traveling at a constant rate, distance &lt;math&gt;d_r&lt;/math&gt; covered by a specific velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and a certain perception-reaction time &lt;math&gt;t_r&lt;/math&gt; can be computed using simple dynamics:

&lt;math&gt;
d_r = \left( vt_r \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, combining these two elements together and incorporating unit conversion, the AASHTO stopping sight distance formula is produced.  The unit conversions convert the problem to metric, with &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; in kilometers per hour and &lt;math&gt;d_s&lt;/math&gt; in meters.

&lt;math&gt;
d_s  = d_r  + d_b  = 0.278t_r v_i  + \frac{{(0.278v_i)^2 }}{{19.6\left( {f \pm G} \right)}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== A Note on Sign Conventions ====
We said
&lt;math&gt;
d_b  = \frac{{v_i ^2  - v_e ^2 }}{{2g\left( {f \pm G} \right)}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Use: 
&lt;math&gt;
(f - G)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
if going downhill
and
&lt;math&gt;
(f + G)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
if going uphill, where G is the absolute value of the grade

===Passing Sight Distance===

Passing Sight Distance (PSD) is the minimum sight distance that is required on a highway, generally a two-lane, two-directional one, that will allow a driver to pass another vehicle without colliding with a vehicle in the opposing lane.  This distance also allows the driver to abort the passing maneuver if desired.  AASHTO defines PSD as having three main distance components: (1) Distance traveled during perception-reaction time and accleration into the opposing lane, (2) Distance required to pass in the opposing lane, (3) Distance necessary to clear the slower vehicle.

The first distance component &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;
d_1  = 1000t_1 \left( u - m + \frac{{a t_1 }}{{2}} \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where 
* &lt;math&gt;t_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = time for initial maneuver, 
* &lt;math&gt;a \,\!&lt;/math&gt; = acceleration (km/h/sec),
* &lt;math&gt;u \,\!&lt;/math&gt; = average speed of passing vehicle (km/hr),
* &lt;math&gt;m \,\!&lt;/math&gt; = difference in speeds of passing and impeder vehicles (km/hr).

The second distance component &lt;math&gt;d_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;
d_2 = \left(1000ut_2\right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where 
* &lt;math&gt;t_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = time passing vehicle is traveling in opposing lane, 
* &lt;math&gt;u  \,\!&lt;/math&gt; = average speed of passing vehicle (km/hr). 

The third distance component &lt;math&gt;d_3\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is more of a rule of thumb than a calculation.  Lengths to complete this maneuver vary between 30 and 90 meters.

With these values, the total passing sight distance (PSD) can be calculated by simply taking the summation of all three distances.

&lt;math&gt;
d_p = \left( d_1 + d_2 + d_3 \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

=== Example 1: Stopping Distance ===

{{TProblem |
A vehicle initially traveling at 88 km/h skids to a stop on a 3% downgrade, where the pavement surface provides a coefficient of friction equal to 0.3. How far does the vehicle travel before coming to a stop?
}}

{{Answer |
&lt;math&gt;
d_b  = \frac{{\left( {88*\left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)} \right)^2  - \left( 0 \right)^2 }}{{2*\left( {9.8} \right)*\left( {0.3 - 0.03} \right)}} = 112.9m
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Example 2: Coefficient of Friction ===

{{TProblem |
A vehicle initially traveling at 150 km/hr skids to a stop on a 3% downgrade, taking 200 m to do so.  What is the coefficient of friction on this surface?
}}

{{Answer |
&lt;math&gt;
d_b  = \frac{{\left( {150*\left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)} \right)^2  - \left( 0 \right)^2 }}{{2*\left( {9.8} \right)*\left( {f - 0.03} \right)}} = 200m
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\left( {f - 0.03} \right) = \frac{{\left( {150*\left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)} \right)^2  - \left( 0 \right)^2 }}{{2*\left( {9.8} \right)*200}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
f = 0.47
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Example 3: Grade ===

{{TProblem |
What should the grade be for the previous example if the coefficient of friction is 0.40?
}}

{{Answer |
&lt;math&gt;
d_b  = \frac{{\left( {150*\left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)} \right)^2  - \left( 0 \right)^2 }}{{2*\left( {9.8} \right)*\left( {0.40 - G} \right)}} = 200m
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\left( {0.40 - G} \right) = \frac{{\left( {150*\left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)} \right)^2  - \left( 0 \right)^2 }}{{2*\left( {9.8} \right)*200}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
G = 0.44 - 0.40 =   0.04
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the road needs to be a 4 percent uphill grade if the vehicles are going that speed on that surface and can stop that quickly.
}}

=== Example 4: Accident Reconstruction ===

{{TProblem |
You are shown an accident scene with a vehicle and a light pole.  The vehicle was estimated to hit the light pole at 50 km/hr.  
The skid marks are measured to be 210, 205, 190, and 195 meters.  A trial run that is conducted to help measure the coefficient of friction reveals that a car traveling at 60 km/hr can stop in 100 meters under conditions present at the time of the accident.  How fast was the vehicle traveling to begin with?
}}

{{Answer |
First, Average the Skid Marks.  

&lt;math&gt;(210+205+190+195)/4 = 200\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Estimate the coefficient of friction.

&lt;math&gt;
d_b  = \frac{{\left( {60*\left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)} \right)^2  - \left( 0 \right)^2 }}{{2*\left( {9.8} \right)*\left( {f - 0} \right)}} = 100m
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{{\left( {60*\left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)} \right)^2  - \left( 0 \right)^2 }}{{2*\left( {9.8} \right)*100}} = 0.14
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Third, estimate the unknown velocity

&lt;math&gt;
d_b  = \frac{{\left( {v*\left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)} \right)^2  - \left( {50*\left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)} \right)^2 }}{{2*\left( {9.8} \right)*\left( {0.14 - 0} \right)}} = 200m
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\left( {v*\left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)} \right)^2  - \left( {50*\left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)} \right)^2  = 200m*\left( {2*\left( {9.8} \right)*\left( {0.14} \right)} \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
548.8 + 192.9 = v^2 \left( {\frac{{1000}}{{3600}}} \right)^2 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
v^2  = \frac{{741.7}}{{0.077}} = 9612.43
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
v = 98km/h
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Example 5: Compute Stopping Sight Distance ===

{{TProblem |
Determine the Stopping Sight Distance from Example 4, assuming an AASHTO recommended perception-reaction time of 2.5 seconds.
}}

{{Answer |
&lt;math&gt; d_s = ((1000/3600) * 98 * 2.5) + (98*0.278)^2/(2*9.8*0.14)=338 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

== Why did this person become interested in science? ==
As a child, young Alexander displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age.

==  Where did this person go to school? ==
As a young child Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father. Later he went to a college in London.
He went to school for 5 years.

== What problem did he or she uncover that needed solving? == 
His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could &quot;speak,&quot; albeit only a few words.

== What solutions had already been tried that did not solve the problem? Why wasn't it working? ==
Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's Skye terrier, &quot;Trouve&quot;

== What did this person invent that solved the problem? == 
[[File:Alexander Graham Bell.jpg|90px-1876_Bell_Speaking_into_Telephone.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander Graham Bell]]

==  How did the invention solve the problem? ==

He thought he could harness the new electronic technology by creating a machine with a transmitter and receiver that would send sounds telegraphically to help people hear.

== How has this inventor changed people and the world? == 

It allowed people from all over the world to keep in touch regardless of distance.

== What happened to this inventor in the end? ==
Bell died of diabetes on 2 August 1922, at his private estate, Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia, at age 75.

== If you could ask this inventor one question, what would you ask? ==

== When, Where, and to whom was he or she born? == 
[[Image:Thomas Edison.jpg|200px|right|Thomas Edison]]

Thomas Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, and was raised in Port Huron, Michigan. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison, Jr. (1804–1896) (born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia, Canada) and Nancy Matthews Edison née Elliott (1810–1871). His family was of Dutch origin. 

== What was his or her childhood like? == 
In school Thomas Edison wasn't a really good student. He couldn't hear well so people think that he didn't pay attention to the 
teacher as much as he should have.
He was born on February,11,1847

== Why did this person become interested in science? ==
Thomas Edison loved to read and he became interested in science from books. At the age of 10 he set up a small Laboratory in his room. He spent most of his time reading or trying out a new experiment.

==  Where did this person go to school? ==
He went to school in  Port Huron, Michigan. But he only went to school for three months.

== What problem did he or she uncover that needed solving? == 
The problem he needed solving is that how to make the electric light bulb last longer than the ones that other inventors invented.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* He helped create over 1,000 inventions!
* He produced the first talking motion picture.
* He worked for the navy in World War I.
&lt;/div&gt;[[Image:Edison_bulb.jpg|200px|left]]

== What solutions had already been tried that did not solve the problem? Why wasn't it working? ==

The solutions that had already been tried that did not sovle the problem are that he used  platinum and other filaments that did not work, he tried many times and every one, failed. After many Failures he used a carbon filament and it lasted 40 hours.

== What did this person invent? == 
[[Image:Edison and phonograph edit2.jpg|200px|right|Thomas Edison with the phonograph.]]

Thomas Edison invented the phonograph. The phonograph was the first invention that could record the sound of someone's voice and play it back to them. In 1877 he recited the poem &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot; and the phonograph played it back to him.

He solved the problem of providing light for the world.

== How has this inventor changed people and the world? == 
He helped in the creation of the light bulb. If he hadn't helped we probably wouldn't have long lasting light bulbs like we do now. It gave light to the world.

== What happened to this inventor in the end? ==


== If you could ask this inventor one question, what would you ask? ==
If I could ask this inventor one question, I would ask him how he was inspired to be an inventor.

== If you could bring this inventor to today and tell him or her one thing, what would you tell him or her about the effect of his or her invention? ==
Was it hard work?

[[Image:Tesla2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Picture of the Nikola Tesla]]

== When, Where, and to whom was he or she born? == 
Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1846 in Austria. Legend says he was born at exactly midnight during a lightning storm, which is interesting because Nikola studied electricity.

== What was his or her childhood like? == 
Tesla had one older brother and three sisters. He excelled in school because he had a photographic memory, which means he can remember pictures perfectly. After reading a book he could always remember what was in it. But his childhood wasn't easy, he was often sick and complained of seeing strange flashing lights and things that weren't actually there.

== Why did this person become interested in science? ==
He studied electricity and some of his first jobs were for a telegraph company.


==  Where did this person go to school? ==
He completed one year at Charles-Ferdinand University.

== What problem did he or she uncover that needed solving? == 
When Nicola Tesla was born we didn't know very much about electricity. Along with Thomas Edison he allowed us to have all the electronics we have today. 

== What solutions had already been tried that did not solve the problem? Why wasn't it working? ==


== What did this person invent that solved the problem? == 


==  How did the invention solve the problem? ==


== How has this inventor changed people and the world? == 


== What happened to this inventor in the end? ==
As he got older, Tesla began having more and more psychological problems which eventually made him unable to work. He died alone with little money.

== If you could ask this inventor one question, what would you ask? ==
I would ask him how he was able to invent so many complicated machines during his life.

== If you could bring this inventor to today and tell him or her one thing, what would you tell him or her about the effect of his or her invention? ==
I would tell him that his work is used by people all across the world, and that he has not been forgotten.

== When, Where, and to whom was she born? == 

Marie Curie (born Maria Skłodowska, also known as Marie Curie-Skłodowska; in Warsaw, then part of Russian Poland, November 7, 1867 – July 4, 1934) was a physicist and chemist of Polish upbringing and, subsequently, French citizenship. She was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity, the first twice-honored Nobel laureate (to this day, the only one to win the award in two different sciences)

== What was his or her childhood like? == 

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* First interesting fact.
* Another interesting fact.
* Yet another interesting fact.
&lt;/div&gt;

== Why did this person become interested in science? ==

Within two years, Marie took the master's examination in physics and scored highest in the class.She was completely absorbed in science when , in 1894, she met  the physicist who became her husband.Meanwhile both Curies had became interested in the work of another French scientist, Antoine Henry Becquerel.In 1896 he had discovered that uranium gave off invisible radiations, which could &quot;take a picture&quot; on a photographic plate, even in total darkness.Marie wanted to find out what these radiations were.

==  Where did this person go to school? ==

Three radioactive minerals are named after the Curies: curite, sklodowskite, and cuprosklodowskite.

Pierre and Marie Curie University, the largest science, technology and medicine university in France, and successor institution to the faculty of science at the University of Paris, where she taught, is named in honor of her and Pierre. The university is home to the laboratory where they discovered radium.

Another school named for her, Marie Curie M.S. 158, in Bayside, New York, specializes in science and technology as does Curie Metropolitan High School, located in the community area of Archer Heights on Chicago's Southwest Side. It has a Technical, Performing Arts and IB program.

In 2007, the Pierre Curie Paris Métro station was renamed the &quot;Pierre et Marie Curie&quot; station.

The Maria Skłodowska-Curie Medallion, a stained-glass panel created by Jozef C. Mazur, may be found at the University at Buffalo Polish Room.

== What problem did she uncover that needed solving? == 


== What solutions had already been tried that did not solve the problem? Why wasn't it working? ==


== What did this person invent that solved the problem? ==
Madam Curie discovered the use of radium for creating x-rays, and helped to launch modern nuclear physics.

==  How did the invention solve the problem? ==


== How has Marie Curie changed people and the world? ==

== What happened to this inventor in the end? ==
Marie's body tissue had been poisoned by exposure to too much radioactivity. Pierre died when he was run over by a very heavy cart.

== If you could ask Marie Curie one question, what would you ask? ==
I would ask her who her mom and dad were.

== If you could bring Marie Curie today and tell her one thing, what would you tell her about the effect of her invention? ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== When, Where, and to whom was he born? == 

Benjamin Franklin was born on Milk Street in Boston on January 17, 1706 and baptized at Old South Meeting House.  His father, Josiah Franklin, was a tallow chandler, a maker of candles and soap, whose second wife, Abiah Folger, was Benjamin's mother.
{{-}}

== What was his childhood like? == 
Benjamin was the fifteenth child and youngest son.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* In 1733, Franklin began to publish the famous Poor Richard's Almanack (with content both original and borrowed) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders, on which much of his popular reputation is based.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{-}}

== Why did this person become interested in inventing ==
At the age of forty-two, Benjamin retired from printing to explore his other interests including inventing new and exciting things.

==  Where did this person go to school? ==
Franklin's father intended for Ben to become a clergyman but he didn't have enough money for years of schooling that would require. Because of Ben's love of his books, he was apprenticed to one of older brothers, James, who was a printer. He attended Boston Latin School but did not graduate; he continued his education through reading lots and lots of books at home.

== What problem did he uncover that needed solving? == 

Lots of problems. He had a very busy life and came up with lots of problems that needed fixing. One thing that always fascinated Benjamin was electricity. One stormy night his son, William, and Benjamin were experimenting with lightning. At this time people thought that lightning was a mysterious force that was a punishment from God; however, he wanted to prove that lightning is a form of electricity.

Benjamin attached a pointed metal piece on the top of his kite and a metal key to the base of the string. Lightning struck the kite and traveled down the kite straight to the key. When he touched the key with his knuckle, there was a spark! It's a good thing he didn't electrocute himself (although he was knocked unconscious twice before when experimenting with electricity, so don't try this at home!), but he did prove that lightning is electricity! 

== What solutions had already been tried that did not solve the problem? Why wasn't it working? ==

== What did this person invent that solved the problem? == 

After his experiments with electricity, he invented the lightning rod to protect buildings and ships from lightning damage.

He also invented swim fins, bifocal glasses, a glass armonica, watertight bulkheads for ships, the lightning rod, an odometer and a new type of wood stove (called the Franklin stove).

==  How did the invention solve the problem? ==


== How has this inventor changed people and the world? == 

Buildings and ships are now protected from lightning. Lightning strikes used to cause lots of fires that destroyed buildings and killed people. Now this happens much less.

== What happened to this inventor in the end? ==

Franklin died on April 17, 1790, at age 84. His funeral was attended by approximately 20,000 people.

== If you could ask this inventor one question, what would you ask? ==

== If you could bring this inventor to today and tell him or her one thing, what would you tell him about the effect of his or her invention? ==

===Speedy Delete?===
Why? &gt;.&lt; [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] ([[User talk:Hoogli|talk]]) 00:11, 3 April 2008 (UTC)

== &quot;Subscription Drugs&quot;? ==

What exactly are these? I've never heard the term before. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] ([[User talk:Hoogli|talk]]) 21:23, 4 April 2008 (UTC)

:There are several papers/articles that claim that some subscription drugs increase suicidal tendencies, by altering the brain chemic, some affect only certain age groups or have a long term effect (especially in children and teenagers).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:05, 4 April 2008 (UTC)
:Do you mean prescription drugs? (I'm from the US, maybe the term is different elsewhere) [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] ([[User talk:Hoogli|talk]]) 02:18, 10 May 2008 (UTC)
::Lol, yup probably my mistake... Subscription is the paper need to get some of the most active substances (legally controlled). Prescription is mostly a medical act, that can result or not in a subscription (legal paper, that can also have economical value to the state or other entities) to the patient (in some places of the world not only medical doctors can prescribe drugs, ie: Midwifes in Holland for instance can do it also, if I remember it correctly), since I was thinking on the level of control, not on the act of prescription itself I don't know what best qualifies it...
::I did a google search and you get things like:
::&quot;...direct-mail subscription drug program...&quot;, &quot;Annual Subscription of Drugs Cases...&quot; or &quot;...potential interactions between subscription drugs...&quot;, so I think both of us may be correct, English is not my natural language so some stuff may be lost in translation but the distinction seems relevant...   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:43, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

== Scrapping the Considering Others pages ==

I don't think the content on the pages linked from [[Suicide#Considering Others]]; [[Suicide/Saying Goodbye]] and [[Suicide/Suicide Notes]], is helpful. It's just unsourced personal opinion and plain obvious stuff. More the sort someone would write as a mental exercise while contemplating suicide rather than something useful to someone wanting to know about the topic.

The book might discuss suicide notes, but a this-is-how-to-write-a-suicide-note section is going to be inherently flawed unless it takes into account all the various issues surrounding it and the different situations a person might be in. These two pages don't even begin to do so. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:45, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

:It is a stub. It can be useful to deals with the impact of a suicide on others, people that have had a suicide in the family etc...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:24, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

::As might be obvious, I agree with Swift.  Exactly this type of unsourced personal doesn't live up to our inclusion criteria, which was one of the reasons I brought this book up at [[WB:RfD]].  I think removing/replacing this content would go a long way to improving this book. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:54, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

:: It can be useful if it actually contributes something. It doesn't. It implies a certain state of mind and the logic is broken (see the first three sentences for an amazing example of syllogism from another world).
:: This would be a stub if it laid out the issues surrounding bidding farewell that were more applicable to a broad range of situations. Currently, it implies too much and categorises based on that. That ''isn't'' useful.
:: The topic should be covered, but is probably best done so separately depending on the situation. It should furthermore focus on issues rather than methods, as they are more transferable to various situations. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:39, 9 May 2010 (UTC)
:: Sorry, the previous comment referred specifically to [[Suicide/Saying Goodbye]]. I'll agree that [[Suicide/Suicide Notes]] is considerably better. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:44, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

== Unusual methods useful? ==

Does anyone think it's useful to have the [[Suicide#Unusual Methods]] section? Personally it just looks like uninformative gore. I can see that it's interesting in the &quot;wow, that's wacky!&quot; sense, but I don't see its merit as a &quot;hmm, my life is more full for having learnt this&quot; topic. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:49, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

:For what it is worth I agree, it was one of the sections I originally complained about. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:07, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

:Unusual methods can cover suicide by cop, suicide by committing capital crimes, suicide pacts, mass suicides.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:21, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

:: &quot;''Unusual methods can cover suicide by cop''&quot; Sorry, but you're speaking in some strange language again, Panic. As for suicide pacts and mass suicides, these are separate subjects. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:03, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

::: Huh [[w:Suicide by cop|suicide by cop]] ?!? (commuting -&gt; committing)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:08, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

:::: :-D That's one phrase I'm proud not to have known! &quot;''Committing''&quot;: Thanks, that explains that one a bit. It doesn't, however, explain why this merits a special section. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:27, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

::::: Except for assisted suicided (that requires an participative collaboration) those other &quot;methods&quot; go beyond a personal decision.
::::: I do think that this quality assurance (beyond the reasonable), unnecessary need for justification (since none else was editing) and overbearing criticism will be the death of the project.  
::::: Heck, I'm not committing to this book, I already have 3 other books going on. I was and I am just proving that the subject is worth keeping, valid under the WIW, with valid content and all can be extended to be a constructive resource of information, of course I understand Thenub314 point of view (if based on personal feeling, religion or moral). Even if I disagree with it. Being incarcerated '''is''' mental torture even at its best it causes always mental stress, that should be plain to anyone (this is why undomesticated animals in captivity often die, go mad or fail to reproduce). I'm not going to fight over the subject, I becoming strongly demotivated by all this friction, for instance the removal of the Dr. Death image/reference (that would be easy to be extended) in general it is annoying that people still go to such lengths, commenting on quality and subjective reasons without in reality doing any real work to improve the content...
::::: I'm done for now here, I've made my point, posted my vote and opinion on the RfD and done my bit to improve the work so I'll move along. If people decide to contribute positively, I'm willing to collaborate since the subject merits being covered.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:57, 9 May 2010 (UTC)
{{outdent|:::::}} I am sorry if I have brought a negative tone to this discussion.  My comments about prison systems are largely motivated by my personal experience with it.  My remaining comments revolve around stem from what I feel a textbook is, and what I feel is academically relevant to this subject, which is in turn based on the courses I have taken.  In way of an apology let me emphasize a few points which might have been overshadowed by my strong objections to the work.  I meant what I said when I claimed that this book might be OK if it lived up to its own description of itself.  I sincerely meant to give praise when I described the work you did as &quot;excellent&quot;.  I did not want to detract from this praise, and I fully believe any implicit OR was accidental. Let me further say that I think the subject is worthy of academic discussion, my objections where always based upon what was written instead of the subject itself.  I have tried to contribute positively, even through my criticisms.  For example, I do not spend time on the weekend reading forensic pathology books because I enjoy it, but because I see fact checking part of the editorial process.  I have avoided removing information I find suspect as I am the person who initiated the  RfD, and I saw it as polite not to take actions others might view as deteriorating the quality of the work while I simultaneously worked toward deleting it.  I have thought seriously about what I might add, and I have been busy reading references about the subject. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:17, 10 May 2010 (UTC)

:Though it is off topic, the argumentative side of me cannot help to point out that your arguments about the success of animals in captivity is deeply flawed. While many undomesticated animals do die, it is just as often due to a misunderstanding of the animal itself as opposed to the confines of its space.  You fail to acknowledge that some breeding programs, say amongst higher apes are quite successful, while others are not (FYI: Because of the success of breeding programs for chimpanzees there is now an &quot;over popluation&quot; in the US. Relative of course to the available appropriate space for them.)  Other animals, such as elephants, will die without others of the species around and are notoriously difficult to breed.  As different species react differently, the real question in our case is about the human species.  I grant that there is undoubtedly a certain amount of stress involved with being incarcerated.  But I would stop far short of being put in jail or prison in the US a form of mental ''torture''. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:17, 10 May 2010 (UTC)

== Focus ==
I have spent a bit of time reading textbooks (or sections of textbooks) about suicide and I see a place where a decision needs to be made.  The textbooks I have found fall under three major disciplines: Philosophy, Sociology, and  Psychology.  Depending on the discipline very different perspectives are taken, indeed many differ on the definition of suicide.  I think there is a lot to be gained by choosing a discipline we hope this book would be written from.  I think it would:
*identify a set of references for a bibliography, as well as helping to improve our verifiability;
*help make clear the scope of our book, making it clear whether sections on subjects like &quot;Unusual methods&quot; are relevant.
My personal preference is the philosophical approach, because this is the one I know best.  What do other people think.  (Note to Panic: 3 sections, all located after your reply). [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:17, 10 May 2010 (UTC)

== Suicide methods ==

There is a bunch of content I could bring here from the now-defunct [[wikiindex:SuicideWiki|SuicideWiki]] (which in turn got a lot of the content from the now-defunct [[wikiindex:ASH|ASH wiki]]). Specifically, I could add pages on: Amitriptyline cocktail, Carbon monoxide poisoning, Chloroquine cocktail, Cyanide poisoning, Darvon cocktail, Diphenhydramine, Exit (plastic) bag with sedatives, Fentanyl, Hanging, Helium, Hydrogen sulfide, Ligature strangulation, Methadone, Morphine and heroin, Nicotine, Non-suspension strangulation, Pentobarbital, Promethazine, Terminal dehydration, Wrist cutting, Suicide method characteristics, Availability, Peacefulness, Preparation and administration, Reliability, Safety to others, Speed of effect, Storage, Undetectability, Antiemetic regimen, Bad methods, Capsules, Cold water extraction, Drugs' shelf lives, Method contraindications, Obtaining drugs, Payment options, and Repackaging drugs in capsules.

This was attempted at Wikiversity and led to the pages being deleted. See [[wikiversity:Talk:Suicide]]. Can it be done at Wikibooks instead? Thanks. [[User:Leucosticte|Leucosticte]] ([[User talk:Leucosticte|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Leucosticte|contribs]]) 22:32, 16 October 2014 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|2|1962|Health and Science|General Conference}}
==1. Define and/or draw a diagram of the following:==
===a. Focal length ===

[[Image:Focal-length.png|frame|right|The focal point '''F''' and focal length ''f'' of a positive (convex) lens, a negative (concave) lens, a concave mirror, and a convex mirror.]]

The distance from the lens (center of lens) or mirror to the focal point.

===b. Positive lens ===
 
This type of lens creates a real image by converging the rays of light to a common focus.

::[[Image:Lens1.png]]

===c. Negative lens ===

This type of lens diverges the light or causes it to spread. It creates a virtual focal point that appears to be the location where the light is coming from.

[[image:lens1b.png]]

===d. Two kinds of distortion===

;Barrel Distortion

:The Magnification decreases as you get farther from the center of the lens. This is the type of distortion in fisheye lens. It appears like the image has been mapped around a sphere.

::[[Image:Barrel_distortion.svg|200px]]

;Pincushion Distortion

:The Magnification increases as you get farther from the center of the lens. This is the type of distortion is often seen in low quality telephoto lenses. It appears like the image has been pinched toward the middle.

::[[Image:Pincushion_distortion.svg|200px]]

===e. Longitudinal color===

Different colors of light are bent to varying degrees as they go though a medium such as glass. This effect is called Chromatic Aberration. The affect is a longitudinal displacement  (along the axis of the lens) of the focus. 

[[image:lens6a.png]]

Chromatic aberration is caused by the fact that different colors of light travel at different speeds through a medium such as glass. The amount of bend in the light as it travels from one medium to another is given by Snell's law:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2} = \frac{velocity\ 1}{velocity\ 2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}&lt;/math&gt;

The bigger the difference in the velocities, the more bending takes place.

===f. Lateral color===
===g. Spherical aberration===
[[Image:Spherical aberration 2.svg|thumb|300px|Spherical aberration. A perfect lens (top) focuses all incoming rays to a point on the optic axis. A real lens with spherical surfaces (bottom) suffers from spherical aberration: it focuses rays more tightly if they enter it far from the optic axis than if they enter closer to the axis. It therefore does not produce a perfect focal point. (Drawing is exaggerated.)]]
Lenses with surfaces that are spherically shaped are easier to manufacture, but they have a flaw that the light that travels through the lens near the center focuses at a different point than the light that travels through the lens near the edge.

Spherical mirrors will show the same aberration as spherical lenses, but it is fairly easy to parabolize a mirror and cause the focus to be at a single point. Non spherical lenses are difficult to manufacture, but modern computer controlled polishing machines are improving lens quality.
{{clear}}

===h. Achromatic lens ===

By using two lenses made of different materials we can minimize the amount of chromatic aberration that a lens creates. This principle is used in all high quality lenses to create a better image.

::[[image:lens6b.png]]

===i. Refraction of light===
Light is bent as it goes from one medium to another. The more difference there is in the two media, the greater the amount of refraction.

==2. Explain how light behaves when it strikes or traverses water, oil, feldspar, and a mirror.==
===Water===
When light travels though air and strikes water it is bent or refracted.  This is caused by the difference between the speed of light through air and the speed of light through water.
===Oil===
When light strikes oil (or a soap bubble) it gets reflected ''twice''.  The first reflection occurs when light strikes the top surface of the oil, but not all of the light is reflected here.  Some of the light penetrates the surface of the oil and is reflected from the bottom surface.  This causes the light to undergo a ''phase shift''.  When the light emerges from the oil and is recombined with light reflected from the surface, some of the light frequencies are canceled because of the phase shift, and others are reinforced.  Which frequencies are canceled and which are reinforced depends on the angle at which they are viewed, and the viewing angle changes continuously over the surface of the oil.  The effect is that one band of oil will appear yellow, another green, another yellow, etc.  This is why you see a rainbow in a puddle of oil or on a soap bubble.

===Feldspar===
There are many varieties of feldspar, and therefore, many different ways in which it interacts with light.  Some feldspars (such as spectrolite) appear to have an iridescent sheen because the light is reflected from below the surface of the stone (this is the same effect discussed above under ''oil''.  

Moonstone is a form of feldspar that is highly translucent to transparent.  

Orthoclase is a form of feldspar that is a transparent yellow (it reflects yellow light, but other colors go right through).  

Amazonite is an opaque green to blue-green form of feldspar.

===Mirror===
Light striking a mirror is reflected.  The angle at which the light strikes a mirror is equal to the angle of its reflection.

==3. Name and draw diagrams of three kinds of positive lenses and three kinds of negative lenses.==

[[File:Lens shapes.svg|framed|center|&lt;big&gt;'''1''' -  Symmetrical double convex lens.  '''2''' - Asymmetrical double-convex lens.  '''3''' - Plano- convex lens. '''4''' - Positive meniscus lens.&lt;br&gt;'''5''' - Symmetrical biconcave lens.  '''6''' - Asymmetrical biconcave lens.  '''7''' - Plano-concave lens.  '''8''' - Negative meniscus lens.&lt;/big&gt;]]
The four lenses at the top of this illustration are positive.  The four along the bottom are negative.

==4. What should be the minimum distance of light source from the lens when testing for focal length?==
[[Image:Lens calc.png|thumb|450px|Measuring the focal point]]
It depends on how accurately you want to measure the focal length.  The focal length can be determined by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f}  &lt;/math&gt; 

Where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the center of the lens and the light source, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the image the lens makes and the lens itself.  If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 30 times the focal length, it can be disregarded because 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{u}&lt;/math&gt; is so small.

If you are using the sun for the light source, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is 93 million miles, meaning &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{u}&lt;/math&gt; is so tiny as to practically be zero.

==5. Find the focal length of at least four lenses, one being a negative lens.==
[[Image:FocalLength.jpg|thumb|400px|Finding the focal length of a positive lens]]
===Positive Lens===
Set a ruler on end on a work surface (a table, sidewalk, or a wood board). Using a bright light (such as the sun) as the light source, hold the lens against the ruler and slide it up and down the ruler until the light is focused on the work surface.  The point on the ruler that the focused lens touches is to be recorded as the Focal Length for that lens.
{{clear}}
===Negative Lens===
[[Image:Sistema afocale 2.png]]
{{clear}}
Measuring the focal length of a negative lens is more difficult because light going through it does not converge to form an image.  Instead, you will need to place a positive lens between the light source and the negative lens.  Move the lenses and screen around until the light is focused.

Once focused, we can measure the distance between the negative lens and the image on the screen and call it &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt;.  The only other information we need for calculating the focal length of the negative lens is the distance between the negative lens and its object.  But where is its object?  It lies between the negative lens and the screen at the positive lens's focal point (which you have presumably already measured).

Therefore, the distance between the negative lens and its object &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the lenses &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; minus the positive lens's focal point &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;u_2 = d - f_1&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; should be smaller than &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; making &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt; a negative number.

Once we have &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt;, we can get the focal length &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{v_2} + \frac{1}{u_2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; should come out as a negative number.
{{clear}}
[[image:Negativelensfocallenght.png|thumb|center|450px|Simple method for determining the focal length of a negative lens.]]{{-}}
Another method for measuring focal length of a negative lens:
[[image:MeasuringNegativeLensFocalLenght.png|thumb|center|450px|Measuring the focal length of a negative lens using measuring microscope. Link-&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MeasuringMicroscope.jpg]]]

==6. Explain by diagram why an image from a positive lens makes an image reversed and inverted.==

By drawing lines representing the rays of light, we can show that the light creates an inverted image.

[[image:lens3.png|550px]]

==7. Show with diagrams how a prism works. State the angles at which the colors appear and disappear.==
[[Image:Dispersion_prism.jpg|thumb|200px‎]]

A prism uses the fact that different colors of light are bent differently as they travel through a medium. This effect is also seen in chromatic aberration.

The shape of a prism is an equilateral triangle. This causes the colors of light to disperse in a very predictable way.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==8. Show and demonstrate what happens when light strikes one-way glass.==

One-way glass, also called a two-way mirror, or a one-way mirror, is a pane of glass with a partially reflective, partially transparent layer, used with a darkened room on one side and a well-lit room on the other, allowing those in the darkened room to see into the lighted room but not vice versa.

The glass is coated with (or in some cases encases a layer of) a very thin almost transparent layer of metal (generally aluminum) to enhance its reflective nature. The result is what appears to be a mirror from one side, and tinted glass from the other. A viewer in the brightly lit area has difficulty seeing into the darkened room, through what appears to be a mirror.

To take full advantage of the partially mirrored surface, the target side should be brightly lit, to obscure any hint of light coming through the glass from the viewer's side. The darkened room is only completely obscured when it is in complete darkness. Sometimes a darkened curtain or a double door type vestibule is used to keep the viewers side darkened.

===Uses===
[[Image:Teleprompter schematic.svg|right|350px|thumb|One-Way Glass (4) used in a teleprompter to reflect a script.]]
One-way glass is used for:
* providing security, through covert viewing, of public spaces.
* for the protection of covert camera
* for some police interrogation rooms.
* The use of one-way glass is also apparent in the broadcast television where persons read from a script while seemingly looking directly at the camera. This effect is achieved where the camera is the viewer looking through the glass, upon which the prompt or script is also reflected for the subject to read.

==9. Construct one optical instrument using mirrors or lenses, such as a periscope, a slide or opaque projector, or a simple telescope.==
===Periscope===
[[Image:Simpleperiscopes.png|thumb|350px|right|'''Principle of the periscope.'''&lt;br&gt;
 '''A''' - Periscope using two plane mirrors.&lt;br&gt; 
''' B''' - Periscope using two right–angled prisms.&lt;br&gt;
'''1 - 2''' - Plane mirrors.&lt;br&gt;
'''3 - 4''' - Right–angled prisms.&lt;br&gt;
'''5 - 6'''  - Observer eye.&lt;br&gt;
'''7 - 8''' - Periscope tube.&lt;br&gt;
'''H''' - Periscope optical height.&lt;br&gt; 
'''Different types of periscopes:'''&lt;br&gt;
Lens periscopes. [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Periscope_1.png]&lt;br&gt;Handheld periscope. [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Handheld_periscope.png]&lt;br&gt; Submarine periscope.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Attack_periscope.png]]]
A periscope is an instrument for observation from a concealed position. In its simplest form it is a tube in each end of which are mirrors set parallel to each other and at an angle of 45° with a line between them.

A periscope may be used as a toy or for seeing over people's heads in a crowd. This form of periscope, with the addition of two simple lenses, was used for observation purposes in the trenches during World War I.

A simple periscope can be made from two small, flat mirrors and a rectangular box (such as those in which aluminum foil or wax paper are packaged).  Hot melt glue and strips of cardboard can be used to hold the mirrors in place.

===Slide Projector===
[[Image:Diaprojektor beleuchtungssystem IMGP1044.jpg|thumb|600px|Inside a slide projector]]
{{clear}}
A slide projector is an opto-mechanical device to view photographic slides. It has four main elements: a fan-cooled electric light bulb or other light source, a reflector and &quot;condensing&quot; lens to direct the light to the slide, a holder for the slide and a focusing lens. A flat piece of heat absorbing glass is often placed in the light path between the condensing lens and the slide, to avoid damaging the latter. This glass transmits visible wavelengths but absorbs infrared. Light passes through the transparent slide and lens, and the resulting image is enlarged and projected onto a perpendicular flat screen so the audience can view its reflection.
===Opaque Projector===
[[Image:Episcope.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An episcope which was used in a University of Cambridge lecture hall in the late 1800s]]
The '''opaque projector''', '''epidioscope''', '''epidiascope''' or '''episcope''' is a device which displays opaque materials by shining a bright lamp onto the object from above. A system of mirrors, prisms and/or imaging lenses is used to focus an image of the material onto a viewing screen. Because they must project the reflected light, opaque projectors require brighter bulbs and larger lenses than overhead projectors. Care must be taken that the materials are not damaged by the heat generated by the light source. Opaque projectors are not as common as the modern &quot;overhead&quot;.

Opaque projectors are typically used to project images of book pages, drawings, mineral specimens, leaves, etc. They have been produced and marketed as artists’ enlargement tools to allow images to be transferred to surfaces such as prepared canvas, or for lectures and discourses.

===Refracting Telescope===
[[Image:Kepschem2.jpg|thumb|500px|Refracting telescope]]
All refracting telescopes use the same principles. The combination of an objective lenses (1) and some type of eyepiece (2) is used to gathered more light than the human eye could collect on its own, focused it (5), and present the viewer with a brighter, clearer, and magnified virtual image (6). The objective in a refracting telescope refracts or bends light. This refraction causes parallel light rays to converge at a focal point; while those which were not parallel converge upon a focal plane. Refracting telescopes can come in many different configurations to correct for image orientation and types of aberration. Because the image was formed by the bending of light, or refraction, these telescopes are called refracting telescopes or refractors.

===Reflecting Telescope===
[[Image:Newtontelescope.png|thumb|right|300px|'''Diagram of  Newtonian reflector''']]
[[Image:Newtonian.PNG]] 
{{clear}}
In this diagram, light enters the telescope tube from the left and strikes the primary mirror (which is concave).  Light is then focused onto the secondary mirror mounted on a set of struts, and is then reflected out the side of the tube to the eyepiece.

==10. Explain what is meant by the term 6x35 and 7x50 as applied to binoculars.==
[[Image:Porro binocular.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''A typical Porro prism binoculars design''']]
The numbers used for describing binoculars give the power followed by the diameter of the objective lens (The largest diameter lens) in millimeters. This means that 6x35 have a magnifying power of 6x and have a diameter of 35mm.

The power represents how much bigger an object appears than with the unaided eye. You can also think of how many times closer it appears to be. The diameter lets you know how much light is gathered by the lens. A 50mm objective lens gathers much more light than a 35mm objective lens. Because the amount of light that is gathered increases if we increase the area  that the light hits, we can calculate the light gathering of a lens using the area of a circle:

Area of lens= π  (radius of lens)&lt;math&gt;^2&lt;/math&gt;

The 50mm objective lens collects 2.0408... times more light than a 35mm objective lens. If you are in a dark environment, you will get twice as much light with the 7x50 binoculars than with a 6x35. The 7x50 binoculars has more magnifying power (7/6 or 1.167 times) than the 6x35 binoculars.

The higher the first number, the larger things appear, but the harder it is to hold the binoculars steady. Above 10x most people need a tripod to hold it steady enough to be useful. The higher the second number, the more light gathering power, which allows you to continue to see even in low light conditions, but the binoculars are much heavier as well.

Knowing what the numbers on a pair of binoculars mean is important as you are choosing which ones are best for you, but binoculars are a very personal thing, so try them before you buy them.

==11. Define the term &quot;f/stop&quot; as used in connection with cameras. What does it mean when a lens is fast or slow? Is an f/8.5 lens faster or slower than an f/8 lens?==

A faster lens has a lower f-number, and lets in more light than a slower lens. The f-number is the ratio of the diameter of the entrance pupil to the focal length of the lens.

&lt;math&gt;f\ number = \frac {Focal\ length} {Diameter\ of\ objective}&lt;/math&gt;

The two parameters that define the f-number of an optical system are:

;Focal Length
:The longer the focal length, the more magnifying power the optical system has. You will choose a very long focal length lens if you wish to photograph birds, and a short focal length lens to photograph scenic shots such as a panarama.

;Diameter of the lens
:The larger the diameter the more light is let in. So to have a fast lens, you will need a large diameter lens, and the longer the focal length, the larger the diameter needs to be to have the same speed. A 50mm f/4 lens will have a diameter of 12.5 mm, but a 400mm f/4 lens will have a diameter of 100mm.

The advantage of a faster lens is that there is more light, so it is easier to see, and for photography, you can keep the exposure time low.

The disadvantage of a fast lens is that it is heavier, and has less depth of field.

1.  Adaptor threads is the number of threads to spawn to service your requests.
	
2. IIRC he said about 7-8 worker threads and 2-3 listen queue ones.  Of course that depends on your app and what average requests are doing etc etc.  But above that limit, if the app slows, the requests pile up to where it has no hope of meaningful recovery (the app may recover, but the users have gotten an error message long before).	

Based on Max's comments, I have set the listen queue size to 2, minimum adaptor threads to 2, and maximum adaptor threads to 4 on my deployed WO apps.  Yes, these seem extremely low compared with the defaults, but as Chuck (and Max) stated, higher values can cause poor performance at high loads.  ''With these low settings, you'll get a warning at app startup, but ignoring this warning hasn't caused any obvious problem''.	


3. You can adjust your session timeout dynamically. We allow 5 minutes to login, but once you login, we bump it back up to 3600. That way we don't have a bunch of stale sessions triggered by web robots.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As compactness is one of the fundamental ideas of topology, I feel that this chapter belongs to the Topology wikibook and not the Set theory one. Further, no one has supported the '''mergeto:Set Theory''' suggestion in a long time and so I'm removing it.

== Using unexplained concepts ==

It is not in the spirit of these WIKI-books to simply use the concepts of filter and net.
Use of filter is slightly more defendable, since it is a more non-topological concept, but at least it should have been mentioned in the first chapter as &quot;prerequisite&quot;.
&quot;Net&quot; is a topological concept. It should be properly introduced in the context of the book itself.

The physical environment is an intrinsic and essential aspect of outdoor education. It is also one the most contested and discussed aspects, and has stimulated some of the most passionate and eloquent viewpoints and debates.

Whilst solo outdoor experiences and outdoor education do occur, most outdoor education occurs within the context of small groups guided by designated leaders. Thus, the study of group behaviour, leadership, and facilitation are important aspects of understanding outdoor education.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Foods==
Beans are a food introduced to the world by the Native Americans.  Prior to Columbus's voyage, they were unknown in Europe.  This is also true of the potato, tomato, and pineapple.  Such flagrant errors in the text cast doubt on the rest of the list of foods, so I'm going to take it out. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:23, 3 April 2008 (UTC)

: Re-read that reference.  Exotic foods were UNKNOWN to the Saxons.  That means they did NOT eat them.  Also, I stand by my position on beans.  That is a New World food, and as such, it would have been impossible for the Saxons to have eaten it. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:50, 3 April 2008 (UTC)
:: OK on the beans.  I was referring to the common bean, but the word &quot;[[w:Bean|bean]]&quot; applies to other foods as well, including the broad bean, peas, lentils, and chickpeas. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:55, 3 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">At this point in the course, it is easy to get bogged down in the complex theories and equations surrounding 'waves'. However, a better understanding of waves can be gained by going back to basics, and explaining what a wave is in the first place.

==Definitions==
A '''wave''', at its most basic level, is a disturbance by which energy is transferred because this disturbance is a store, of sorts, of potential energy. This begs the question &quot;How is this disturbance transferred across space?&quot; In some cases, this is easy to answer, because some waves travel through a medium. The easiest example to think about is a water wave. One area moves up, pulling the next one up with it, and pressure and gravity pull it back to its original position.
[[Image:Wave_characteristics.svg|right|350px|thumb|Features of a wave]]

However, some waves (electro-magnetic waves) do not appear to travel through a medium. Physicists have puzzled over how light, which behaves like a wave in many situations, travels for a long time. One theory was that there was a mysterious 'ether' which pervaded all of space, and so light was just like water waves, except that the water was invisible. This theory is widely regarded to be incorrect, but, since light is assumed to be a wave, what is it a disturbance in?

Another explanation is that light is not a wave, but instead is a stream of particles. This idea would explain away the need for an 'ether' for light to travel through. This, too, has its problems, as it does not explain why light behaves as a wave.

So, we are left with a paradox. Light behaves as both a wave and a particle, but it can be shown not to be either. Quantum physics attempts to explain this paradox. However, since light behaves as both a wave and a particle, we can look at it as both, even if, when doing this, we know that we don't fully understand it yet.

The image on the right shows a waveform. This plots the distance through the medium on the x-axis, and the amount of disturbance on the y-axis. The amount of disturbance is known as the amplitude. Wave amplitudes tend to oscillate between two limits, as shown. The distance in the medium between two 'peaks' or 'troughs' (maxima and minima on the waveform) is known as the wavelength of the wave.

==Types of Waves==
Waves can be categorised according to the direction of the effect of the disturbance relative to the direction of travel. A wave which causes disturbance in the direction of its travel is known as a longitudinal wave, whereas a wave which causes disturbance perpendicular to the direction of its travel is known as a transverse wave.

|[[Image:Onde_cisaillement_impulsion_1d_30_petit.gif]]
|}
==Superposition==
One feature of waves is that they superpose. That is to say, when they are travelling in the same place in the medium at the same time, they both affect the medium independently. So, if two waves say &quot;go up&quot; to the same bit of medium at the same time, the medium will rise twice as much. In general, superposition means that the amplitudes of two waves at the same point at the same time at the same polarisation add up.

==Interference==
Consider two identical waveforms being superposed on each other. The resultant waveform will be like the two other waveforms, except its amplitude at every point will be twice as much. This is known as constructive interference. Alternatively, if one waveform moves on by half a wavelength, but the other does not, the resultant waveform will have no amplitude, as the two waveforms will cancel each other out. This is known as destructive interference. Both these effects are shown in the diagram below:

[[Image:Interference_of_two_waves.svg]]

These effects occur because the wavefronts are travelling through a medium, but electromagnetic radiation also behaves like this, even though it does not travel through a medium.

==Velocity, frequency and wavelength==
You should remember the equation v = fλ from earlier in this course, or from GCSE. v is the velocity at which the wave travels through the medium, in ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, f (or nu, &amp;nu;) is the frequency of the wave, in Hz (no. of wavelengths per. second), and λ is the wavelength, in m.

This equation applies to electromagnetic waves, but you should remember that there are different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, and that different colours of visible light have different wavelengths. You also need to know the wavelengths of the different types of electromagnetic radiation:

==Questions==
[[Image:Interference_refraction_reflection.png|thumb|400px|right]]
1. Through what medium are sound waves propagated?

2. What aspects of the behaviour of light make it look like a wave?

3. What aspects of the behaviour of light make it look like a particle?

4. Consider the diagram on the right. White light is partially reflected by the transparent material. Some of the light, however, is refracted into the transparent material and reflected back by the opaque material. The result is two waves travelling in the same place at the same time at the same polarisation(the light is not a single beam). Why does, say, the red light disappear? (Variations on this question are popular with examiners.)

5. What is the wavelength of green light?

6. The lowest frequency sound wave humans can hear has a frequency of approximately 20Hz. Given that the speed of sound in air is 343ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, what is the wavelength of the lowest frequency human-audible sound?

'''1. Through what medium are sound waves propagated?'''

Usually the air, but most material objects will carry sound.

'''2. What aspects of the behaviour of light make it look like a wave?'''

Superposition and diffraction (and others).

'''3. What aspects of the behaviour of light make it look like a particle?'''

[[w:Photoelectric effect|Photoelectric effect]]

'''4. Consider the diagram on the right. White light is partially reflected by the transparent material. Some of the light, however, is refracted into the transparent material and reflected back by the opaque material. The result is two waves travelling in the same place at the same time at the same polarisation(the light is not a single beam). Why does, say, the red light disappear?'''

If the refractive index and width of the transparent material are correct, then the two waveforms leaving it will be half a wavelength apart, as one will have travelled further. Destructive interference will cause the red light to become 'invisible'.

'''5. What is the wavelength of green light?'''

500nm

'''6. The lowest frequency sound wave humans can hear has a frequency of approximately 20Hz. Given that the speed of sound in air is 343ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, what is the wavelength of the lowest frequency human-audible sound?'''

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{343}{20} = 17.15\mbox{m}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Horizontal Curves''' are one of the two important transition elements in geometric design for highways (along with [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Vertical Curves|Vertical Curves]]).  A horizontal curve provides a transition between two tangent strips of roadway, allowing a vehicle to negotiate a turn at a gradual rate rather than a sharp cut.  The design of the curve is dependent on the intended design speed for the roadway, as well as other factors including drainage and friction.  These curves are semicircles as to provide the driver with a constant turning rate with radii determined by the laws of physics surrounding centripetal force.

== Fundamental Horizontal Curve Properties ==

=== Physics Properties ===

[[Image:Ring_3_and_E6_Oslo_Quevaal.jpg|thumb|A Horizontal Curve in Oslo, Norway| right| 350px]]

When a vehicle makes a turn, two forces are acting upon it.  The first is gravity, which pulls the vehicle toward the ground.  The second is centripetal force, which is an external force required to keep the vehicle on a curved path.  For any given velocity, the centripetal force would need to be greater for a tighter turn (one with a smaller radius) than a broader one (one with a larger radius).  On a level surface, side friction &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; could serve as a countering force, but it generally would provide very little resistance.  Thus, the vehicle would have to make a very wide circle in order to negotiate a turn.  Given that road designs usually encounter very narrow design areas, such wide turns are generally discouraged.

To deal with this issue, horizontal curves have roads that are tilted at a slight angle.  This tilt is defined as superelevation, or &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, which is the amount of rise seen on an angled cross-section of a road given a certain run, otherwise known as slope.  The presence of superelevation on a curve allows some of the centripetal force to be countered by the ground, thus allowing the turn to be executed at a faster rate than would be allowed on a flat surface.  Superelevation also plays another important role by aiding in drainage during precipitation events, as water runs off the road rather than collecting on it.  Generally, superelevation is limited to being less than 14 percent, as engineers need to account for stopped vehicles on the curve, where centripetal force is not present.

The allowable radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; for a horizontal curve can then be determined by knowing the intended design velocity &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, the coefficient of friction, and the allowed superelevation on the curve.  

&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{{v^2 }}{{g\left( {e + f_s } \right)}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

With this radius, practitioners can determine the degree of curve to see if it falls within acceptable standards.  Degree of curve, &lt;math&gt;D_a&lt;/math&gt;, can be computed through the following formula, which is given in Metric.

&lt;math&gt;%R = \frac{{1746}}{{D_a }}
%\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;D_a\,\!&lt;/math&gt;= Degree of curve [angle subtended by a 30.5-m (100 ft) arc along the horizontal curve

One place you will see steep banking is at automobile racetracks. These tracks do not operate in winter, and so can avoid the problems of banking in winter weather. Drivers are also especially skilled, though crashes are not infrequent. For NASCAR fans, the following table may be of interest.

=== Geometric Properties ===

[[Image:Horizontal_Curve.JPG|thumb|A Typical Horizontal Curve (Plan View) | right| 250px]]

Horizontal curves occur at locations where two roadways intersect, providing a gradual transition between the two.  The intersection point of the two roads is defined as the '''Point of Tangent Intersection (PI)'''.  The location of the curve's start point is defined as the '''Point of Curve (PC)''' while the location of the curve's end point is defined as the '''Point of Tangent (PT)'''.  Both the PC and PT are a distance &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; from the PI, where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is defined as Tangent Length.  Tangent Length can be calculated by finding the central angle of the curve, in degrees.  This angle is equal to the supplement of the interior angle between the two road tangents.

&lt;math&gt;T = R\tan \left( {\frac{\Delta }{2}} \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;T\,\!&lt;/math&gt;= tangent length (in length units)
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;= central angle of the curve, in degrees
* &lt;math&gt;R\,\!&lt;/math&gt;= curve radius (in length units)

The distance between the PI and the vertex of the curve can be easily calculated by using the property of right triangles with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.  Taking this distance and subtracting off the curve radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the external distance &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, which is the smallest distance between the curve and PI, can be found.

&lt;math&gt;E = R\left( {\frac{1}{{\cos \left( {\frac{\Delta }{2}} \right)}} - 1} \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;E\,\!&lt;/math&gt;= external distance (in length units)

Similarly, the middle ordinate &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; can be found.  The middle ordinate is the maximum distance between a line drawn between PC and PT and the curve.  It falls along the line between the curve's vertex and the PI.

&lt;math&gt;M = R\left( {1 - \cos \left( {\frac{\Delta }{2}} \right)} \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;M\,\!&lt;/math&gt;= middle ordinate (in length units)

Curve length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; can be determined using the formula for semicircle length.

&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{{R\Delta \pi }}{{180}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the geometric formula for cord length can find &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, which represents the cord length for this curve.

&lt;math&gt;C = 2R\sin \left( {\frac{\Delta }{2}} \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Sight Distance Properties ===

[[Image:Costal_Redwood.jpg|thumb|Limited Curve Sight Distance Ahead| right| 200px]]

Unlike straight, level roads that would have a clear line of sight for a great distance, horizontal curves pose a unique challenge.  Natural terrain within the inside of the curve, such as trees, cliffs, or buildings, can potentially block a driver's view of the upcoming road if placed too close to the road.  As a result, the acceptable design speed is often reduced to account for sight distance restrictions.

Two scenarios exist when computing the acceptable sight distance for a given curve.  The first is where the sight distance is determined to be less than the curve length.  The second is where the sight distance exceeds the curve length.  Each scenario has a respective formula that produces sight distance based on geometric properties.  Determining which scenario is the correct one often requires testing both to find out which is true.  

Given a certain sight distance &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and a known curve length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and inner lane centerline radius &lt;math&gt;R_v&lt;/math&gt;, the distance a sight obstraction can be from the interior edge of the road, &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt; can be computed in the following formulas.

&lt;math&gt;S &lt; L: M_s = R_v\left( {1 - \cos \frac{{28.65S}}{R_v}} \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S&gt; L: M_s = R_v\left( {1 - \cos \frac{{28.65L}}{R_v}} \right) + \left( {\frac{{S - L}}{2}} \right)\sin \left( {\frac{{28.65L}}{R_v}} \right)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Example 1: Curve Radius===

{{TProblem |
A curving roadway has a design speed of 110 km/hr.  At one horizontal curve, the superelevation has been set at 6.0% and the coefficient of side friction is found to be 0.10.  Determine the minimum radius of the curve that will provide safe vehicle operation.
}}

{{Answer |
&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{{v^2 }}{{g\left( {e + f_s } \right)}} = \frac{{{(110*{(1000/3600))}}^2 }}{{9.8\left( {.06 + 0.10 } \right)}} = 595\ meters \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
}}

===Example 2: Determining Stationing===

{{TProblem |
A horizontal curve is designed with a 600 m radius and is known to have a tangent length of 52 m.  The PI is at station 200+00.  Determine the stationing of the PT.
}}

{{Answer |
[[Image:Horizontal_Curve_Example_2.JPG‎|thumb|300 px|What is known for this problem]]


&lt;math&gt;T = R\tan \left( {\frac{\Delta }{2}} \right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; 52 = 600\tan \left( {\frac{\Delta }{2}} \right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;{\Delta} = 9.9 \deg\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{{R \pi \Delta  }}{{180}} = \frac{{600 \pi 9.9 }}{{180}} = 104
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;PC = PI - T = 200+00\ -\ 0+52\ = 199+48 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;PT = PC + L = 199+48\ +\ 1+04\ = 200+52 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


}}

===Example 3: Stopping Sight Distance===

{{TProblem |
A very long horizontal curve on a one-directional racetrack has 1750-meter centerline radius, two 4-meter lanes, and a 200 km/hr design speed.  Determine the closest distance from the inside edge of the track that spectators can park without impeding the necessary sight distance of the drivers.  Assume that the sight distance is less than the length of the curve, a coefficient of friction of 0.3, and a perception-reaction time of 2.5 seconds.
}}

{{Answer |
With a centerline radius of 1750 meters, the centerline of the interior lane is 1748 meters from the vertex (1750 - (4/2)).  Using the stopping sight distance formula (See [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Sight Distance | Sight Distance]]), SSD is computed to be 664 meters.  With this, the distance from the track that spectators can be parked can easily be found.

&lt;math&gt;S &lt; L: M_s = R_v\left( {1 - \cos \frac{{28.65S}}{R_v}} \right) = 1748\left( {1 - \cos \frac{{28.65(664)}}{1748}} \right) = 31.43\ meters
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the distance (31.43 m)  to the center of the inside lane. Subtracting half the lane width (2m in this case) would give the distance to the edge of the track, 29.43 m.
}}

==Thought Question==

'''Problem'''

Horizontal curves are semicircles, as to allow the driver to negotiate the curve without having to change the tilt of the wheel while passing through.  However, what happens at the PC or PT, where tangent road transitions to a curve or vice versa.  Is the driver expected to abruptly turn the wheel to match the curve or tangent?

'''Solution'''

Generally not.  Engineers employ several techniques to allow drivers to gradually turn the wheel as they enter or leave the curve.  One of the more popular ways is to use Splines.  Splines are polynomial curves that have changing rates of curvature.  Employed at the PC and PT, Splines take away any sharp changes for the drivers and make the drive a more pleasant one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:SF Filbert St North Beach CA-e.jpg|thumb|right|366px|Filbert Street in San Francisco (North Beach)]]

'''Road Vehicle Performance''' forms the basics that make up highway design guidelines and traffic analysis.  Roads need to designed so that the vehicles traveling upon them are accommodated.  For example, the Interstate Highway system in the United States has a maximum allowable grade that can be used, so that the semitrucks that frequently use these roads would be able to travel them without encountering grade problems.  While this can pose quite a design challenge in mountainous regions like Colorado Rockies, without it those trucks would be forced to find better alternative routes, which costs time and money.  The ability of a certain vehicle type to use a road is dependent on the power produced by its motor, as well as other road-based and environmental characteristics.  When choosing a road design, these elements need to be considered.

== Illustration ==
[[File:Lombard Street.jpg|thumb|right|366px|Lombard Street in San Francisco]]

How steep is the grade in San Francisco? 
The famous Lombard Street, the curviest street in the world only has a grade of 14.3 %. The steepest street in San Francisco is  Filbert Street between Hyde and Leavenworth at a grade of  31.5 %. [http://www.sallys-place.com/travel/san_francisco/pt_lombard.htm reference]

Driving in San Francisco at times is like a roller coaster, you can’t see below the nose of your car sitting at the top of the hill, though you can usually see the base of the hill.

What is max grade allowed by law?  

Maximum grade is not regulated so much by law as by engineering standards. Maximum grade varies by type of road, and expected speed.  In practice, it depends on the alternatives: Is the alternative no road at all? Max grade in the relatively flat Minnesota might be lower than Max grade in mountainous Colorado where there are fewer alternatives. Some typical values for illustration:  
*	An interstate is out of standard if it has a grade &gt; 7%. 
*	The National Road (built in 1806) had a maximum grade of 8.75%.
*	Local roads are much higher (12% or 15% are sometimes allowed)
*	Otter Tail MN County roads 6%, alleys 8%
*	Driveways can be as much as 30% for a short distance

==Fundamental Characteristics==
[[Image:AASHTOSSD.png|thumb|400px|right|Forces acting on a vehicle]]
Tractive effort and resistance are the two main forces that oppose one another and determine the performance of roadway vehicles.  Tractive effort is the force exerted against the roadway surface to allow a vehicle to move forward.  Resistance encompasses all forces that push back and impede motion.  Both of these are in units of force.  The general formula for this is outlined below:

&lt;math&gt;  F_t  = ma + R_a  + R_{rl}  + R_g  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;F_t\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Tractive Effort
*  &lt;math&gt;m\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Vehicle Mass
*  &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Acceleration
*  &lt;math&gt;R_a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Aerodynamic Resistance
*  &lt;math&gt;R_{rl}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Rolling Resistance
*  &lt;math&gt;R_g\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Grade Resistance

These components are discussed in greater detail in the following sections.

===Aerodynamic Resistance===

Aerodynamic resistance is a force that is produced by turbulent air flow around the vehicle body.  This turbulence is dependent on the shape of the vehicle, as well as the friction of air passing over the vehicle's surface.  A small portion of this resistance comes from air flow through vehicle components, such as interior ventilation.  This resistance can be estimated through the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;R_a  = \frac{\rho }{2}AC_D V ^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;\rho\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Air Density
*  &lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Frontal area of the vehicle
*  &lt;math&gt;C_D\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Coefficient of Drag
*  &lt;math&gt;V\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Speed of the vehicle

Air density is a function of elevation and temperature.  Frontal area and coefficient of drag are generally unique to each vehicle or type of vehicle.

===Rolling Resistance===

Rolling resistance is caused by a vehicle's internal mechanical friction and the interaction of tires with the roadway surface.  Three main causes exist that create this resistance.  The first is the rigidity of the tire and the roadway surface.  The second is tire pressure and temperature.  The third is vehicular operating speed.  This value of rolling friction can be calculated from a very simplified formula, given here in metric.  &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is in meters per second.

&lt;math&gt;f_{rl} = 0.01(1+\frac{{V}}{{44.73}})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The resistance caused by this friction will increase as weight is added to the vehicle.  Therefore, rolling resistance can be calculated.

&lt;math&gt;R_{rl} = f_{rl}W\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;W\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Vehicle Weight
*  &lt;math&gt;f_{rl}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Rolling Friction

===Grade Resistance===

Grade resistance is the simplest form of resistance.  It is the gravitational force acting on the vehicle.  This force may not be exactly perpendicular to the roadway surface, especially in situations when a grade is present.  Thus, grade resistance can be calculated in the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;R_g = WG\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;W\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Vehicle Weight
*  &lt;math&gt;G\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Grade (length/length)

===Tractive Effort===

Tractive effort is the force that allows the vehicle to move forward, subject to the resistances of the previous three forces.  The derivation of the formula comes from understanding the forces and moments that on around the various tires.  It can be summarized into a simple concept, illustrated here.

For a rear-wheel drive car:

&lt;math&gt;F_{max} = \frac{{\mu W (l_f-f_{rl}h)/L}}{{1-\mu h /L}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For a front-wheel drive car:

&lt;math&gt;F_{max} = \frac{{\mu W (l_r+f_{rl}h)/L}}{{1+\mu h /L}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;F_{max}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Maximum Tractive Effort
*  &lt;math&gt;\mu\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Coefficient of road adhesion
*  &lt;math&gt;W\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Vehicle Weight
*  &lt;math&gt;l_r\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Distance from rear axle to vehicle's center of gravity
*  &lt;math&gt;l_f\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Distance from front axle to vehicle's center of gravity
*  &lt;math&gt;f_{rl}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Coefficient of rolling friction
*  &lt;math&gt;h\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Height of the center of gravity above the roadway surface
*  &lt;math&gt;L\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Length of wheelbase

===Grade Computation===

Most of the work surrounding tractive effort is geared toward determining the allowable grade of a given roadway.  With a certain known vehicle type using this road, the grade can be easily calculated.  Using the force balance equation for tractive effort, a value for grade can be separating, producing the formula below:

&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{{F_t  - F_a  - F_{rl} }}{W}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This calculation produces the maximum grade allowed for a given vehicle type.  It assumes that the vehicle is operating at optimal engine capacity and, thus, no acceleration can occur, dropping that element from the overall equation.

==Examples==

===Example 1: Racecar Acceleration===

{{TProblem |
A racecar is speeding down a level straightaway at 100 km/hr.  The car has a coefficient of drag of 0.3, a frontal area of 1.5 &lt;math&gt;m^2&lt;/math&gt;, a weight of 10 kN, a wheelbase of 3 meters, and a center of gravity 0.5 meters above the roadway surface, which is 1 meter behind the front axle.  The air density is 1.054 kg/&lt;math&gt;m^3&lt;/math&gt; and the coefficient of road adhesion is 0.6.  What is the maximum possible rate of acceleration for the vehicle?
}}

{{Answer |
Use the force balancing equation to solve for &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;  F_t  = ma + R_a  + R_{rl}  + R_g  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Since the straightaway is a level one, the grade is zero, thus removing grade resistance from the general problem.

&lt;math&gt;  R_g = 0  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Aerodynamic resistance is computed:

&lt;math&gt;R_a  = \frac{\rho }{2}AC_D V ^2 = \frac{1.054}{2}(1.5)(0.3) (100 * 1000/3600) ^2 = 183\ N \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Rolling resistance is computed:

&lt;math&gt;f_{rl} = 0.01(1+\frac{{V}}{{44.73}}) = 0.01(1+\frac{{100 * 1000/3600}}{{44.73}}) = 0.016 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R_{rl} = f_{rl}W = 0.016(10000) = 160\ N \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Tractive Effort is computed:

&lt;math&gt;F_{max} = \frac{{\mu W (l_f-f_{rl}h)/L}}{{1+\mu h /L}} = \frac{{0.6 (10000) (1-0.016(0.5))/3}}{{1-0.6 (0.5) /3}} = 2204\ N \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Looking back to the force balancing equation:

&lt;math&gt;  ma = F_t - R_a  - R_{rl}  - R_g = 2204 - 183 - 160 - 0 = 1861\ N \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Divide out mass, which can be computed from weight by dividing out gravity.

&lt;math&gt; W = mg\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{{W}}{{g}} = \frac{{10000}}{{9.8}} = 1020\ kg\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, divide mass from the force and acceleration can be found.

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{{F}}{{m}} = \frac{{1861}}{{1020}} = 1.82\ m/s^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the vehicle is accelerating at a rate of 1.82 meters per second squared.
}}

===Example 2: Going Up a Hill===

{{TProblem |
Using the same case from Example 1, assume that instead the racecar encounters a steep hill that it must travel up.  It is desired that the driver maintain the 100 km/hr velocity at a very minimum.  With that being said, what would be the maximum grade that the hill could be?
}}

{{Answer |
At the steepest eligible hill, the racecar would be able to maintain 100 km/hr without any room for acceleration or deceleration.  Therefore, acceleration goes to zero.  All other values would stay the same from Example 1.  Using the grade formula, the maximum grade can be calculated.

&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{{F_t  - F_a  - F_{rl} }}{W} = \frac{{2204  - 183  - 160 }}{10000} = 0.1861
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The maximum allowable grade is 18.61%.
}}

==Thought Question==

'''Problem'''

Why is it that, in mountainous country, trucks and cars have different speed limits?

'''Answer'''

Tractive effort is one of the leading reasons, as trucks have a harder time going up steep hills than typical passenger cars, but it is not the only one.  Safety is another leading reason, surprisingly, as big rig trucks are obviously more difficult to control in a harsh environment, such as a mountain pass.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vertical Curves''' are the second of the two important transition elements in geometric design for highways, the first being [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Horizontal Curves|Horizontal Curves]].  A vertical curve provides a transition between two sloped roadways, allowing a vehicle to negotiate the elevation rate change at a gradual rate rather than a sharp cut.  The design of the curve is dependent on the intended design speed for the roadway, as well as other factors including drainage, slope, acceptable rate of change, and friction.  These curves are parabolic and are assigned stationing based on a horizontal axis.

==Fundamental Curve Properties==

===Parabolic Formulation===

[[Image:Centerline_Rumble_Strip.jpg|thumb|A Road Through Hilly Terrain with Vertical Curves in New Hampshire| right| 350px]]

[[Image:Vertical_Curve.PNG|thumb|A Typical Crest Vertical Curve (Profile View)| right|350px]]

Two types of vertical curves exist: (1) Sag Curves and (2) Crest Curves.  Sag curves are used where the change in grade is positive, such as valleys, while crest curves are used when the change in grade is negative, such as hills.  Both types of curves have three defined points: PVC (Point of Vertical Curve), PVI (Point of Vertical Intersection), and PVT (Point of Vertical Tangency).  PVC is the start point of the curve while the PVT is the end point.  The elevation at either of these points can be computed as &lt;math&gt;e_{PVC}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_{PVT}&lt;/math&gt; for PVC and PVT respectively.  The roadway grade that approaches the PVC is defined as &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt; and the roadway grade that leaves the PVT is defined as &lt;math&gt;g_2&lt;/math&gt;.  These grades are generally described as being in units of (m/m) or (ft/ft), depending on unit type chosen.

Both types of curves are in parabolic form.  Parabolic functions have been found suitable for this case because they provide a constant rate of change of slope and imply equal curve tangents, which will be discussed shortly.  The general form of the parabolic equation is defined below, where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the elevation for the parabola.

&lt;math&gt;y = ax^2 + bx + c\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

At x = 0, which refers to the position along the curve that corresponds to the PVC, the elevation equals the elevation of the PVC.  Thus, the value of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;e_{PVC}&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, the slope of the curve at x = 0 equals the incoming slope at the PVC, or &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the value of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt;.  When looking at the second derivative, which equals the rate of slope change, a value for &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; can be determined.

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{{g_2 - g_1}}{{2L}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the parabolic formula for a vertical curve can be illustrated.

&lt;math&gt;y = e_{PVC} + g_1x + \frac{{(g_2 - g_1)x^2}}{{2L}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;e_{pvc}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: elevation of the PVC

*  &lt;math&gt;g_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Initial Roadway Grade (m/m)

*  &lt;math&gt;g_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Final Roadway Grade (m/m)

*  &lt;math&gt;L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Length of Curve (m)

Most vertical curves are designed to be Equal Tangent Curves.  For an Equal Tangent Curve, the horizontal length between the PVC and PVI equals the horizontal length between the PVI and the PVT.  These curves are generally easier to design.

===Offset===

Some additional properties of vertical curves exist.  Offsets, which are vertical distances from the initial tangent to the curve, play a significant role in vertical curve design.  The formula for determining offset is listed below.

&lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{{Ax^2}}{{200L}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: The absolute difference between &lt;math&gt;g_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt;, multiplied by 100 to translate to a percentage

*  &lt;math&gt;L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Curve Length

*  &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Horizontal distance from PVC along curve

===Stopping Sight Distance===

Sight distance is dependent on the type of curve used and the design speed.  For crest curves, sight distance is limited by the curve itself, as the curve is the obstruction.  For sag curves, sight distance is generally only limited by headlight range.  AASHTO has several tables for sag and crest curves that recommend rates of curvature, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, given a design speed or stopping sight distance.  These rates of curvature can then be multiplied by the absolute slope change percentage, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to find the recommended curve length, &lt;math&gt;L_m&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;L_m = KA\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Without the aid of tables, curve length can still be calculated.  Formulas have been derived to determine the minimum curve length for required sight distance for an equal tangent curve, depending on whether the curve is a sag or a crest.  Sight distance can be computed from formulas in other sections (See [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Sight Distance | Sight Distance]]).

====Crest Vertical Curves====

The correct equation is dependent on the design speed.  If the sight distance is found to be less than the curve length, the first formula below is used, whereas the second is used for sight distances that are greater than the curve length.  Generally, this requires computation of both to see which is true if curve length cannot be estimated beforehand.

&lt;math&gt;S&lt;L: L_m = \frac{{AS^2 }}{{200\left( {\sqrt {h_1 }  + \sqrt {h_2 } } \right)^2 }}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S&gt;L: L_m = 2S - \frac{{200\left( {\sqrt {h_1 }  + \sqrt {h_2 } } \right)^2 }}{A}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;L_m\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Minimum Curve Length (m)

*  &lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: The absolute difference between &lt;math&gt;g_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt;, multiplied by 100 to translate to a percentage

*  &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Sight Distance (m)

*  &lt;math&gt;h_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Height of driver's eye above roadway surface (m)

*  &lt;math&gt;h_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Height of objective above roadway surface (m)

====Sag Vertical Curves====

Just like with crest curves, the correct equation is dependent on the design speed.  If the sight distance is found to be less than the curve length, the first formula below is used, whereas the second is used for sight distances that are greater than the curve length.  Generally, this requires computation of both to see which is true if curve length cannot be estimated beforehand.

&lt;math&gt;S&lt;L: L_m = \frac{{AS^2 }}{{200\left( {H + S\tan \beta } \right)}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S&gt;L: L_m = 2S - \frac{{200\left( {H + S\tan \beta } \right)}}{A}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: The absolute difference between &lt;math&gt;g_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt;, multiplied by 100 to translate to a percentage

*  &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Sight Distance (m)

*  &lt;math&gt;H\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Height of headlight (m)

*  &lt;math&gt;\beta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Inclined angle of headlight beam, in degrees

===Passing Sight Distance===

In addition to stopping sight distance, there may be instances where passing may be allowed on vertical curves.  For sag curves, this is not an issue, as even at night, a vehicle in the opposing can be seen from quite a distance (with the aid of the vehicle's headlights).  For crest curves, however, it is still necessary to take into account.  Like with the stopping sight distance, two formulas are available to answer the minimum length question, depending on whether the passing sight distance is greater than or less than the curve length.  These formulas use units that are in metric.

&lt;math&gt;S&lt;L: L_m = \frac{{A(PSD^2) }}{{864}}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S&gt;L: L_m = 2PSD - \frac{{864}}{A}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*  &lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: The absolute difference between &lt;math&gt;g_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt;, multiplied by 100 to translate to a percentage

*  &lt;math&gt;PSD\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Passing Sight Distance (m)

*  &lt;math&gt;L_m\,\!&lt;/math&gt;: Minimum curve length (m)

==Examples==

===Example 1: Basic Curve Information===

{{TProblem |
A 500-meter equal-tangent sag vertical curve has the PVC at station 100+00 with an elevation of 1000 m.  The initial grade is -4% and the final grade is +2%.  Determine the stationing and elevation of the PVI, the PVT, and the lowest point on the curve.
}}

{{Answer |
The curve length is stated to be 500 meters.  Therefore, the PVT is at station 105+00 (100+00 + 5+00) and the PVI is in the very middle at 102+50, since it is an equal tangent curve.  For the parabolic formulation, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; equals the elevation at the PVC, which is stated as 1000 m.  The value of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; equals the initial grade, which in decimal is -0.04.  The value of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; can then be found as 0.00006.

Using the general parabolic formula, the elevation of the PVT can be found:

&lt;math&gt;y = 0.00006x^2 + -.04x + 1000 = 0.00006(500)^2+ -.04(500) + 1000 = 995\ m \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Since the PVI is the intersect of the two tangents, the slope of either tangent and the elevation of the PVC or PVT, depending, can be used as reference.  The elevation of the PVI can then be found:

&lt;math&gt;y = -0.04x + 1000 = -0.04(250) + 1000 = 990\ m \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

To find the lowest part of the curve, the first derivative of the parabolic formula can be found.  The lowest point has a slope of zero, and thus the low point location can be found:

&lt;math&gt;dy/dx = 0.00012x + -.04 = 0.00012x + -.04 = 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = 333.33\ m \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Using the parabolic formula, the elevation can be computed for that location.  It turns out to be at an elevation of 993.33 m, which is the lowest point along the curve.
}}

===Example 2: Adjustment for Obstacles===

{{TProblem |
A current roadway is climbing a hill at an angle of +3.0%.  The roadway starts at station 100+00 and elevation of 1000 m.  At station 110+00, there is an at-grade railroad crossing that goes over the sloped road.  Since designers are concerned for the safety of drivers crossing the tracks, it has been proposed to cut a level tunnel through the hill to pass beneath the railroad tracks and come out on the opposite side.  A vertical crest curve would connect the existing roadway to the proposed tunnel with a grade of (-0.5)%.  The prospective curve would start at station 100+00 and have a length of 2000 meters.  Engineers have stated that there must be at least 10 meters of separation between the railroad tracks and the road to build a safe tunnel.  Assume an equal tangent curve.  With the current design, is this criteria met?
}}

{{Answer |

[[Image:Vertical_Curve_Example_2.JPG| thumb| 370 px]]

One way to solve this problem would be to compute the elevation of the curve at station 110+00 and then see if it is at least 10 meters from the tangent.  Another way would be to use the Offset Formula.  Since A, L, and x are all known, this problem can be easily solved.  Set x to 1000 meters to represent station 110+00.



&lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{{Ax^2}}{{200L}} = \frac{{(3.5)(1000)^2}}{{200(2000)}} = 8.75\ m \,\!&lt;/math&gt;



The design DOES NOT meet the criteria.

}}

===Example 3: Stopping Sight Distance===

{{TProblem |
A current roadway has a design speed of 100 km/hr, a coefficient of friction of 0.1, and carries drivers with perception-reaction times of 2.5 seconds.  The drivers use cars that allows their eyes to be 1 meter above the road.  Because of ample roadkill in the area, the road has been designed for carcasses that are 0.5 meters in height.  All curves along that road have been designed accordingly.  

The local government, seeing the potential of tourism in the area and the boost to the local economy, wants to increase the speed limit to 110 km/hr to attract summer drivers.  Residents along the route claim that this is a horrible idea, as a particular curve called &quot;Dead Man's Hill&quot; would earn its name because of sight distance problems.  &quot;Dead Man's Hill&quot; is a crest curve that is roughly 600 meters in length.  It starts with a grade of +1.0% and ends with (-1.0)%.  There has never been an accident on &quot;Dead Man's Hill&quot; as of yet, but residents truly believe one will come about in the near future.

A local politician who knows little to nothing about engineering (but thinks he does) states that the 600-meter length is a long distance and more than sufficient to handle the transition of eager big-city drivers.  Still, the residents push back, saying that 600 meters is not nearly the distance required for the speed.  The politician begins a lengthy campaign to &quot;Bring Tourism to Town&quot;, saying that the residents are trying to stop &quot;progress&quot;.  As an engineer, determine if these residents are indeed making a valid point or if they are simply trying to stop progress?
}}

{{Answer |
Using sight distance formulas from other sections, it is found that 100 km/hr has an SSD of 465 meters and 110 km/hr has an SSD of 555 meters, given the criteria stated above.  Since both 465 meters and 555 meters are less than the 600-meter curve length, the correct formula to use would be:

&lt;math&gt;S&lt;L: L_m = \frac{{AS^2 }}{{200\left( {\sqrt {h_1 }  + \sqrt {h_2 } } \right)^2 }} = \frac{{2(555)^2 }}{{200\left( {\sqrt {1.0 }  + \sqrt {0.5 } } \right)^2 }} = 1055\ m \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Since the 1055-meter minimum curve length is greater than the current 600-meter length on &quot;Dead Man's Hill&quot;, this curve would not meet the sight distance requirements for 110 km/hr.

This seems like a very large gap.  The question becomes, was the curve even good enough at 100 km/hr?  Using the same formula, the result is:

&lt;math&gt;S&lt;L: L_m = \frac{{AS^2 }}{{200\left( {\sqrt {h_1 }  + \sqrt {h_2 } } \right)^2 }} = \frac{{2(465)^2 }}{{200\left( {\sqrt {1.0 }  + \sqrt {0.5 } } \right)^2 }} = 740\ m \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

740 meters for a minimum curve length is far greater than the existing 600-meter curve.  Therefore, the residents are correct in saying that &quot;Dead Man's Hill&quot; is a disaster waiting to happen.  As a result, the politician, unable to hold public confidence by his &quot;progress&quot; comment, was forced to resign.
}}

==Thought Question==

'''Problem'''

Sag curves have sight distance requirements because of nighttime sight distance constraints.  The headlights on cars have a limited angle at which they can shine with bright enough intensity to see objects far off in the distance.  If the government were to allow a wider angle of light to be cast out on standard car headlights, would this successfully provide more stopping sight distance?

'''Solution'''

Yes, of course.  For a single car traveling on a road with many sag curves, the design speed could be increased since more road could be seen.  However, when additional cars were added to that same road, problems would begin to appear.  With a greater angle of light being cast from headlights, drivers in opposing lanes would be severely blinded, forcing them to slow down to avoid causing an accident.  Just think of the last time somebody drove by with their 'brights' on and blinded you.  This problem could cause more accidents and force people to slow down, thus producing a net loss overall.

==Variables==

* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; - Curve Length

* &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; - Elevation of designated point, such as PVC, PVT, etc.

* &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; - Grade

* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; - Absolute difference of grade percentages for a certain curve, in percent

* &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; - Elevation of curve

* &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; - Offset between grade tangent from PVC and curve elevation for a specific station

* &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; - Height of driver's eye above roadway surface

* &lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt; - Height of object above roadway surface

* &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; - Height of headlight

* &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; - Inclined angle of headlight beam, in degrees

* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; - Sight Distance in question

* &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; - Rate of curvature

* &lt;math&gt;L_m&lt;/math&gt; - Minimum Curve Length

==Key Terms==

* PVC: Point of Vertical Curve

* PVI: Point of Vertical Intersection

* PVT: Point of Vertical Tangent

* Crest Curve: A curve with a negative grade change (like on a hill)

* Sag Curve: A curve with a positive grade change (like in a valley)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page details the POSper build process/layout/structure using maven.

1) The root directory pom file delegates all the interesting build stuff to the plugins directory.

2) the plugins directory pom file simply enumerates the existing modules, including but not limited to core, where the interesting build stuff happens

The pom files for the various plugins have their own artifact id and name, but they share dependency on the maven-compiler-plugin (to compile themselves), maven-jpf-plugin (because they're all plugins), and maven-surefire-plugin (for testing) in their build/plugins section.  

They also all use repo.posper.org and telscenter.org as their repositories, and repo.posper.org as their plugin repository.

The modules other than core are currently limited to build dependencies on jpf and the core plugin.  This means that all the stuff they need to get their jobs done (eg, jasper.reports for the reports plugin) they access from what core integrates.

The core module has a whole laundry list of dependencies, many of which are strictly for the other plugins.  The one dependency that makes it stand out as the foundation of POSper is the jpf-boot dependency, indicating that the core is needed to boot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">1) the startup command from the devel directory is java -jar lib/jpf-boot.jar --entry=JFrmTPV

2) jpf-boot checks for boot.properties, and sees that org.posper.core is the application plugin

3) looks in the plugins directory and finds the plugin.xml configuration for core, reports, and openbravosync and loads them all in

4) the core plugins AppCore is launched, which recognizes JFrmTPV was the entry point (JFrmConfig is the alternative) and JFrmTPV gets launched.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pro-sumti are words that describe other sumti without specifically mentioning them- kind of like &quot;he&quot; or &quot;this&quot; in English.  Unlike English, Lojban has sumti with only one possible interpretation (&quot;he&quot; does not: There are Bill and Charlie.  He hit him. ''(Who hit whom?)''').

== Vocabulary ==

 ri                   the last sumti, as determined by back-counting rules
               ''la suzyn. bajra .i ri klama la xustyn.''
                              Susan runs.  She (Susan) is going to Houston''
               ''la suzyn. rinsa la bret. .i ri melnau''
                              Susan greets Bret.  He (Bret) is handsome (literally &quot;beauty-type-man&quot;)  
 ra                   a recent sumti before the last one, as determined by back-counting rules
               Usually is used as &quot;Susan&quot; in: ''la suzyn. rinsa la bret. .i ri melnau ra''
                              Susan greets Bret.  He (Bret) is handsome to her (Susan).
               However, it is not required to be used in the just previous example
                              (it could refer to a sumti even before Susan)
 ru            a remote past sumti, before all other in-use backcounting sumti
               Used as &quot;''ra''&quot; is to &quot;''ri''&quot;
 goi                  assigns the just following pro-sumti to the just previous sumti/tanru
               assigns a pro-sumti of selma'o KOhA4 (such as: ''ko'a'', ''ko'e'', ''fo'a'', ''fo'e'', etc.)
 ge'u          terminates [goi] pro-sumti assigning action (almost always elidable)
 da'o                 cancels all pro-sumti assignment
 da                   someone/something (unspecified but important) 1
               there exists something 1 (usually restricted)
 de                   someone/something (unspecified but important) 2
               there exists something 2 (usually restricted)
 di                   someone/something (unspecified but important) 3
               there exists something 3 (usually restricted)

== Additional Notes and/or Examples ==

*After any occurrence of a cmavo belonging to selma'o KOhA4 (''ko'a'', ''fo'a'', etc.) &quot;''cu''&quot; is not necessary, unless if the utternace is complex.
*The &quot;counting-back rule&quot; used for &quot;''ri''&quot;, &quot;''ra''&quot;, &quot;''ru''&quot; does not include selma'o KOhA4.
**&quot;la suzyn. goi ko'a zgani lo nanmu .i ko'a se melbi ri&quot; = Susan sees that which is really a man (the man).  He (the man/lo nanmu) is beautiful to Susan.
*&quot;''ra''&quot; can be used in place of &quot;''ri''&quot; (meaning that they both can refer to the immediately preceding predicate argument), unless if &quot;''ri''&quot; is already in use for the intended anaphora:
**[lo smuci .i lo forca .i la djen. pu pilno ri .i la rik. pilno ra] = There exist at least of spoon.  There exist at least on fork.  Jen used (the-immediately-preceding-sumti = '''a fork''').  Rick uses (somewhat-distant-sumti = '''a spoon''').
***If &quot;''ri''&quot; did not occur, but was replaced by &quot;''ra''&quot; - [lo smuci .i lo forca .i la djen. pu pilno &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''ra'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] - &quot;''ra''&quot; could refer to &quot;a fork&quot;.
**This rule also applies to &quot;''ra''&quot; and &quot;''ru''&quot;, respectively, as well.
*[''goi''] need not always assign a pro-sumti from the KOhA4 series
**[lo tricu goi .ytoi (cu) melbi mi .i .ytoi banro] = The tree is good-looking to me.  The tree is growing.
***In the immediately previous example, any occurrence of [''.ytoi''] refers to [''lo tricu''] specifically, not any [[''tricu''], nor anything else.
**[ko'e goi la samantas. (ge'u) (cu) melbi] = Party&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, henceforth known as &quot;Samantha&quot;, is beautiful.
***The immediately previous utterance is equivalent to [la samantas. goi ko'e (ge'u) (cu) melbi] (which is, in English &quot;Samantha, henceforth known as &quot;Party&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is beautiful&quot;), therefore [goi] is symmetric.
***This sentence does not imply that the name of [ko'e] is &quot;Samantha&quot;, nor is [ko'e] normally called &quot;Samantha&quot;.  It merely states that &quot;Samantha&quot; is a term, almost chosen at random, that will be used to identify [ko'e] for that writing.
*[ge'u] differs from [da'o]: [ge'u] just terminates the action of assignment; while [da'o] terminates the pro-sumti meaning what it previously meant.
***[la nevil. goi ko'i ge'u (cu) dunku le du'u rirni jai fenki] = Neville, henceforth known as &quot;[ko'i]&quot;, is anguished by the notion of his parent's being crazy
::::Not: Neville, henceforth known as &quot;[ko'i (cu) dunku le du'u rirni jai fenki]&quot;
***[la nevil. da'o cu virnu] = Neville, no longer dubbed &quot;[ko'i]&quot;, is brave
*The precise definition of [le go'i], and (by extension) any of its relatives, is &quot;that which is described as doing the previous bridi&quot;.
**[le xekri mlatu cu klama le zarci .i le go'i cu cadzu le bisli] = The black cat goes to the store.  The cat (that is black and goes to the store) walks on the ice.

=== Pro-sumti as Rafsi ===

*The most prominent way of using pro-sumti as rafsi is to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached
**as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
**[donta'a] &lt;small&gt;([do] = you; [tavla] = talk)&lt;/small&gt; = [tavla be do] 
***x1=tavla1 talks to you about subject x2=tavla3 in language x3=tavla4
****since tavla2 (the addressee) is already known to be [do] (you). 
**[donma'o] &lt;small&gt;([do] = you; [cmavo] = structure word)&lt;/small&gt; = [cmavo be zo do]
***x1=cmavo1 is a second person pronoun in language x2=cmavo4
****Since both the cmavo2 place (the grammatical class) and the cmavo3 place (the meaning) are obvious from the context [do].
*cmavo of series KOhA4 ([ko'a], [ko'e], [ko'i]...) terjvo (predicate arguments that make up a lujvo) which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.)
**[fo'a goi le kulnrsu,omi .i lo fo'arselsanga] = x6 stands for Finnish-culture.  An x6-song
*Lujvo involving [zi'o] are also possible. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for [zi'o] as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. 
**Consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a [se pinxe be zi'o] the lujvo corresponding to this is [zilrelselpinxe] (deleting the second place of [se pinxe]). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one.
***[zilpavypinxe] = [zilrelselpinxe]
***[lo zilpavypinxe] = [lo zilrelselpinxe] refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
*The pro-bridi [co'e'], [du], and [bu'a] also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu.
**The resulting lujvo have (except for [du]-based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A change in ownership can be because of many different factors. When ownership changes (for example from a Private Limited Company to a Public Limited Company) there may be a change in focus. For example, a private company typically has few, if any, institutional investors and a stable shareholder register. This allows the company to focus on very long term goals, to retain profit for future investment, etc. A public company, in contrast, will have a more diverse and changeable shareholder base. This can lead to the company needing to maintain or increase income distributions year-on-year which could be against the best long term interests of the company. 

== Takeovers and mergers ==
These are the main ways change in ownership can occur.

=== Takeovers ===
This is where one company takes control of another. It can be an agreed takeover which happens when a current owner and an external person agrees a price which the share of the company is sold for. It can also occur in hostile conditions where a potential owner goes about collecting shares, buying off the market when they are made available and trying to get a large enough share to control the company. In the United Kingdom, public company take overs are governed by the Take Over Panel and company law. These set rules around how a stake is accumulated, the timetable for making an offer, etc. They also ensure all shareholders are treated equally. 

Many advantages can be taken for the new owner. These include:
*Brand name retained
*Reputation retained
*Customer base retained
*Staff/expertise retained
*Patents and designs retained

Even if the failing companies get taken over, the best parts of the companies can be retained, or the market share can still mean a larger market share (e.g., Volkswagen take-over of Skoda - Skoda before the takeover was known as a bad quality car but Volkswagen then put its engines and reliability into Skoda and before long Skoda became a good quality car at a lower price point).

Disadvantages can also be experienced:
*Not only the good parts of companies are taken over, but also the bad parts
*The cost of completely taking it over can be huge

=== Mergers ===
Two companies may decide to join together to gain synergies. This could be where the companies have complimentary products (allowing a wider range to be offered or to cover a greater geographic area), have significant overlap (allowing duplication and hence cost to be eliminated) or other reasons. This is called a merger. An example is the now HBOS where Halifax and the Bank of Scotland merged and also Lloyds TSB when Lloyds merged with Trustee Savings Bank. Lastly when two gaming companies merged called Activision and Blizzard to form Activision Blizzard.

== Integration ==
=== Vertical Integration ===
=== Horizontal Integration ===
=== Conglomerate ===

Hello and Welcome King Crusaders.  I just wanted to thank you for your work on [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Bread Dough]].  As you can tell, the Arts and Crafts section of this book could really use a lot of help (it's not my strong point).  If you have any questions about the project or about formatting Wiki text, please do not hesitate to drop me a note (either on your talk page, or on [[User_talk:Jomegat|mine]].  I'll see it either way).

Thanks again! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:01, 3 April 2008 (UTC)

== Adding Images ==

Hi King Crusader,

There's a pretty nice tutorial on doing this at [[Editing Wikitext]]. Without a better description of you problem, I can't offer more specific help.  Where are the images you were trying to add?  They have to be either at [http://commons.wikimedia.org Wikimedia Commons] or on the Wikibooks site. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:54, 4 April 2008 (UTC)

== [[:Template:Species id]] ==
Hi KC,

I have added the [[:Template:Species id|Species id]] template to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Marine Invertebrates|Marine Invertebrates]] honor for the Tunicate.  Take a look and you can see how that's done.  It pretty easy to do, and if you like it, you can add it to the rest of the MI's listed in requirement one. Another thing you might consider is simplifying some of the language imported from Wikipedia.  There are a lot of technical terms in there that should either be reworded or chopped out.  For example, most people (me included) have no clue what a metanephridial organ or mesenchyme are. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:48, 5 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ExpectationViolationException ==

The first time I got an ExpectationViolationException , I was baffled.&amp;nbsp; Here's what it looked like:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;failed: Rhino.Mocks.Exceptions.ExpectationViolationException :
IInternalSearchService.ProcessIndexingRequest(collaboration.thecompany.com.internalServiceContractsObjects._2007._12.AuthenticationCredentials,
&quot;Zardoz&quot;, \[collaboration.thecompany.com.internalSearch._2007._12.IndexingWork\]); Expected #0, Actual #1.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;
IInternalSearchService.ProcessIndexingRequest(collaboration.thecompany.com.internalServiceContractsObjects._2007._12.AuthenticationCredentials,
&quot;Zardoz&quot;, \[collaboration.thecompany.com.internalSearch._2007._12.IndexingWork\]); Expected #1, Actual #0.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|}
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Cryptic, and ultimately not very helpful (at least to me). Basically, all you know when seeing this is that something went wrong with an expectation you set up in your test. Here are a few more things to know, and things you can do to try and debug these kinds of problems:

* Expectations have to do with both the expected calls _and_ the expected parameters. If, in your test, you say something like, Expect.Call(myMock.DoSomething(fooObject)), Rhino.Mocks expects that myMock.DoSomething will be called with _the exact instance_ of fooObject.

* When Rhino.Mocks compares expected parameters (like fooObject in the previous point), it uses the object's Equals() method. This means that even if your expected object has all the same property values, etc., comparison will fail unless you are able to pass the _exact_ expected instance (or unless you override Equals(), which is generally a not-so-great idea). In 3.4, Rhino.Mocks introduced the Property.AllPropertiesMatch() constraint which does a reflective property comparison for objects, e.g.,
{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;Expect.Call(myMock.DoSomething(fooObject)).IgnoreArguments().Constraints(Property.AllPropertiesMatch(fooObject));&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|}
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
: I.e., expect a call to myMock.DoSomething, &quot;ignoring&quot; all passed arguments, but constrained by the following: that the first arguments properties match fooObject's properites exactly.

* You can add a Rhino.Mocks logger to print data to the console. This can give a bit more detail on what's happening where and why. Just add the following line to your test, before the mocking work:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background:lightgrey;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;
RhinoMocks.Logger = new TextWriterExpectationLogger(Console.Out);
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|}
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* When Rhino.Mocks compares two objects during expectation validation, and something goes wrong, the data you get in the exception message comes from the ToString() on the objects. So, you can override ToString() in the class of the objects which are being compared; override it to give you some info about what might be going wrong with the comparison (like, override it to spit out the various properties on the objects).

== Waves ==
*A '''Sound wave''' from a tuning fork moves at 340 m/s. It has a wave length of 2.43m. What is it's frequency?
 Wave Speed = wavelength * frequency
 340m/s/2.43m = 139.91Hz 

*Name, and describe two types of waves that we discussed in class.

 '''Transverse Wave''': motion of the particle is perpendicular to the direction of the wave
 '''Longitudinal Wave''': motion of the particle move the same direction

* A wave is traveling with a frequency of 70.0 Hz and has a wavelength of 50 m.  What is the speed of this wave?

 velocity= wavelength X frequency
 velocity= 50 m X 70.0 Hz
 velocity= 3500 m/s

* As a wave moves, intensity _________ with distance, and ________ as it passes through a material.

 Intensity '''DECREASES''' with distance, and '''DECREASES''' as it passes through a materal.

* What is the definition of a wave?
 Any Pattern with an indentifable periodicity in space and time. No matter is transferred but energy is.

* A wave has a wavelenght of 70m and a frequencey of 80Hz. How fast would this particular wave be traveling?

 = Wavelength x frequency
 = 70m x 80HZ
 = 5600m/s


* Illustrate [[diffraction]]

* Illustrate [[Hugen's Principle]]? 
 At a time(t) consider everypoint on a wave front, a new point source. 

* What are the names for the highest and lowest points of a wave?
  crest and trough




=== Sound ===
1. For '''sound''' waves, as the _________ of a material increases, _________ increases

 '''Density''' and '''Velocity''' 
 
2. Dolphins can hear noises at the frequency of 250 kHz. If a dolphin hears a sound with this frequency that is moving with a velocity of 1700 m/s what is it's wavelength?

 Use the equation v=λf, for this problem it is v/f=λ. First convert 250kHz to 250000Hz. 
 1700m/s divided by 250000Hz = 6.8x10^3m

3.  Sound cannot travel through a vacume because it needs what?

      Sound needs a medium to travel through. (solid, liquid, or gas)

4. What is Refraction when dealing with sound waves?

 An abrupt change in wave speed at boundary of two mediums.

5. What is the equation for Refraction?

 f = v1/wavelength = v2/wavelength2

=== Electromagnetic Waves ===

* What are the seven type of waves in the electromagnetic spectrum in order of their size (largest to smallest)?
 Radio waves, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma rays. 

* The wave-like properties of electromagnetic radiation are due to what?
 The periodic oscillations in the electric and magnetic components.

# If a wave is traveling at a velocity of 3.8m/s and the end of the wave reaches where the fron t of the wave started in 15s.
 Wavelength=velocity / Frequency
 3.8m/s x 15s=
 57m/s(squared)

* If an AM radio wave has a length of 300 m , what is it's frequency?

 Frequency = speed of light (c) / wave length
 Frequncy= (3 x 10^8 m/s)/ 300 m
 Frequency= 1 x 10^7 Hz

* An electromagnetic wave has a frequncy of 1.5x10^7 Hz, what is the lenth of the wave?
   c is constant. c=3x10^8 m/s
 legth=c/f=3x10^8/1.5x10^7Hz=20m

== Light ==

* What's the difference between a '''convex mirror''' and a '''concave mirror'''?
 A convex mirror curves away from you and a concave mirror curves toward the viewer.

* What can the size of an infrared light wave be compared to physically? (e.g. a bread box, an atom, etc).

 a pinhead

=== Reflection===
1. A beam of light is sitting in the floor 45 degree and it is shining to a mirror that was sitting at the floor 90 degree, if the mirror turn 45 degree where the light is pointing to and the light remain the same position, what will be the new reflection angle? (Hint: follow the wording use the diagram only as a guide)
[[Image:morrior reflection.jpg]]

 No reflection will occour because the mirror and the light become parallel.


=== Refraction ===

Empty
=== Lighting ===
==== CFL ====
* A '''Compact Fluorescent Light bulb''' (or [http://www.appropedia.org/CFL CFL]) uses roughly ____ percentage of the electrical wattage needed for an incandescent light bulb to produce the same amount of light.
 Answer: 25%


* True or false   CFL's are a more economical choice over the standard incandescent bulbs
  Answer: True

* If a house has 20 light fixtures and they switch to CFL's, that save $32 per bulb, how much will the household save?
  Answer: 20 x 32
          $640

*CFL Bulbs that have the equivalent power of a 60 Watt Incandescent bulb have ____ watts.

   Answer: 15 watts

*If you have 10 fixtures to replace with CFL light bulbs and the total costs over 8,000 hrs of illumination at Clarion rate of $0.0615 per kW-hr are$18.30 per fixture. How much will your initial costs be to replace the light bulbs with the energy saving bulbs?

   Answer: $18.30*10=$183 as your initial cost for CFL bulbs


*How do CFL light bulbs differ from incandescent light bulbs?
 
 Answer: CFL's use mercury vapor and when the mercury vapor is exposed to an
 electrical current the electrons begin to move quickly, emitting light.   An
 Incandescent light bulb uses a filament which emits mostly heat, which makes it   
 much less efficient.  

*If a CFL light bulb has a pay back time of 5.4 months and you save 1.12 per month and the life time is 3 years, what is your total return on investment?

 Answers: 36 months - 5.4 = 31.6 months x $1.12 = $35.40


==== LEDs ====

Nothing

==  Energy ==
* What is the formula for electrical '''energy'''?

 Answer: Energy=Power(Time)

* Name 5 forms of energy
     Light, chemical, electrical, lastic, nuclear, sound, thermal, gravitational.

* How much energy is being used while using 3000 watts for 5 hours?
     E=Pt = [w][hrs]
     1000w=1kw
      =3(5)
      =15kw*hr

*If you use one electrical space heater at 500w to heat your living room for 8 hrs. How much energy does it use in kw-hr? 1000w= 1kw-hr 
     E=Pt
     =(500w)(8hrs)
     = 4,000w-hrs = 4kw-hr
     E= 4kw-hr

* What are 3 examples of chemical energy?

   Gasoline, fossil fuels, batteries

* Can energy be lost when it is used in a particular task?

      no, energy can only be transfered from on form to another--[[User:Natehepler|Natehepler]] 

* A 120 watt curling iron plugged in for 1 hour uses how much electrical energy?       
 .12[kw-hrs]            

* How many watts are in a kilowatt?
        1000

11.  A force of 6 N is moving a box over a distance of 2 meters.  How much work is being exerted on the object?
       w=6x2; w=12J

== Central vs Distributed ==

===Temperature ===


*When dealing with science, equal temperatures are also known as this term?
 Thermodynamic Equilibrium

* The boiling point of water in degrees Kelvin is 373. Find the boiling point of water in degees Celsius.
 373-273=100

* If you have a temperature of 63 degrees Celcius, what would that same temperature be in Kelvin?

 Formula: T Kelvin = T Celcius + 273
 
 T Kelvin = 63 + 273
 T = 336

* What is Thermal Expansion and what causes it to occur?

Answer: '''Thermal Expansion''' is the expansion/contraction of a material due to temperature change.  When most materials are heated, the atoms move faster and cause the material to expand; the opposite occurs when it is cooled. Thermal expansion is calculated by using a &quot;coefficient of thermal expansion&quot; specific to that material, since the expansion/contraction of each material varies.

* A 10-inch long copper rod is heated from 70°F to 180°F.  The coefficient of thermal expansion of copper is 9.3×10^-6 in./°F.  What is the length of the rod after it has been heated?

 ΔL = α×L×ΔT
 Where α=coefficient, L=original length, ΔT=change in Temperature
 ΔL=(9.3×10^-6)(10 inches)(180-70°F)
 ΔL=(9.3×10^-6)(1100 in./°F)
 ΔL=(0.01 inches)
 10 inches + 0.01 inches = 10.01 inches

===Heat Transfer ===

*How many ways can heat be transfered and what are the specific 
ways?

  -3
  -Conduction
  -Convection
  -Radiation


*Lets say you have a wall with a window in the middle. The window
is 90cm x 60 cm. The glass in the window is .35 cm thick. The temp
outside is 5 c and inside it's 20 c. What is the rate of heat loss
through your window? Remember K= .63 w/mk


 Icd=Q/t=KAΔT/d

 .63w/mk(90x10 raised to the negative 2)(60x10 raised to the -2)(20-5)
 divided by .35x 10 raised to the negative 2 m

 the answer is 1458 w


# Jimmy is replacing the 17ft x 14ft window in his kitchen. The glass he purchased is 0.34cm thick. The current temperature in Jimmy's house is 23 degrees Celsius and the temperature outside is 7 degrees Celsius. K is 0.63w/mK. What is the thermal gradiant?


                Solution: ΔT/d  Change in temp= 23-7 =16.0
                D = 0.34
                ΔT/d = 16/0.34 = '''47.06'''


*What is ΔT/d?
 It is the thermal gradient.

*The Jones are getting new window for in their living room. They are 50cm x 45 cm. The glass is 0.42 cm. The outside temperature is 10°C, the inside is 21.1°C. K is 0.63w/mK. What is the thermal gradient?
 T=21.1-10=11.1  D=0.42     ΔT/d.... 11.1/.42= 26.4

*Name the 3 types of heat transfer.

 Conduction, Convection, and Radiation


*We are getting new windows in the classroom.From the example we had in class 20cm x 15cm, 
 the glass is .32cm outside temp. is -15°C inside temp. is 22°C and K is 0.63w/mK. 
 Using this information what is the Thermal gradient?

 ΔT/d 22-(-15)= 37 d=.32 37/.32= 115.62

* All of the following are ways to improve windows except:
A. Having multiple panes 
B. Use an inert gas--vacuum
C. Low conductivity spacers, either plastic or wood
D. Having a single pane
E. Low e coating

 D is the correct answer.
 
* What is the rate of heat loss thru a 30 cm by 25 cm single pane window, with a thickness of 0.45 cm thick, when it is -10 degrees C outside and 25 degree C inside.  If given K=0.63 W/mK, what is the rate of loss?
 
 Icd=KA(change in temp)/d
 Plug in the numbers and the answer is 368 W.
 
* Describe the 3 different types of heat transfer.
 Conduction-a collision of molecules
 Convection- energy transfer by movement of material (forced air)
 Radiation-energy transfer with electromagnetic waves
 

* A baseball player has a surface area of 1.2m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a skin temperature of 34 degrees celcius. He is standing in center field. The air temperature is 28 degrees celcius and the wind velocity is 4m/s. The coefficient of convection is 32. I&lt;sub&gt;cv&lt;/sub&gt;=?
 I&lt;sub&gt;cv&lt;/sub&gt;=(h)(A)(change in temperature)
 I&lt;sub&gt;cv&lt;/sub&gt;=(32)(1.2m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(6 degrees celcius)
 I&lt;sub&gt;cv&lt;/sub&gt;=230.4 W
 


* A shipwrecked sailor is lying on a beach.  The sailors skin area is 1.8m², the air temp is 25°c,  
   the windspeed is 3m/s, and the sailors skin temp is 30°c.  What is the Icv? ( h=26)                                                             -  

    use the formula Icv = hAΔT = 26(1.8m²)(30 - 25) = 234w

   
* A hockey player has a surface area of 1.6 m2 with a skin temperature of 35 degrees celcius while he is warming up for a big game.  The temperature in the arena is 45 degrees celcius and there is a slight breeze from the top being open and it is 2 m/s.  What is the  Icv? (h=37)
-Use the formula Icv=(h)(a)(change in temperature)
Plug in the numbers in the correct places. 
Icv= (37)(1.6 m2) (45-35)
iCV= (37)(1.6 m2) (10)
Icv=592 w

      <text xml:space="preserve">The difference between these three types of Rhino Mocks mocking solutions has always been a little confusing to me.  So, here's my best shot at some concise definitions:

* A normal mock object will throw an exception when a method, which has no explicit expectation defined, is called on the mock instance.
* A dynamic mock, instead of throwing an exception, will return null or 0 for any unexpected method calls.
* A partial mock, like a dynamic mock, will not throw an exception if a method is called when there is no expectation defined for the method; but, instead of returning 0 or null, a partial mock will call the actual implementation method (i.e., not the mock) on the object and return that value. This lets you selectively mock specific methods on an object.

==IMPORTANT==
This page is under heavy construction. It will probably not be edited better until early May 2012. If someone sends me information on how to convert a OpenOffice odt file to a wikidoc format, then it may be done sooner. Until then this will be quite a work in progress.

==Authors &amp; Contributors==
See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Authors_%26_Contributors here].

==Introduction==
I found it quite cumbersome to find all of the little quirks, problems, and tricks in multiple sources whenever I would forget something. Therefore, I compiled all of the things I found important—primarily with character animation. Almost all the information here is consolidated from many sources. Some sources still need to be cited and any help on this would be much appreciated. For that reason I did not intend to make this public but I think there is enough need for this type of information so here it is. 

Just as a special aside, I made these notes to help myself with my animation project. Although I have organized them and posted them online for my and others benefit, I will not be dedicating any large amount of time to this website. All of my extra time needs to be allocated to the animation project. However, I do not mind suggestions and am willing to possible use them. I want to make sure that the viewer understands my time is very limited.

There may be many typos or confusing areas of organization. I tried to organize the mess of notes as best as possible but I am sure there is an even better way. Feel free to fix any aspect of this.

Any suggestions or comments feel free to e-mail me at wiki [at] pagodaproductions.com.

==Animation FAQ==

==Armatures==
'''Q:''' I managed to create an acceptable walk cycle finally, now when I reopend the file to add additional animation, It keeps falling back to walk cycle, is their something i am doing wrong.  Even after adding the LocRotScale key frame, it still ignores them, and goes back the corisponding frame for the walk.  Ugggghhhh!!!

'''Q:''' What is the best approach for rigging a character in Blender?

'''Q:''' How do I attach a separate object to a bone?

'''Q:''' When you try to scale the root bone of the armature(which scales the mesh), the bones move out of the natural placement causing unwanted positioning and distortion. Is there any way around this?

'''Q:''' What is a pole vector?

'''Q:''' How do I know that my armature is correctly positioned in global space in edit, object, and pose mode with proper bone rolls and axis pointing in proper directions? What are the best methods for building? And what axis is up Y or Z?

==Hotkeys==

Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V Trick
One simple way to get the right name is to select the Lattice, go to F9, Link and Materials panel and where it says Ob:Lattice or Ob:Lattice.001 etc., move the mouse over this field and press Ctrl-C (don't click on it, just hover over it). This copies the Lattice name. Then select your object, go to the Lattice Modifier panel, hover the mouse over the Ob: field and press Ctrl-V to paste the name in. Now it should stay there and your Lattice should work in Edit Mode. 

H
hides bones

Alt+H
shows all bones

Shift+H 
hides everything except the chain

Ctrl+I [Pose Mode]
will automatically add an IK contraint

M [Pose Mode]
to move a bone to a bone-layer, select it in POSE mode then press &quot;m&quot; and click on the desired layer button. When the bone is selected, you can see which bone layer it is on in the Editing buttons / Selected Bones panel. Whichever of the 16 layer buttons is enabled is the layer the bone will be on.

Shift+M [Pose Mode]
You can use the hotkey SH-M to display a floating bone-layer panel in the 3d viewport. Select the armature, change to POSE mode, then change to the Buttons/Editing panel (F9). Under the Armature-Panel, Display Options SH-LMB the 8th button under the Display Options Bone-Layer buttons to enable it. 
Check out [http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=88090&amp;highlight=hotkey+bone+layer this] by BlenderArtists.com.

Alt-N 
normalize the bone orientation This can fix problems sometimes.

Alt+P 
clears parent

Alt+S [Pose Mode]
in edit mode allows b-bones shape to scale visual changes without affecting the bones. 

W [Edit Mode]
subdivides bones	

W [Pose Mode]
will calculate paths to see how a bones movement is mapped out along a path
or
If you've named your bones correctly ( with .L and .R at the end of the name ) , you can flip the mirrored bone name by pressing &quot;W&quot; and &quot;flip name&quot; . A relevant post on BlenderArtsists.com is available [http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=93705&amp;highlight=mirrored+bones here].

==Approaches, Techniques, Tips and Tricks==

Constraining IK or FK
In the Armature Bones Panel is where you can limit the movement of the bone for IK and Limit Rotation Constraint for FK

Customizing  Frame Skipping
Steps(F10 playback) allows for a customizable way of skipping frame in increments.


Copying Constraints
in pose mode
1. Select all bone(s) you wish to copy the constraints to, from a particular bone
2. Now, select the bone you wish to copy constraints from
3. Ctrl C --&gt; Constraints (All)

You can do CTRL-CKEY to copy stuff from a bone to bones. The options are location, rotation, scale and constraint. Constraint is very handy when you wan to copy a constraint to other bone. The way it works is easy. 
The WKEY menu get some neat options too: 
Select constraint target: Will select the target of the bone's constraint currently selected. 
Flip name: Yep, you can flip name in Posemode too. 
Calculate/Clear path: This is a visual way to see the action linked to your armature. You can select just some bones and ask Blender to show you the paths of the bones.

It's possible to copy constraints from one object/bone to a bunch of objects/bones. A useful thing to know when doing a repetitive task like rigging all the fingers of a hand. Just select all bones/objects that you want to give a copy of the constraint, and then select the bone/object containing the constraints. Press CTRL-CKEY in 3DView, and select Object Constraints from the popup menu. The idea behind this is to copy the constraints of the active object to the selection. 


Rigging
'''Q:''' What is the best approach for rigging a character in Blender?

A: Apollux
Honestly, I don't think that there is a golden set-up that will solve all your problems. For example, when I design a character rig I need to know beforehand what type of actions he will perform. 

If you want general pointers, I guess this would do:
Allways set your rigs in a half relaxed fashion.. totally relax your hand for a few minutes and see the position of the palm and fingers, that is position you should model and rig-them on the 3D world. Same goes for mouth, legs, arms, etc. etc. etc.

When in doubt over IK or FK always choose IK, since it is quite easy to switch a IK rig into FK when needed and then back to IK.

Bone's axis orientation can't be an afterthought!! It is no coincidence that every self-respecting rigging tutorial for blender mention it... And don't trust blindly on the automatic axis orientation fix command (Ctrl-N), since it can introduce some odd solutions on complex armatures. Always check each bone by hand, even if Blender says they are fixed.

Ultimate rig design is not the in-and-all of character animation. Sometimes I would spent crazy amounts of time preparing a rig for a special squence, and in the end realize that if I had used a simple FK rig tricked by hand during animation I would get the same results in half of the time and half the frustration. Not because it can be done means that it must be done. 
BlenderArtists post [http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=18480 here].


Item Pickup
A good use of it is to ask a character to pick up something. By having a bone or empty for each side of the relationship (hand &lt;-&gt; glass), as the hand approaches the glass, you can align the two empties and fire the constraint up (1.00) to stick them together. You add another child-bone in the middle of the hand to tell where the glass will be. Thus moving the hand will move the glass. On the side of the glass just add an empty and make it parent of the glass. Add a copy location to the empty pointing to the bone in the hand we just did. There you go. Of course when the hand rotates the glass will not. For that you will need to add a Copy Rotation Constraint.
Before Blender 2.40, the above method was a good way of faking parent relationship without rotation. But now we have the hinge option which does the same.

==Problems and Questions==

Separate Object/Bone Attachment
'''Q:''' How do I attach a separate object to a bone?

A: To do that simply Ctrl-Tab into Pose Mode with the armature selected then select the object/mesh you want to parent to a bone then shift-select the bone you want to be the parent and Ctrl-P&gt;&quot;MakeParent to&quot;&gt;Bone .


Armature Scaling Problems
'''Q:''' I have been trying to scale my character which has many similarities to the mancandy and ludwig rigs. However, when you try to scale the root bone of the armature(which scales the mesh), the bones move out of the natural placement causing unwanted positioning and distortion. Both the mancandy and ludwig rigs have this same problem. Is there any way around this?

A: Why are you trying to scale the root bone (to scale the whole model)? Are you doing this in pose mode or object mode? If you are trying to scale the whole model try it in Object Mode. Also check if you are scaling around the cursor instead of median point


'''Q:''' What is a pole vector?

A: Vertex Pusher
2) Pole vector is actually a term used in Maya. It refers to the direction a bone is set to point towards in Maya rigging. For example, the direction you want the knees to point towards can be set using pole vectors. Apparently, Blender should be getting this feature soon . Right now you have to add target bones so that the knees will only bend one way (see Ryan Dale's BSoD tutorial), but with the option to use pole vectors you won't need to do this in the future .

Bone Orientation
'''Q:''' How do I know that my armature is correctly positioned in global space in edit, object, and pose mode with proper bone rolls and axis pointing in proper directions? What are the best methods for building? And what axis is up Y or Z?

A: 1. Build up all the bones, as you did before. (Every foot, arm, etc. should
be a bit bent, and drawn from the proper view.)

2. Select all these armatures, and with Ctrl-J join them into one armature.
(Or with parent/child connection, as is necessary.)

3. Select this armature, go to &quot;Editing&quot; (F9), and then turn on &quot;draw axes&quot;.
Then you can see the axes of the bones. You will see, that the axes are
different. Some bones has the Z-axis up, some has the Z-axis to the left,
etc.

4. First you should tell Blender that this is the original position of
your skeleton/model by pushing Ctrl-A. This is applying rotation. This
means, that now all the rotations of the bones will be &quot;0, 0, 0&quot;, so if you
push later Alt-R (clear rotation), you will get this position. (Turn
on numerical menu with N, to see what happens when you make this apply rotation command.)

5. Select the whole skeleton/model again. Go to edit mode. Then push A, to
select all the bones. (They should be yellow now.) Then hit Ctrl-N, and  you will see all the axises will be changed to stay on the same way.

6. That is, your skeleton now is ready to define the IK solvers, and then the
skinning, and finally the animation.

4) Yes you should always add in top view[numpad 7]. An armature bone always has its axes set (Y is always up X side to side and Z depth) and you cannot change this like you can with mesh objects, so it seemingly won't matter which view you add a bone while in Edit Mode but in Object Mode your armature object will have a 90 degree rotation around the X axis (if you add it in front view) which can and usually does create problems down the road . 
If for some reason you want to add bones in front view simply start by adding the first armature bone in top view ad then switch to front view to add additional bones . You can just delete the first bone or rotate it while in Edit Mode .

Blender's default views have the Z as the &quot;up&quot; axis while the armature system is coded with the Y as the &quot;up&quot; (like most 3D apps)

When you rotate a bone in the front view, when the bone is aligned to that view and the Z is the up axis, you will give a roll value the bone because it is rotating perpendicular to its coded up axis ... this can cause you problems in some situations when you want a &quot;neutral&quot; roll value in Pose Mode... in most cases you'll want to recalculate the roll value with Ctrl-N (which will remove the visible rotation and insert a value in the &quot;Roll:&quot; field in the Transform Properties subwindow) and give it a non zero roll value in Edit Mode so that in Pose Mode it is properly aligned and rotated for poses and constraints ...

You won't get that behavior if you rotate in either the top or side views if the bone is aligned to the view ...

It's just that if you have the Y axis (the axis the bone rolls on) perpendicular to the Global Y axis then you will have to recalculate the bone roll angles to get it aligned properly for pose space .

By &quot;bone is aligned to the view&quot; I mean what it is like when you first add a bone in a preset view, i.e. head at bottom and tip up at top in Edit Mode with no rotation applied .

A: Fligh
If you look at your left hand, palm down, from above, and assume for this exercise that all four fingers have their X-Axis pointing towards the thumb and have a Roll Angle of zero (same as if you created an Armature in Top View), but the thumb would need a Roll Angle of about 90. So if you rotate the first digit of the fingers around their Local X (R-XX) they would go down perpendicular to the back of the hand, but if you rotate the thumb (Roll Angle 90 and again around the Local X) it would go Left, towards the fingers.

Ahh.... but who bothers to pose bones like that? You just grab the IK Target and move it!. Well the Transform Matrix is divided into four chunks (I think? I'm not sure of this but it helps to think of it [or look at it] this way and if you actually test it in Blender it works), Bone Space (the structure of the bone including Roll Angle), Armature Space (the structure of the Armature = the sum of all BoneSpace), Pose Space (transforms relative to Rest Position = recorded changes in BoneSpace within ArmatureSpace) and World Space (the sum of all the above relative to the (transforms of) the Armature Object.

http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=102209

A: Fligh
Anyhow, In Blender, In Top View (always add armatures in Top view) the Z-Axis is Facing you and Y is Up. So when you add the first Bone it lies along the Y-Axis. You cannot change that parallel-to-Y and any future Bones you extrude will use that bones axis as reference. If you add an Armature in Front view the bone's (local) Z-axis will point to the Global -Y (Y-Negative) and can lead to problems later on.

http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=102609&amp;highlight=bone+orientation

A: Vertex Pusher
Well I guess I may have a little something to contribute to this ... but I have been trying to learn the armature system in depth for the past few months and this particular issue came up with a complicated rig I was working with ... and I basically &quot;discovered&quot; that you really shouldn't have any other axis other than the Y as the &quot;up&quot; axis . And precisely because the bone roll angle issue .

It seems that despite how the view ports are configured (with the Z as the &quot;up&quot; axis) the default &quot;up&quot; axis is the Y ... for everything ... This is a bit annoying but if you have, like me, configured Blender to start with the front view open and have the Transform Properties window always open, you will see that everything when created in the front view is actually rotated 90 degrees along the X axis once you tab into Object Mode and that you need to Ctrl-A all objects so created (I guess Blender &quot;out of the box&quot; has the top view open ? ... it's been a while so I can't remember ...) . This isn't all that important for most things but for the armature system this does create a problem - bone roll values that you don't want .

Just as a simple test : Open up Blender and add an armature in the front view . Grab the tip and move it to a corner of the grid so that it is angled 45 degrees . Tab into Object mode . Open up the Transform Properties window . You will notice that your armature is rotated 90 degrees along the X axis . So ... Ctrl-A the armature to have it's &quot;up&quot; axis as Z ... And suddenly you will see the bone rotate along its roll axis . Tab back into Edit Mode, select the entire bone and Ctrl-N to recalculate the bone roll angles ... the bone will rotate back to the way it was ... but with a change in its roll value (-45 or 45 depending on which way it is angled) ...
Now repeat the above but this time create the armature in top view ... And you will realize that despite being angle at 45 degrees to the view like above no roll value ... not even after recalculating the bone roll angles (Ctrl-N) ...

Now I am assuming that this occurs because the Y axis is the one used to calculate the bone's roll ... and that if you have anything other than the Y as the &quot;up&quot; axis the roll values get screwed up because now the roll axis (Y) is tangent to the up axis instead of being the up axis . Just turn on &quot;Draw Axes&quot; and look at what the &quot;up&quot; axis is for an individual bone is ... the Y .

And just another bit of proof ... The really great new &quot;limit&quot; constraints (loc,rot and scale) added in the last release ... Try and apply the limit rotation constraint to the first armature (the one with Z up and rotation applied) . Now turn LimitX on with no min or max values and do not turn on the &quot;local&quot; co-ordinate space ... it will fall flat along the Y axis as if created in the top view ... This is occurring because despite the fact that you have applied the 90 degree rotation along the X axis to the object, the constraint is enforcing the global up axis ... which is ... the Y . 

Now the only work around that I could come up with was to create an empty and parent a Y up armature to it then rotate the empty 90 degrees to be able to use the Z up view ports and also making sure the mesh also had the proper orientation as the armature . This prevents me from accidentally applying the rotation to the armature and I can use the numbpad hotkeys to navigate the views ... 
... Else you could just clear the roll values manually if you insist on having the Z as the up axis ... though you won't be able to get rid of the rotation that is caused by being tangent to the Y axis without odd roll values ...

Sorry for the long winded response, but this has been bugging me for a while ... Hopefully with the refactoring for v2.5 later this year there will be an option as to which axis will be the &quot;up&quot; axis with regards to the various views ..

==General Armature Information==

Armature Object is like any other object type:
It has a center, a position, a rotation and a scale factor. 
It can be edited. 
It can be linked to other scenes, and the same armature data can be reused on multiple objects. 
All animation you do in object mode is only working on the object, not the armature's contents like bones. 
Link and Materials panel: 
The AR: field let you rename your armature Datablock. The dropdown is a quick way to select which Armature datablock you want to connect to this armature. You can keep more than one version for the same character. Useful when you have a special move to achieve in a shot, you can turn on an armature for a special purpose. 
The F button is an option to assign a Fake user to the Armature. Again if you have more than one armature for your character, it's a good idea to turn the Fake on, because if your armature datablock is not used (linked) it's not going to be saved in your .blend files. You can always do batch Fake-assignment of armatures by opening the Datablock browser (SHIFT-F4KEY), go in Armature datablock, select all the armatures you want to keep, and Press the FKEY. 
The OB: field is just to Rename your armature Object to something more cool and useful than Armature... Armature.001... 

Delay Deform: This was useful before as the old system was very slow. What it does is when you do a manipulation to the rig, it waits until you finish to update the view. Can still be useful though. 

Weight: This specifies how strongly this bone will influence the geometry around it, relative to the other bones. If two bones crossing each other, both with envelope influence, have the same weight (like 1:1) they will influence the surrounding geometry equally. But if you set one to 0.5, the geometry will be affected more significantly by the other one, with weight 1. For example, in this image, 2 bones using envelope influence try to move the same geometry. The 2 on the left have the same weight, you can see the geometry didn't move. On the right, one of the bones has 0.5 so the bone with weight 1 is winning the tug-of-war!: 
Deform: This lets you say if you want the bone to deform the geometry at all. Switching it off is like setting the weight to 0, except it's faster this way. Useful when using a bone as a target or a controller, i.e. a bone you just want to use to control other bones, but not the geometry itself. 
Mult: to deform geometry you can use vertex group and/or Envelope. The ability to mix both of these methods is handy for using one to tweak the other. For example, you might use envelope everywhere but tweak difficult places manually with vertex group. We'll discuss this in more detail later on. 
There are two number fields to better tweak the effect of B-Bones. The in/out is used to tell the scale of the virtual handle of the bezier curve. In is the Root of the bone, and Out is the Tip. The bigger the value, the bigger the effect of rotation. 
You can do ALT-SKEY on one or more bones while in Envelope display mode to tweak the envelope size in real time while animating. Useful when for example you move the hand and some part of the character isn't in the influence zone; the result will be that some vertices will stay behind. 

Tip: Bake envelope to vertex groups
The workflow is very simple. When you are done with the envelope's tweaking and you have gotten the best out of it, delete the Armature modifier and parent the mesh to the armature(CTRL-PKEY). Parent it to &quot;armature&quot; when asked and &quot;Create From Closest Bones&quot;. Do ALT-PKEY and redo the Armature modifier. Now all the envelope influence are converted to Vertex Groups. This way you can further tweak influence zone using Weight paint. More info in the following pages.
You can edit this white zone in Editmode or posemode by going in Envelope display mode, selecting bones and using SKEY or ALT-SKEY 
The Mult option will tell Blender to multiply the weight it get from envelope (let say 0.7) with the weight you painted in weight paint (let say 0.5). The result will be 0.5*0.7=0.35 so in fact you just tweaked the envelope influence to 0.3 when it was at 0.7. If you don't want vertices to be part of the zone, you can always paint it with 0, as 0*(something) will always give 0. This way you can give custom shape to your envelope. More on weight paint on next page. 

Deform with only things weight painted
Deform + Multiply with only things that are weight painted within the envelope radius

Process:
Make bones. 
Make good envelope transformations(including some overlap).
Alt+P to make virtual parent(from nearest bones)this will already weight paint parts based on envelope influence

&quot;All faces&quot; tells Blender if you want to paint on all faces in the mesh or just the visible one. 
&quot;Vertex Dist&quot; tell blender to use vertex distance instead of faces. When active, the painting will only check if the vertex is in the brush, then apply a weight value. If it's off, all vertice part of the faces in the brush will receive weight value. Turning on Vertex Dist can give good results when you have a lot of polys in your mesh. 
Constraints are calculated from first to last. So if you have two Constraints working on the same channel, let say Location, The last one will most probably win the chance to move the object. But... 
Most of the constraints have influence slider to tell how much it influence on the stack. If the last constraint have an influence of 0.5 it will mix the result with the one before. 
Most of the time this little constraint is useful to stick objects to one another. By playing with the Influence you can tell when it will work, when it will remain motionless.


==Building Armatures==

Ludwig's Stretchy Spine
In the spine Ludwig model keep in mind the following things. The SpineStretch.null is necessary. It must be set to Hinge and Deform to keep the bones from scaling. IKSpine must have Deform turned off(none selected). Spine 4 or the last bone child in the chain(closest to the neck) must have Deform turned off(none selected). Scaling problem is usually tied(maybe always) tied to an improper child/parent relationship to a bone that is involved with stretching.

Created a mirrored copy without using X-Axis Mirror
select the bones that you want to mirror , put the 3D cursor at the center :
And make shift + d , and directly , S , X , -1 ...

Other Information
You can extrude a new bone from the selection using EKEY. This will create a bone connected to the original one, meaning the Root of the new bone will follow the Tip of the original one. You can also CTRL-LMB to extrude a new bone. It will extrude to where you clicked. 

Alternatively, you can connect two existing bones by selecting them one after the other and pressing CTRL-PKEY. You can then choose either 'Connected' (the child bone - the one you selected second - will automatically be moved so that it touches the parent) or 'Keep offset'. aa
Using the WKEY menu, You can subdivide your bone or flip the name of the bone between Left-Right (See Naming convention below). 
You can delete the bone with XKEY 
You can select a chain of bones (connected together) using LKEY, when you hover your mouse over a bone. 
In many cases, rigs are symmetrical and can be mirrored in half. In these cases, it is helpful to use a left-right naming convention. This is not only useful for your own sake, but it gives Blender a hint that there is a pair of equivalent bones, and enables the use of some very cool tools that will save you some significant work.
It's helpful to name your bones with something useful telling you what it's there for, such as leg, arm, finger, back, foot, etc. 
If you get a bone that has a copy on the other side, however, like the arm (you have 2 arms right?), then the convention is to call them arm.Left and arm.Right. 
Other alternatives are also possible, like _L, _LEFT, _left, .L, and .Left. Anyway, when you rig try to keep this left-right thing as accurate as possible; it will pay off later on. 
You can copy a bone named blah.L and flip it over using WKEY --&gt; flip name. So the bone will be blah.L.001 after you copy it, and flipping the name will give you blah.R. Blender handily detects if the .001 version already exists, and increments the number for you.

:{{del}} - I get very suspicious when massive amounts of text are added in one edit.  I'm not convinced this isn't a copyvio, even though it passes the &quot;google&quot; test.  When similar kinds of text are added to wikibooks, I've seen then languish here and eventually get deleted even when there was an active contributor who responded to questions on user talk pages and the content talk page.  Original research issues are a legitimate point to raise, as this appears to be trying to use Wikibooks as a vanity press to get the content distributed.  This said, I beg to differ that this isn't a textbook as it certainly fills a significant niche and does cover the topic to some degree for somebody who would be interested this sort of material.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 07:34, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Hans Christian Andersons Little Mermaid - Copenhagen.jpg]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted because there is missing license or source information.

==Notes for Use==
----

===Use===
----
Template name '''Codebits'''.

Used to display ''preformatted code lines'', and to include notes.   The methods used are to enclose the code blocks in either ''poem'' tags or the line-numbered version of the ''source'' tags in an attempt to regain some control over the widths of preformatted text lines.   In case it is not obvious, both of these methods at the very least allow single line spacing and the wrapping of long lines: two essential factors for listing code.  

The '''iwidth''' option sets the ''ititial'' width of the box, and the ''cwidth'' option sets the width of the content, when the box is open, and as a result, decides the wrapping width for long code lines within the content. This is regardless of whether the content text is surrounded with the ''poem'' tags or the line-numbered ''source'' tags, or is simply ''unformatted'' text. (See two examples below).

If contents are either an image or text in ''pre'' tags, then the open-width will extend to accommodate the contents.   The use of the pre-wrap value of the CSS white-space property will in time allow the ''pre'' tags to wrap long lines, but not all browsers can use it at present.(8 Dec 2008). 

Although the ''source'' tags deactivate code themselves, the ''poem'' tags need an inside set of ''nowiki'' tags for any code that would otherwise run.   The example below shows how to arrange the content parameter for use with the ''poem'' tags:

{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Codebits|1=Heading|2=&lt;poem&gt;&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;Code block goes here&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;&lt;/poem&gt;|3=Notes}} 
&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
An example of the drop control's use can be seen below:
{{codebits|cwidth=650px|align=center|1=Table Code Block|2=&lt;poem&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;table  style=&quot;background:lightyellow;border:1px solid gray;&quot; cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5px align=left width=70% &gt;
  &lt;caption&gt; Top Caption Goes Here &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background:brown; color: white;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;th style=&quot; border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Heading 1&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th style=&quot; border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Heading 2&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th style=&quot; border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Heading 3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;G&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;H&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;I&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;|3=Copy and paste this code module into the Wiki Sandbox for an example of a colourful table.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It might be of interest to know that the ''source'' tags can color a code module, and provided the tags have attributes set for line-numbering, the long lines again will wrap.   See the next example in the main text or [[Editing_Wikitext/Preformatted_Text#HTML_Code_Colors|Pre-Formatted Text]] for the description of the method.}}

Another format, that colors code, numbers the lines, and wraps any long code lines, uses the ''source'' tag extensions.   The colors are selected for many languages and needs to be specified within the leading tag.  Interestingly, the language can be specified as ''text'', to take advantage of line numbering for unlisted languages.  See [[Editing_Wikitext/Preformatted_Text#HTML_Code_Colors|Pre-Formatted Text]] for more details.   The following example shows how to use the ''source'' tags for code coloring and the numbering of lines:

{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Codebits|1=Heading|2=&lt;source lang=html4strict line start=1&gt;Code block goes here&lt;/source&gt;|3=Notes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
The coloured code can be seen in the dropbox below:
{{codebits|cwidth=650px|align=center|1=Source Tag Code Coloring|2=&lt;source lang=html4strict  line start=1&gt;&lt;table  style=&quot;background:lightyellow;border:1px solid gray;&quot; cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5px align=left width=70% &gt;
  &lt;caption&gt; Top Caption Goes Here &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background:brown; color: white;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;th style=&quot; border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Heading 1&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th style=&quot; border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Heading 2&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th style=&quot; border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Heading 3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;G&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;H&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;I&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/source&gt;|3=Copy and paste this code module into the Wiki Sandbox for an example of a colourful table.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It might be of interest to know that it is only with line-numbering that long lines will wrap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;. See [[Editing_Wikitext/Preformatted_Text#HTML_Code_Colors|Pre-Formatted Text]] for the description of the method.}}      

===Limitations===
Bear in mind that the use of  '''&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;'''  tags might still be needed for some applications.   If the block of text itself has these same tags within it, then the literals should be used to replace the  ones within the text.   (ie: use these instead;   '''&amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt;''' and '''&amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt;''').   This avoids the corrupted functioning which would otherwise result.   A similar method can be used to make literals for most other tags, such as ''nowiki'', ''poem'', and ''source'', etc., should they ever need to be shown as inoperative text.

===Parameters===
----
----
;Heading:   1; the top heading on the drop-box - (Arial, Bold, in 400 pixel initial width)
;Content:   2; the code text entry - (Courier, 400 pixels wide, left)
;Notes:     3; the notes block - (Arial, 400 pixels wide, justified)


===Options===
----
----
;iwidth:   initial width of the container,(default 300px)
;cwidth:   width of the open box; this sets the wrapping point for long lines. (Default 600px)  
;align:   horizontal alignment of container (default left)

Consider the image on the right. It shows a wave travelling through a medium. The moving blue dot represents the displacement caused to the medium by the wave. It can be seen that, if we consider any one point in the medium, it goes through a repeating pattern, moving up and down, moving faster the nearer it is to the centre of the waveform. Its height is determined by the amplitude of the wave at that point in time. This is determined by a sine wave.

[[Image:Phasor.png|thumb|left|A phasor]]
Phasors are a method of describing waves which show two things: the displacement caused to the medium, and the point in the repeating waveform which is being represented. They consist of a circle. An arrow moves round the circle anticlockwise as the wave pattern passes. For every wavelength that goes past, the arrow moves 360°, or 2π&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;, starting from the right, as in trigonometry. The angle of the arrow from the right is known as the phase angle, and is usually denoted θ, and the radius of the circle is usually denoted a. The height of the point at the end of the arrow represents the displacement caused by the wave to the medium, and so the amplitude of the wave at that point in time. The time taken to rotate 360° is known as the periodic time, and is usually denoted T.

Phase difference is the difference between the angles (θ) of two phasors, which represent two waves. It is never more than 180°, as, since the phasor is moving in a circle, the angle between two lines touching the circumference will always be less than or equal to 180°. It can also be expressed in terms of λ, where λ is the total wavelength (effectively, 360°). You can use trigonometry to calculate the displacement from the angle, and vice-versa, provided you know the radius of the circle. The radius is equal to the maximum amplitude of the wave.

Phasors can be added up, just like vectors: tip-to-tail. So, for example, when two waves are superposed on each other, the phasors at each point in the reference material can be added up to give a new displacement. This explains both constructive and destructive interference as well. In destructive interference, the phasors for each wave are pointing in exactly opposite directions, and so add up to nothing at all. In constructive interference, the phasors are pointing in the same direction, so the total displacement is twice as much.

==Questions==
1. A sine wave with wavelength 0.1m travels through a given point on the surface of the sea. A phasor arrow representing the effect of this wave on this point rotates 1000°. How many wavelengths have gone past in the time taken for the phasor to rotate this much?

2. A sine wave has a maximum amplitude of 500nm. What is its amplitude when the phasor has rotated 60° from its start position?

3. Two waves have a phase difference of 45°. When the first wave is at its minimum amplitude of -0.3m, what is the total amplitude of the superposed waveforms?

0.1m is irrelevant information.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1000}{360} = 2.78\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. A sine wave has a maximum amplitude of 500nm. What is its amplitude when the phasor has rotated 60° from its start position?'''

&lt;math&gt;a \sin{\theta} = 500 \times 10^{-9} \times \sin{60} \approx 433\mbox{nm} \,&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. Two waves have a phase difference of 45°. When the first wave is at its minimum amplitude of -0.3m, what is the total amplitude of the superposed waveforms?'''

The first wave has an amplitude of -0.300m. The second is at an angle of 270 - 45 = 225°.

&lt;math&gt;a \sin{\theta} = 0.3 \times \sin{225} \approx -0.212\mbox{m} \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-0.300 + -0.212 = -0.512\mbox{m}\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Some Essential Surveyor Hints ==

;Add a new baseboard: Move the camera so that the space where the new baseboard is required is visible. Topology &gt; Advanced &gt; Extend - then left-click off the edge of the world in the space where the new baseboard is required.

;Add spline point, and stay in spline adding mode: {{keypress|Ctrl}}-click in Spline Add mode

;Add spline point, without reference to previously existing track or roads, or their spline points: {{keypress|Shift}}-click in Spline Add mode. This is useful if you don't want your new spline to 'snap' to a nearby spline point.

;Adjust height of ground to railway track or road level: Smooth Spline - levels the railway track or road between two spline points, then raises or lowers the ground so as to meet the track or road, forming an embankment or a cutting. Apply several times if necessary.

;Adjust height of railway track or road to ground level: Remove Gradient - lowers or raises a section of railway track or road so as to lay precisely on the ground below it. The ground can have been previously raised or lowered. Spline points may need raising very slightly afterwards so as to prevent short sections of track or road disappearing under the surface of the ground.

;Alternate wireframe view: Trainz contains an alternate wireframe view, that uses less resources and also shows '''all''' the ground polygons. Press {{keypress|Alt|W}} to activate; Click the wireframe button or use {{keypress|Ctrl|W}} to show the wireframe; Use {{keypress|Alt|W}} again to switch back to the standard wireframe.

;Camera initial position: Allocate an AI driver to a locomotive, so as to make the camera default to an external view of that locomotive when the driver session starts.

;Copy and paste: These operations can sometimes have disastrous results when used on large layouts. Therefore perform a save before using them.

;Double track: All connections, including junctions with other sections of double track, must be made via sections of single track.

;Fly mode: Fly mode is an alternative camera movement mode in Surveyor. To invoke Fly mode in UTC/TRS2004 press and hold {{keypress|Alt}} and type &quot;fly&quot; (without the quotes). In TRS2006 press {{keypress|Alt|U}}. In Fly mode navigate with the cursor keys and turn with the mouse. To return to normal mode, press the {{keypress|Esc}} key. See also Walk mode.

;Level crossings (known as grade crossings in US English): All level crossings are listed in &quot;Objects - Object Mode&quot;, but under various names. After placing a level crossing, attach tracks and roads as appropriate to each of its spline points. Road traffic is controlled and barriers operate as trains pass.

;Positions of objects at junctions: The signal for trains approaching the junction from BACK and going to LEFT or RIGHT, then the junction lever, then the spline point at which the tracks diverge, then along each branch and pointing in the other direction the signals for trains approaching the junction from LEFT and going to BACK and the signal for trains approaching the junction from RIGHT and going to BACK.

;Roads: All roads are listed in &quot;Objects - Spline Mode&quot;. Roads are created in the same way as railway track. (Similarly for other spline objects such as fences, power lines and rows of trees.) Bridges carrying roads can be created in the same way as bridges carrying railway tracks. There are a few road tunnels available but they do not appear to behave as true tunnels. The Straighten Track toggle will also work on most other splined objects such as roads and fences.

;Rotating Objects: To precisely rotate an object, hold down the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key while moving the mouse.

;Signalling: This is a highly complex subject in its own right and therefore described elsewhere.

;To make spline circles disappear: In pop out menu select a non-spline category (for example Tools - {{keypress|F5}}) and press {{keypress|Alt|O}} (the letter, not zero). Or, if you want to see only the rail spline circles and not the scenery spline circles, then select the Tracks tab and press {{keypress|Alt|O}}. Likewise, if you want to see the scenery spline circles without the track spline circles, select &quot;Objects - Add Spline&quot; (S) and press {{keypress|Alt|O}}.

;To make the pop out side menu disappear: Press {{keypress|Ctrl|Space}}. 

;To move a track marker or trigger past a spline point or onto a different track: Change from Track &gt; Trackmark to Track &gt; Trackside mode (and then click the &quot;Move&quot; button).

;Track alignment at junctions and between curved sections: Straighten Track - use this toggle to make the track's curves smooth. (The Straighten Track toggle will also work on most other splined objects such as roads and fences.) For best results at a junction, use the Straighten Track tool on a short stretch of track immediately before and immediately after the main through track of the junction.

;Undo: The Undo button routine is suspected of having a bug which sometimes causes it to corrupt a layout. TRS2006 is particularly suspect in this respect. Therefore avoid using the Undo button, or do so only to an extremely limit extent and check before resaving a layout.

;Vegetation hint #1: On an out of site area of the layout, create a suitably textured area with a random clump of vegetation (trees, plants, bushes, etc as desired). Give one of the trees a name such as &quot;Trees&quot; so it can be readily found. Then copy and paste this area wherever it is required. Stagger the paste in a brickwork fashion and rotate each time to avoid repetition.

;Vegetation hint #2: To delete vegetation, copy and paste a blank area of baseboard onto the area with the unwanted trees (etc).

;Vegetation hint #3: The apparent variety of vegetation types can be increased by varying the heights of trees, grass, etc.

;Walk mode: Walk mode is an alternative camera movement mode in Surveyor. To invoke Walk mode in UTC/TRS2004 press and hold Alt and type &quot;walk&quot; (without the quotes). In TRS2006 press {{keypress|Alt|Y}}. To return to normal mode, press the {{keypress|Esc}} key. Walk mode allows the user to explore the layout from a person's point of view. This feature automatically triggers the Alternate wireframe view: see above. See also Fly mode.

;Water height: In &quot;Topology&quot;, add water over the relevant squares, then adjust the water level. Separate water areas on the same layout can have separate water heights, but this is somewhat tricky to achieve. It is probably best to paint all the separate water areas (making sure they do not join) before adjusting any of their heights. It is possible to create canal locks, crater lakes, dams and &quot;Lake On The Mountain&quot; effects.

;Some additional Surveyor features (each of which may only be available in some versions of Trainz):
*{{keypress|Alt|C}}{{keypress|A}}{{keypress|R}}{{keypress|Z}} allows you to ride a car. The compass will disappear, in which case you should click on a car to ride. After some amount of time the ride will end automatically for some reason. Use the {{keypress|Esc}} key to manually cancel.
*{{keypress|Alt|L}}{{keypress|U}}{{keypress|C}}{{keypress|Y}}{{keypress|I}}{{keypress|N}}{{keypress|T}}{{keypress|H}}{{keypress|E}}{{keypress|S}}{{keypress|K}}{{keypress|Y}} generates a variety of sky colours and patterns.
*{{keypress|Alt|M}}{{keypress|M}}{{keypress|M}}{{keypress|G}} generates random terrain and textures.
*{{keypress|Alt|S}}{{keypress|M}}{{keypress|I}}{{keypress|T}}{{keypress|E}} Makes lightning strike the ground. This makes the terrain under your cursor to lower, and this also makes the terrain have new textures. Press {{keypress|Esc}} to cancel this mode.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In the belief that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|the Elder Wand]] will grant its allegiance only to one who has slain its previous owner, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] has his pet snake, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], kill [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]].

== Event Details ==

Through the confusion of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] notices that there does not seem to be any sign of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. She asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] to try and look into his mind, to see where he is. Harry looks into Voldemort's mind, and sees Voldemort ordering a bedraggled-looking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] to fetch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] to him. Returning to himself, Harry tells Hermione and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] that Voldemort is in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]].

Making their way through the tunnel to the Shrieking Shack, the Trio find their way into the Shack blocked by boxes. Hidden by these boxes, they listen (and Harry watches) as Snape reports to Voldemort. Snape seems to be asking permission to enter Hogwarts and fetch Harry out for Voldemort. Voldemort, however, has something else on his mind and summarily dismisses Snape's request. He says that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]] that he has retrieved from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] tomb is a fine wand, but is nothing special. He says that he believes that the wand is not performing to its best ability because it has not yet shifted its allegiance to him. And why not? Because Snape killed Dumbledore, and so the wand currently owes its allegiance to Snape. The wand will not perform its best for Voldemort until Snape is dead. So saying, Voldemort waves his pet snake, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], in her nest of protective spells, into Snape. Nagini immediately bites Snape, who falls. Voldemort and Nagini leave the room; Harry pushes the boxes aside and kneels over the fallen Snape. Seeing Harry, Snape forces a large quantity of memories out of his head, and Harry collects them in a crystal flask that Hermione provides. Then, asking Harry to look into his eyes, Snape dies.

== Notable Consequences ==

The memories that Snape has provided to Harry will prove, once and for all, where his loyalties have lain for the entire series. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|The viewing of these memories]] explains much of why Snape has acted the way he has throughout the series, and will affirm Dumbledore's trust of Snape.

The memories Harry has received will also give Harry the necessary information he needs to finally defeat Voldemort.

The death of Snape leaves Voldemort confident in having finally gained the full powers of the Elder Wand. This faith may be misplaced.

== Analysis ==

As we will find out, there is really a large amount of information that Snape feels the need to pass to Harry. There is no way that Snape could have told it all to Harry in the midst of the battle, and in fact there is little way that Harry would have been prepared to believe anything that Snape, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] deep within the councils of Voldemort, could have told him. Yet, despite the battle proceeding apace, Harry must get this information. Snape's death, and the immediate crushing urgency of getting the message to Harry, is likely the only way that Snape could have gotten these memories to Harry in the available time, and likely the only way that Harry could have accepted them.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The key piece of information that Harry receives from Snape is that a fragment of Voldemort's soul is lodged within Harry, and that the only way to dislodge it, and thus prevent Voldemort from returning again, is to have Voldemort kill Harry. Snape has been charged with passing this message on by Dumbledore, once Voldemort stops sending Nagini out to run his errands, instead keeping her close and magically protected. This actually is one link in the chain which almost fails. While Dumbledore does generally plan for the occasional failure, he had somehow assumed that once Voldemort had started protecting Nagini, Snape would still have the necessary freedom of motion to be able to pass the message on to Harry. Dumbledore had clearly not been aware either that Voldemort would so lightly kill his main lieutenant, or that the animosity between Snape and Harry would be increased by Dumbledore's death to the point that Harry would actually have killed Snape given the chance. If Harry had not been present at Snape's death, or if he had not been restrained from killing Snape by the presence of Voldemort and Nagini, the message would never have been passed, and the one remaining soul shard would have remained, anchoring Voldemort to the earth and to Harry.

Several additional pieces of Snape's memory come along with that one fact, however. Snape evidently feels the need to explain himself, and his actions. We learn that Snape had acted out of unrequited love for Harry's mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]]. It is likely that it was necessary for Snape to include that background; it is uncertain whether Harry would have believed him, even given the memories, if he had not had that information about why Snape had acted as he did. Without that information, the ties holding Snape to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] seem far too tenuous to make us believe in them, and we would continue to believe, as Harry has, that Snape's first loyalty is to Voldemort. Given that belief, anything Snape could say would be seen as serving the interests of Voldemort, rather than of Harry. Harry, feeling that Snape had duped poor, trusting Dumbledore as he had everyone else, would equally distrust anything Snape told Dumbledore, making the memories of Snape and Dumbledore's discussions also entirely suspect.

Harry, having seen these memories, recognizes that Snape was a strong wizard, true to his given word no matter how distasteful the duties he was assigned, and was acting throughout in Harry's best interests, at Dumbledore's request. As we will find out in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Epilogue|epilogue]], Harry eventually names one of his children after both Snape and Dumbledore.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When two coherent waves - waves of equal frequency and amplitude - travel in opposite directions through the same area, an interesting superposition effect occurs, as is shown in the following animation:

[[Image:Harmonic_Standing_Wave.gif]]

[[Image:Standing_wave.gif|thumb|right|Standing wave with nodes labelled in red]]
Some areas of the resultant waveform consistently have an amplitude of 0. These are known as nodes. At other points (half-way between the nodes), the resultant waveform varies from twice the amplitude of its constituent waveforms in both directions. These points are known as antinodes. Everywhere in between the nodes and antinodes varies to a lesser degree, depending on its position.

This effect only occurs if the two waveforms have the same amplitude and frequency. If the two waves have different amplitudes, the resultant waveform is similar to a standing wave, except that it has no nodes, and 'moves'.

Because of these conditions, standing waves usually only occur when a waveform is reflected back on itself. For example, in a microwave oven, the microwaves are reflected by the metal on the other side of the oven from the transmitter. This creates nodes and antinodes. Since nothing cooks at the nodes, a turntable is necessary to ensure that all of the food passes through the antinodes and gets cooked.

==Frequencies==
[[Image:Overtone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fundamental frequency, and the first 6 harmonics]]
Consider a string, attached at either end, but allowed to move freely in between. If you pluck it, you create a wave which travels along the string in both directions, and is reflected at either end of the string. This process keeps on happening, and so a standing wave pattern is created. The string goes up, and then down, as shown in the first row of the diagram on the right. If you imagine the top arc as the first half of a waveform, you can see that when the string is vibrating at the fundamental frequency, the string is half as long as the wavelength: it is ½λ long.

If you were to pinch the string in the middle, and then pluck it on one side, a different standing wave pattern would be generated. By plucking, you have created an antinode, and by pinching, you have created a node. If you then let go of the string, the standing wave pattern spreads, and the string length now equals the wavelength. This is known as the first harmonic.

As you pinch the string in descending fractions (½, ⅓, ¼, etc.), you generate successive harmonics, and the total length of the string is equal to additional ½λ wavelengths.

==Pipes==
[[Image:Standing_waves_pipes.png|thumb|left|200px|Standing waves in pipes, showing nodes and antinodes]]
Consider a pipe which is open at one end, and closed at the other. In pipes, waves are reflected at the end of the pipe, regardless of whether it is open or not. If you blow across the end of the tube, you create a longitudinal wave, with the air as the medium. This wave travels down the tube, is reflected, travels back, is reflected again, and so on, creating a standing wave pattern.

The closed end of the pipe must be a node; it is the equivalent of pinching a string. Similarly, the open end must be an antinode; blowing across it is the equivalent of plucking the string.

Harmonics can be present in pipes, as well. This is how musical instruments work: an open hole in a wind instrument creates an antinode, changing the frequency of the sound, and so the pitch.

Tom Duncan states that the fundamental frequency IS the same as the first harmonic (Adavanced Physics 5th edition page 317)

==Questions==
1. The air in a 3m organ pipe is resonating at the fundamental frequency. Organ pipes are effectively open at both ends. What is the wavelength of the sound?

2. A string is vibrating at the second harmonic frequency. How many wavelengths long is the standing wave created?

3. Express, in terms of λ, the length of a pipe which is closed at one end, where λ is the length of one wave at the fundamental frequency.

Logo inherits lists from [[Subject:Lisp programming language|Lisp]], and they are its primary method of storing vectors. Arrays are also provided.

* Operators exist to convert words into lists, and lists into arrays and back again.
* This data type has the advantage over arrays that it is infinitely expandable. Data are extracted using the operations first, butfirst, last, butlast, butmember, member and item. Data elements are added using sentence fput and lput.
* A list can be considered to be a queue with the operators queue and dequeue, or a stack with the operations push and pop.
* Recursion rather than iteration is the natural method to process lists.

====Example: using list primitives to extract the first five members of a list====
One way would be to use iteration.

  &lt;nowiki&gt;to firstfive :alist
  ifelse lessp count :alist 6 [ op :alist ][make &quot;olist []]
  repeat 2 [ make &quot;olist lput first :alist  :olist   make &quot;alist bf :alist ] output :olist
 end

 show firstfive [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]
 [1 2 3 4 5]
 foreach firstfive [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ] [show 10 - ?]
 9 
 8 
 7 
 6 
 5&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Another, more elegant way would be 

  &lt;nowiki&gt;to firstn :num :list
  if :num = 0 [output []]
  output fput (first :list) (firstn :num-1 butfirst :list)
 end
 
 to firstfive :list
  output firstn 5 :list
 end&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This method uses recursion, and is an example of a functional rather than an imperative programming approach.

And a more general way would be

  &lt;nowiki&gt;to tail :num :alist
  if or not numberp :num not listp :alist [print [Error: Bad argument(s)] stop]
  if not equalp 0 :num - int :num [make &quot;num int :num]
  if :num=0 [output []]
  if equalp count :alist abs :num [op :alist]
  if lessp count :alist abs :num [output :alist]
  if :num&gt;0 [output tail.left :num :alist] 
  if :num&lt;0 [output tail.right abs :num :alist]
 end

  to tail.left :num :list
   output fput (first :list) (tail.left :num-1 butfirst :list)
  end

  to tail.right :num :list
   output lput (last :list) (tail.right :num-1 butlast :list)
  end

 show tail 5 [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
 [1 2 3 4 5]
 show tail -5 [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
 [5 6 7 8 9]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

===Control structure commands===
Logo provides several common control structures.

:*ifelse test [ do_if_true list ] [do_if_false list]

There are iteration commands

:*while condition [instruction list]
:*until condition [instruction list ]
:*repeat number [instruction list]

Recursion is Logo's preferred processing paradigm.

===Template iteration ===
Logo also provides list-based control structures. The basic idea is that you have two lists

 OPERATION [ a list of commands ] [ many data items ]
each of the commands is applied in turn to each of the data items. There are several of these template commands with names like MAP, APPLY, FILTER, FOREACH, REDUCE and CASCADE. They represent four flavours of template iteration, known as explicit-slot, named-procedure, named-slot (or Lambda), and procedure-text.

 show map [? * ? ] [ 5 6 7 ]
 [25 36 49 ]
 show filter [ (count ?) &gt; 4 ] [ the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog ]
 [quick brown jumps]
 show foreach [1 2 3 4 5] [ ? * 10 ]
 [10 20 30 40 50]

 RUN [ list of commands ] ;run a list of commands  (or programs) from in a program.

===Property lists===
A property list is a special list where the odd number items are property names, and the even are property values. There are three commands to process property list.
 pprop :listname :name :value ;to add a new pair to the list
 remprop :listname :name :value ;to remove a pair to the list
 show gprop :listname :name  ;to get the matching value from the list

===I/O Commands===
Text may be written to the command window (output stream) using  &lt;code&gt;print, show&lt;/code&gt; and to the graphics window using &lt;code&gt;label &lt;/code&gt;

The standard commands are &lt;code&gt;readlist readword readchar&lt;/code&gt; with the normal input stream being the keyboard. In Unix tradition the input stream can be changed, so input can come from a disk file. Similarly, output can be redirected.

 openread [filename]
 setread[filename]
 setreadpos nn
 readchar
 setread[]
 close [filename].

There are equivalent commands to change the output stream, &lt;code&gt;openwrite, openappend, setwrite, setwritepos nn. &lt;/code&gt;

 dribble [filename]
Creates a transcript of everything that is typed in or outputted to the command window.
 nodribble
This turns it off.

I/O commands can be applied to generate text to resemble a known bitmap, also seen in [[ASCII art]] conversion programs. An example of this, a set of crosses resembling the [[Mandelbrot set]].&lt;!-- If this example is important, please supply the Logo code and let the reader generate the output                                                   X

                                                  X
then a screen dump of the result in MSW or X-logo would be nice! --&gt;

===Graphics===
Turtle graphics is a powerful method of introducing thinking but LOGO also has a few useful [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] commands
 home         ;returns the turtle to (0,0)
 setx xx      
 sety yy      ; sends the turtle, still drawing to (xx,yy)
 seth nn      ; sets the turtle on a heading or compass bearing of (nn)

====Example: calculating and drawing a [[sundial]] for a given latitude====
This is a typical garden dial. The graphic can be printed and transferred to wood or brass to make an accurate garden timepiece.
 &lt;nowiki&gt;to dial
   
   cs show [Type in your latitude as a whole number]
   make &quot;latitude readword  ;uses keyboard input
   for [i 0 6 1][
     make &quot;ang arctan product sin :latitude tan product  :i 15  ;the calculation
     rt :ang fd 200 bk 200 lt :ang                      ;draw the morning line
     lt :ang fd 200 bk 200 rt :ang                      ;use symmetry to draw the afternoon line
   ]
   pu setx -300 sety -300 seth 90 pd                  ;send the turtle to the bottom
   fd 300 seth 270 rt 90 - :latitude fd 300           ;draw the [[style]] or [[gnomon]]
   pu home pd                                         ;tidy it up
 end&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The same code in a different Logo dialect (in this case, NetLogo, would look like this.
 &lt;nowiki&gt;to dial
   
   clear-all
   create-turtles 1
   let latitude 38  ;Just set this manually
   let ang 0
   ask turtles [pu set heading ang]
   foreach [0 1 2 3 4 5 6][
     set ang atan ((sin latitude) * (tan (? * 15))) 1  ;the calculation
     ask turtles [pd rt ang fd 10 bk 10 lt ang                      ;draw the morning line
     lt ang fd 10 bk 10 rt ang pu                     ;use symmetry to draw the afternoon line
     ]
   ]
   ask turtles [pu setxy -15 -15 set heading 90 pd                  ;send the turtle to the bottom
   fd 15 set heading 270 rt (90 - latitude) fd 15           ;draw the [[style]] or [[gnomon]]
   pu home pd                                         ;tidy it up
   ]
 end&lt;/nowiki&gt;
A sundial plate must be adjusted by latitude using the formula 
 x= arctan( sin(latitude)*tan(HourDiff * 15) &lt;!-- Comment --&gt;)
The Gnomon Angle = latitude.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Ex10 38N.jpg|right|Sundial in Berkeley, California]]&lt;br&gt;
This dial above is set for 38N, the latitude of Berkeley, California. A small correction should also be made for longitude.

===MSWLogo extensions===

MSWLogo supports multiple turtles, and 3D Graphics. MSWLogo allows input from COM ports and LPT ports and also hardware ports. MSWLogo also supports a windows interface thus I/O is available through this GUI- and keyboard and mouse events can trigger interrupts.

====GIF animations====

Simple GIF animations may also be produced on MSWlogo version 6.5 with the ''gifsave'' command.  Below is an example of code to generate a simple animation.
 to squareani :number
  setactivearea [-5 -5 105 105]         ;we do not want to save the entire screen
  local &quot;col
  setpensize [3 3]                      ;make it a noticeable square
  make &quot;append &quot;false                   ;signify that we want to start a new animation
   repeat :number [
    cs
    make &quot;col 255*(repcount-1)/(:number-1)
    setpc (list :col :col :col)         ;change the square's color
     repeat 4 [                         ;
     fd 100 rt 90                       ;draw the square
     ]                                  ;
   (gifsave &quot;squareani.gif 5 :append 0) ;save to squareani.gif
   make &quot;append &quot;true                   ;from now on, we want to keep adding frames to squareani.gif
   ]
 end
Thus, with a :number variable of 15 frames, the result is given below, along with a slightly more complex example (note that this gifsave feature does not yield the same quality color gradients as Logo would save in bitmap form):
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|[[Image:Squareani.gif]]
|
|-
|A square fading&lt;br /&gt;from black to white&lt;br /&gt;in 8 bits per pixel&lt;br /&gt;(default for gifsave).
|
|}

====Save/Load Functions====
MSWLogo and FMSLogo support saving and loading of LOGO procedures and files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tents in which open fires can be lit for warmth have been known for hundreds of years. On the North American continent, the Plains Indians have developed different variations of the essentially conical style of tent, generally known as the tipi. The Indian tipi usually has a substantially circular base, and its height from base to apex is about the same as the base diameter. The traditional construction of an Indian tipi involves first erecting a plurality of poles with their lower ends spaced around a circle intended to define the base of the eventual tipi and their upper ends fastened together at the peak. Primarily, the tipi was a conical tent covered with dressed buffalo skins. Everywhere the tipi was made, cared for, and set up by the women. First, a conical framework of long slender poles was erected and the cover raised into place. Then the edges of the cover were staked down and the poles supporting the &quot;ears&quot; put in place. The &quot;ears&quot; are wings, or flies, to keep the wind out of the smoke hole at the top; they were moved about by the outside poles. The fire was built near the center and the beds spread upon the ground around the sides. The head of the family usually sat near the rear, or facing the door. 

The &quot;skin&quot; of the tipi, when laid flat on the ground, is generally semi-circular in shape, and includes two smoke flaps extending from the middle area of the side corresponding to the diameter of the semicircle. These smoke flaps, when the tent is wrapped around the erected poles, take up a position in which they extend downwardly from the tipi peak on either side of an opening through which smoke is evacuated from the interior of the tipi. In the traditional construction of the tipi, the smoke flaps are held in a taut condition by flap poles of which the top ends engage the smoke flaps and the bottom ends are dug into the ground. The flap poles bear inwardly against the side of the tent, and are resisted by the support poles inside the tipi. 

The entrance to the tipi is directly beneath the smoke flap, and the tipi is always erected so that the entrance and the smoke hole are directed away from the prevailing wind. In order to achieve a good draught so that the smoke from the interior fire will exit through the smoke hole, the traditional tipi is at least 12 feet high, and often as much as 18 or 20 feet in height

      <text xml:space="preserve">Preferably, the structure is erected in such an orientation that the prevailing wind tends to blow toward the back of the tipi. In this manner, the smoke flaps define an opening which is generally downwind, and this improves the draught in the interior of the tipi, so that smoke from a fire built on the ground within the tipi will be drawn up to the peak, and out through the flue opening between the smoke flaps. 

It is not essential that the smoke flaps be an exact shape, since their configuration is a matter of choice. The lower corners of the smoke flaps need not be provided, for example, and the flaps can merely be triangular with the vertical edge extending directly from the pocket to the bottom of the flue opening. Where the corners are provided, however, they can be tied out to a tie-pole by cords, thus preventing the smoke flaps from flapping.

While the general plan of the traditional Indian tipi represents an excellent design as far as smoke exhaustion and the maximum utilization of space are concerned, there are serious limits to its portability. The necessity of providing from 18 to 24 long poles at each site, or of transporting existing poles from site to site, makes the traditional tipi construction suited for the most kinds of camping that is popular.

== Recipe for Perfect Roast pork==

A somewhat 'antique' recipe and outlook.

''Roast Pork is the most wonderful dish. There is of course an added bonus to roast pork, namely the presence of the fatty skin on the joint, which, if cooked correctly, forms what is known as Crackling - where the skin crisps up into a brittle state, and breaks your teeth as you eat it ! Absolutely delicious though''

==Ingredients==

===For the Roast pork===

*1 joint of loin or leg of Pork of good, free-range quality (about 5 pounds or 2.5 kg, for 4 people)
*1 teaspoon (5ml) salt (rock salt preferred)
*1 large pinch of ground black pepper 
*1/4 cup olive oil or other good cooking oil
*2 cups of water
*1 onion, chopped

== Buying... ==

Best buy a 'joint' of Loin or Leg with the fat and skin, which should ideally have been scored by the butcher, still on it. Please do try and buy from a reliable butcher, and preferably not from a supermarket. It should be moist, slightly shiny in appearance and somewhere between Pink and Beige in colour.

If you're planning your roast pork for a Sunday lunch, please remember to buy the joint by Thursday lunchtime. Most butchers sell out fast thereafter; to efficient housewives on a Friday, to us less efficient mortals on a Saturday morning! By Saturday afternoon the choice is usually pretty sparse and you may even have to settle for lamb or worse, something really healthy like chicken!

Try and make your joint feel welcome when you get it home. It needs to relax in preparation for its weekend ordeal. Put it high in the fridge on a dish - don't even think about freezing it - with the quartered onion, and cover with foil. Turn it over occasionally making sure you don't drain any juice which may seep out.


== Crackling ==

There is a strong divergence of opinion on this one. I personally cut the layer of fat off the joint when I get it home, and roast the crackling to perfection separately. 

The whole process to achieve perfect crackling is much more reliable using this method, but all respect to those that disagree.

Either way, ensure the skin on the joint is scored to a depth of about 2 mm in a criss-cross pattern. Rub over a small amount of oil, and then rub a generous amount of salt into the skin.

If you take the skin off the joint, ensure you leave some of the fat underneath on, which will then crisp up a little whilst roasting.

== Roasting ==

On the morning of cooking, get the Pork joint out of the fridge, and let it stand to warm up to room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 220°C (400°F) and place the roasting tin you propose to use in the oven to heat up. If you have a spare one, place another onion in the tin as it heats up. Try and use a cast-iron roasting tin. They conduct heat better.


'''Deviations and modifications....'''


''Butterfly the joint'' - If you have taken the skin off the pork, you will have had to cut the string which it comes tied up with, and so I recommend you flatten the joint with judicious cutting of the meat, so that it is longer than it is high. This will also aid the roasting process as well as the carving. However for purists, you may need to re-string the joint before roasting.

Also at this point sprinkle whatever herbs or spices you like to the skin of the joint. I also recommend spiking the skin with cloves, and sprinkling it with a little dried sage. I also sometimes cut a wide slit into the middle of the joint, and place some fresh Sage or Basil, chopped apples, as well as some garlic into it. But this is entirely optional.


'''....continuation of recipe''' 


Place the crackling on a open shelf at the top of the oven, with nothing underneath it, and leave it hanging there until cooked.

For the joint, lay it on the chopped onion, with a little water, in the bottom of a roasting pan, and place it in the middle shelf of the oven which has been preheated to 220 degrees C.

For Pork there is no real choice of 'doneness' - Pork is not traditionally served rare, medium or well-done, and so allow about 20 minutes per pound (50 minutes per kilo) The best way of testing whether the joint is cooked is to insert a skewer into the thickest part of the joint. If it is done, the juices will run out clear, with no pinkness to them.

As with any joint, leave the joint to rest for 15 or so minutes in a warm part of the kitchen, covered with a loose wrapping of tin-foil.

By this time the crackling should also be cooked. If it is not, turn your oven up to its highest setting and watch it carefully as it will crackle up quickly!

== Meat juices ==


The juices that run from the joint whilst cooking, which will have mixed with the onion, are perfectly adequate for a gravy (or a jus, as it is called) - is suffices to sieve the juices from the roasting pan, ensuring any burnt bits are scraped off and mixed with the juices, reheated and serves with the joint


== Serving ==

Again there is no real etiquette about Roast Pork slices, as there is with beef (thin) and lamb (thicker). Carve the pork as you feel. 

Roast Pork is usually served with '''Apple Sauce'''. I shall not bore you with a recipe for this as I am sure it is available elsewhere, but I ''would'' suggest the addition of a drop or two or '''Rosewater''' essence to the apple sauce. It gives it a most wonderful and subtle aroma.

One can also make a '''Sage sauce''' - a little like Mint sauce, but with Sage, made of mixing chopped, fresh sage, vinegar and Honey, heating in a pan, allowing to diffuse for 15 minutes, and then serving separately.

Pork is served with a variety of vegetables. Mashed potatoes (with a subtle addition of mustard) and a simple mixed salad are excellent.


'''Don't Roast.... Grill !'''


I recently bought a George Foreman grill, and attempted this recipe by placing the joint, skin-removed and flattened as much as possible, between the grill plates. 

The results were exquisite, as the meat was slightly blackened on both sides and was moister as the cooking time was much reduced. Sprinkling a small amount of brown Caster sugar on the skin made it even better!

You cannot however achieve crackling this way, which has to be done, in the usual manner, in the oven. So this is ''not'' an environmentally responsible recipe, as you have to operate both the Oven and the Grill !

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic window source code ==
Here is the smallest FLTK application, it shows an empty window:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;fltk/run.h&gt;
#include &lt;fltk/Window.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char** argv) {

	// build a square window (with a side of 300 pixels)
	fltk::Window window (300, 300, &quot;FLTK test&quot;);

	// show it
	window.show (argc, argv);

	// enter the FLTK event loop
	return fltk::run();
}

&lt;/source&gt;

Compiling and running this piece of code yields the following kind of window:

{|
|[[Image:FLTK-BasicWindow-Linux.png|framed|left|GNU Linux screen shot]]
 ||[[Image:FLTK-BasicWindow-MacOSX.png|framed|left|Mac OS X screen shot]]
|}

== Basic application compilation ==

To build above code, first save it to a file named ''test.cxx''. You can also use ''test.cpp'', but the ''cxx'' extension is the one used by FLTK source code.

We assume ''GCC'' is installed, since it is required to build FLTK. Depending on the environment, windowing system libraries need to be linked against the executable. Basically, the following command is the minimum required to build ''test.cxx'':

 g++ -o test test.cxx -lfltk2

Using the X Window system (GNU Linux for example), you usually need to add the following ones:

 g++ -o test test.cxx -lfltk2 -lXi -lXinerama -lXft

Under Mac OS X, you'll have to link with the Carbon framework:

 g++ -o test test.cxx -lfltk2 -framework Carbon

      <text xml:space="preserve">An International Baccalaureate HL Music student must compose 5 to 15 minutes of music within the span of three compositions. These should demonstrate the composer's ability to communicate musically through a wide selection of genres. For example, one student may choose to write an avant garde version of a Gregorian chant, by mixing it with the arc and lyrics of a contemporary spiritual song, and also write a Sicilienne for flute, and a 12-tone composition for piano. The scores of the pieces are sent out into the world to be assessed, along with recordings of the pieces.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The HL Musical Investigation must be no more than a '''maximum''' of 2000 words, and is an ethnomusicalogical study, as well as a music theory study of two distinct musical cultures. 

Ethnomusicology is the study of music from different areas and times.  Students must compare and contrast two different genres of music from completely different areas and times to see the relationships between the two.  Examples include the relationship between ragtime and Skandinavian folk Music or the differences between the punk rock and the Indian Tabla Drums.  The more obscure the difference between the two the more likely you are to score well. 

The Musical Investigation must also be written as a media script---THIS IS NOT AN ESSAY OR REPORT!!!!  Again, the more obscure you can be with what type of media script, the better.  Examples include a festival adjudicators sheet, a magazine article, a Myspace page, etc.  Have fun with this part, because this is the most creative part of the Musical Investigation.


== Advice to Writing the Musical Investigation ==

Try to write the Investigation in parts.  Compare and contrast the Melody of each piece, then the Harmony of each piece, and so on.  The reader will not follow your thought process as well as if you were to talk about Genre A and then go into how Genre B differs.  Keep the similarites and differences close together - it just sounds like you know what you're talking about better.

GOOD LUCK!!!

== Getting started ==
To begin, open a new scene in Blender. Let's clean up the scene a little by selecting the lamp and camera in the scene, press M to move them to a different layer and click on the fifth layer from the left to place the objects. Go back to layer 1 and delete anything else. You may also want to get rid of the grid by opening the View Properties and turning off the Grid Floor and X &amp; Y axes.

To block out our character, we're going to use an object type that is probably the least used and useful of any known to mankind. Let's hear it for... Metaballs!

== Sculpting With &quot;Lumps of Clay&quot; ==
[[image:Blender3d Add meta ball.jpg|right|200px]]
Go into the top view (important), press Space and add a '''metaball.''' Metaballs are a nifty, ancient piece of 3D technology that is useful for creating blobs. (Similar to lumps of clay, eh?) You create simple primitive shapes and scale and rotate them to block out your character's shape. When the primitives come close to one another, they &quot;bleed into one another&quot; in much the same way that water droplets merge when they touch. Cool.

If you're using an earlier version of Blender that jumps out of Object mode into Edit mode when you create an object, then press Tab to switch back to Object mode, as you won't be able to scale your Meta primitive non-proportionally in Edit mode. 

In Object mode, you can change these options for the entire Meta object, while tabbing into Edit mode gives you more options for the selected meta primitive, such as changing the type from Ball to Tube, Plane, Cube, ;;etc.;  (You can also make &quot;Negative metaballs.&quot;)  

{{Clear}}


[[image:Blender3d Meta ball man.jpg|right|150px]]
Press '''Shift+D''' to duplicate the Metaball, and place it where you like. Continue blocking out your character, building enough blobs to represent the limbs or forms you will need to sculpt your masterpiece. 

The balls at the end of the limbs, were scaled '''SKEY''' larger, and then moved '''GKEY''' out a bit more.

Don't get carried away and put in too much detail at this stage:  use as ''few'' shapes as you need.  (This is supposed to be quick and fun, after all...)

{{Clear}}

== Meta-mess! ==
You should still be in object mode.

Now that you've got something that resembles what you're after, select all the Metaballs and ( be in object mode) type '''ALT+C''' -&gt; &quot;delete original&quot;, to convert it to polygons so you can actually do something with your blob. 


'''Noob note:''' if you pick &quot;keep original&quot; you will still have the meta balls present, plus have a mesh version of the metaballs sharing exactly the same space. When you select &quot;delete original&quot;, the meta balls are turned into the mesh, and the circles that the metaballs were originally in hang around, but are empty.


[[image:Blender3d Meta ball man meta mess.jpg|right|200px]]



Still in object mode! 

Delete any of those black rings left over from the metas and select your new polygon mesh. 
















If you Tab into Edit mode you will see terrifying ugliness instead of nicely gridded mesh. &quot;Surely we can't be expected to create anything useful out of this!&quot; you shriek. Take it easy, my friend. It's time to add a ''Decimate'' modifier (make sure you're in object mode when doing this to see changes).








Switch back to object mode!

The '''Decimate''' modifier (you will only see things change if you're in object mode) will do two things for us. Its primary job is to ''reduce'' the poly count of a mesh. A pleasant side-effect for our purposes is that it will begin to ''rearrange'' the topology into a more manageable heap of triangles and quads. Keep reducing the Ratio slider below 0.5 until it becomes as coarse as you can stand. You want the lowest polygon base you can have that still maintains enough detail in the limbs and shapes you made with the Metaball phase. 

One thing to watch for is that this process sometimes creates holes as it does its best to simplify the mesh. I find that usually you can slightly change the Ratio to fix the problem, but if you're still finding holes, check out the &quot;Tips &amp; Tricks&quot; section at the end.

As you can see, this step greatly reduces the Face Count, which will be good later. Next we need to get rid of as many of those triangles as possible. Click Apply (in the modifier panel) 






Switch to Edit mode!

Press A until all of the vertices are selected (turn yellow) and hit Alt-J to convert the faces from triangles to quads, which will subdivide better. Now you should have something you can work with.


{{Clear}}

==Beginning to sculpt==
Right next to the Modifiers panel is the '''Multires''' panel. (Note: In recent versions of Blender this is not its own panel---it is a Modifier.) A multires object has the options to add numerous levels of smooth subdivision to a mesh. While you can use the sculpt tools on any polygon or nurbs mesh, the great strength of sculpting with Multires is the ability to jump back and forth to different levels, quickly sketching out the gross form at lower levels, and adding finer detail at the higher levels. Add the Multires and Add a level; we're ready to sculpt!


:'''Noob note:''' If nothing seems to be happening while you're trying to sculpt your mesh, it's because you haven't applied your Decimate. it must be locked down and applied before you're actually allowed to do anything to your mesh. 

:'''Noob note:''' Only apply multires once, doing it a few times will quickly increase the polygon count to amounts that will really slow blender down

In case you haven't noticed, Blender's different modes offer different tool sets and options. To make the sculpting tools available you need to be in '''Sculpt''' mode, accessible through the Mode drop-down in any 3D window header. You'll see two new tabs next to the multires panel, ''Sculpt'' and ''Brush.'' Sculpt has most of the options you'll need to begin shaping your mesh. Note that most of the different brushes in this panel have hot-keys which will save a lot of time('''G'''=Grab, '''D'''=Draw, '''S'''=Smooth, ''etc.''). Most important here is changing the brush size and intensity. Pressing F and dragging the mouse will resize the brush, while Shift-F will allow you to adjust the Brush Intensity. You can also turn on '''Symmetry''' to paint, for instance, both sides of a face at one time. This can speed up tasks tremendously, as long as your mesh is aligned to the axis properly.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

(West) Slavs lives in Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, (South) Slavs lives in Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia and (East) Slavs lives in Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.

== What did they believe? ==
Early Slavic people believed in many gods. For example, Perun, the god of thunder and lightning, Svarogc father of the chief deities, Dazhbog the god of sun and Svarazic the god of fire are some of their gods. The two most important gods were Byelobog (or Byelun) the White God and Chernobog the Black God. Most of the Slavic people converted to Christianity, that was practiced in the Byzantine Empire in eastern Europe. By the 1000s, all Slavic lands had been converted to Christianity.

==What Countries Did They Live In? ==
The Munhumutapa people lived in the south east coasts of Africa in the area of the modern countries of Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
The Kingdom of Mutapa Empire (Shona: Wene we Mutapa; Portuguese: Monomotapa) was a medieval kingdom (c. 1450-1629) which stretched between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers of Southern Africa in the modern states of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Its founders are culturally and politically related to the builders who constructed Great Zimbabwe.

== What did their buildings look like? ==

The buildings were built between the eleventh to fifteenth centuries, and are the oldest remains in the South of Africa. It is believed that 18,000 people lived in Great Zimbabwe, the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe. The ruins that have survived until today are built entirely of stone and we think the architecture was like that to protect from other people. 
Because of their great ability to construct such a great city, now Great Zimbabwe is a National Monument.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Huitlacoche.jpg|thumb|180px|Corn smut]]
The smuts are fungi, mostly ''Ustilaginomycetes'' (of the class ''Teliomycetae'', subphylum ''Basidiomycota''), that cause plant disease.

Smuts affect grasses, notably including cereal crops such as maize. They initially attack the plant's reproductive system, forming galls which darken and burst, releasing fungal spores which infect other plants nearby.

A smut infestation is controlled by removing and destroying the infected plants. In Agriculture, this process is known as destruction of the initial inoculum.

There are several types of smut including:
* [[w:Corn smut|Corn smut]]
* [[w:Sugarcane smut|Sugarcane smut]]
* [[w:Loose smut|Loose smut]]

Botryotinia is a genus of ascomycete fungi causing several plant diseases. The anamorphs (asexual reproductive stage) of Botryotinia are mostly included in the imperfect fungi genus Botrytis. The genus contains 22 species and one hybrid.

Plant diseases caused by Botryotinia species appear primarily as blossom blights and fruit rots but also as leaf spots and bulb rots in the field and in stored products. The fungi induce host-cell death resulting in progressive decay of infected plant tissue, whence they take nutrients.

'''''Magnaporthe grisea''''', also commonly known as '''rice blast fungus''', '''rice rotten neck''', '''rice seedling blight''',''' blast of rice''', '''oval leaf spot of graminea''', '''pitting disease''', '''ryegrass blast''', and '''johnson spot''', is a plant-pathogenic fungus that causes an important disease affecting rice. It can also infect a number of other agriculturally important cereals including wheat, rye, barley, and pearl millet causing diseases called '''blast disease''' or '''blight disease'''. ''M. grisea'' causes economically significant crop losses annually, each year it is estimated to destroy enough rice to feed more than 60 million people. The fungus is known to occur in 85 countries worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Where does religion come from?&quot; &quot;How did it develop?&quot;

The origin of religion is uncertain, but it has been suggested that it evolved for the nurture of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding |first=Sarah|last=Blaffer Hrdy |isbn=9780674032996 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say it is probably  a mechanism which helps us survive and thrive as human beings within a community founded on shared beliefs, traditions and practices.

Apart from any consideration of &quot;what the true religion is,&quot; or &quot;what is true in any given religion,&quot; we can reasonably ask what the source of the religious impulse is. That is actually within the purview of the first book in this series but here we want to look at what the religions themselves say about the subject. How would any particular individual answer the question, &quot;How did we begin to relate to the divine?&quot;

What is the myth of religion?

But before we look at this concept of myth, let's take a brief look at the actual historical entity we call religion (at least, as much as we think we know about that history.) I will follow the Random House Timetables of History as a guide to organize this discussion.

There is a good bit of controversy about how religion &quot;got started&quot;. With the current dialog about the neuronal area in the brain dubbed the &quot;God center&quot; it is possible that it, in fact, was always there, as long as there has been humans. Until recently, it has been assumed that religion appeared and developed with agriculture as fertility cults centered around the worship of an Earth mother, but that hardly explains the elaborate burial procedures used by prehistoric hunter and nomad societies. We must admit that we simply do not know how or where religion started. 

==Stone Age ==
Religious behaviour is thought to have emerged by the time of the Upper Paleolithic (Late Stone Age) more than 30,000 years ago. but behavioural patterns such as burial rites that might be characterized as religious reach back at least 300,000 years, with the first appearance of our near cousins Homo Neanderthalensis and our own direct Homosapiens ancestors . Religious behaviour may be ritual, spiritual, mythological or magical in character, often a combination of ideas and beliefs typically regarding absent ancestors and the impending cycles of the natural world, may have had separate histories of development during the Middle Palaeolithic before combining into &quot;proper religion&quot; of kingdoms and empires.

==Ancient Religion==
Until about 12,000 years ago around 10,000 BC (Before the Common Epoch - meaning  the modern calender date that Dennis the Dwarf miscalculated to be the birth of Christ) stone-age people survived in small groups. As the warmer Holocene period began, agriculture and complex societies emerged, empires flourished.  About 5000 years ago, writing was invented and recorded history began. about 4000 years ago in Persia (Mesopotamia) Zoroaster simplified the pantheon of confusing gods into two easily understood opposing forces - chaos and wisdom. We can not now know for sure if ancient historical characters ('ancient' means mentioned in writing) such as Zoroaster were real people, the name of a group of scholars or a fictional composite to explain the fusion of several schools of thought.

Past assumptions are quickly being eliminated by new information. We do know that priesthoods developed early in Egypt and Mesopotamia to officiate in the worship of gods who supposedly presided over local regions. These religions had intricate rituals, associated artistic and architectural traditions, and concepts such as divine kingship. Worship of nature deities was a feature of the Mediterranean world and Mesopotamia before the third millennium BC.

About 1772 BCE the sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi developed written law which he had inscribed on stone pillars or 'Stele' in every important settlement.  This legal code is one of the oldest deciphered writing of significant length found anywhere in the world. The authority of the Code of Hammurabi is based on his having been appointed and instructed by the prevailing regional gods and consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting &quot;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&quot; (lex talionis) so that severity of punishment depended on social status such as  slaves, women, free men or noble lords&lt;ref&gt;Review: The Code of Hammurabi, J. Dyneley Prince, The American Journal of Theology Vol. 8, No. 3 (Jul., 1904), pp. 601–609 Published by: The University of Chicago Press. URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/3153895&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Bronze Age Religions===
Mesopotamian religion had developed into its classical form in the early dynastic period. It recognized four major gods: Anu, the god of heaven; Enlil, the god of wind; Enki, the god of water; and Ninhursag, the goddess of birth. Divination was practiced as part of the religious rituals.

Egyptian  religion reflected the stability of life in the Nile valley in the early dynastic period. A belief in an afterlife was well established by that time and was extended to include people other than royalty with the decline of the Old Kingdom.

Invasions of warrior, Aryan cultures following 2000 BC, caused changes in the great religions of the Near East including the development of ecstatic sacrificial cults but, despite that and the brief incursion of the interesting monotheistic religion sponsored by the Pharaoh Akhenaton, Egyptian religion remained quite hardy and virtually unchanged. Nevertheless, this historical matrix provided the cultural ground from which the ethical monotheism of the Israelite tribes grew. Whatever the initial events, this is the fertile ground from which Judaism, Islam, and Christianity grew.

The Aryan invaders of India carried with them the seeds of the religion that would be embodied in the collection of sacred hymns called the Vedas. This was a complex, polytheistic religion that would develop into the Hindu religion.

During the period of the Judges, a strong emphasis toward purity in the monotheistic religion of Israel developed, reinforcing the resistance of outside influences and the tendency to add deities to the traditional faith.

Around 1000 BC, a secular philosophy emerged in China that set the stage for the major religious systems with their deemphasis of the supernatural. The Rigveda developed in India around this time, as did the Shinto religion in Japan.

The constant invasion of Greece by the northern tribes kept the religious thought there in flux and would lead to a flexible philosophical outlook that would foster the development of the brilliant 5th century Greek culture with its complicated pantheon of gods associated with Olympus.
===Religion and Rulers===
Religion is closely associated with absolute social control and rigid hierarchy, often ruled by a  supposedly  deified hereditary single ruler such as 'A King appointed by God' (winning power by force clearly 'demonstrated' God's will) 
*For example, A Chinese military general, strategist and philosopher from the Zhou Dynasty  (c. 722–481 BC) proposed terror be used to win wars and impose without fighting. Before hiring a general the King is said to have challenged  him to convert a harem of concubines into soldiers. when first ordered  to face right, they giggled. In response, General Sun Tzu is supposed to have ordered the execution of the king's two most favoured concubines,because, if juniors did not obey, it was because their superiors were weak.

Alternatively people who were able to correctly predict astronomical events might be seen as magicians - able to bring the same order  to human life. 
*For example, the concept of caste in India was elaborated around 700 BC  by the Vedic tradition in order to organize division of labour and secure power in the hands of a ruling elite, the priestly caste of Brahman.

Nevertheless the period of time from 800 to 200 BC, called the axial age, saw a remarkable flowering of religious and philosophical thought. Buddhism and Jainism were significant offspring of Brahmanism. Zoroastrianism developed in Persia. Both Taoism and Confucianism became established in China. Greek philosophy began with Thales and his contemporaries and thrived through the time of Aristotle.
===Iron Age Religions===
The establishment of the Roman Empire set the stage for the Christian religion which began as a sect of the Jewish religion but quickly found its independence and thrived during the early years of persecution to become one of the most influential movements in Western civilization.

The complex doctrine of the Christian church developed, in large part, in response to emerging traditions outside the mainstream church including Gnosticism, Manichaeanism, Mithraism, and Montanism, and in response to legalistic tendencies within the mainstream church that tended to draw the adherents back into the parent Judaism. Constantine (c. 285 - 337) adopted Christianity as his own religion (possibly in addition to other religious affiliations) and provided religious freedom to all religions. Theodosius the Great (c. 379 - 395) then made Christianity the Roman state religion. Finally safe from outside attacks the Christian church then turned inward to begin a history of, often violent, internal disputes.

During this same time period - roughly the first 500 years AD, Buddhism's power increased, turning back to influence the parent religion, Hinduism and also moving into China to claim adherents there and to affect the traditional Chinese religions and philosophies. By 700, Buddhism was firmly established in China and Japan.

Islam appeared in the early 7th century and quickly grew. By 700 AD, it had spread across the Middle East. By the year 1000, it had reached India and Spain. Like Christianity, it had to deal with internal schism which have yet to be resolved.

In the centuries before the turn of the first millennium, the church became more and more political. The competition between the Eastern and Western churches led to a widening rift. The papal support of Charlemagne's empire gave the church greater prestige but individual clergy became more and more disreputable, which would eventually lead to the monastic Cluniac reform movement which emphasized clerical discipline. 
===The Dark Ages===
During this time, the Sufi movement was founded in the Islamic society, emphasizing an austere mysticism in response to the rational idealism of orthodox Islam.

In the Americas, Mayan religion reached its zenith as a complex, hierarchical system. 

The Vikings also reached a peak around 1000. They worshipped a pantheon of gods similar to the Germanic who were called the Aesir and were lead by Odin.
===Medievalism===
After 1000, the church consolidated its power to judge the morality of secular political entities. Scholasticism appeared in both the Christian and the Muslim communities with a revival of interest in philosophy and especially Greek and Aristotlean thought. The First Crusade (1096-1099) captured Jerusalem and established Frankish kingdoms in the Near East. 

The popular Mahayana form of Buddhism and the monastic Zen form appeared and developed in China and Japan.

During the years from 1250 to 1400, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scot, and William of Ockham brought European scholasticism to its zenith. The papacy of Boniface VIII marked the peak of papal power. After the move of the papacy to Avignon in 1305, the power of the papacy declined. The seeds of the Protestant Reformation were evident in the writings of people like William Langland and John Wycliffe who criticized the clergy for its corruption while advocation spiritual and social equality.

The first printed Bible was produced in 1456.

The Spanish Inquisition was instituted in 1478. Among its targets were Jews, Muslims, and Catholic intellectuals. The church also condemned the practice of witchcraft in 1484 and the manual of persecution of witches, the Malleus Maleficarum was published in 1487.

==Modern Religious Thought==
Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door of Wittenberg Castle Church in protest to corrupt practices in the Catholic Church in 1517. He was excommunicated in 1520. In 1521, at the Diet of Worms, he argued for justification by faith alone. He translated the Bible into the German vernacular around 1525.

In 1534, Henry VIII assumed full control over the Church of England in 1534.

John Calvin began his ministry in Geneva, Switzerland in 1541, teaching the doctrine that God had elected who would and would not be saved from the beginning (predestination).

The Council of Trent instituted the Catholic counter-reformation in 1545-1547.

Sikhism was founded by Nanak around 1519.

Francis Bacon wrote his masterwork on the scientific method, Novum Organum, in 1620. Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) championed the cause of science and ran afoul of the church, spending his last years of life in house arrest. René Descartes (1598-1650) developed many of the method that would allow for a mathematical evaluation of physical phenomenon. A materialistic view of nature was developing that would lead to a serious confrontation with the church in later years. Still, at this time, the scientific community generally supported an unassailable belief in God.

George Fox founded the Quakers in 1652.

The later part of the 17th century saw a great increase in scientific and philosophical investigations along with a sharp split between people like Isaac Newton, John Locke, and Bishop George Berkeley, who were strict empiricist who believed that knowledge could only be gained by experience; and people like Gottfried Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza, rationalists who believed that knowledge of the world could be derived by deductive reasoning.

Hundreds of years of war in Europe, ostensibly due to differences in religious belief, caused thinkers to ponder ways to approach religion that would lead to a more peaceful society - in that, they began to look at and study religion from a strictly secular angle.

David Hume (1411-1776) pointed out the flaws in scientific thinking and came to the conclusion that we can't really know anything, much less anything about God.
===The Renaissance===
Philosophers in 18th century Europe were beginning to predict or, even, call for the demise of religion.

Henri de Saint-Simon (1760-1825) and Auguste Compte (1798-1857) sought to replace Christianity with a secular religious priesthood based on positivism.
===Universal Education===
Mormonism was founded in New York state in 1830 by Joseph Smith. Modern Adventism, precursor of the Seventh Day Adventists sect was founded in 1831 by William Miller.

Felicite Lamennais, in Thoughts of a Believer (1834) argued for separation of church and state and criticized the Catholic Church for its interference in politics.

Ludwig Feuerbach (1904-1872) advocated humanistic atheism and influenced Karl Marx (1818-1883) who viciously attacked religion as the &quot;opiate of the masses&quot;. Marx predicted the immanent demise of religion.

Ali Muhammad founded the Babi movement in Persia in 1844.

Mírza Husayn 'Alí, 19 years after Ali Muhammad in the year 1863, founded the Baha'i Faith. Ali Muhammad's followers were told of the coming of Mírza Husayn 'Alí and were instructed to follow His religion.

During the late 1800s and early 1900s, the ideas of Marx, Freud, Compte, Darwin and others posed very serious critiques to religion. In particular, the idea of evolution provided an alternative to the religious idea of the intelligent creator. It was demonstrated that nature might be self organizing to a certain extent.

The T'ai-p'ing Rebellion in China in 1850 was very much influenced by Protestant Christian teachings regarding equality and communal economics.

William Booth founded the Salvation Army in 1865 in response to the squalor he witnessed in London.

The doctrine of papal infallibility was one result of the first Vatican Council in 1869-1870. In 1871, Johann von Dolinger was excommunicated for opposing the same doctrine.

Max Muller addressed the royal Institute of London on the &quot;science of religion&quot; in 1870.

Eastern and Western thought began to mix in earnest with the Hindu reforms of Ramakrishna (1836-1886) and the Theosophical Society founded in New York in 1875 by Helene Blavatsky.

In the United States, the Jehovah's Witnesses were founded by Charles Russell (1852-1916) and Christian Science was founded by Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910).

Although the spirit of Antisemitism has been around for a long time, the ideology of Antisemitism developed as an outgrowth of various nationalistic sentiments in the late 1800s. It was popularized in La France Juive by Edouard Drumont in 1886.

James Frazier published his anthropological treatise on religion, The Golden Bough, in 1890. He speculated that there is, in human history, a natural development from nature magic, through religion, to scientific thought.

William James (1842-1910), in The Varieties of Religious Experience, described religion on the basis of observable religious behavior and posited that religion could have either healthy or unhealthy expression.

Freud's total rejection of religion as a juvenile defense mechanism was a major factor in the split between him and his protege Carl Jung.

The Pentecostal movement began in America around 1902.

Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) championed global unity and nonviolent civil disobedience while the Vienna Circle (1927-1938) championed the strict empiricism called positivism.

Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906-1945) sought a secular version of Christianity. 

The World Council of Churches met in 1948.

The Christian church began to search for means toward unity in the Ecumenical Movement, which began in 1961-1962. The Catholic Church tried to reconcile internal differences during the Vatican Council of 1962.

The United States Episcopal Church began to allow the ordination of women as priests in 1976.

The mass suicide of the People's Temple cult in Guyana in 1979 drew international attention.

The Chinese government allowed the reopening of many Buddhist, Christian, and Muslim churches in 1981.

Carol Tavris brought up some serious critiques of scientific research from a woman's studies perspective in &quot;The Mismeasure of Woman&quot; in 1992.

So, this is my first story and it's called the history of religion. I have another story to tell about history, this one a bit more personal.

When I was in high school, the history class I was in was taught, as history, that Catherine the Great of Russia died trying to have sex with a horse. It seems, the horse fell on her. I later found that &quot;in fact&quot; the incident did not even occur and the story seems to be a rumor started by the French who were the enemies of Russia during this period of history.

My point is that history is not necessarily fact. The old dictum, &quot;History is written by the victor,&quot; applies here, which does not, at all, make history useless, but it is important how it is used. History is useful in so much as it helps us to understand the present and predict the future. The past is gone and, in many ways, we can never be sure what, exactly, has happened then, but as long as we keep in mind that any particular history is a best guess given what we have to decipher it, we are usually okay.

So with that caveat in place, let us continue.

Exercise:

Form a timeline of your own personal religion. How did you come to believe what you believe about things like death, God, spiritual things, morality, etc.? How certain can you be about the truth of these events? You may be able to talk to others (parents, teachers, etc.) and compare their memories about the events  with your own.

Modern tipis provide a tent structure essentially cone-shaped, including a flue opening in one side adjacent the peak. Two flexible smoke flaps are aligned vertically along the lateral edges of the flue opening. Two truss poles extend from the ground on opposite sides of the tent to a location above the peak, and the peak of the tent is slung from the point where the truss poles meet. Two flap poles extend upwardly from the ground on the side opposite the flue opening, each flap pole crossing one of the truss poles externally and being attached to one of the smoke flaps, in order to maintain the flaps taut in a desired orientation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The sample gui application quits immediately now ... I need to put a (. Thread (sleep 10000)) to get any value from it.  Brand new to Clojure, so I'm not sure what the best fix is.

== split into multiple pages? ==

Good article, but long.  Might consider splitting it into multiple pages.

-- I split the main topic to subpages, but didn't edit the main page yet. This should help further work

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Clojure_Programming/Getting_Started 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Clojure_Programming/Tutorials_and_Tips

=== mvn vs ant ===

I've did &quot;mvn install&quot;, but it downloaded a whole bunch of things to my machine. And so far just doing &quot;ant&quot; works for me :)

== Problem with clj-completions script ==

The supplied clj-competions script doesn't work with recent svn checkouts. The following will do completions for the clojure.core namespace

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defmacro with-out-file [pathname &amp; body]
  `(with-open [stream# (new java.io.FileWriter ~pathname)]
    (binding [*out* stream#]
      ~@body)))

(def completions (keys (ns-publics (find-ns 'clojure.core))))
(with-out-file &quot;clj-keys.txt&quot; (doseq [x completions] (println x)))
&lt;/source&gt;

== needs much work ==

Wow, these instructions are atrocious.

== Knowledge collection ==

There is so much knowledge in the Google Group, IRC transcripts, official docs, actual code, screencasts, and what not. It's getting out of hand to learn all the small stuff like conventions, idioms, guidelines, principles of operation, and other stuff that's usually left out of the regular docs and, currently, out of this wiki.

Maybe there's a point to start a section for these small not-really-belonging-anywhere-else tidbits? E.g. What's Clojure convention for naming functions, camelCase or under_scores or dash-names? (dash-names).

What do you think?

== Approved revisions ==

The approved revision mechanism is killing this wiki. I'm avoiding even the smallest improvements due to this over-controlling mechanism. Please remove it and let the magic commence. [[Special:Contributions/62.0.132.222|62.0.132.222]] ([[User talk:62.0.132.222|talk]]) 10:43, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

I don't think there's a way to disable this, unfortunately.  [[Help:Revision_review#Automatic_editor_status_criteria]] explains how one can become an editor.  I think it's too much trouble, but the rules are being revised, apparently.  [[Special:Contributions/41.241.89.88|41.241.89.88]] ([[User talk:41.241.89.88|talk]]) 14:22, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

I do not know, and have been unable to find an elementary proof of this theorem. If you know of a proof of this result that is appropriate for the level of this book, please contribute.

This result is '''incorrect''' (consider the metric space of the real numbers, without the number 0. Then the sequence 1/n has no convergent subsequence)--[[Special:Contributions/131.243.31.197|131.243.31.197]] ([[User talk:131.243.31.197|talk]]) 00:08, 7 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I started serious pyhton programming one month ago. I have touched python several times, but found it very hard to start. The learning curve is steep.

This Wiki on Python programming help me a lot. Where the Python.org documentation is for experienced python programmers, the wiki is up to date and easy to understand. Especially the page about classes is excellent.

I would like this wiki on Python to be a good start point for beginners.

A lot of new python programmers are starting right now. The IronPython studio has been released. Many new to python will start look at the language. This Wiki can help these beginners to get a good first experience with python progamming. It is strongly needed, because the IronPython studion generates terrible python.

I am 45 years old. I have a family with wife and three kids of 9, 7 and 2 year. I work as a software architect on a Microsoft platform, .Net and C# in a good SCRUM team.</text>

==Acid-Base Reaction Theories==

Acids and bases are everywhere.  Some foods contain acid, like the citric acid in lemons and the lactic acid in dairy.  Cleaning products like bleach and ammonia are bases.  Chemicals that are acidic or basic are an important part of chemistry.

{{Helpful hint|hint=You may need to refresh your memory on [[General Chemistry/Naming Substances#Naming acids|naming acids]].}}
Several different theories explain what composes an '''acid''' and a '''base'''.  The first scientific definition of an acid was proposed by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in the eighteenth century. He proposed that acids contained oxygen, although he did not know the dual composition of acids such as hydrochloric acid (HCl).  Over the years, much more accurate definitions of acids and bases have been created.  

=== Arrhenius Theory ===
The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius published his theory of acids and bases in 1887. It can be simply explained by these two points:

{{TextBox|1=
; Arrhenius Acids and Bases
# An acid is a substance which dissociates in water to produce one or more hydrogen ions (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).
# A base is a substance which dissociates in water to produce one or more hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).}}

[[Image:Arrhenius2.jpg|thumb|Svante Arrhenius]]
Based on this definition, you can see that Arrhenius acids must be soluble in water.  Arrhenius acid-base reactions can be summarized with three generic equations:
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HA} \to \hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{A}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|An acid will dissociate in water producing hydrogen ions.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{MOH} \to \hbox{M}^+ + \hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|A base (usually containing a metal) will dissociate in water to product hydroxide ions.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HA}_{(aq)} + \hbox{MOH}_{(aq)} \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)} + \hbox{MA}_{(aq)}&lt;/math&gt;
|Acids and bases will neutralize each other when mixed.  They produce water and an ionic salt, neither of which are acidic or basic.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The Arrhenius theory is simple and useful.  It explains many properties and reactions of acids and bases.  For instance, mixing hydrochloric acid (HCl) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) results in a neutral solution containing table salt (NaCl).

However, the Arrhenius theory is not without flaws.  There are many well known bases, such as ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) that do not contain the hydroxide ion.  Furthermore, acid-base reactions are observed in solutions that do not contain water.  To resolve these problems, there is a more advanced acid-base theory.

===Brønsted-Lowry Theory ===

The Brønsted-Lowry theory was proposed in 1923.  It is more general than the Arrhenius theory—all Arrhenius acids/bases are also Brønsted-Lowry acids/bases (but not necessarily vice versa).

{{TextBox|1=
;Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases
# An acid is a substance from which a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion) can be removed. Essentially, an acid ''donates'' protons to bases.
# A base is a substance to which a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) can be added. Essentially, a base ''accepts'' protons from acids.}}

{{Wikipedia|Acid–base reaction}}
Acids that can donate only one proton are '''monoprotic''', and acids that can donate more than one proton are '''polyprotic'''.

These reactions demonstrate the behavior of Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases:
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HCl} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{Cl}^- + \hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+&lt;/math&gt;
|An acid (in this case, hydrochloric acid) will donate a proton to a base (in this case, water is the base).  The acid loses its proton and the base gains it.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HCl} + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_3 \to \hbox{Cl}^- + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_4^+&lt;/math&gt;
|Water is not necessary.  In this case, hydrochloric acid is still the acid, but ammonia acts as the base.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Cl}^- + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_4^+ \to \hbox{HCl} + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_3&lt;/math&gt;
|The same reaction is happening, but now in reverse.  What was once an acid is now a base (HCl → Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and what was once a base is now an acid (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  This concept is called ''conjugates'', and it will be explained in more detail later.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HCl} + \hbox{NaOH} \to \hbox{NaCl} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+ + \hbox{OH}^- \to 2 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
|Two examples of acids (HCl and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) mixing with bases (NaOH and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) to form neutral substances (NaCl and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{NaOH} + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_3 \to \hbox{Na}^+ + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{N}\hbox{H}_2^-&lt;/math&gt;
|A base (sodium hydroxide) will accept a proton from an acid (ammonia).  A neutral substance is produced (water), which is not necessarily a part of every reaction.  Compare this reaction to the second one.  Ammonia was a base, and now it is an acid.  This concept, called ''amphoterism'', is explained later.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The Brønsted-Lowry theory is by far the most useful and commonly-used definition.  For the remainder of General Chemistry, you can assume that any acids/bases use the Brønsted-Lowry definition, unless stated otherwise.

[[Image:Acetic-acid-dissociation-3D-balls.png|thumb|center|This Brønsted-Lowry acid donates a proton (in green) to water (the base).]]

===Lewis Theory===

The Lewis definition is the most general theory, having no requirements for solubility or protons.

{{TextBox|1=
; Lewis Acids and Bases
# An acid is a substance that accepts a lone pair of electrons.
# A base is a substance that donates a lone pair electrons.}}

Lewis acids and bases react to create an '''adduct''', a compound in which the acid and base have bonded by sharing the electron pair.  Lewis acid/base reactions are different from redox reactions because there is no change in oxidation state.

[[Image:Coordinate Covalent Bonding.svg|thumb|center|This reaction shows a Lewis base (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) donating an electron pair to a Lewis acid (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to form an adduct (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).]]

== Amphoterism and Water ==

Substances capable of acting as either an acid or a base are '''amphoteric'''.  Water is the most important amphoteric substance.  It can ionize into hydroxide (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, a base) or hydronium (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, an acid).  By doing so, water is
# Increasing the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; concentration (Arrhenius),
# Donating or accepting a proton (Brønsted-Lowry), and
# Accepting or donating an electron pair (Lewis).

{{Info|1=
;Important
A bare proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion) cannot exist in water.  It will form a hydrogen bond to the nearest water molecule, creating the '''hydronium ion''' (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  Although many equations and definitions may refer to the &quot;concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions&quot;, that is a misleading abbreviation.  Technically, there are no H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, only hydronium (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions.  Fortunately, the number of hydronium ions formed is exactly equal to the number of hydrogen ions, so the two can be used interchangeably.}}

[[Image:Hydronium-3D-balls.png|thumb|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions actually exist as hydronium, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
Water will dissociate very slightly (which further explains its amphoteric properties).
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \leftrightarrow \hbox{H}^+ + \hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|The presence of hydrogen ions indicates an acid, whereas the presence of hydroxide ions indicates a base.  Being neutral, water dissociates into both equally.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \leftrightarrow \hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+ + \hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|This equation is more accurate—hydrogen ions do not exist in water because they bond to form hydronium.
|}

=== Ammonia ===

Another common example of an amphoteric substance is ammonia.  Ammonia is normally a base, but in some reactions it can act like an acid.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{NH}_3 + \hbox{HCl} \to \hbox{NH}_4^+ + \hbox{Cl}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|Ammonia acts as a base.  It accepts a proton to form ''ammonium''.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Li}_3\hbox{N} + 2 \hbox{NH}_3 \to 3\hbox{Li}^+ + 3\hbox{NH}_2^-&lt;/math&gt;
|Ammonia also acts as an acid.  Here, it donates a proton to form ''amide''.
|}

Ammonia's amphoteric properties are not often seen because ammonia typically acts like a base.  Water, on the other hand, is completely neutral, so its acid and base behaviors are both observed commonly.

==Conjugate Acids and Bases==

In all the theories, the products of an acid-base reaction are related to the initial reactants of the reaction. For example, in the Brønsted-Lowry theory, this relationship is the difference of a proton between a reactant and product. Two substances which exhibit this relationship form a '''conjugate acid-base pair'''. 

{{TextBox|
; Brønsted-Lowry Conjugate Pairs
* An acid that has donated its proton becomes a ''conjugate base''.
* A base that has accepted a proton becomes a ''conjugate acid''.}}

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;{\color{Red}\mathcal{HI}_{(aq)}} + {\color{Blue}\mathbf{H}_2\mathbf{O}_{(l)}} \to {\color{Blue}\mathcal{I}^-_{(aq)}} + {\color{Red}\mathbf{H}_3\mathbf{O}^+_{(aq)}}&lt;/math&gt;
|Hydroiodic acid reacts with water (which serves as a base).  The conjugate base is the iodide ion and the conjugate acid is the hydronium ion.  The acids are written in red, and the bases are written in blue.  One conjugate pair is written bold and the other conjugate pair is in cursive.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;{\color{Blue}\mathcal{NH}_{3(aq)}} + {\color{Red}\mathbf{H}_2\mathbf{O}_{(l)}} \to {\color{Red}\mathcal{NH}^+_{4(aq)}} + {\color{Blue}\mathbf{OH}^-_{(aq)}}&lt;/math&gt;
|Ammonia (basic) reacts with water (the acid).  The conjugate acid is ammonium and the conjugate base is hydroxide.  Again, acids are written in red, and the bases are written in blue.  The conjugate pairs are distinguished with matching fonts.
|}

==Strong and Weak Acids/Bases==

A '''strong acid''' is an acid which dissociates completely in water. That is, ''all'' the acid molecules break up into ions and solvate (attach) to water molecules. Therefore, the concentration of hydronium ions in a strong acid solution is equal to the concentration of the acid.

The majority of acids exist as '''weak acids''', an acid which dissociates only partially.  On average, only about 1% of a weak acid solution dissociates in water in a 0.1 mol/L solution. Therefore, the concentration of hydronium ions in a weak acid solution is always less than the concentration of the dissolved acid.

'''Strong bases''' and '''weak bases''' do not require additional explanation; the concept is the same.

{{Info|The conjugate of a strong acid/base is very weak. The conjugate of a weak acid/base is not necessarily strong.}}
This explains why, in all of the above example reactions, the reverse chemical reaction does not occur.  The stronger acid/base will prevail, and the weaker one will not contribute to the overall acidity/basicity.  For example, hydrochloric acid is strong, and upon dissociation chloride ions are formed.  Chloride ions are a weak base, but the solution is not basic because the acidity of HCl is overwhelmingly stronger than basicity of Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{Helpful hint|hint=Although the other halogens make strong acids, '''hydrofluoric acid''' (HF) is a weak acid.  Despite being weak, it is incredibly corrosive—hydrofluoric acid dissolves glass and metal!}}
Most acids and bases are weak.  You should be familiar with the most common strong acids and assume that any other acids are weak.
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Formula
! Strong Acid
|-
| HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; || Perchloric acid
|-
| HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || Nitric acid
|-
| H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; || Sulfuric acid
|-
| HCl, HBr, HI || Hydrohalic acids
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Within a series of ''oxyacids'', the ions with the greatest number of oxygen molecules are the strongest.  For example, nitric acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;'''3'''&lt;/sub&gt;) is strong, but nitrous acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;) is weak.  Perchloric acid (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is stronger than chloric acid (HClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is stronger than the weak chlorous acid (HClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Hypochlorous acid (HClO) is the weakest of the four.

Common strong bases are the hydroxides of Group 1 and most Group 2 metals.  For example, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide are some of the strongest bases.  You can assume that any other bases (including ammonia and ammonium hydroxide) are weak.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Formula
! Strong Base
|-
| LiOH || Lithium hydroxide
|-
| NaOH || Sodium hydroxide
|-
| KOH || Potassium hydroxide
|-
| RbOH || Rubidium hydroxide
|-
| CsOH || Cesium hydroxide
|-
| Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || Calcium hydroxide
|-
| Sr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || Strontium hydroxide
|-
| Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || Barium hydroxide
|}
{{ref|Brown_2009}}
&lt;/center&gt;

{{Yellow Warning|Acids and bases that are strong are not necessarily concentrated, and weak acids/bases are not necessarily dilute.  Concentration has nothing to do with the ability of a substance to dissociate.  Furthermore, ''polyprotic'' acids are not necessarily stronger than ''monoprotic'' acids.}}

==Properties of Acids and Bases==

Now that you are aware of the acid-base theories, you can learn about the physical and chemical properties of acids and bases.  Acids and bases have very different properties, allowing them to be distinguished by observation.

=== Indicators ===
[[Image:Bromothymol blue colors.jpg|thumb|'''Bromothymol blue''' is an indicator that turns blue in a base, or yellow in acid.]]
Made with special chemical compounds that react slightly with an acid or base, '''indicators''' will change color in the presence of an acid or base. A common indicator is '''litmus paper'''. Litmus paper turns red in acidic conditions and blue in basic conditions.  '''Phenolphthalein purple''' is colorless in acidic and neutral solutions, but it turns purple once the solution becomes basic.  It is useful when attempting to neutralize an acidic solution; once the indicator turns purple, enough base has been added.

=== Conductivity ===

A less informative method is to test for conductivity. Acids and bases in aqueous solutions will conduct electricity because they contain dissolved ions.  Therefore, acids and bases are ''electrolytes''.  Strong acids and bases will be strong electrolytes.  Weak acids and bases will be weak electrolytes.  This affects the amount of conductivity.

However, acids will react with metal, so testing conductivity may not be plausible.

=== Physical properties ===

{{Warning|The following is for informative purposes only. '''Do not sniff, touch, or taste any acids or bases''' as they may result in injury or death.}}

The physical properties of acids and bases are opposites.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
!Acids
!Bases
|-
!Taste
|sour
|bitter
|-
!Feel
|stinging
|slippery
|-
!Odor
|sharp
|odorless
|}

These properties are very general; they may not be true for every single acid or base.

Another warning:  if an acid or base is spilled, it must be cleaned up immediately and properly (according to the procedures of the lab you are working in).  If, for example, sodium hydroxide is spilled, the water will begin to evaporate.  Sodium hydroxide does not evaporate, so the concentration of the base steadily increases until it becomes damaging to its surrounding surfaces.

=== Chemical Reactions ===

==== Neutralization ====
Acids will react with bases to form a salt and water.  This is a '''neutralization''' reaction.  The products of a neutralization reaction are much less acidic or basic than the reactants were.  For example, sodium hydroxide (a base) is added to hydrochloric acid.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{NaOH}_{(aq)} + \hbox{HCl}_{(aq)} \to \hbox{NaCl}_{(aq)} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a [[General Chemistry/Types of chemical reactions#Double Replacement Reaction|double replacement]] reaction.

==== Acids ====
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{HCl}_{(aq)} + \hbox{Zn}_{(s)} \to \hbox{ZnCl}_{2(aq)} + \hbox{H}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Acids react with metal to produce a metal salt and hydrogen gas bubbles.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{SO}_{4(aq)} + \hbox{CaCO}_{3(s)} \to \hbox{CaSO}_{4(s)} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)} + \hbox{CO}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Acids react with metal carbonates to produce water, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas bubbles, and a salt.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{HNO}_{3(aq)} + \hbox{Na}_2\hbox{O}_{(s)} \to 2 \hbox{NaNO}_{3(aq)} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;
| Acids react with metal oxides to produce water and a salt.
|}

==== Bases ====
Bases are typically less reactive and violent than acids.  They do still undergo many chemical reactions, especially with organic compounds.  A common reactions is ''saponificiation'': the reaction of a base with fat or oil to create soap.

[[Image:Saponification.png|thumb|250px|center|Saponification converts an &quot;ester&quot; into an &quot;alcohol&quot; and salt.  This is an [[Organic Chemistry|organic reaction]] outside the scope of General Chemistry.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the best results, you should have Script Editor open, so you can test the code and results as you read.

== Basics of Lists ==
Applescript has two data structures, '''lists''' and '''records'''. A list is an ordered collection of objects. Ordered, in the sense that items can be retrieved by index, and of objects because you can put anything into a list with anything else.

List creation is simple, anything that you put between a &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; is a list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;
set myList to {} -- make a new list
set myList to myList &amp; {1, &quot;two&quot;, {7}, {fred:&quot;barney&quot;, wilma:&quot;betty&quot;, foo:&quot;bar&quot;}, 5} -- add a bunch of items to the list
set k to {6, &quot;three&quot;, {8}, {george:&quot;jetson&quot;, elroy:&quot;jetson&quot;, judy:&quot;jetson&quot;}, 0}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above we create two lists. The first list &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; contains 5 items, the number 1, a string &quot;two&quot;, a list containing the number 7, a record containing three properties, ''fred'', ''wilma'', and ''foo'' with string values, and the number 5. 

We can access these items in several ways. The statements

&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;
item 3 of myList
third item of myList
myList's third item
myList's item 3
&lt;/source&gt;

Will all return the same value, &lt;code&gt;{7}&lt;/code&gt;, that is, a list containing the number 7.

=== Looping Through a String As If It Were a List ===

This works a character at a time. (Strings are sequences of characters and behave accordingly.)
&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt; 
set my_string to &quot;freedom is not freedom fries&quot;
repeat with counter_variable_name from 1 to count of my_string
	set current_character to item counter_variable_name of my_string
end repeat
&lt;/source&gt;

== Basics of Records ==

A record is a list of '''properties'''. You can retrieve items from a record by name, but not by index. For example, to retrieve the &lt;code&gt;elroy&lt;/code&gt; of the property list &lt;code&gt;{scooby:&quot;doo&quot;, elroy:&quot;jetson&quot;,grape:&quot;ape&quot;}&lt;/code&gt;, I can retrieve it by name.
&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;
elroy of {scooby:&quot;doo&quot;, elroy:&quot;jetson&quot;, grape:&quot;ape&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

Which will return the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;jetson&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

but not by index, 
&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;
item 2 of {scooby:&quot;doo&quot;, elroy:&quot;jetson&quot;, grape:&quot;ape&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

Which returns an error.

      <comment>I added one important function and changed one mistake. Now the commands work properly.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this tutorial, we will plot a set of random, uniformly distributed, points on the surface of a sphere. This seems like a trivial task, but we will see that the &quot;obvious&quot; solution is actually incorrect. We will start off with this incorrect method, and then improve it to be correct.

== Incorrect Method ==

[[File:Spherical Coordinates (Colatitude, Longitude).svg|right|200px|thumb|The Spherical Coordinate system we are using.]]
In order to plot a point on a sphere's surface, we need two numbers: the colatitude, ''φ'' and the longitude, ''θ''. We could use the latitude, which is given by 90°−''φ'', but colatitude is the conventional quantity to deal with.

Now, we will make the simplistic assumption that we can use a uniform distribution for both the colatitude and longitude. We will plot 6000 points over a half sphere only, as this will allow us to see the results more clearly.

Let's define these distributions:

 theta := RandomReal[ {0, Pi} ]; (* Uniform on [0,Pi], longitude, only goes halfway round*)
 phi   := RandomReal[ {0, Pi} ]; (* Uniform on [0,Pi], colatitude, from pole to pole *)

You can easily alter the angle covered by changing the &lt;tt&gt;{0, Pi}&lt;/tt&gt; to your desired boundaries.

Notice that we have used the &quot;set delayed&quot; operator (&lt;tt&gt;:=&lt;/tt&gt;). We need this because when we build a table of the values in the next step, we want the &lt;tt&gt;Random[]&lt;/tt&gt; function to be called for each entry. If we do not do this, the values of &lt;tt&gt;theta&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;phi&lt;/tt&gt; will be set above and never changed, resulting in 6000 identical points. We now make the table of data:

&lt;pre&gt;
dataPoints = Table[
   {phi, theta},
   {6000}];
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let's have a look at the distribution of the points:

&lt;pre&gt;
rectPlot = ListPlot[
  dataPoints,
  AxesLabel -&gt; {&quot;\[Phi]&quot;, &quot;\[Theta]&quot;},
  Ticks -&gt; {
    {0, Pi/4, Pi/2, 3 Pi/4, Pi},
    {0, Pi/4, Pi/2, 3 Pi/4, Pi}}
  ]
&lt;/pre&gt;

This produces the following output. We see that the points indeed appear to be uniformly distributed.

[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 1.png|centre]]

We will now map these spherical coordinates into the Cartesian space. This transformation is standard:

:&lt;math&gt; x = r \sin\phi \cos\theta \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = r \sin\phi \sin\theta \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z = r \cos\phi \,&lt;/math&gt;

For our purposes, we will set ''r''=1. We make a function called &lt;tt&gt;sphericalToCartesian&lt;/tt&gt; to transform each two-element coordinate &lt;tt&gt;{φ,θ}&lt;/tt&gt; in the spherical system to a three-element coordinate,&lt;tt&gt;{x,y,z}&lt;/tt&gt;, in the Cartesian system.

&lt;pre&gt;
sphericalToCartesian[{phi_, theta_}] :=
  {Sin[phi]*Cos[theta],
   Sin[phi]*Sin[theta],
   Cos[phi]};
&lt;/pre&gt;

We have a mapping, so all that remains is to apply it using the &quot;map&quot; operator, &lt;tt&gt;/@&lt;/tt&gt;, which will perform this on each point in &lt;tt&gt;dataPoints&lt;/tt&gt;:

 mappedPoints = sphericalToCartesian /@ dataPoints;

Now that we have a set of points in the Cartesian system, we would like to see them. We make a set of points located at each point in &lt;tt&gt;mappedPoints&lt;/tt&gt; and show it. Here, we have the default view, and orthographic views from the top and front:

&lt;pre&gt;
 points = Graphics3D[Point /@ mappedPoints];

 Show[points]
 Show[points, ViewPoint-&gt;{0,Infinity,0)}]
 Show[points, ViewPoint-&gt;{0,0,Infinity)}]
&lt;/pre&gt;

{| align=center
|[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 2.png|centre|250px]]
|[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 3.png|centre|250px]]
|[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 4.png|centre|250px]]
|}

We see that the points are certainly ''not'' distributed evenly - they are much more dense at the poles. This is because the mapping from spherical to Cartesian coordinates does not preserve area - the spherical space is pinched and compressed at the poles by the mapping. In order to fix this, we must alter our original distributions.

== The Correct Method ==

In order to find the correct distribution for &lt;tt&gt;theta&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;phi&lt;/tt&gt;, we must consider the [[w:Jacobian determinant|Jacobian determinant]] of the mapping &lt;tt&gt;sphericalToCartesian&lt;/tt&gt;. This will tell us how the spherical space is pinched by the transformation at each point.

We must find the Jacobian matrix first. We will leave ''r'' in for the moment, as Mathematica will be crunching the numbers. The evaluated Jacobian matrix is shown below, but we will let Mathematica work it out from the beginning.

:&lt;math&gt;J_F(r,\phi,\theta) =\begin{bmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial x}{\partial r} &amp; \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \phi} &amp; \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} \\[3pt]
\dfrac{\partial y}{\partial r} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \phi} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \theta} \\[3pt]
\dfrac{\partial z}{\partial r} &amp; \dfrac{\partial z}{\partial \phi} &amp; \dfrac{\partial z}{\partial \theta} \\
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 
	\sin\phi \cos\theta &amp; r \cos\phi \cos\theta  &amp; -r \sin\phi \sin\theta \\
	\sin\phi \sin\theta &amp;  r \cos\phi \sin\theta &amp; r \sin\phi \cos\theta \\ 
	\cos\phi            &amp; -r \sin\phi            &amp;  0                    
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

We will construct this matrix very easily using the &lt;tt&gt;Outer[]&lt;/tt&gt; function, which takes every possible combinations of each element except the first, and gives them as arguments to the function in the first element. Again, we must not evaluate this yet, as if we do, Mathematica will take the inputs &lt;tt&gt;f_&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;x_&lt;/tt&gt; as &quot;atomic,&quot; meaning that they cannot be broken down and therefore are unsuitable for inputs to &lt;tt&gt;Outer[]&lt;/tt&gt;.

 jacMat[f_, x_] := Outer[D, f, x]

This statement will take a list of directions (i.e. ''r'', ''φ'', ''θ''), and a list of the same length of functions, which are the mappings taking these to the target space, in this case, Cartesian. This simple statement doesn't check that you have given it lists as inputs, and doesn't ensure they are same length. However, we know the lengths are right, so we won't bother with this.

We now define the list of directions. First, we must remove our previous definitions of &lt;tt&gt;phi&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;theta&lt;/tt&gt;, (and &lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt; for good measure) as at the moment, they will inject a single random number each into the above statement, rather than a symbolic quantity. We also define the list of functions, which can be obtained by giving our now-symbolic directions as arguments to &lt;tt&gt;sphericalToCartesian&lt;/tt&gt;.

 sphericalToCartesian[{r_, phi_, theta_}] := {r*Sin[phi]*Cos[theta],  r*Sin[phi]*Sin[theta], r*Cos[phi]};

&lt;pre&gt;

Remove[r, phi, theta]
dirs = {r, phi, theta}
map = sphericalToCartesian[{r, phi, theta}]
&lt;/pre&gt;

In order to find the Jacobian matrix and determinant, we now put:

&lt;pre&gt;
jacMat[map, dirs]
Simplify[Det[%]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The output is:

&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
{{Cos[theta] Sin[phi], -r Sin[phi] Sin[theta],  r Cos[phi] Cos[theta]}, 
 {Sin[phi] Sin[theta],  r Cos[theta] Sin[phi],  r Cos[phi] Sin[theta]}, 
 {Cos[phi],             0,                     -r Sin[phi]}}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;r^2 Sin[phi]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

We see that the Jacobian matrix is rearranged, but in Jacobians, it is exactly equivalent, as it just depends on the order of specification of the directions and functions. The Jacobian determinant is independent of the longitude, &lt;tt&gt;theta&lt;/tt&gt;, so our uniform distribution in spherical coordinates will be uniform in Cartesian space. However, &lt;tt&gt;phi&lt;/tt&gt; will not be, as as it changes, the Jacobian also changes. &lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt; also does this, but as we can just deal with a unit sphere, we can cut it out of the equation now.

There exists a method called the &quot;Inverse CDF Method&quot; which allows us to generate samples of a given probability density function from a set of uniformly distributed numbers between 0 and 1 (just like Mathematica's &lt;tt&gt;Random[]&lt;/tt&gt;).

To use this method, we must first find the CDF of the PDF given by the Jacobian determinant. We normalise (to give a total probability of 1) by dividing by the area under the curve. &lt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; is a dummy variable.
&lt;pre&gt;
area = Integrate[Sin[t], {t, 0, Pi}];(*Area under PDF*)
cdf[y_] = Integrate[Sin[t]/area, {t, 0, y}](*CDF*)
&lt;/pre&gt;

We now find the inverse of the CDF:

&lt;pre&gt;
Solve[x == cdf[y], y](*Get distribution transform*)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
{{y -&gt; -2 ArcSin[Sqrt[x]]}, {y -&gt; 2 ArcSin[Sqrt[x]]}}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

We take the positive solution, and we can now set our &lt;tt&gt;theta&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;phi&lt;/tt&gt; distributions:

&lt;pre&gt;
 theta := RandomReal[ {0, Pi} ]; (* Uniform on [0,Pi], longitude, only goes halfway round*)
 phi   := 2 ArcSin[Sqrt[Random[]]]; (* Colatitude, from pole to pole *)
&lt;/pre&gt;

We now plot the points exactly as before:
&lt;pre&gt;
dataPoints = Table[{phi, theta}, {6000}];
rectPlot = ListPlot[
  dataPoints,
  AxesLabel -&gt; {&quot;\[Phi]&quot;, &quot;\[Theta]&quot;},
  Ticks -&gt; {
    {0, Pi/4, Pi/2, 3 Pi/4, Pi},
    {0, Pi/4, Pi/2, 3 Pi/4, Pi}}
  ]
sphericalToCartesian[{phi_, theta_}] := 
  {Sin[phi]*Cos[theta], 
   Sin[phi]*Sin[theta], 
   Cos[phi]};

mappedPoints = sphericalToCartesian /@ dataPoints;
points = Graphics3D[Point /@ mappedPoints];
Show[points]
Show[points, ViewPoint -&gt; {0, 0, Infinity}]
Show[points, ViewPoint -&gt; {0, Infinity, 0}]
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 5.png|centre]]

We have reduced the distribution density around the poles.

|[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 7.png|centre|250px]]
|[[File:Uniform Spherical Distribution 8.png|centre|250px]]
|}

We have now made it so that the points are evenly distributed over the spherical area.

To differentiate the field of Communication into sub classes may include a split from [[Communication Theory]] of Telecommunications theory. Communications has excellent subclasses already (small group communication, face-to-face communication, rhetoric and others) but the predominance and pervasive reality of mass media suggests at least a new field of study. 

This book will build on the [[Communication Theory]] book already being worked on.  For this book, we will deal exclusively with mass media messages mediated through technological forms. This covers telegraph, telephone, radio, television and the networked computer. In this case the channel in the standard communication model (transmitter – channel – receiver) will always be technologically related.  

Like the Communication Theory book, this book approaches telecommunication theory from a biographical perspective, in an attempt to show theory development within a social context. Many of these theorists would not actually consider themselves &quot;telecommunication&quot; researchers. Like communications, the field of telecommunication study is remarkably inclusionary, and integrates theoretical perspectives originally developed in a range of other disciplines.


Sections to include:

* Reasons why telecommunications theory is needed
* Perspectives on Theory

==Theorists and Approaches to Telecommunications==
To gain a comprehensive view of telecommunications theory, each approach theory or model will need its own page covering major points of the theory, its origin, criticisms and current state.

Hi Typewriter,

It looks like you created several pages today (and yesterday) that should probably be collected under a single book (perhaps they were intended to be chapters of the [[Telecommunications Theory]] book?  If so, would you please move them?  Here's a short list, but there may be more.
* [[Diffusion and Gap Theories‎]]
* [[Flow - Presence - Transportation Theory‎]]
* [[Uses and Gratifications‎‎]]
* [[Agenda Setting Framing Priming‎‎]]
* [[3rd Person Effect‎]]
* [[Agenda Setting/Framing/Priming‎‎]]
* [[Media Dependency‎]]
* [[Accessibility Theory‎‎]]
* [[Constructions of Social Reality‎]]
* [[Cultivation‎]]
* [[Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing‎]]
* [[Modeling and Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication‎]]
* [[Hypodermic Needle Theory‎]]
* [[Telecommunications Research Methods]]

If you need any help, let me know. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:43, 7 April 2008 (UTC)

* Thanks for getting to that so quickly.  If you like, I can delete the old versions, and would be happy to do that for you.  Looks like an interesting book! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:59, 7 April 2008 (UTC)
**Just to confirm - it's OK for me to delete the 14 pages I listed above? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:31, 7 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

=== Statement ===
	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 		(+) 	Console 	
=== Syntax ===
TBALIAS oldName,NewName 
=== Description ===
&lt;p&gt;As the Mac OS matures, terse and economical toolbox names give way to more descriptive names. In C, this spells disaster because there is no way to stay in step except to go through all of your projects and change the name of the toolbox call to match Apple's latest syntax. FB offers a more elegant solution by providing an alias. A toolbox alias is a synonym that FB uses to translate all of your old syntax into the latest PPC toolbox names. This happens more often than you might imagine. Some common aliases are shown below: TBAlias InsertMenuItem , InsMenuItem
TBAlias DeleteMenuItem , DelMenuItem
TBAlias GetMenuHandle , GetMHandle
TBAlias CountMItems , CountMenuItems
TBAlias GetControlValue , GetCtlValue Without these TBALIAS statements, your existing code would break when it used a common toolbox like GETMHANDLE. With the alias in place, FB sees &quot;GETMHANDLE&quot; and automatically translates it to &quot;GETMENUHANDLE&quot;. The result is that your old code continues to work in a modernized environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= TEHANDLE =

=== Function ===
	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 			Console 	
=== Syntax ===
editFieldHandle&amp; = TEHANDLE(fieldID)
fieldInfo = TEHANDLE(-fieldID) 
=== Description ===
This function returns information about an edit field or picture field in the current output window. If you use the first syntax (passing a positive value to TEHANDLE), TEHANDLE returns a handle to the TextEdit record associated with the specified field. Although a valid handle will also be returned for picture fields, this is really more useful in the case of edit fields. The following table lists some of the more useful elements that can be found in the field's TextEdit record. The syntax shown in the table assumes that the value returned by TEHANDLE has been assigned to a long integer variable teH&amp;. IMAGE imgs/TEHANDLE_function02.gif (Note: for a description of other elements in the TextEdit record, see the &quot;TextEdit&quot; chapter in Inside Macintosh: Text.) If you use the second syntax (passing a negative value to TEHANDLE), TEHANDLE returns a value identifying the field's type, as follows: IMAGE imgs/TEHANDLE_function04.gif Example:
This function returns the next available ID number that is not currently being used by any picture field or edit field in the current window. LOCAL FN GetUnusedFieldID
   DIM id
   id = 0
   DO
INC(id)
   UNTIL TEHANDLE(-id) = 0
END FN = id Note:
You should generally not alter the contents of a TextEdit record directly. Use TextEdit Toolbox routines, or FB statements like EDIT FIELD, to alter the characteristics of the field. If you use TEHANDLE to get a TextEdit record handle, you should not dispose of the handle. The memory associated with the edit field is automatically disposed when you close the edit field (using EDIT FIELD CLOSE) or close its window (using WINDOW CLOSE).

:{{neutral}} I don't think that there is a stark demarcation between &quot;video games&quot; and games which are not videogames. In any strategy guide, there is really a continuum where we need to judge cultural significance to some degree, and we also need to judge the educational opportunities in the book. I think we all would agree that [[Chess]] is generally acceptable because of it's significance. [[Doom]], it was almost unanimous, did not belong here. What's really the difference between these two books about games? Just because a particular game is a board game and not a video game, does that mean that it doesnt have the cultural transience of a no-name videogame? Is Dungeons &amp; Dragons significant enough to warrant a strategy guide here, and, if we required, would that book be able to justify it's presence here on an educational books site? I think that in this case, yes, Dungeons &amp; Dragons is worthwhile to have here, but I don't say that because of some kind of blanket policy that board games are suitable book topics. However, my opinion on this matter is not strong enough to warrant a keep. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:11, 25 March 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
This small book aims to be a practical guide to essay writing. A generic approach to writing is introduced, enabling you to write in a clear and structured way, while at the same time allowing you to develop your own argument in a creative way. A good essay combines your own content with a clear structure.

I wrote this book because many mistakes in writing essays are unnecessarily repeated time and time again. These mistakes can easily be avoided, and will allow you to get the credit you deserve. Nothing in this document is rocket science, but most students enter university without having been taught how to write effectively. Merely by studying at a university, however, no-one will learn how to write good essays. By following just a few steps, most mediocre essays can be improved. I tried to include many examples taken from my own essays to make this guide a practical one.

A key idea that I wish to convey, is that it really matters ''why'' we write an essay. There is no universal approach to writing, and the reason of writing will be the best guide as to ''how'' to write. It’ll guide us to ''whom'' we write for, what level of details we include, what kind of language we choose, and so on.

==Audience==

The audience is for whom we write. In the situation of a university essay, the audience is often imaginary. That is not to say that your essay will not be read properly, but that the person for whom you write sometimes actually differs slightly from who is marking your essay.

Assuming your essay is being marked by a knowledgeable teaching assistant, why write at all? She might know everything you have to say, or even know it better; on the other hand, you might be writing an essay about an area your marker does not specialize in. Hard to tell? The solution is to pitch your essay towards a reasonably well educated person, but one who lacks the specific expertise. Imagine someone who has done an introductory course in your subject, for example.

By writing for an educated person, you no longer have to explain some of the fundamental aspects of your subject matter. However, it’ll still be necessary to explain some of the more specialized issues—maybe just to remind your reader. Practically speaking, pitching your essay this way means that a non-specialist will not be lost when reading your writing. It’s a useful skill to write difficult things in a relatively easy way. At the same time, if your essay is read by your really knowledgeable teaching assistant, she will immediately see that you have grasped the subject matter: that you know what you’re writing about.

Sometimes, the question you’re set will clearly say what kind of style and level of language is expected. A conventional essay is not the same as a report, nor the same as a press briefing, an entry in an encyclopaedia, or a memo. In each case, you’ll have to think about the particular needs: who is your (imaginary) reader, what will they know, what will they want to know?

==Preparation==

When chefs prepare a meal, they often put all the necessary ingredients on the table before starting (''mise en place''). This is a good way to make sure everything is ready. With essay writing the process is similar. We don’t jump in straight away and start writing, but instead spend a few moments thinking about what we want to achieve in our essay. What do we want to communicate? You may think of these considerations as a plan of attack.

What are the essential ingredients of an essay then? First of all, you should know what you’re going to write. Once you know that, you probably want to consider some examples to illustrate the argument. Illustrations have two functions: firstly, they show that what you write is relevant, and secondly they make your argument more approachable. Having worked out the content—what you’re going to include—you’ll also need to think a little bit about the structure: in what order you’re going to say it. The approach introduced in this book will help you with this task.

==What Goes In—What Stays Out?==

Planning an essay can be difficult. Sometimes there is just too much that you could write about; at other times there just does not seem to be enough. The following approach may help you to decide what you include in your essay, and equally important, what you don’t.

* Brainstorming: Write down the key concepts of the essay in the centre of a page, and link as many ideas that come to mind. If you’re unsure what the key concepts are, look out for terms you have come across a lot when reading. In many cases, you’re looking for arguments for and against a proposition, so take care to include both sides. If there is no argument against something, make a note of it. Don’t be shy to state what you think of the different points.

* More material: Once you’re reasonably happy with the ideas you have collected, you should go back to your course material. Sometimes the essay question will identify relevant material for you, but most of the time, it’s up to you and your notes. Obviously, if you need more material, this step is important to identify further points to include. It may not strike you as obvious, that you should never skip this extra step, even if you have collected tons of ideas in step one. Going back to your course material will not only ensure you have not missed something important, but also help you decide whether your points are balanced.

* Grouping: By now you should have a reasonably large collection of ideas linked to your key concepts, and it’s time to think about structure. Use coloured pens, numbers, letters of the alphabet, symbols—whatever works for you—and try to group similar ideas together. You might find points for and against a proposition, different theories, or the different components of the concept you’re examining.

* Selection: At this stage, you should be very selective. You might have tons of ideas that are linked to the question, but we are not normally interested in quantity. Go over the different points and ask yourself whether they are relevant to your answer. Does this particular point tell us anything new? Be rigorous, and kick out anything that will not help answering the question.

* Illustrations: Having decided what stays in, try to think of useful examples. An example is useful if it’s apparent how it links with your argument. If you need an extra paragraph just to establish the link, then you might not have picked the most suitable example. It’s often possible to use the same example for different points.

* Ordering: Now that you know what goes into your essay, think about the order. The way you grouped the ideas will determine much, and should you have time to spare, you even might want to consider alternative approaches: and then pick the best one. Realistically, we never have that much time, and you should focus on a coherent line of thought. Sometimes it’s reasonable to first look at the arguments for, then those against, and finally mitigate. At other times, it makes sense to look at what different theories say in turn, or work from one example to the other. What is important is that there is a clear line of thought, where one bit builds on the other. Make a note of this ordering, and you have just written most of your outline.

Why do we bother going through this procedure? It helps to work like chefs do: having all the necessary ingredients at hand before starting with the actual writing. Imagine a chef starting to bake a lemon tart, finding out half way though that he only has strawberries in the fridge. Surely he can cobble something together, maybe even produce very nice strawberry tartlets. This is no problem for our chef preparing a meal for the family at the weekend, but what about if he entered a competition for the best lemon tart in town?

I use a special essay organizer to make sure everything is in place before I start writing. You can use this template, or create your own. At the top I collect the course the essay is for. Normally I use the abbreviations the university uses, or make up my own where there are no such given abbreviations. I also record the number, such as 3 for the third essay in that particular course. The deadline comes in big letters at the top. The essay question is central, so I copy this onto my planner. To make sure that I have understood the question, I rephrase it. Ticking the format needed (essay, report) and word limit makes me aware of these. Similarly, I collect the process and content word separately, making sure that I really identified them. The relevant material is also collected. I usually use the name of the author, or simply ''chapter 3''. The key concepts and theories have their separate place at the centre. Sometimes your tutor or the written instructions will tell you that a particular skill is focused on: I make a note of these, too. Under ''Approach'' I take a note of some key points or illustrations that just have to go in. I also write down any hints or considerations regarding the structure.

In the bottom half of the organizer, I work these hints into a proper outline with an introduction, definitions, a main body (with sections), and a conclusion. I usually assign a certain number of words to each section, and write them down, too. There is also space for notes and references. At the very bottom I include what essay skills I want to pay particular attention to. If my tutor mentioned that I should use more examples, that’s what comes here. This way I make sure that I at least try to improve on the previous essay. See the section on [[Writing_Better_University_Essays/Using feedback|using feedback]].

Using some time to prepare your essay will make sure that you answer the question, and thus you maintain your chances of winning that competition for the best lemon tart in town… None of this work preparing the essay will be wasted. On the one hand you have made sure you have everything ready to write this essay: no more running out of ideas half way through. On the other hand, your marker will appreciate an essay which is both relevant and coherent.

==Getting Directions==

Before you can start writing, you have to make sure you understand the question. Some questions are difficult to understand, but usually there are lots of clues as to what is expected. Look out for content and process words. Content words tell you what you’re going to write about. Process words, on the other hand, tell you how to do it.

It’s a good idea to spend a few moments identifying the content and process words. You may want to underline them in different colours. Once you really know what your task is, you’re ready to go. There is a simple way to check yourself whether you have understood the question set: rephrase it. If you’re able to write down the question again, using your own words, then you can be sure you know what the question is about. Make sure, though, that you really use your own words, and not just reshuffle the different bits in the question.

For example, take the following question: “Distinguishing between conformity, deviance and crime aids our understanding of British society. Discuss.” First of all, you want to identify the process word, which tells you what kind of answer is required. In this case, the process word is ''discuss''. What are the content words? The question tells you to focus on ''British society''. This does not mean that you can’t bring in an example from the US, for instance, but that you should focus on Britain. Maybe the examples in your course were from the US, and the examiners are keen to see how you apply this to the British case? The question gives you further clues: ''conformity'', ''deviance'', and ''crime'' are the key concepts you should use in your answer. It’s these words that I would brainstorm before writing.

To make sure you have understood the question, try to rephrase it. Use your own words, and write it down. One way to rephrase the question is: “If you want to understand British society, it helps to distinguish between conformity, deviance, and crime.” In this case I have not bothered to rephrase the key concepts. This is OK, because I will need to define the key concepts anyway. In most cases, however, try not to use any of the words from the original.

Unfortunately, identifying the content and process words is not always a straightforward task. Sometimes you have to read a bit between the lines, identifying the implicit tasks. Every essay question has some implications that are not immediately apparent. Look out for assumptions, schools of thoughts, or particular theories. Often, essay questions include a statement to be discussed. Such statements in many cases make quite strong assumptions about the world, or follow a certain school of thought. Although these links are not physically written in the question, they too are content words. If you’re trying to get very good grades, it’s important that you identify such assumptions and work with them.

Here you find a list of [[Writing_Better_University_Essays/Process words|process words]].

Why should we bother with process and content words? You might consider this all a waste of time. Unfortunately, most essays that fail or get a poor grade are essays that don’t answer the question. Sometimes, the markers get essays that are brilliantly written, but they can’t give a good mark, because the question set is just not addressed. You’re not primarily assessed in your ability to write eloquently, or for showing off how much you have read or learnt this term: what you’re assessed on is how well you answer the question.

This book introduces a simple yet powerful approach that is flexible enough to allow creativity in what you write. Bearing in mind the reason why you write, following this simple approach your essays will come with the necessary structure and be focused on the question set. You still have to write it yourself though…

      <text xml:space="preserve">=The Structure=

There is a simple structure that you can follow for your essays. The details of this approach are discussed in detail in the subsequent sections. The key idea of this approach is writing in a structured manner, focusing on answering the question or problem presented by the assignment. Not only does this approach help you making sure your answer is relevant, but also will it guide your reader through your writing. There are specific parts to your essay that you should never leave out, such as an introduction and a conclusion. These and the remaining parts should be developed and based upon your answer to two primary questions: Who am I writing for, and what is my purpose? The answers to these two questions should determine what is included, what is important and what is unnecessary in your essay. Whilst the approach outlined here is very useful for general essays, bear in mind that at times your university work will take different forms. For example, if you must write a report or dictionary entry, these structures may need adapting. The key ideas presented here, however, can be applied to other forms of writing as well. 

First of all, you ''delimit''. By this I mean that in your introduction, you address the question and set the focus of the essay. You should not only state how you understand the question or problem, but also how you decide what ideas are not relevant. Next up, you’ll need to ''define'' key terms. The idea is the same as before: to demonstrate that you’re aware of different interpretations, but also making sure that your readers understand things in the same way.

The ''main part'' of your essay is where you do the actual writing. Here you follow the outline you devised during preparation, making sure that it all links to a coherent answer. Next, it’s important to ''discuss'' the implications of your answer. If you discuss strengths and weaknesses of an approach, this is where you want to evaluate them. Now you’re done, and you demonstrate this in your ''conclusion''. The conclusion demonstrates that you have actually delivered what you promised in the introduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Delimiting the Question=

First of all, it’s necessary to state to the reader how you understand the question. Not only raises this expectations, but also can you demonstrate that you’re focused. Furthermore, you’ll avoid that your reader will misunderstand you, or think that you have left out critical aspects. For example, if your question is about crime, you may want to delimit this to contemporary white-collar crime in Britain. Your reader will not be puzzled not to read about the dungeons in medieval France, since you stated that these will not be addressed here. By explicitly delimiting your answer, you also demonstrate that you’re aware of the greater picture, or the other possible interpretations. This bit should be as short as possible, but never leave it out.

In an exam situation, it’s very important to delimit your answers. Sometimes a particular question is, to a certain extent, tied to a particular module or even a single lecture. By delimiting your answer, you demonstrate that you’re aware of this link. In other cases questions are much more open. In these cases you also need to delimit your answer. The limits of your analysis are both in terms of content (the medieval dungeons in France) and theories (such as feminist perspectives on consumption). Delimiting works in two ways: saying what is in, and stating what is out.

You may imagine that the essay question is a brief for a job. You have landed the task described, but have not the time to do it yourself. As you are in charge, you decide on a contractor. Think about which contractor is best suited to fulfil the task. In the social sciences, the contractors often are theories or schools of thought. Once you decide who is best suited for the job, you should state so, and also include a brief justification. It’s not uncommon that you’ll want to hire out different parts of the job to different contractors.

For example, take the following question: “What kind of mechanisms can explain sudden changes in collective action?” As a typical essay question, it leaves lots of scope. Practically, we can never write everything we know about the topic. Just like we can’t try out all the contractors to build a house and decide later on which one was best, we need to make decisions here, too. We want to quash diversions before they develop, and signal to the reader that we know what we are writing about. Answering this question, I might want to focus on tipping models. However, I am aware that there are alternatives, and will state that these will not be ignored completely. By stating, for example, “this essay will focus on tipping models, but alternative approaches will also be outlined briefly,” I signal that I know that tipping models are not the only way to go.

==Guiding the Reader==

After delimiting the answer, we will need a short outline. On the one hand this gives the reader some sort of direction. This can be really useful, if we are not so successful at linking the different sections later on. The reader will already have an idea what comes up, and not get lost, even if a paragraph diverts a little bit. An essay with an outline will almost always come across as more coherent. On the other hand, the outline will make sure that you—the writer—know where you’re going. In other words, an essay with an outline will almost always ''be'' more coherent.

Such an outline can be understood as guiding the reader. It should be short, because it does not actually answer the question. It should, however, be long enough, to include all the main sections that will be included. Because the guide will be kept general, it acts as a guide to you as the writer, too, not as a straitjacket. The following is an example of such an outline:

: ''This report describes the experience of carrying out a survey in order to measure cultural capital. The actual questions used in the survey are discussed, as are the sampling process and the data collection method. This is followed by an examination of the scale building, with a focus on reliability and validity. At each step, the actual work done is critically examined with regards to how it could have been done better. A short discussion about whether anything was learned about cultural capital completes this report, but first the definition and conceptualization of cultural capital needs to be addressed.''

Such an outline gives an idea of what is going to be addressed in the answer, and also roughly in what order. The length of the guide will depend on the essay. A much shorter version is just as good in a different context:

:''This paper critically reviews an article by Katz-Gerro (2002) that examines this link. In order to do so, there is a focus on research design and the persuasiveness of the results, but other aspects such as the mechanisms included will not be ignored.''

There is a simple trick to make your outline a little bit more interesting: keep the first topic you’ll write about until the end of the outline. So in your outline, you state in order what you’ll do, only that the first topic is mentioned last. The longer example just above makes use of this trick. Use phrases like “firstly, however, it is necessary to”, or “but before these are discussed, it will be useful to consider first of all.” Not only does this raise expectations, but also does this give you a chance to demonstrate the relevance of the opening section after the introduction. This sense of direction is something your readers will appreciate.

==When to Write the Introduction==

There are different views on when it’s best to write the introduction. Many write it first, because they write the essay from beginning to end. This is not a good justification as such. It’s a good idea to write the introduction first, because the introduction will delimit the answer, and provide an outline. As such, by writing the introduction, you commit yourself to a plan. It also helps you to stay focused.

This view is countered by those who argue that you never really know where you end up when writing an essay. This is the case, because writing the essay itself is a process by which the outcome—or conclusion—is not always known. Even where you have an idea, where the essay will take you, you might not know the precise details. For these reasons, some write the introduction last: after completing the essays and writing the conclusion. The benefit is that the introduction is about the essay as it exists, not about the essay as it was initially intended. As a consequence, the introduction will never make false promises and be tightly focused.

Probably the best alternative is to combine the two, especially when using a word processor where you can change what you wrote. Start with writing the introduction. This will help you stay focused, and make sure you think about the structure and order of the answer before you start writing. This is a good way to make sure the answer is relevant. However, after completing the essay, you come back to the introduction, and modify it as necessary. Maybe the focus has changed; maybe there is now an extra section. Having a careful plan before writing will mean that such changes are often of minor nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Process Words=
On this page you find a list of process words that are often used. This list is in part based on Jordan (1999). The process words are given in alphabetical order. Probably the most common process words are: ''discuss'', ''describe'', ''explain'', ''compare'', ''evaluate'', and ''criticize''.

'''Account for''' asks for an explanation. Even thought it looks similar to give an account of, this process word is rather different. You should give a description with details. The description should clarify the concept, and don’t forget to give reasons.

'''Analyze''' calls for an outline of the components. Take the issue, and break it down (divide) into the parts that make up the issue. Your task is not only to describe the different parts of the issue, but also to show (examine) how they relate to each other.

'''Argue''' is about making a case. You’re often asked to argue for or against something. In order to make a good case, your answer will need to include convincing evidence. Your argument will be more convincing if it’s logically structured. Even though the question often asks for a one-sided case, don’t forget the arguments against: even if it’s to dismiss them. If you don’t agree with the proposition, this is fine: what counts is the case you present.

'''Assess''' asks you to make a judgement of the value or importance of something. Your answer should focus on both sides of the coin, weighing up the positive and negative aspects. It’s often necessary to spend much time on the areas that are disputed. In order to provide a credible answer, back up your answer with references and good examples. Even though you may have a good example from your own experience, it’s usually better to choose a more authoritative source.

'''Calculate''' asks you to estimate the extent of something. You should take great care to define the key dimensions and determine how they are measured. Weigh up different reasons carefully. In the social sciences, the estimate itself is often secondary to how you evaluate the key dimensions.

'''Characterize''' is mostly another word for describe. You’re looking for the key dimensions (characteristics) of a concept. Often it’s necessary to compare to other concepts to make clear the limit.

'''Classify''' is very similar to analyze. The key difference is possibly that this process word explicitly asks you to come up with some sort of classification: a way to divide. You probably want to spend a bit more time on the boundaries, on how the identified dimensions are different.

'''Comment''' is similar to the content words analyze and assess. It’s indeed often considered a combination of the two. Be careful not merely to summarize the issue, but include some form of evaluation. This process word asks you to explain the importance of something. Your ability to describe an issue is usually only appreciated in conjunction with a critical argument.

'''Compare''' always involves two or more issues. Focus on what characterizes the issues, and your answer will include both the similarities and differences. This content word often occurs in conjunction with contrast. Technically, compare is about similarities, but for a balanced answer you’ll need to include the differences, too. Your conclusion may include a statement of which of the issues or options discussed you consider preferable.

'''Consider''' asks you to think carefully about something. This process word is sometimes followed by an example or case study, but also a theoretical perspective. Take great care to include these aspects, because you’ll be (partly) marked on how well you apply whatever the question is to this particular example or theory.

'''Contrast''' is like a twin to compare. Two or more issues or options are involved, and your answer should focus on the differences. Technically, contrast does not ask you to include similarities, but a balanced answer will include these, too. Your conclusion may include a statement of which of the issues or options discussed you consider preferable.

'''Criticize''' asks for a careful judgement of a statement or point of view. You’re often asked to make statements about the value or truth of a statement. Make sure you point out faults. It’s important to state by which criteria of evaluation your answer is guided. Your illustrations should not be of general nature, but specific. If the illustrative examples are not general in nature, too, then say so. Your answer will judge the merit of the views included in the statement. Often you can—and should—link to underlying theories and approaches. These should be included in the evaluation, too. Your answer also needs to discuss the nature and quality of evidence you cited for and against the different views. Always back up your argument with evidence and reasoning.

'''Deduce''' asks you to reach a conclusion based on something. Make clear how you reach this conclusion.

'''Define''' may look innocent, but the devil is often in the detail. Similar to analyze, you’re after the components of an issue of concept. You don’t want just any definition, but one that discusses the different meanings of a concept, the different ways it can be interpreted. Often, you can link the answer to how different schools of thought use a term. In this case your task is to tease out the different understandings and state the different meanings. Your answer necessarily includes an appreciation of the different components, but you should also pay attention to the differences to other concepts: how is it distinct from something else. Precision is important in your answer, and your answer should always go beyond common-sense interpretations. Sometimes you’re asked to write for a specific audience, such as a student encyclopaedia, and you should bear this in mind.

'''Demonstrate''' asks you to show something as clearly as you can. You’ll need to use an example (illustration) to this extent. Make sure the illustration is relevant and state clearly how it is relevant.

'''Describe''' is one of the most straight-forward tasks. You’re asked to outline the main aspects of an issue or point of view. Say what something is like. Sometimes the order of events is important. Your answer should always include illustrative examples to bring the argument alive. The structure of the answer is important: don’t jump around, picking up bits and pieces on the way. Instead, plan a logical and coherent way in order to cover all the main aspects. This process word often occurs together with others, such as in describe and criticize.

'''Determine''' asks you to find out something, maybe to calculate or estimate something. You should always describe how you arrive at the answer, including an appreciation of how not to proceed. Be open about the shortcomings or potential dangers of your approach.

'''Differentiate between''' something and something else is a combination of describe and define. You’re asked to focus on the differences. Often it’ll be necessary to discuss the similarities, too.

'''Discuss.''' It’s very common to be given a quote or provocative statement, followed by just this word: discuss. Your answer should include an outline of the problems and then evaluate the different arguments or points of view. Weigh up the points for and against. It’s important to illustrate your argument, and refer to established work. Very often your own opinion is asked, usually in form of an evaluation of the different points of view. Look out for key debates that are involved. The statements that come with this process word are often deliberately provocative.

'''Distinguish between''' is just another process word for differentiate between.

'''Elaborate''' asks for a discussion in great detail. Always give reasons and include illustrations. Think carefully about which aspects of a theory or concept are worth exploring in great detail. In this sense, this question often asks you to—implicitly—determine the key components of something. Avoid repetitions of the same point.

'''Elucidate''' is very similar to explain. You’re asked to make clear something. This often involves a clear line of argument, and usually a number of illustrations to bring the argument alive.

'''Enumerate''' in principle asks you to put a number to something. In practice you’re normally asked to name and list different aspects, giving an explanation. You should always try to estimate the extent of something, having outlined how you reach this estimate.

'''Estimate''' is a close relative to calculate, but you’re also asked to judge and predict. State clearly how you reached your conclusion or estimate.

'''Evaluate''' is similar to discuss, but it asks you to focus more on the value or importance of a certain argument or point of view. You should weigh up the different aspects, illustrate the argument, and refer to established works. You’ll usually be able to make a statement of the worth of something. Also see the box on persuasiveness on page 22.

'''Examine''' is a process word that asks you to have a close look at something. Consider the different components and parts. Often you can examine an issue using different theoretical perspectives. Always make explicit which perspectives you use.

'''Explain''' asks you to focus on how things work. Rather than focusing on things as they are, this process word asks you to focus on how things got there. So you’ll always need to give reasons. The answer will include some describing and analyzing. It’s important to make explicit the workings and mechanisms.

'''Express''' is just another word to say describe.

'''To what extent''' is similar to assess or criticize. You’re asked to explore a statement or view. Look out for theoretical and practical limits to the statement, but also include evidence in favour. The typical conclusion highlights the limits of the proposition, but will neither be total acceptance nor total dismissal. Watch out for changes over time and across space: Is the proposition also applicable in other cultures? Was the proposition also applicable in the past?

'''Identify''' is a process word that allows you a great deal of liberty. You’re expected to choose the examples, features, or arguments for a proposition that you regard the most important ones. It’s usually a good idea to point out and list the features first. The choice of these key aspects, however, is often secondary to your answer. Instead, you should focus your attention to the criteria of evaluation: why a feature is central. You should defend and justify your choice of picks.

'''Illustrate''' is similar to explain, but the person writing the question appears to be very keen on illustrative examples. Make sure you have a relevant example, and include enough details to make clear the relevance. Sometimes, you may illustrate the argument with statistics. What is important is that the examples support the argument, and you therefore demonstrate how exactly the examples are relevant. Sometimes a question will ask you explicitly about a figure or diagram to explain or clarify. Take care to follow such instructions carefully. Where nothing is stated, assume that you should include concrete examples.

'''Indicate''' asks you to show and explain. Usually you’re expected to use a good illustration. Make sure you demonstrate how the example is relevant to the question.

'''Infer''' is a process word that asks you to conclude based on facts or a clear line of reasoning. It’s important that you state clearly how you reached the conclusion, not just what your conclusion is.

'''Interpret''' asks for a clarification and explanation. Rather than just describing, you should also give your judgement. An interpretation often highlights how an issue or point of view relates to others, or outlines the different meanings and interpretations there are to it. Usually you’re expected to give your own judgement as part of an evaluation of the different aspects.

'''Justify''' on the surface asks for a defence of a particular statement, theory, or point of view. You should cite evidence and give examples that support the case. However, for a balanced answer, it’ll be necessary to look at the arguments against. The justification thus is a form of evaluation. Your conclusion may be that the statement can’t be justified (in the light of certain evidence), or outline limits.

'''List''' probably looks as innocent as describe, and is in fact closely related. You’re asked to classify or catalogue something. Make sure you include how you decided to classify, what criteria you used to put the list in sequence. This process word may mean that you have to list the key components of a concept.

'''Mention''' asks you to describe something briefly. This process word usually is used together with others, but do make sure you don’t skip this part of the question.

'''Name''' is another word for identify.

'''Outline''' asks you to indicate what the main characteristics or features of a topic or point of view are. Sometimes you’ll need to indicate the key events in a sequence. It’s very important to follow a clear and logically coherent structure. Your answer may focus on how the different features relate to each other, rather than just describing them.

'''Prove''' is a rare process word in the social sciences. You should try to demonstrate that something is true and certain. On the one hand you should provide convincing examples and evidence that something is the case. On the other hand, you should also demonstrate that the opposite is not the case either. Your conclusion may well be that it’s impossible to prove something, but make sure your answer is relevant to the question, not just a philosophical treatment of whether we can prove things.

'''Quantify''' is another word for enumerate.

'''Relate''' is similar to giving an account of. You’re usually particularly asked to relate one thing to another, demonstrating how they link.

'''Review''' is very similar to assess. The key difference is that you’re asked to write about a topic or area rather than a specific case or statement. The answer will thus include a selection of everything about a topic. Usually it’s a bad idea trying to include all the different angles and all the different authors. Instead, you should try to organize your answer, such as into schools of thought, or key proponents. Leaving out less relevant contributions is often the key to a successful answer. Take care not merely to describe who said what, but also to assess the merit of their argument.

'''Show''' asks you to indicate something. Make sure you use appropriate evidence and examples to back up your claims. Make clear what something means.

'''Speculate''' is similar to prove, but different in that you’re not asked to come up with a definite answer. The very word used indicates that there will be many different explanations, and you’ll have to evaluate the different possibilities. You’re thus asked to form an opinion. Very often this process word is given where you don’t have complete knowledge of the circumstances. You should suggest the most likely case.

'''State''' asks you to express something carefully. Make sure you cover the different components and be clear. Often you’re asked to illustrate something, or demonstrate how two different things link.

'''Suggest''' is somewhat similar to speculate. You should mention the different possibilities, and choose the most likely one. Make sure you include in the essay the criteria how you evaluate the different possibilities: how you can say that one is the most likely possibility.

'''Summarize''' is about the identification of the key points and aspects of an issue or topic. Details can often be omitted, as can be illustrations. However, depending on the tasks, illustrations may be necessary: try to identify the key examples. This process word often occurs together with others, such as analyze. It’s often easier to first summarize and then move to the second task, but make sure the different parts of the answer link.

'''Trace''' asks you to provide a narrative that outlines the progress or sequence of an issue or certain events. Often, a chronological order is the easiest form of structure. Sometimes you’ll be asked to write from a particular point of view. Usually, however, you can include the different points of views. The same sequence of events may be interpreted or experienced in different ways by the different participants.

'''Verify''' asks you to make sure that something is the case. You’re looking for evidence and examples for and against the case. Evaluate the evidence and provide a judgment whether the statement is true or accurate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Defining Key Terms=

Having decided what to include in the answer, there is another way to make sure the answer is focused: telling the reader what we are talking about. By defining what the key terms mean, we do two things. Firstly, we show that we know what we are writing about. Secondly, we avoid misunderstandings by settling on a single understanding of the key terms. It might be that your marker understands power in a Marxist way, and you want to approach the essay from a feminist point of view. By providing a brief definition, there will be no misunderstanding. Your marker may not agree with you, but that is not necessary to get good grades. A definition makes sure you and your readers talk about the same things. For example, you can define fruit salad as consisting of bananas, pineapples, and yellow apples (ideally you would have a reason for this, too). Having done so, your reader will not object when you later state that fruit salad lacks the vital bits of red.

In order to define the key terms, you first have to bluntly state what they are. Always include the key words included in the question. These have been identified as central concepts for you, and by excluding them, you’ll be very likely answering a different question from the one set. There are often other key terms you want to include, and it’s usually worth spending some time thinking about which ones are the key concept. This is time worth spending, because you can later use the concepts without giving any further qualifications or comments. For this reason you should also define the terms carefully. Having defined power in a particular way, for example, every time you use the term in the essay, it only means what ''you'' want it to be.

Providing the definition of the key terms also works as a signal to your marker that you know what you’re talking about. By defining power in a certain way, you demonstrate that you’re aware of other interpretations. In fact, it’ll often not be necessary to state what the other interpretations are, unless the distinction is a key aspect of the argument. Very often, you’ll use the work of somebody else to help you define the key terms. Make sure that you put references accordingly.

The following three paragraphs define the concepts social disadvantage, social mobility, and siblings. The definitions are taken from a range of sources, and referenced accordingly. In the context of another essay, these definitions may be too long or too short.

:''Social disadvantage, to start with, refers to a range of difficulties a person can be exposed to. Social disadvantages include a lower expectancy in educational attainment, lower prospects at work, or lower status in society (McLanahan &amp; Sandefur, 1994). It has been demonstrated that social and economic disadvantages in society often come together, leading some sociologists talking about ''underclasses'' (Steinberg, 1999). Social disadvantage, however, does not necessarily have to be as extreme as that: it describes a relative difficulty in reaching a similar position in society than people not disadvantaged.

:''Such disadvantage in society has been shown to be transmitted from one generation to another. The term ''social mobility'' is often used to describe this phenomenon (Braham &amp; Sherratt, 2002). Intergenerational mobility describes the difference between a person’s location in society as compared to his or her parents (Goldson, 2004). If social disadvantage is sustained across generations, it is often argued that in one way or another the disadvantage has been passed on.''

:''Siblings, finally, in the context of this essay, refer to brothers and sisters of the same birth family. This means that siblings are biologically related, as well as living in the same family. For consistency reasons, often siblings are chosen that live in the same family with one other sibling only. This is thought to reduce influences of effects between siblings that are not the concern in the case here (Sandefur &amp; Wells, 1999).''

Depending on the length of your essay, you’ll have between 2 and maybe 5 key terms. Sometimes it takes a bit of time to think which terms are the central ones. Consider the following phrases as ways to define terms: ''X is understood as a process by which'', ''X regards Y as'', ''one view is that there is X so that Y'', or ''X is commonly considered as''.

==Sources for Definitions==

When writing your definition, there are a number of sources you can use to help you. Using a common-sense definition is hardly ever suitable. In many cases, a definition as found in a specialist dictionary will do. In other cases, you want something even more specialized, and consult your course material. Many introductory books define key terms, and then discuss them in more detail in the chapter. It’s important not just to simply copy a definition, but choose what is suitable for your needs. Bear in mind that every text, even a specialized dictionary, was written with a specific purpose in mind. What you need for your essay is likely to be a bit different.

Google and other internet search engines may be an easy way, but they are usually not suitable. Apart from the fact that your source may not be reliable, you’re likely to end up with a definition that is either too generic, or from a different area. A definition of power from a physics text may not be what we want in our discipline.

It’s often worth spending some time on the key terms. This is the case, because the way you set out this section will direct the remainder of the essay a great deal. Choosing a certain way to interpret a concept rather than another may be just as important as focusing on certain issues and not others in the main part of the essay. Despite its importance, the section providing the definitions should not be too long: focus on the concepts that are really central. These are usually the concepts that are recurring throughout the essay.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Main Part=

This part constitutes the main part of your essay. Try to use about 60% of your words for this part. You can understand it as ''delivering'' what you have promised in the introduction. This part of the essay is often referred to as the main body, or the argument. It’s the part of the essay, where you develop the answer. Whilst doing so, it’s important to be aware of the question at all time. This is the only way to keep to the topic set.

Ideally, every paragraph is geared towards answering the question. It does not suffice, if you are aware of how a particular paragraph is focused on your task: you need to show the relevance to your reader. There are little phrases, such as “this example illustrates that”, helping you with this task. Consider the following example: “The resistance in Harlem insisting to keep an open market in 125th street helped to point out that there are people with different needs in the city (Zukin, 1995).” After outlining resistance in Harlem, these few sentences make it plain what the example showed us: that different people in cities have different needs.

Writing an essay can take a considerable time, but it’s important that you keep to your original plan as much as you can. Of course, new ideas will come up as you write. In this case, you should jot them down, so as not to lose them. Next, think about it: How will this help me answering the question? Is this relevant to the essay? Do I not have another example of this already? What you do is to make sure that what goes into the essay has one purpose only: answering the question. Sometimes it’s difficult to resist the temptation, but don’t explore thoughts by the way. This should not discourage you from having original ideas, or even exploring them, but it should encourage you to use your essay for one purpose only.

Keeping to the plan means keeping to the structure. This is important, because you can lose your reader by jumping around from one topic to the other, even if all you say as such is relevant and useful. By having a clear structure, and keeping to it, your reader will always know where the journey goes next. This makes your essay a pleasant read.

When writing the main part of the essay, it’s important to keep the argument and illustrations in balance. Too few examples make the essay dry and difficult. Too many, on the other hand, make the argument disappear. The trick is to include illustrations to bring the text alive, but link them tightly with the argument. Rather than stating that “this is an example of white-collar crime,” you may say “tax avoidance is a good example of white-collar crime, because…” By so doing, you demonstrate the importance of the example, you highlight how and why it is important, and most importantly, maybe, you avoid that the examples take over. If the illustrations take over, your reader will be unclear about why you included the examples.

==Sections==
Sections are an important tool to structure the answer of an essay. The longer the answer, the more important sections probably are. Some courses and tutors may ask you to include subheadings (as used in this book); some institutions even have explicit recommendations on their use. Subheadings can be a good way to structure an answer into sections. However, the lack of subheadings—or the fact that your tutor discourages you from using them—is no excuse for not having sections.

Sections group paragraphs that elaborate a similar point. Often, within a section, you’ll have a number of paragraphs discussing the same issue from a number of different perspectives. A section can be treated, in some ways, as if it was a mini essay in itself. This is the case, because in each section, a particular point is explored. For example, there might be a section on the arguments for abortion, and then a section on the arguments against.

What is important when writing a section, is that both you and the reader are aware of the purpose of the section. It’s tiring and frustrating for your reader to read half a page before knowing what you’re writing about, or more often why you’re writing this here. For these reasons it’s important to link the sections into a coherent one. By linking the sections, and linking the paragraphs within each section, your essay will be more focused on answering the question.

For example, after a paragraph outlining problems of studying and measuring the transmission of social disadvantage, in one of my essays I discussed how sibling data may be the solution. I opened the paragraph as follows: “The use of sibling data promises a cure to at least some of the problems outlined above.” In one sentence, the new topic (sibling data) is introduced, but it is also indicated why this may be important (because these data help tackling the problems already outlined). The reader should not be puzzled as to what the link is between problems of measuring the transmission of social disadvantage on the one hand, and sibling data on the other.

Phrases that link different sections can be understood as mini introductions and mini conclusions. Particularly when a section is long, or where the link to the next section is not immediately apparent, it might be useful to write one or two sentences to summarize the section. This will indicate to the reader how far we have come in developing the argument, but also remind him or her, why we have bothered to write a section in the first place.

Just like sections are structured into paragraphs, each paragraph should have some internal logic. You can usually use the first sentence of a paragraph to introduce what the paragraph is about. This is particularly useful at the beginning of a new section. Consider these phrases as bridges. For example, in one of my essays, I opened a paragraph with “It will now be necessary to consider the argument that local cultures are dominated by transnational corporations.” My readers will immediately know what the paragraph is about.

Ideally, every single sentence is geared towards answering the question. Practically, this is hard to achieve, given the lack of infinite time resources available to most of us. However, by your trying to link similar paragraphs into sections, and by linking sections into a wider argument, every essay will benefit. The result is an essay that is easier and more pleasant to read.

Each paragraph, and definitely each section, should be geared towards the essay question you’re answering. It’s therefore a good idea to evaluate each section in terms of how far this helped to answer the essay question. You do a number of things with this: demonstrate that you’re still on track; you’re working towards a conclusion; you demonstrate the relevance of what you wrote in the section. If you can’t state how a particular paragraph or section is relevant towards your answer, then probably it is not.

==Structuring the Main Part==
There are different ways to structure the main part of the essay. One key difference is between essays structured along the lines of analytic dimensions, and those structured along the lines of argumentative dimensions. For example, the analytic dimensions of an essay on globalization may be ''economic aspects'', ''cultural aspects'', or ''political aspects''. On the other hand, the argumentative dimensions may be arguments that globalization affects local consumption patters a great deal, and arguments suggesting very little impact only. The analytic approach would examine the different views in terms of economic aspects first, before moving on to cultural aspects. The argumentative approach would first explore the views in favour of strong impacts in all the different dimensions: economic, cultural, political, and then move on to do the same for arguments against.

There is no fast rule which of these approaches is better. In fact, both approaches can be very successful. You should consider the extent to which your structure helps you avoid saying the same thing twice. Whatever approach you choose, a clear indication in the introduction as to how you approach the essay will make sure your reader knows where you’re going.

==Dealing with Repetition==

An essay where the same word or sentence structure is repeated time and time again is often boring. Many writers consider repetitions bad writing. There are a few things you can do to avoid repetition. Where you should be careful, however, is the use of specialist terms. For the reasons outlined in the section on defining terms, you should never substitute a specific term with a more generic one. If you talk about power, then say so, even if this means using the same word over and over again. By no means use a thesaurus and pick a random suggestion offered there. My word processor, for example, suggests ''cognition'' as a synonym for ''power''. This may be the case in some contexts, but as a key term, this is hardly ever the case.

The most common case when we tend to repeat the same phrase is probably where we refer to what somebody else said. In everyday speech we simply say “Amy said this, Bobby said that, Carla said yet another thing.” In the more formal style required in essay writing, this is commonly written in the following way: “Adams (2006) states that…, Bird (1999) suggests that.”

In order to make your essay less repetitive, consider the following options in addition to the common states and suggests. Always use your own judgement, when a phrase feels overused. By suggesting that repetition may leave a less than ideal impression, it’s not argued that this is an area of essay writing worth spending hours on. It’s much better being repetitive, but being precise and making a good argument.

* Crouch (1977) argues that …
* Daniels (2004) sees the problem as resulting from …
* Elton (1848) identifies the problem as consisting of …
* Ferro (1997) is of the opinion that …
* Gallagher (2003) defends the view that …
* Hall (1998) notes that the problem originates from …
* Inglehart (2000) considers that …
* Jackson (1984) views the issue as caused by …
* Kanter (1970) maintains that …
* Lewis (2002) concurs with Mann (2000) that …
* Nixon (1955) supports the view that …
* Orwell (1999) holds the view that …
* Perry (2005) agrees that …
* Quart (2001) denies that …

These alternative ways to put the ever same idea may be particularly useful when reviewing what different authors had to say on an issue—the parts of the essay where you simply restate what has been said before. Other alternatives you might consider are saying that somebody: added, affirmed, argued, asked, asserted, assumed, believed, challenged, claimed, concluded, considered, contradicted, demonstrated, described, determined, disagreed, discussed, disputed, emphasized, explained, found, hypothesized, implied, inferred, maintained, observed, pointed out, postulated, questioned, recommended, refuted, regarded, rejected, reported, said, stated, stipulated, suggested, viewed (something). This list should illustrate that there need be no conflict between variation in writing and writing clearly. If in doubt, however, you should always prioritize clarity.

==Academic Style==

When writing for academic purposes, there are a number of conventions that you should follow. A key difference to most other forms of writing is that we give references to the sources of our argument. Ambiguity is something most academics dislike, and you’re more credible, too, if you avoid it. Academic writing tends to be rather formal, and many will advise you to avoid writing in the first person (that is, not write using I). This makes academic writing both formal and impersonal.

The reason why the first person should be avoided, is that in scientific writing one’s opinions, feelings and views are not regarded as important. Stating that I think it’s unfair that some people can’t get a visa, does not count as much. However, urging you not to use I in essays can fail in two ways. Firstly, you could still write about your own feelings and opinions using different phrases, and secondly, not all uses of the first person are bad. It’s a good idea to stay clear of phrases such as “I think,” or “in my opinion,” unless you’re evaluating a claim. However, there is no apparent reason for not saying “I will first define the key terms.” Using the first person in this way will make a text more approachable. Moreover, using phrases starting with I, you avoid using the passive voice which many find more difficult to read.

Having said this, some markers still consider it preferable not to use the first person. Should your tutor or marker be one of them, you may want to play it safe. Don’t use we when you mean ''I''. If you are the sole author, the use of a plural is technically not correct. However, even a tutor who hates such phrases will not mark you down: It’s the argument and general structure of your essay that count for much more.

One area where there is no room for argument is the use of colloquialisms, slang, or street language. Academic writing is formal writing, and you might be penalized for using the wrong register. A little bit of informality here or there will not normally matter much. Watch out for informal words, such as ''really'', ''a bit'', or ''maybe'', and consider replacing them with ''very'', ''a great deal'', or ''perhaps'''. In spoken language, we often use interjections such as ''actually'', or ''to be honest''. These, too, don’t belong into an academic essay.

Consider the following example: “To be honest, I don’t think much of this theory” is something we might say to a colleague of ours. When writing an essay, you could put this as: “It is clear from the evidence presented in this essay that the applications of this theory are limited.” The following list further illustrates what is meant by formal and informal English. The formal words are included in brackets in each case: Ask for (request), carry out (conduct), chance (opportunity), find out (discover), get better (improve), get worse (deteriorate), guess (estimate), look into (investigate), OK (satisfactory), tell (inform), worried (concerned).

Euphemisms, such as ''passed away'' for ''die'', are another aspect of language you should not use in your essays: if you write about and mean ''die'', then say so. Clarity and accuracy are paramount. For these reasons academic writing can be rather tentative and cautious. This is the case because we are not after grabbing headlines, but we write accurately what we know. If our data suggest that X ''possibly leads to'' Y, we say just that. In this case we should never say that X ''leads to'' Y. In academia we are often unsure what really goes on, and we should be upfront about this.

Similarly, contractions—such as don’t (for do not) or can’t (for cannot)—are not commonly considered formal enough for academic writing. Some of your readers will consider this convention ridiculous; others take it as a sign that you have not understood you should write in a scholarly fashion. To play it safe, use the full forms at any time. This particular academic convention seems to ease more and more.

Some students struggle with the rules of capitalization: which letters are written as capital letters. The easiest one is that every sentence starts with a capital letter. Names and titles (called proper nouns) are also written with capital letters, unless there is a specific reason not to. So, we write the name of ''Mark Granovetter'' with capital letters, but the special case of the ''iPod'' is written with a small one. Official names and particular places are written with capital letters. It’s thus the ''Department of Health'', and ''Oxford University''. However, when we write about general places, we don’t use capital letters. We study at university in general. Official titles are often capitalized, such as ''Value Added Tax''. Furthermore, many abbreviations come with capital letters. It’s an ''MBA'' your friend may be studying for. The days of the week are capitalized, such as in ''Monday'' and ''Wednesday'', as are the names of the months. The names of countries, nationalities, languages, and people from places are written with capital letters: the ''Swiss'' live in ''Switzerland'', and ''Norway'' is a country. Apart from this, about every other word is written with small letters.

===Weasel Terms===

Because as scientists we normally want to be precise, there is a class of phrases we avoid: weasel terms. Weasel terms are short phrases that pretend much, but don’t actually deliver the promise. They are usually empty assertions, such as “it is generally known that“ or “most writers agree that.”

This box contains a list of weasel terms. In an essay, you should never use these phrases without a reference to substantiate what is said. 

* allegedly
* arguably
* as opposed to most
* considered by many
* contrary to many
* critics say that
* experts say that
* it could be argued that
* it has been noticed
* it has been said
* it has been stated
* it has been suggested
* it is generally claimed
* it is widely believed that
* mainstream scholars say that
* mainstream scientists say that
* many people say
* many scientists argue that
* research has shown
* researchers argue that
* serious scholars say that
* social science says
* sociologists believe that
* some argue
* some feel that
* some historians argue
* the scientific community
* this is widely considered to be
* this is widely regarded as
* widely considered as

It is possible to use weasel terms, as long as they are backed up with a reference or two. So, saying that something is “widely considered the foremost example of” something is possible, if you either provide a reference to someone who demonstrates this, or provide a group of references to back up your claim. However, in most cases we want to be more precise. Rather than saying that “many social scientists argue that class is important”—which is probably true—and giving a couple of references to back this up, it’s better to put it as follows: “Goldthorpe (2000) argues that class remains important.” Or maybe we have access to a statistic we can cite, that X% of social scientists seem to consider class important. In either case, the solution is more precise and thus more satisfactory.

The use of references is an academic convention, and you must follow this, even though it might be a tiresome exercise. Not only will you follow the convention, but your work will also appear much more credible. You can find more on the [[Writing_Better_University_Essays/Referencing|use of references]] in a separate section.

Footnotes are often associated with academic writing. Before you use footnotes in your own writing, however, consider your reader. Footnotes interrupt the flow of reading: you force your audience to stop for a while, moving down to the bottom of the page, before they can read on. From the reader’s point of view you should avoid footnotes if you can. The only general exception is if you use footnotes for referencing. Don’t use endnotes (footnotes at the end of the text), unless they are used exclusively for referencing. Asking your reader to flick forth and back through your essay is even more of an interruption. Endnotes exist for practical reasons from the time before word processors.

Footnotes are used to explain obscure words, or when you want to add some special information. In the case of obscure words, if it’s a key term, define it in the main text. There are cases, where you’ll want to use an obscure word, but it is not central to the argument. Consider the following example: “The Deputy must, with every word he speaks in the Diet&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, […] anticipate himself under the scrutiny of his constituents” (Rousseau, 1762, cited in Putterman, 2003, p.465). Here I talk about the name of an assembly. The word is probably obscure to most readers, but not central to my argument: I write about parliaments in general, not the ''Diet'' in particular. Adding this footnote will help the readers to understand the quote. In terms of special information, if you make an important point, then make in the main text. If it’s an unimportant remark, then very often you don’t want to make it at all. The guiding principle is whether the note is relevant to your answer.

Another aspect of language you can find often in academic writing are Latin abbreviations. Never use these unless you’re sure what they mean. Normally, you should not use abbreviations in the main text. Instead, use plain English. Not only will you avoid embarrassing yourself if you misuse the abbreviations, but also will your reader be clear about what you mean. It’s much clearer to write for example, rather than mistakenly putting i.e. instead of e.g. (a common mistake). Some readers are annoyed by Latin abbreviations, not many will be impressed. Others will simply struggle to understand without a look in the dictionary. The same is true for a number of English abbreviations.

Another area of academic writing where there are many bad examples out there is the use of jargon and specialist terms. Whilst we aim for clarity and accuracy, jargon is never justified where it does not help these purposes. Specialist terms can be very useful to summarize complex issues into a few letters. Nonetheless, all technical terms need to be defined in simpler language somewhere in your essay. Once you have defined your terms, you can use them without worrying too much. This is where the ''define'' section comes in. Bear in mind what your audience is likely to know.

Other aspects of writing that may make your essay easier to read, and thus more approachable are: the use of shorter words where possible, cutting out words where they are redundant, using the active voice (''I do'', ''she says'', rather than ''it is understood'', ''it is achieved''), and using English words where they are not different from the Latin or Greek ones. We want to write as clearly as we can, because when the writing is not clear, very often this is an indication that the argument is not very clear, either.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Discussion=
After presenting the main argument, it’s usually necessary to discuss what this all means. The argument of the essay may have implications on policy, implications on the use of certain theories, or implications on how we (should) understand the world. Not always are these implications novel or big. Nevertheless, you should always discuss the implications of what you have just said. If you don’t do so, you risk leaving your reader with the feeling of ''so what''?

Obviously, this is something we want to avoid. The discussion of what it all means can often be incorporated inside the main section of the essay. This is often a good idea, too, because the repetition of the same points can be avoided. However, even where the implications of the argument are discussed as part of the main argument, it’s a good idea to use at least one paragraph to make explicit that you have invested time into this section.

Rather than summarizing the argument, this section is here to draw the different sections together. Depending on the essay question, the discussion can be rather large (such as in an ''evaluate'' question), or very short (for example if you’re asked to ''describe'' something).

==Evaluating Persuasiveness==
A number of essay questions directly or indirectly ask you to evaluate the persuasiveness of an argument or theory. There are a number of points you can look out for when making such an evaluation: coherence, empirical adequacy, and comprehensiveness.

A good approach is to think about the coherence of the argument, the empirical adequacy, and the comprehensiveness. By ''coherence'' I refer to the reasoning and the argument. Does it make sense? Is the argument elaborate enough? Are there gaps in the line of reasoning? Is the argument clear? Does one point follow the other? Is it a logical argument?

''Empirical adequacy'' is about the extent to which there is support for the argument. Does the evidence support the argument? Does A always lead to B? Are there alternative explanations?

''Comprehensiveness'', finally, is about the limits of the argument. Is it true in other places? Was it true in the past? Will it be the same in the future? Do other cultures do things the same way? Is the argument explicit about its limits? Does the argument attempt to cover everything (universal)?

Thinking about these three aspects alone will help evaluate arguments and claims. You’ll find that sometimes the answers to the questions here are difficult to answer. Sometimes, the answers lie in the assumptions, or in what is not said.

Where you’re asked to evaluate the usefulness of ''models'' or ''terms'', consider the following criteria. You should not just state that X is being used, but always try to establish criteria for the usefulness of the model.

For definitions, look out how clearly something can be defined. Can we recognize an X if we see one? Are all X the same? Is X a neutral term? Is X value-laden? Does the definition of X depend on something else? Is X the same in every context? How can X be measured?

You may also want to consider the analytic dimensions of concepts. Is X as a concept more useful than Y? Does X contradict Y? Is X complimentary to Y? In which cases is using X rather than Y more useful? What does X capture better than other terms? What does X capture that other terms don’t? But also, what does X ''not'' capture?

There is often also a normative dimension to terms (what should be). A full evaluation will include such normative aspects, too. What does X suggest about policies? Given X, how should society be organized? How should the world be seen?

      <comment>/* When to Write the Conclusion */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Conclusion=

Having written the essay, you state that you have done so. This section is often separated visually, or singled out with a subheading such as ''conclusion'' or ''concluding remarks''. What this section does, is summarizing what you have done, and providing a conclusion to the argument. Never should you bring in new material—be it examples or arguments—at this stage.

In fact, your aim is to make the conclusion as short as you can. If there is much to discuss, if there are many loose ends, you should use the previous section (''discussion'') to do so. In a similar way as the introduction includes an outline, the conclusion recaps the argument. What you do is to revisit the highlights of the argument. Just like the discussion leads to a conclusion, your final section will close with a concluding remark.

The following is an example of a concluding paragraph. Depending on the length of your essay, it might be reasonable to have a longer conclusion, but try to keep it as short as you can.

:''This paper has critically looked at an article by Katz-Gerro on cultural consumption (2002). The article was outlined, and particular attention was given to the research design, data analysis, and the persuasiveness of the argument. It was found that the article provides a coherent and plausible argument, but one which is marred by issues around the comparability of the data used, as well as the omission of some compelling alternative explanatory variables, such as status. Because of these weak points, the findings of the article may not be as generalizable as the author presents them. The article uses a good approach, but the study could have been executed in a more rigorous way, a point that would have improved the power of the argument.''

This example illustrates the two functions: summarizing, and concluding. The first bit reminds the reader how we got where we are. Then the key points of the argument are briefly revisited. Finally, the paragraph and the essay are brought to a conclusion. Nothing new is added, and no time and space is wasted reiterating what was said before. Obviously, without a substantial section discussing the different strengths and weaknesses of the article, as well as the significance of those, the conclusion could never be so short.

Writing a long conclusion means that—for the last time—you run the risk of losing your reader. Reading the same thing again, albeit put in different words, is not usually very interesting to read. By keeping the discussion separate, the final paragraph can be short and to the point.

It’s important to note that you can take sides in an essay, and indeed you should. It’s unlikely that you’ll ever conclude that something is utterly useless or the golden bullet for that, but if your argument suggests that the statement you were given, for example, does not hold, then do say so. A good idea to conclude an essay is by referring back to the original question. This can be done in a subtle way, but often there is nothing lost from doing it head on. By so doing, you demonstrate that even after all the work, you’re still focused.

==When to Write the Conclusion==

Just as there is disagreement on when it is best to write the introduction, there is no clear consensus when to write the conclusion. On the one hand, you can write it at the end, after you know where the essay leads. On the other hand, you can write it first, and thus commit yourself to the conclusion. The idea is to force yourself to stay focused.

Unfortunately, writing the conclusion first is no guarantee of staying focused. Although I would recommend writing the conclusion last, because that's one way to get the greatest effect possible (and for that, you need to know exactly how your argument went), it’s not unreasonable to write the conclusion first. In this case, do so as an incentive to stay focused, but be prepared to modify the conclusion after you have finished.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Young.gif|right]]
You should be familiar with the idea that, when light passes through a slit, it is diffracted (caused to spread out in arcs from the slit). The amount of diffraction increases the closer the slit width is to the wavelength of the light. Consider the animation on the right. Light from a light source is caused to pass through two slits. It is diffracted at both these slits, and so it spreads out in two sets of arcs.

Now, apply superposition of waves to this situation. At certain points, the peaks (or troughs) of the waves will coincide, creating constructive interference. If this occurs on a screen, then a bright 'fringe' will be visible. On the other hand, if destructive interference occurs (a peak coincides with a trough), then no light will be visible at that point on the screen.

==Calculating the angles at which fringes occur==

If we wish to calculate the position of a bright fringe, we know that, at this point, the waves must be in phase. Alternatively, at a dark fringe, the waves must be in antiphase. If we let the wavelength equal λ, the angle of the beams from the normal equal θ, and the distance between the slits equal d, we can form two triangles, one for bright fringes, and another for dark fringes (the crosses labelled 1 and 2 are the slits):

[[Image:Youngs_slits.png]]

The length of the side labelled λ is known as the path difference. For bright fringes, from the geometry above, we know that:

&lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \frac{\lambda}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = d \sin{\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

However, bright fringes do not only occur when the side labelled λ is equal to 1 wavelength: it can equal multiple wavelengths, so long as it is a whole wavelength. Therefore

&lt;math&gt;n\lambda = d \sin{\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where n is any integer.

Now consider the right-hand triangle, which applies to dark fringes. We know that, in this case:

&lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \frac{0.5\lambda}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;0.5\lambda = d \sin{\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

We can generalise this, too, for any dark fringe. However, if 0.5λ is multiplied by an even integer, then we will get a whole wavelength, which would result in a bright, not a dark, fringe. So, n must be an odd integer in the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;0.5n\lambda = d \sin{\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;n\lambda = 2d \sin{\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Calculating the distances angles correspond to on the screen==

At this point, we have to engage in some slightly dodgy maths. In the following diagram, p is path difference, L is the distance from the slits to the screen and x is the perpendicular distance from a fringe to the normal:

[[Image:Youngs_slits_effect.png]]

Here, it is necessary to approximate the distance from the slits to the fringe as the perpendicular distance from the slits to the screen. This is acceptable, provided that θ is small, which it will be, since bright fringes get dimmer as they get further away from the point on the screen opposite the slits. Hence:

&lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \frac{x}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

If we substitute this into the equation for the path difference p:

&lt;math&gt;p = d \sin{\theta} = \frac{dx}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

So, at bright fringes:

&lt;math&gt;n\lambda = \frac{dx}{L}&lt;/math&gt;, where n is an integer.

And at dark fringes:

&lt;math&gt;n\lambda = \frac{2dx}{L}&lt;/math&gt;, where n is an odd integer.

==Diffraction Grating==

A diffraction grating consists of a lot of slits with equal values of d. As with 2 slits, when &lt;math&gt;n\lambda = d \sin{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, peaks or troughs from all the slits coincide and you get a bright fringe. Things get a bit more complicated, as all the slits have different positions at which they add up, but you only need to know that diffraction gratings form light and dark fringes, and that the equations are the same as for 2 slits for these fringes.

==Questions==

1. A 2-slit experiment is set up in which the slits are 0.03 m apart. A bright fringe is observed at an angle 10° from the normal. What sort of electromagnetic radiation was being used?

2. Light, with a wavelength of 500 nm, is shone through 2 slits, which are 0.05 m apart. What are the angles to the normal of the first three dark fringes?

3. Some X-rays, with wavelength 1 nm, are shone through a diffraction grating in which the slits are 50 μm apart. A screen is placed 1.5m from the grating. How far are the first three light fringes from the point at which the normal intercepts the screen?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Referencing=

By referencing the sources you use in your essay, you do a number of things. First of all, you comply with an academic convention. Secondly, you make your essay look more professional. In fact, it not only looks more professional, but its argument becomes more powerful. Thirdly, you allow others to check your sources. This is often only a hypothetical issue, but a look through the list of your references will allow others to judge your argument quickly. Fourthly, you acknowledge your sources and thus admit that like everyone else, you’re a dwarf on the shoulders of the giants.

The essential bits of referencing require you to provide enough information to others so that they can identify the source. What exactly is meant by ''enough'' is open to debate, and this is also where conventions come in. Essential is that you do provide references. Ideally, you would do so properly. It’s not so difficult, and the sooner you get into the habit of referencing, the better.

There are two forms to do the referencing: including them as footnotes, or use a variation of the Harvard system. Your institution may have a preference, or even a house style. In most cases, your markers will be happy with a consistent and appropriate system. The Harvard system is also known as author/date, and will be described here in more detail.

==Inside the Text==

Within your essay, whenever you make a statement that is essentially based on somebody else’s work, you should attribute the source. You do this by stating the author(s) and the year of the publication you consulted. Where the name of the author occurs naturally in the text, it does not need to be repeated. The references are usually included at the end of a sentence, or where inappropriate in a place where the text flow is not interrupted too much, such as in front of a comma. This may be necessary, for example, if only the first half of your sentence is based on someone else’s work.

:''Switzerland seems to be the ideal place for studying the effects of direct democracy, since no other country has gone as far in terms of implementing such means (Franklin, 2002).''

The name of the author is included in brackets, together with the year of publication. Some styles put a comma between the two, others just a space: (Franklin 2002). Where there are two authors, both names are included: (McLanahan &amp; Sandefur, 1994). Some styles prefer the word ''and'', others prefer the ampersand (&amp; symbol). Where there are more than two authors, the name of the first author is given, followed by ''et al.'' (which literally means ''and others''): (Almeder ''et al.'', 2001). Some styles put ''et al.'' into italics, others don’t.

If you have two or more references for the same argument, you should separate the references with a semicolon (; symbol): (McLanahan &amp; Sandefur, 1994; Steinberg, 1999). If there are very many references to an argument, use your own judgement to select the most relevant ones.

What should you reference? Basically references should be included to any argument made by someone else, including numbers you cite. However, statements of general nature need not be attributed to anyone. A statement that the sky is blue alone does not require a reference. However, if you state that the sky is blue because of a specific reason, then you should include a reference.
If you use the exact words of an author (quotation), you’ll need to give the number of the page where you copy from. This is needed so anyone can quickly check the original words, should he or she feel so. See the separate section on quotes.

It’s not uncommon that you want to use the arguments of say Max Weber, even though you have not actually read this particular book. Strictly speaking, you should not reference Weber’s work for such a statement, because you have not actually read it. Can you really be sure this is what Weber said or meant? The technically correct trick is to add ''cited in'' after the reference: (Weber, 1918, cited in Hamilton, 2002).

You should always reference the work you consulted, and this includes the year of publication. Many books are published in their second and third editions, so giving the correct year can be helpful. Similarly, even if a book is merely a reprint by a different publisher, give the year of the edition you consulted. The page numbers may differ. If it’s just a second print of the exact same book, use the original date. Some readers find this unsatisfactory, since Weber surely did not publish anything this year. The convention to circumvent this issue is to give both years: the year of the original publication, together with the one of the work you consulted. Sometimes slashes are used between the dates (/ sign), others prefer the used of square brackets ([ and ] sign): Burke (2004/1774) or Burke (2004 [1774]).

Another small issue occurs where an author published more than one book or article in a single year, and you want to cite more than one of them. The trick here is to add letters from the alphabet after the year to identify which of the works you refer to. Use the letter ''a'' for the first of your references, the letter ''b'' for the second and so on: (McManus, 1994a) and (McManus, 1994b) are two different works.

To sum it up, inside the text, you give the family name of the author, followed by the year of the publication. Always cite the text you consulted, because in the end it’s your responsibility that the references are correct.

==At the End==

At the end of your essay you should include a list of references. Such a list of references provides more details than just the name of the author and the year of publication. It’s this list that allows identifying the work cited. Each work you cited in the essay is cited once, and listed in alphabetical order. Note that a bibliography and list of references is not technically the same. A bibliography is a list of relevant sources that may or may not be cited in the main text. References are the sources you cited, even if they are rather trivial. Use the heading ''references'' for your references.

For books, you put the family name of the author(s) and their initials, followed by the year of publication in brackets, the title in italics, the place of publication, and finally the name of the publisher. If there are editors, give their names instead of the authors’. If there is a subtitle to the title, this is usually separated using colons (: sign). Where there are more than four authors, it’s common to use ''et al.'' after the first three, but some styles insist on citing all authors. Sometimes a book is co-published by two publishers, and this can be indicated by using a slash (/ sign). Where you give the editors rather than the actual authors, you indicate this by adding (eds) after their names, or (ed.) if there is only one. The title is capitalized. For example:

: Anderson, C. &amp; Zelle, C. (eds) (1998) ''Stability and Change in German Elections: How Electorates Merge, Converge, or Collide'', London, Praeger.
: Granovetter, M. (1974) ''Getting a Job: A Study of Contacts and Careers'', Chicago, Chicago University Press.
: Grass, G. (1963) ''Katz und Maus'', Neuwied am Rhein, Rowolth/Hermann Leuchterhand.
: Hall, S. (ed.) (1997) ''Representation: Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices'', London, Sage.
: Halsey, A., Heath, A. &amp; Ridge, J. (1980) ''Origins and Destinations'', Oxford, Clarendon Press.

Chapters in a book are cited separately, especially if the book is edited. You give the family name of the author and his or her initial, the year, the name of the chapter in single speech marks (‘ and ’ sign; not capitalized), followed by the word ''in'', and the name and year of the editor(s). If you cite only one chapter, you can give the whole reference at the end; otherwise it’s enough to give the name and year of the editor. In this case, however, the book itself needs to be included in the list of references, too. For example:

: Allen, J. (1995) ‘Global worlds’ in Allen, J. &amp; Massey, D. (eds) (1995).
: Hardin, R. (1990) ‘Public choice versus democracy’ in Chapman, J. &amp; Wertheimer, A. (eds) (1990).
: Leroy, P. &amp; Verhagen, K. (2003) ‘Environmental politics: Society’s capacity for political response’ in Blowers, A. &amp; Hinchliffe, S. (eds) (2003) ''Environmental Responses'', Chichester, Wiley.

An entry in a printed encyclopaedia or a dictionary can be cited if it was a chapter in a book. The editors are often given on the front of the reference book. For example:

: Jackman, R. (2001) ‘Social capital’ in Smelser, N. &amp; Baltes, P. (eds) (2004).

Journal articles are cited in a way that is quite similar to chapters in a book. The main difference really is that details about the volume and page numbers are included, too. The reference starts with the name and initial of the author, the year in brackets, the title of the article in single speech marks (not capitalized), followed by the name of the journal in italics (capitalized), and further details. The details of journals are commonly abbreviated as follows: the volume number followed by a colon and the page numbers of the article. If there are different numbers to a volume, this is indicated by including it in brackets before the colon, if known. Online journals may not have page numbers. For example:

: Burt, R. (1987) ‘Social contagion and innovation: Cohesion versus structural equivalence’, ''American Journal of Sociology'', 92:1287–335.
: Thoits, P. &amp; Hewitt, L. (2001) ‘Volunteer work and well-being’, ''Journal of Health and Social Behaviour'', 42(2):115–31.
: Small, C. (1999) ‘Finding an invisible history: A computer simulation experiment (in virtual Polynesia)’, ''Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation'', 2(3).
: Valente, T. (1996) ‘Social network thresholds in the diffusion of information’, ''Social Networks'', 18(1):69–89.

Pages on the internet should be cited where used. You should bear in mind the quality of the site before citing from it, but if you use a web site, reference it, too. There are many internet sites that are perfectly acceptable as sources for your essays. The reference includes the name of the author and initial, the year in brackets, the title of the document in italics, the word ''online'' in square brackets, the place of publication, the publisher, the words ''available from'': followed by the URL, and the date when the document was accessed in brackets. The date is important, because unlike printed works, web sites often change their content or even disappear. Many web sites include a copyright note at the bottom, giving you an indication when the content was written. For example:

:Moser, P. (2005) ''Politik im Kanton Zürich—eine Synthese'' [online], Zürich, Statistisches Amt des Kantons Zürich, available from: http://web.archive.org/web/20051224111845/http://www.statistik.zh.ch/statistik.info/pdf/2005_15.pdf [accessed 27th October 2005].
: Chan, T. &amp; Goldthorpe, J. (2004) ''Social Status and Newspaper Readership'' [online], Oxford, Oxford University, available from: http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0006/papers/news4.pdf [accessed 31st March 2005].

Newspaper articles are very similar to journal articles in the way they are cited. The key difference is that rather than the volume, the date is given. The reference therefore includes the name and initial of the author, the year of publication in brackets, the title in single speech marks, the name of the newspaper in italics (capitalized), the date, and finally the page where the article was found. For one page it’s customary to use the abbreviation ''p.'', for articles running over two or more pages, the abbreviation pp. is common. For example:

: Cockburn, P. &amp; Usborne, D. (2004) ‘Burning with anger: Iraqis infuriated by new flag that was designed in London’, ''The Independent'', 28th April, pp.2–3.

Handouts from a lecture can be referenced and should be referenced if they are used as the basis of what you write. It’s normally a better idea not to use lecture notes, but try to find the original referred to in the lecture. Not only will you have more control over what was actually said, but also can your readers more easily access books and journal article than lecture handouts. The reference to a lecture handout includes the name and initial of the lecturer, the year in bracket, the title of the handout in single speech marks, the words lecture notes distributed in followed by the name of the course in italics, the word at and the name of your institution, the place, and date of the lecture. For example:

: Burt, S. (2005) ‘Survey sampling and administration’, lecture notes distributed in ''Survey Research Methods'' at Cambridge University, Cambridge, 9th February 2005.

Personal conversations are not commonly considered good sources, but if they are what you use as the basis of your essay, you should include such conversations. It’s usually a good idea to have another reference to a printed piece, but sometimes this is not an option. In terms of giving the reference, personal conversations are very easy: the name of the person you spoke to, the year in brackets, the words ''conversation with the author'' and the date of the conversation. For example:

: Smith, E. (2004) conversation with the author 6th July 2004.

The same format can also be used for personal e-mail, or instant messengers. Once again, bear in mind the credibility of your sources. With e-mail messages it’s customary to include the e-mail address of the sender in brackets after the name, but it’s essential that you obtain consent from the author. The subject line of the e-mail is often included as the title. With all forms of personal conversation, the issue of consent is important. It’s always a ''very'' good idea to check with the author first.

==Problem Cases==

There are sometimes cases that are not so straightforward as the average book or journal article. For everything there is a solution in the academic conventions. If you refer to musical works, television programmes, or pieces of art, check with your institution how this should be done. If everything else fails, remember the function of referencing, and provide a reasonable amount of information for others to chase the work.
Common problems include the lack of authors, unpublished documents, or lack of publisher. Where there is no author, often there is an organization. Put the name of the organization. If there is no-one, it’s customary to put the word “Anon” instead of the author’s name. For example:

: IDEA (1998) ''Women in Parliament: Beyond Numbers'' [online], Stockholm, International IDEA, available from: http://archive.idea.int/women/parl/toc.htm [accessed 28th February 2006].

Sometimes the year of a document is not known. Where you have a rough idea, you can put a c before the date, such as in (c.1999). Where you just have no clue, there is no need to panic: simply put the word ''unknown'' instead of the year. Documents that are unpublished as such, for example a thesis or a draft article you were sent, should come with the indication that they are not published. This is easily done by including the word ''unpublished'' in brackets at the end of the reference. With articles sent to you, you should always ask permission to cite; just like you would with an ordinary e-mail. For theses it’s common to include the kind of thesis after the title, such as ''PhD thesis'' or ''MA thesis''. Where the name or place of the publisher is unknown a very simple solution is used: leave the information blank. This is particularly an issue with internet sites. Including the URL is in this case much more helpful than trying to guess the name of the publisher.

Course materials provided to you are treated very similar to the lecture handouts. Give the name of the author, the year in brackets, the course code if there is one, the course title in italics (capitalized), the kind of material and its title in single speech marks, place of publication, and publisher. For example:

: Peake, S. (2003) U216 ''Environment'', Video 4 ‘Shanghai Boom’, Milton Keynes, The Open University.
: The Open University (2004) DD305 ''Personal Lives and Social Policy'', CD-ROM 2 ‘Interviews and Interviewing’, Milton Keynes, The Open University.

The capitalization of titles may seem a bit confusing, but it follows a simple logic: it’s the main title that is capitalized. In the case of a book, the main title is that of the book. In the case of journal articles, on the other hand, the main title is thought to be that of the journal itself. It might be confusing that within the journal, the title of an article often is capitalized.

Capitalization is not very hard to achieve. Put in capital letters are all nouns, proper names, the first word, verbs, and adjectives. This is in fact almost everything. Not put in capital letters are words like ''and'', ''in'', ''or'', or ''with''. Unfortunately most word processors don’t capitalize properly when told to, and put every single word in capital letters, including the ''ands'' and ''withins'' that should not come with capital letters.

Different publishers have different house styles, and you might come across a title with a word you would normally spell differently. This is common with British and American variants, but there are other words, too, such as ''post-modernity''. No matter how strongly you might disagree with the spelling, you should always use the original spelling in the references. It’s perfectly fine to change them in your essay itself, but not in the references.

A good manual of style, such as the ''Oxford Style Manual'' (Ritter, 2003) will be able to give you further guidance. Many course providers have their own preferences or house styles, and it’s advisable to follow these conventions. Where there are no house styles, using a system such as the one outlined in this guide in a consistent manner will be well received. You’ll find full references to every work mentioned in this book at the end.

==Plagiarism==

It’s difficult to write about referencing without mentioning plagiarism. Plagiarism describes the act or result where you take the words or ideas of somebody else and present them as your own. Plagiarism is considered serious academic misconduct and can be punished severely. Most importantly, however, your reputation is on the line.

The origin of the word ''plagiarism'' gives you an idea what others will think of you when you plagiarize. The word goes back to the Latin ''plagiārius'', a thief and kidnapper—in particular a child snatcher and somebody abducting slaves. The modern use in academia brands you a ''literary thief'' (OED, 2005).

There are a number of reasons why plagiarism occurs. The worst case is deliberate plagiarism (for whatever reason). Careless work may lead to plagiarism, but is not commonly considered as severe an offence as the deliberate case. Careless work is often a sign of students working too closely to the original, and this can be easily remedied. Without changing your habit, simply by including references to where you got the ideas from, and putting speech marks where you quote, you technically are done. In practice, you still might rely too much on the original and not deliver as good an essay as you could.

Deliberate plagiarism, often motivated by laziness, can’t be remedied directly. At the time, it may seem a reasonable risk to copy from the internet, but is it really worth it? Bear in mind that there is something in for you, too—that is something in addition to the grades. The more you write, the easier it gets.

If you work too closely to the original, there is a simple solution: don’t write the essay with the books in front of you. By so doing, there is very little danger that you copy word by word. In a way, you force yourself to make the material your own: and that is a good thing—it makes a better argument, your essay will be more original, and not least, you’ll also get better grades. Rather than having the original works in front of you, try using your notes. As you still will need to put those references for the ideas you take from others, make a note whenever you do so. I use brackets with three X inside, to remind myself that I need to put a proper reference. Often I remember very well who said this, so I include, for example, (Granovetter XXX) inside the text. When checking the essay, it’s hard not to notice the triple X; and there is always the search facility in the word processor. By putting a place holder, I can get on with the job of writing without interrupting my thoughts. Equally important, I leave some traces indicating to myself that there is some more work to be done: finding the proper reference, for example.

If you think plagiarism is hard to detect by your marker, think again. There are a great number of signs that give plagiarized work away. Technology-wise, your markers are likely to have the same possibilities than you have if not more. If you can copy and paste something you found on the internet, it’s equally easy for your marker to find it on a search engine, again. It would, of course, be possible, to change plagiarized work to the extent that the deed is no longer easy to spot. Usually, however, this is just as much work as writing the essay yourself.

Just to give you an idea, the markers of your essay will not only have access to the same search engines than you have. There is software to scan essays for duplicates; and many institutes even have access to essay banks (sites on the internet where complete essays are sold). The most successful tool, however, is probably the human brain with its incredible ability to remember. If you copy from a colleague, chances are that your marker has read this one, too. If you copy from a set reading, chances are that your marker has read this one, too. Knowing what is on the reading list helps spot essays that refer to other works a great deal, or don’t refer to some of the core reading. Your marker can estimate how many readings you had time to read, or whether you’re likely to have read a great number of papers on the ''Belgian'' perspective of whatever issues is set in the question. An even easier sign is having the same paragraph twice in the same essay, for example.

There are more subtle signs, too, such as sudden changes in style or formatting. Many people are unaware of how idiosyncratic one’s writing style is. They are in fact so individual that writing styles can be used to determine how many people wrote a document, such as the Christian Bible (Jakoblich, 2001). Writing style includes the tenses we use, the level of formality, our own choice of words, the kinds of metaphors we put, whether we use American or British English, choices over punctuation, the length of sentences, or the use of specialist terms. Typographic signs include font size, choices of where to break paragraphs, spaces in between lines, and things like proper m- and n-dashes (when copying from electronic articles).

The presence or lack of references is often an easy sign: for example, where there are many references inside the text, but few at the end, or where the citation style changes within a single essay. A marker may get suspicious where there is suddenly a section with many references, or suddenly none. Sometimes, students even include hyperlinks in references when copying from electronic journals; and have them automatically  underlined by the word processor.

Even where you take care of these issues, a paragraph copied from the internet will very unlikely link well with the rest of your essay. The style may be inappropriate, or just different. Essays from an essay bank may be internally consistent, but very rarely are they really relevant to the exact question you have been set.

In summary, you can avoid plagiarism easily. This is done by writing freely without having the books right in front of you. Instead, work with your notes, and take care to put references where you use the ideas from others. Don’t use the internet to copy from, no matter how tempting it is. It will hardly ever be worth it.

==Citations and Quotations==

There is an important difference between citations and quotations. Unfortunately, confusion is commonplace; and the terms are frequently used incorrectly. Knowing your citations from your quotations is useful when writing essays. It’s essential, in fact, if you want to reference properly.

Citations are about ideas you take from others. Quotations are about the exact words used by others. This is really the whole distinction. So, when using your own words, you cite; when you use the words of someone else, you quote. “Why can’t a man be more like a woman?” (Blankenhorn, 1995, p.117) is a quotation, because I use the exact same words Blankenhorn did. However, when stating that families in the US are increasingly defined by the absence of a father (Blankenhorn, 1995), I only use the idea, not the exact words.

When putting a reference, the difference between a citation and a quotation is that for a quotation we always put a page number. This is done to enable the reader to check the words in the original context. In the list of references at the end of the text, there is no difference.

Short quotations are included in the text, and enclosed by speech marks. Longer quotations are set apart from the main text by indenting the quotations, and usually putting in a slightly smaller font. Longer means about 3 to 4 lines or more. For example:

:''It is true that many voters may be voting for reasons wholly unconnected with social inequalities in any of the three dimensions. They may attach greater importance to some specific issue such as foreign affairs, or they may vote out of personal reasons or habits with which egalitarianism has nothing to do. (Runciman, 1966, p.136)''

When quoting someone else, you should take great care to copy the words exactly. Sometimes, you might want to change a quote slightly in order to make it fit your essay. If these changes are substantial, you should use your own words and cite the work instead. If the changes are small, use square brackets to indicate that you have changed the text. For example, you might quote Rawls (1999, p.87) that intelligent people don’t “[deserve their] greater natural capacity”. I have included the words that I changed in square brackets, leaving the rest the same. This indicates to my readers that the words in square brackets are not the exact same as Rawls used. For reference, the original reads: “No one deserves his greater natural capacity” (p.87). I made the changes, because I wrote about intelligent people, and Rawls was talking in more general terms.

Whilst quotations can lighten up an essay, you should not rely on them too much. Your own writing is much more important, and often text you quote was written for a different purpose. The consequence is that the quotations may be relevant in content (what is being said), but in terms of style don’t fit well with what you wrote. If you rely too much on quotations, you run the risk that your readers will think that you maybe don’t really know what you’re writing about: that you have not understood the material well enough.

==When to Put the References==
When writing an essay, particularly when writing an extended essay, it’s easiest to put the references whilst you write. This is the case, because you still know where you got the idea from. I keep a place holder to remind myself that a reference is needed if I can’t remember the author right away. Often, I will know at least some of it, and write this down. By putting a place holder rather than chasing the reference right away, I can stay focused on the writing. However, I also indicate that the essay is not completed. Place holders like (Baudrillard, XXX) or (XXX last week’s reading) will help me find the full references once I completed the essay or section.

References are needed whenever you write an academic piece of writing. Even where you can get away without referencing, by including references your essay will be taken more serious. It’s a good habit to put references all the time, so when you really need to—such as in your thesis—you’ll not struggle, or spend days trying to find out how to reference a chapter in a book.

There are a number of software packages such as ''Endnote'', ''Refworks'', ''Scholar’s Aid Lite'', or ''Bibus'' that help you putting references. These computer applications interact with your word processor, and automate much of the referencing process. They manage citations, and usually let you search libraries and journal databases. Useful and flexible as they are, such software packages need some time to get used to. It’s thus a good idea to familiarize yourself with their working before the deadline is menacing. For example, make sure you know how to put page numbers for quotations.

Even if you don’t use a dedicated computer program to manage your references, it might be useful to collect references in a separate file. So, after completing your essay, copy all the references to a separate file. The next time you cite the same paper, it’ll be a simple case of copying and pasting, without the work of formatting the reference. Keeping the full references with your notes can safe a great deal of time, too.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Exam Essays=

Exam essays are essays like others. They differ mostly by the constraints of time and therefore space. For these reasons, it’s even more important to follow a clearly structured approach to writing. The time constraints mean that you need to remain very focused in order to make most of what is available to you.

Very important in the setting of the exam is that you delimit the scope of your answer. Often a question is to a certain extent tied with a particular module or even a single lecture. Whilst this helps you in terms of deciding what goes in your essay and what does not, you should always leave some clues to the markers. By being explicit about the content and theories used in the essay, you demonstrate that you have put thought into the question. As a result, the answer will be more focused.

Because of the time/space constraints it’s advisable to reduce many sections, but don’t leave them out. One or two sentences can delimit the scope of the answer. One or two sentences can outline the answer, giving the marker an idea where you’re going to take him or her. The time constraints also mean that you may be better of with choosing a few key arguments and develop them properly. Don’t, however, focus on one side of the argument only: the overall structure of your essay answer should be essentially the same as if you were writing a full length version. What is different is that you may only include one example, or only consider two schools of thought in detail.

It’s usually worth drawing up a quick timetable for the exam. Say there are three questions in three hours, you should spend one hour on each (assuming the same number of points to be gained). You may need 10 or even 15 minutes for a good essay plan, leaving you with about 45 minutes to write up the essay. Ideally, you should allow a few minutes to check what you have written, too.

An exam plan should be clear about the priorities should you run out of time. For example, spending 15 minutes on the introduction will waste time you better spend on the main argument—no matter how brilliant the introduction turns out to be. Make sure you know what your main argument is going to be before starting writing. It’s better to cut short a minor point than missing the key argument. Similarly, never use time allocated for another question to finish off the one you’re working on. You’ll almost certainly lose more points than you gain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Using Feedback=

In many cases your essays are not only graded, but your markers give you feedback on the writing. In order to improve your essay writing skills, you should spend a few moments to read the comments and try to take them as useful criticism. Often it’s a good idea to leave the essay on its own for a day or so, after getting it back. This way you have time to cool down after receiving the mark. Marks are often different from what we expect, either better or worse. Coming back to the essay a day after, you’re able to make the most of the criticism: make it work for you.

A good idea is to go through the comments and identify three good points, and three points you want to work on. For example, your teaching assistant may comment that your overall structure was good. Make a note of it. Then again, maybe you didn’t include enough examples, so that would be something to work on. Even essays with full marks usually come with a few hints what could be done better.

[[Image:Feedback Organizer.png|Example Feedback Organizer|thumb]]

I use a table to collect the grade, three positive and three negative points. When writing the next essay, it’s time to dig out this table, and focus on the three points to improve. Probably you’ll want to choose only one of them, but make a real effort to improve on this one. When planning the essay, as outlined on page 3, you spend a few extra moments just focusing on what you want to do better. It’s by going through this process that you really learn from the feedback on your essays: this is how you develop writing skills.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Common Essay Problems=

By following the approach of essay writing outlined in this book, you can avoid a whole range of very common essay problems:

# Unstructured: Many essays are not structured, which makes them difficult for the markers to read. Without structure, reading an essay is like a discovery journey: your marker will never be sure what is around the corner. This might sound appealing, but you’re not writing a thriller. Your marker will have difficulty to see whether and how what you write is relevant to the question set. Following the advice in this book, you can avoid this problem by outlining at the beginning how you’re going to answer the question (''delimit''). Your reader will know what is coming up. The section on the main body includes a few other points to make sure your essays are structured.
# Rambling: The problem of rambling is often just a symptom of the above problem: lack of structure. By thinking in a structured way, tendencies to ramble are reduced. Following a reasonable form of preparation will also help (see the section on preparation). Once you know what you’re going to say, and in what order you’re going to say it, it’s much easier to stay on track.
# Not relevant: Unfortunately many essays that are written are as such great essays, but include substantive sections that are not relevant. The problem may be that not enough time is spent planning the essay. It may also be the case, that the irrelevant bits merely appear to be irrelevant. The trick in the latter case is to link the paragraphs using suitable phrases, and actively demonstrate how the illustrations are relevant, for instance.
# Unconnected: For the same reasons as in the above point, essays may be or appear unconnected. A good plan can be the first line of defence: making sure that you yourself know how the different bits link. The next thing to do, again, is using phrases that connect different paragraphs and sections. Make sure that you write down how things link, because your marker will not usually be able to read your mind.
# Unclear: An essay can be well put together, and the reader still be left unclear about what exactly is being said. The problem is in most cases the lack of ''delimitation'' and ''definition''. This means that the essay does not state what is and is not written about, and also that key terms are not defined. Much unclarity can stem from misunderstandings, the reader understanding terms in a different way from what you intended them to mean. What is clear to you may not be so for the marker. Making sure it’s down on paper, this problem can be prevented.
# Difficult: Essays that are difficult to read often suffer from one of the following symptoms: lack of illustrations, lack of conceptual clarity, or lack of guidance. Illustrations are not a nice to have, but an essential part of most essays. Think about the examples when you plan the essay. Conceptual clarity can be remedied by providing definitions, as outlined in the previous point. The lack of guidance means that your readers will feel lost, not knowing where the essay will go next. Providing a clear introduction that delimits the scope of the answer is sometimes all that is needed. Within the main body, linking sections and paragraphs helps further.

The most common problem, probably, is students failing to answer the question. By paying attention to the process and content words, the first part of the problem is already resolved. Writing in a planned and structured way, the remainder is addressed, too. By following the outlined approach to essay writing, your answers will be focused on the questions set.

==Getting Top Grades==

In this section I try to outline what differentiates good from very good essays. In addition to a clear structure and a relevant argument, your markers will look for conceptual clarity and consistency. You can achieve this by taking care to delimit your answer, and define key terms in a way that is relevant to your answer. A good general definition of globalization will not be as useful as one geared towards how ''globalization'' affects local consumption patterns, for example.

Your examiners will also look for critical engagement. Constantly ask yourself how important an argument is. Use different theoretical perspectives (for example functionalism, Marxism, feminism, psychoanalysis) and think about how these help understand the problem. Chances are that some theoretical perspectives have very little to say on your particular question. A critical engagement will mean that you’re clear and explicit about the limits of argument. Markers look out for statements like that “X is important, but only in certain areas of life,” or that “Y is important but only when considered together with other concepts,” or that “Z is not as important as X and Y.”

Essays with top grades identify and challenge where appropriate the assumption implicit in a question. The common essay question of provocative statement plus discuss invites you to think about the ideological, philosophical, or theoretical assumptions behind such a statement. A question may actually be the wrong question to ask if you’re approaching the answer from a feminist point of view, rather than a Marxist one, for example. Look out for counter-claims and examine their merit.

A top essay will have a clear and systematic structure. Ideally, at any one point your readers will know where they are, and why they are there. In practice this means that you’ll be clear about what you want to write before you start, and that you organize your thoughts in a coherent manner. The different sections are thus linked in a way obvious both to you and your reader.

Exploring all possibilities is another way to get top grades. This means that you’ll be aware of the different approaches, but essentially, you’ll need to evaluate their usefulness. It’s not just a matter of applying a great number of perspectives, but maybe more importantly one of choosing and selecting which of those carry forward the argument most. This normally involves the rejection of some of the possibilities. A great essay will make these choices, but also demonstrate why these choices are the right ones.

Top-grade essays are also clear about the relevance of what is written. In a paragraph, you not only list the different aspects, for example, and then give an appropriate example. In addition, markers look for a few sentences on the importance of what was just written. This can usually be achieved by linking it back to the question, or other underlying debates. Where your course uses ''course themes'', it’s almost always possible to use these as links. In their feedback, markers often use the phrase “engaging with the question” to refer to this aspect.

==Word Limits==

In most cases when you’re given an essay to write, there is a word limit stated. A word limit is simply an indication how many words you should not exceed in your essay. Sometimes instead a number of pages is given. Word limits exist for a number of reasons. First of all, writing to length is considered a desirable skill. Secondly, having a limit is a way to ensure that you select the most relevant bits. Skills of selection are sought after outside of academia, too. Thirdly, word limits give an indication to you as the writer of what is expected from you.

You should always try as hard as you can not to exceed the word limit. They are called ''limits'' after all, not indications. The most powerful of reasons is probably that you might be penalized. Moreover, keeping to word limits is part of good practice, nice on your readers, and a sign that you possess certain skills. Many institutions practise a formal or informal 10% tolerance. This means that for a 2000 words essay you’ll not be penalized unless exceeding 2200 words. It’s essential that you check, and make sure you check with someone in an adequate position. Staying within the limits is the easier and safer option.

Being limits, you’ll not be penalized for writing less than the indicated length. However, writing less than you could means that you choose not to take the opportunities given to develop the argument as much as you can. It’s for this reason that you might get lower marks. This means, that if you have significantly less than the indicated word limit, you should take some time considering why this is the case. It’s not necessarily a bad sign, but usually means that you could develop the argument further, or that there are no illustrations to bring the essay alive. In either case, your marker will be likely to comment on this.

Planning your essay is the best way to stay within the limits. When drawing up the outline, I always spend a moment thinking about how many words I want to allocate to each section. This not only helps me staying within the word limit, but more importantly, maybe, is the plan for a balanced answer. By planning to write the same amount on two contrasting views, for example, it’s unlikely that I write three quarters of the essay on one side only. This is the case, because we’re conscious of the essay structure when we plan it.

During the process of writing the essay, you can monitor your progress by checking the number of words in your current section. Planning and checking section by section will prevent you from panicking when looking at the overall word count. If you go over, or run out with much to spare, flag the section. Maybe you’ll have an additional idea later on in the day, maybe your plan was not realistic, or maybe you mentioned a point in another section. By having the sections flagged, it’s easier to remedy the length of the essay once completed.

Sometimes there is confusion over what counts as words. Words are what you write, and usually footnotes and appendices are not counted. However, word processors often count these, too. In any case, do check what counts towards the word limit in your institution or course. Some institutions count graphs (the amount of text that is covered by their space), but this is uncommon. Technically, references don’t count towards the word count. If they did, this would encourage sloppy referencing. Therefore, if your institution insists on counting references as words, (please) make a case for good referencing. The list of references at the end of the essay is not included in any case. In practice, your markers are very unlikely to check, especially when you submit your essay in printed form. It’s for reasons like this that many institutions allow you an extra 10%. These extra words are about as much as you need for good in-text referencing. For the same reasons, the length of essays is frequently limited in number of pages. Do check the format expected, such as double-spacing. In any case, you should strive to keep within the word limit, because this is expected from you. The grading of essays is always in relation to what could be said within the limits stated, not what possibly ever could be said about it.

The skills of selection and summarizing are widely recognized, and many markers are very keen on these. Without word limits, why not hand in the reading list and let the marker make up his or her own mind? Surely all the relevant points would be covered…

==Getting Help==

It would be foolish to claim that a short book could be the definite guide to writing essays. Of course it is not. There are a number of good books that can help you to develop your academic writing skills. Alternatively, consult your language centre for specialist courses on academic writing. Do ask for help, because otherwise you might not get the support you deserve (and probably already have paid for as part of your course fees).

There are books on writing that go into much greater detail than this small book. Ask your bookshop or library about what is available, and have a good look what is covered in the book. Books on essay writing in general will never offer you as much advice as those focusing on specific aspects of writing. Everyone has different needs, and a book focusing on the areas of essay writing you’re particularly good at will probably not help you as much as another. Feedback from previous essays may help you find out what areas you want to improve.

For technical details, you might need a good dictionary. If English is not your first language, get hold of a dictionary written for learners of English, such as the ''Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary'' (Hornby, 2005) or the ''Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary'' (Woodford, 2005). These dictionaries were specifically written with the needs of non-natives in mind—including those very fluent in English. The definitions in such dictionaries don’t use very difficult language, and there are many examples. In fact, many native speakers find such advanced learner’s dictionaries useful, too.

The choice of grammar books is vast, and you should pick one you feel comfortable with. Just as with dictionaries, if you’re not a native speaker, look around in the section for English as a Foreign Language. Michael Swan’s ''English Usage'' (1995), for example, is both approachable and comprehensive. Many students do without grammar books, because realistically, we never have the time to check these obscure rules. Similarly, there are authoritative books on the style of your documents, such as ''The Oxford Style Manual'' (Ritter, 2003). Hart’s rules (Ritter, 2005) are often considered authoritative, but often go far beyond the scope of general essay writing. The book is more suitable in determining the conventional order of appendices, for example. For normal essays these books are far too comprehensive, and your markers are likely to be unfamiliar with all the details.

For advice on writing style, there are a great number of books available. Again, check your bookshop or library. Some books focus on the choice of the right word, others on different aspects of style. Note that different books give different stylistic advice. If you don’t want to splash out on a good book, you could do worse than bookmark Paul Brians’ page on common English mistakes (2006). This free and useful guide can come in very handy when in doubt (see reference at the end for URL).

If you’re unsure about plagiarism, or worried about your writing skills: the best way to get help is approaching your tutor or supervisor. They will be familiar with most of the conventions, and equally important, be able to guide you to more specialist assistance should this be necessary. In terms of plagiarism, there are a number of useful internet sites, including the Glatt Self-Detection Programme (2000), and their site at http://www.plagiarism.com/ (1998).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Summary Page=

This page is a one-page summary of the whole book. A good essay is characterized by following a structured approach of essay writing.

==Audience==
When writing an essay, you should always think about the audience: who do you write for. The audience is often imaginary, but you should never assume that your readers will be very familiar with the special concepts you use. Aim for somebody in your general subject but specializes on a completely different area.

==Structure==
The key to a successful essay is planning the structure: what you’re going to say in what order. There is more than one way to approach every question. Following the following advice will always be a reasonable approach.

==1. Delimiting the Question==
As a first step you’ll state how you understand the question. By doing so, you give your reader a sense of where the essay is going. You also demonstrate that you’re going to answer the question. An important point is to be explicit what goes into the essay and what stays out. A short outline is often helpful.

==2. Defining Key Terms==
Rather than assuming familiarity with the key concepts, always give a brief definition. Not only will your readers know what you talk about, but you also can demonstrate that you know what aspects are the most important ones.

==3. Main Part==
Having outlined what you’re going to write, clarified the key concepts, it’s time to deliver. Essays with a clear structure, following a certain logic are the most successful ones. Don’t hesitate to state how different bits link, or why a certain paragraph is relevant. Include illustrations to bring the argument to life.

==4. Discussion==
After exploring the different aspects in your previous section, it’s time to take a critical stance. Are some aspects more convincing, are others plain wrong? This is the place to bring in your own views and prepare the conclusion.

==5. Conclusion==
You have nearly reached the end. In your final section, summarize the main points of your essay, reminding the reader how you got to where you ended up. Refer to the essay question, showing that you have answered the question you were set.

==References==
Always include full references to all the material cited and quoted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Glossary=

The following is a glossary of some of the technical words used in this book.

'''Body''': The main part of your essay is sometimes called the body. It’s the essay minus the introduction and conclusion.

'''Citation''': A citation is a reference to the work of somebody else. You put a citation whenever you use the ideas of somebody else. Citations are not the same as quotations.

'''Conclusion''': The final part of your essay is the conclusion. It is the part where the essay is brought to an end. A conclusion often summarizes the main arguments of an essay, and presents a view or opinion that is reached after considering different aspects.

'''Content words''': These are words in the essay question that tell you ''what'' to write about. They often also tell you (sometimes indirectly) what sources or texts to use. They are not the same as the ''process words''.

'''Definition''': A definition is a short explanation of what a term or concept means. It focuses on the main aspects or components.

'''Essay''': An essay is an analytic piece of work. It is usually divided into an introduction, the main argument (body), and a conclusion.

'''Example''': ''see illustration''

'''Full references''': ''see reference''

'''Heading''': This describes the style of a line that is set apart from the rest of the text. The heading indicates what the section immediately following is about. Smaller headings are called ''subheading''.

'''Illustration''': These are examples that you include in your essay to make the text more approachable. Illustrations link the abstract argument with practical examples. Illustrations in this context don’t normally refer to pictures.

'''In-text reference''': ''see reference''

'''Introduction''': The introduction of an essay is the opening section. It outlines what the essay is about, and serves to indicate how the essay question is answered in the remainder of the essay.

'''Linking word''': Linking words are words and phrases that join different parts of the essay. They can link sentences, paragraphs, or even sections. Such words include ''however'', ''in contrast'', ''on the other hand'', ''but'', or ''furthermore''.

'''m-dash''': This is a long dash used in printed works (— sign).

'''Marker''': Your essay is marked and graded by a person. Depending on the course and institution, this may be your tutor, your supervisor, or a teaching assistant.

'''Memo''': This is usually a shorter piece of writing with specific content. Unlike an essay, a memo is geared towards highlighting certain aspects, such as the social mechanisms involved in a chosen topic.

'''n-dash''': This is a long dash used in printed works (– sign). It is shorter than the m-dash, but longer than a hyphen (- sign).

'''Outline''': An outline is a short and tentative overview of what the essay is about. Only the main points and arguments are included.

'''Paragraph''': This is a distinct subdivision in a text. In your essay, you should break up the text into several paragraphs. Each paragraph develops a separate thought, and makes one statement only.

'''Process words''': These are words in the essay question that tell you ''how'' to approach and structure your answer. For example, ''discuss'' is a process word. Process words are not the same as ''content words''.

'''Question''': The essay question is a short indication of what your essay should be about. It outlines the subject and often gives instructions how to approach the answer.

'''Quotation''': A quotation is the use of the ''exact'' words of somebody else’s words. Quotations are usually put between speech marks to indicate that they are not your own words. They are also known as quotes, but are not the same as ''citations''.

'''Reference''': This is a short note included in the text indicating to the reader where a citation or quotation originates. A common form of referencing is a note in brackets where the author and year of publication are given. Full references are given at the end of the essay, providing further information. An in-text reference allows identifying the full reference at the end. The full reference, in turn, allows identifying the work used.

'''Report''': A report is a piece of writing that differs from essays. It is usually more focused in making points and outlining the findings, and less on developing the arguments. Sometimes bullet points are used.

'''Structure''': The structure of an essay describes how it’s built, how the different parts of the essay link together to create the complete essay. Your essay should include an introduction, a section defining key terms, a main part (body), and a conclusion. Within these parts, your essay should be divided into logical sections, consisting of separate paragraphs.

'''Subheading''': This is a heading that is of lower importance than a heading. Technically still a heading, a subheading is set apart from main headings, such as by being set in a smaller font.

'''Summary''': A summary is a brief statement of the main points or arguments of your essay, or the section summarized.

      <comment>the 2nd question was wrong because as stated within the actual question the slit separation is 0.05m and therefore d=0.05 not 0.1. This therefore will affect the whole solution.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A 2-slit experiment is set up in which the slits are 0.03 m apart. A bright fringe is observed at an angle 10° from the normal. What sort of electromagnetic radiation was being used?'''

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = d\sin{\theta} = 0.03 \times \sin{10} \approx 5.21 \times 10^{-3}\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

So, microwaves were being used.

'''2. Light, with a wavelength of 500 nm, is shone through 2 slits, which are 0.05 m apart. What are the angles to the normal of the first three dark fringes?'''

&lt;math&gt;n \times 500 \times 10^{-9} = 0.05 \times \sin{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, where n is an odd integer.

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arcsin{\frac{n \times 500 \times 10^{-9}}{0.05}} = \arcsin{(n \times 500 \times 10^{-8})}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, substitute in n = 1,3 and 5 to gain corresponding values of θ:

{| cellpadding = &quot;3&quot;
!''n''
!θ (°)
|-
|''1''
|5.730 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|''3''
|5.2360 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|''5''
|8.7266 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|}

'''3. Some X-rays, with wavelength 1 nm, are shone through a diffraction grating in which the slits are 50 μm apart. A screen is placed 1.5 m from the grating. How far are the first three light fringes from the point at which the normal intercepts the screen?'''

&lt;math&gt;n \times 10^{-9} = \frac{50 \times 10^{-6} \times x}{1.5} \approx 33.3 \times 10^{-6} \times x&lt;/math&gt;, where n is an integer.

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{n \times 10^{-9}}{33.3 \times 10^{-6}} = 30 \times 10^{-6} \times n&lt;/math&gt;

Then, substitute in n = 1,2 and 3 to gain corresponding values of x:

{| cellpadding = &quot;3&quot;
!''n''
!x (m)
|-
|''1''
|30 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|''2''
|60 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|''3''
|90 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;
|-

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Forces==
Forces are vectors. When solving problems involving forces, it is best to think of them as lots of people pulling ropes attached to an object. The forces are all pulling in different directions, with different magnitudes, but the effect is in only one direction, with only one magnitude. So, you have to add the forces up as vectors.

Forces cause things to happen. They cause an object to accelerate in the same direction as the force. In other words, forces cause objects to move in a direction closer to the direction they are pulling in. If the object is already moving, then they will not cause it to move in the direction of the force, as forces do not create velocities: they create accelerations.

If a force is acting on an object, it seems logical that the object will not accelerate as much as a result of the force if it has a lower mass. This gives rise to the equation:

&lt;math&gt;F = ma\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where F = force applied (in Newtons, denoted N), m = mass (in kg) and a = acceleration (in ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;). If we rearrange the equation, it makes more sense:

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the acceleration in a given direction as the result of a force is equal to the force applied per. unit mass in that direction.

==Work Done==
You should already know how to calculate some types of energy, for example:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Kinetic Energy } = \frac{mv^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Gravitational Potential Energy } = mgh\,&lt;/math&gt;

The amount of energy converted by a force is equal to the work done, which is equal (as you already know) to the force multiplied by the distance the object it is acting on moves:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Work Done } = \Delta E = F\Delta s\,&lt;/math&gt;

When answering questions about work done, you may be given a force acting in a direction other than that of the displacement. In this case, you will have to find the displacement in the direction of the force, as shown in the section on [[A-level Physics (Advancing Physics)/Vectors|Vectors]].

==Power==

Power is the rate of change of energy. It is the amount of energy converted per. unit time, and is measured in Js&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\Delta E}{t}&lt;/math&gt;,

where E = energy (in J) and t = time (in s). Since ΔE = work done, power is the rate at which work is done. Since:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = F\Delta s\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta E}{t} = F\frac{\Delta s}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P = Fv\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where P = power (in Watts, denoted W), F = force and v = velocity.

==Gravity==
Gravity is something of a special case. The acceleration due to gravity is denoted g, and is equal to 9.81359ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is uniform over small distances from the Earth. The force due to gravity is equal to mg, since F = ma. Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{mg}{m} = g&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, when things are dropped, they all fall at the same acceleration, regardless of mass. Also, the acceleration due to gravity (in ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) is equal to the gravitational field strength (in Nkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Questions==

1. I hit a ball of mass 5g with a cue on a billiards table with a force of 20N. If friction opposes me with a force of 14.2N, what is the resultant acceleration of the ball away from the cue?

2. A 10g ball rolls down a 1.2m high slope, and leaves it with a velocity of 4ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. How much work is done by friction?

3. An electric train is powered on a 30kV power supply, where the current is 100A. The train is travelling at 90 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the net force exerted on it in a forwards direction?

Resultant force = 20 - 14.2 = 5.8N

F = ma

5.8 = (5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;)a

a = 1160ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

'''2. A 10g ball rolls down a 1.2m slope, and leaves it with a velocity of 4ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. How much work is done by friction?'''

g.p.e. at top of slope = mgh = 10 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; x 9.81 x 1.2 = 0.117J

k.e. at bottom of slope = ½mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5 x 10 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; x 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.08J

Assuming the remainder of the g.p.e. becomes heat / sound due to friction:

work done by friction = 0.117 - 0.08 = 0.037J.

P = IV = Fv

90 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.025 km&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 25 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

100 x 30 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 25F

The spindle can be soft woods, yucca, mullen, hazel, aspen, cedar, and most willows all work very well. The hearth fire board should be yucca, cottonwood, and cedar. Combination of material for spindel and board can be hazel and poplar as well. 

The bow should be stiff but slightly limber and around 30 inches long. The bearing block can be made of anything but bone, antler, and stone work the best as they can be easily greased, do not create as much friction, and do not burn.

The bow drill is an ancient tool. While it was usually used to make fire, it was also used for primitive woodworking and dentistry. It consists of a bearing block or handhold, a spindle or drill, a hearth or fireboard, and a simple bow. Related drills include the pump drill and the hand drill.

The spindle, carved to reduce friction at one end and maximize it at the other, is held at one end by the bearing block, and at the other by the hearth. The string of the bow is wrapped once around it, so that it is taut enough not to slip during operation. A variation on this called the ''Egyptian Bow Drill'' attaches the string in a slightly different way.

The usual position that a person assumes whilst operating the bow drill is as follows: the right knee is placed on the ground (assuming a right-handed operator) and the arch of the left foot is on the board, pinning it in place. The left wrist, holding the handhold, is hooked around the left shin so it can generate enough downward pressure and speed; achieved by pushing down with the handhold and spinning the drill. The heat of the friction between the hearth and the spindle both creates charred, fuzzy dust and causes it to ignite - forming a coal or ember. The handhold is lubricated and the spindle is carved to about thumb thickness, usually six to eight inches long.

An indentation and a &quot;v&quot; notch into the center of the dent is made into the fireboard and the spindle is placed on it. The notch allows a place for the dust collect while it is being abraded off the spindle and the hearth. Eventually, the friction generates heat to ignite the dust, which can be used to light tinder.

Whilst a &quot;v&quot; is most common, other methods to create a cavity to contain the dust whilst it is being ignited can be used. For example: drilling part-way into a hearth made by lashing two sticks together from one side, and then drilling from the other side to meet this hole; or using the area where two branches separate. This is to keep the coal off wet or snow covered ground.

This is by far the easiest method of producing a coal by primitive means and anyone can do it by using good materials and maintaining a calm mentality, concentrating only on working everything slowly and smoothly.

Survival skills are skills that may help everyone to survive dangerous situations (such as storms or earthquakes), or in dangerous places (such as the desert, the mountains, and the jungle). Useful skills include lighting a fire, finding shelter, making water safe to drink, finding and identifying food, treating injuries, and climbing, swimming, and using specific or makeshift tools.

Each type of wilderness challenges a person with a different range of dangers (see hazards of outdoor activities). An environment may be dry, wet, hot, cold, high altitude, low altitude, desert, rural, urban, wilderness, subterranean, or an island. There are four basic necessities of life which apply in all of these cases: shelter, water, fire, and food. A fifth is oxygen for high altitudes and subterranean environments, and also specific survival situations such as drowning and landslide/avalanche.

Survival skills used on a more permanent basis, or as a component of daily life are referred to as bushcraft.

Developments in outdoor equipment and survival techniques have skewed the scale towards man- if one is prepared, but there is nothing to replace experience in a survival situation. Those who are most prepared physically and mentally stand the greatest chance of survival.

== &lt;big&gt;OCR&lt;/big&gt; ==

&lt;u&gt;Optical character recognition&lt;/u&gt;, usually abbreviated to OCR, 
its is used for translation of images of handwritten, typewritten or printed text.
this is a field of a research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and machine vision.
It is mainly based on the handwritten scripts.

== Touchscreen ==
is a display which can detect the location of touches 
within the display area.They have many features as follows Resistive,
Surface acoustic wave,Capacitive,Infrared,Optical imaging.Example of a touch screen 
application software will be Nintendo DS.

== Keyboard ==

Keyboard is used for many function it helps us in different symbols; typically, this is because they are writing in different languages.
There are many different types of keyboards, like wireless keyboards which increase the freedom of the user and it becomes more user friendly. Made up of any number of color or monochrome pixels arrayed in front of a light source or reflector
The wireless keyboard signals are sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer.There many advantages of a 
keyboard as they have many special keys. There are lot of  different types keyboard for example-Multimedia keyboards,Gaming keyboards,Virtual keyboards.

== MICR ==
-Magnetic ink character recognition

Characters are printed in a special ink which contains tiny magnetic particles. A reading head is passed over the specially shaped characters and recognises the shape of each by its magnetic field. The computer can therefore capture the data printed in magnetic ink.
MICR has the following advantages:
It's both machine and human readable (unlike the magnetic strip on a credit card).
The data can be read even if the paper on which it is printed is marked or folded.
Due to the rarity of magnetic ink printers it is relatively hard to forge. It has the following disadvantages:
A particular font has to be used so that it can be recognised,
Exposure of the printing to a strong magnetic field can make the data unreadable (though it can still be keyed in).

== Plotter ==
is a vector graphical printing device that connects to a computer.
They can draw complex line art, including text, but do so very slowly because of the mechanical movement of the pens.
Plotters are not very efficient in their work as they cannot draw or create a solid region of color.

== LCD ==
Liquid crystal display is a flat device and up of any number of color or monochrome pixels arrayed in front of a light source or reflection.
There are many advantages of LCD Sharpness,Geometric Distortion,Brightness,Screen Shape,Physical.
But there also some disadvantages of LCD Resolution ,Interference,Black-Level, Contrast and Color Saturation ,
Motion Artifacts ,Aspect Ratio. 

Black-Level, Contrast and Color Saturation
LCDs have difficulty producing black and very dark grays. As a result they generally have lower contrast than CRTs and the color saturation for low intensity colors is also reduced. Not suitable for use in dimly lit and dark environments.


== Resolution ==
Each panel has a fixed pixel resolution format determined at the time of manufacture that can not be changed. 
All other image resolutions require rescaling, which generally results in significant 
image degradation, particularly for fine text and graphics.

== Interference ==
LCDs using an analog input require careful adjustment of pixel tracking/phase in order to reduce or eliminate digital noise in the image. Automatic pixel tracking/phase controls seldom produce the optimum setting. Timing drift and jitter may require 
frequent readjustments during the day.

== Black-Level ==
LCDs have difficulty producing black and very dark grays. As a result they generally have lower contrast than CRTs and the color saturation for low intensity colors is also reduced. Not suitable for use in dimly lit and dark environments.



== &lt;big&gt;Sensor&lt;/big&gt; ==

Sensor is a device which determines a physical quantity and transfers it into a signal which can be read by an 
onlooker or by an instrument.Sensor is used in our active life for instance infrared sensor is used in corridors by which 
minimize the energy consumption.   
There are many different types of censors as follows.
Thermal,Electronics's,Mechanical,Chemical.

&lt;big&gt;Optical radiation&lt;/big&gt;
Light time-of-flight. Used in modern surveying equipment, a short pulse of light is emitted and returned by a retro reflector.


&lt;big&gt;Advantages&lt;/big&gt;
Smart sensor is an instrument which can transfer the information wirelessly to an Ethernet monitoring point. 

Wireless  sensor network is very friendlily instrument easy to install no wires are needed,it also allows an easy way 
for upgrading of existing unit.But there are some setbacks of wireless sensor it has a relatively slow speed of communication
it also get sidetracked for example blue tooth .


=Graphic tablets =
This is a computer input device which allows hand-draw images and graphics, similar to the way one draws images with a pencil and paper.It's a flat surface area on which you can draw, write, etc.

Mainly there are two types of graphic tablets:
Passive tablet is electromagnetic induction .The tablet generates an electromagnetic signal, which is received by the LC circuit in the pen. The wires in the tablet then change to a receiving mode and read the signal generated by the pen.By the use of the electromagnetic signals the tablet is capable of using he stylus position without the stylus having to even touch the surface, and powering the pen with this signal means that devices used with the tablet never need batteries. 

Active tablets
This is little bit different from he stylus used contains self-powered electronics that generate and transmit a signal to the tablet.


== Process architecture ==
is a process system which applies such as computer,hardware,software,networking.
process can be defined as having inputs, outputs and the energy required to transform inputs to outputs.

Architecture 
Besides a propensity to modeling dualistic real-world behavior, PNs also offer a way to manage complex process systems hierarchically. Using classical PN construction rules, Petri nets of Petri nets can be built and a hierarchical conception of a complex process system can be studied. This structure of hierarchical abstraction is the heart of process architecture.


A Hint from an ARKIS senior 2012 is also the processor Architecture which is the single and multiple piplines the multiple pipline works in parrallel therorefre incrase the rate of intrruction bring processed

also guys dont forget the Primary Memory Architecture which is from an Known Examiner he told me that in May 2012 CS exam this will come ;) it's about the SRAM and DRAM SRAM stands for Static RAM which is expensive however therefore used for Cache memory and the DRAM is usually used for main memory also dont forget the main development which is EPROM which allow users to write over ROM

''Return to [[IB Computer Science]]''

=Abstract Data Structures and Algorithms=
==Fundamentals==
==Static data structures==
You should be able to compile these examples in any Java editor, such as BlueJ or JCreator. All of the examples assume that the IBIO methods exist in the file.

An example class using these methods is found here . Make sure you can compile and run this source code if you want to implement any of the examples given in these pages.

Any code you want to try out should be placed in the Constructor:

/**
* Constructor for objects of class Adams
*/
public Adams()
{
     // valid Java or JETS statements may be placed here...
     output(&quot;The answer is: &quot; + d);
}

You may want to change the Class name, in which case, remember that:

    the file name must be the same as the class name with the extension .java
    the constructor name must be the same as the class name.
    you ought to change the comments to reflect what your program does.

Stack in an array

An array is going to be used to hold a sequence of characters:
	
 [0] 
	
 [1] 
	
 [2] 
	
 [3] 
	
 [4] 
	
 [5] 
	
 [6] 
	
 [7] 
	
 [8] 
	
 [9] 
	
[10]
	
[11]
stack 	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 

Initially, a pointer, size , is set to 0, so stack[size] is the next available element. To push an item onto the stack we can work one of two ways:

    Allocate the item to stack[size] then move size up one in the array
    Allocate the item to stack[0] and increment size by 1

It should be apparent that the second option involves shuffling up elements whereas the first only requires the stack pointer to be moved.

Given:

   private static final int SIZE = 12;      // a constant for the stack size
   private char[] stack = new char[SIZE];  // the array to hold the stack
   private int size = 0;                   // the number of items in the stack

A possible push operation is:

  // method to push an item onto the stack
   public void push(char item)
   {      
     stack[size] = item;
     size = size + 1;
   }

Which works up to a point. Is there any check that needs to be done? Add it.

So far, the code might look like this:

/**
* Class Stack
* Implements a stack of Characters
* Uses an array - is a static data structure
*/
public class Stack
{
   private static final int SIZE = 12;      // a constant for the stack size
   private char[] stack = new char[SIZE];   // the array to hold the stack
   private int size = 0;                    // the number of items in the stack

   // Constructor
   public Stack()
   {
     size = 0;
     char c;
     do
     {
       c = inputChar(&quot;Input a character ('/' to end)&quot;);
       push(c);
       display();
     } while (c != '/');
   }
   // method to push an item onto the stack
   public void push(char item)
   {
     if (size &lt; SIZE)
     {
       stack[size] = item;
       size = size + 1;
     }
     else
     {
       output(&quot;Stack full&quot;);
     }
   }
   public void display()
   {
     output(&quot;stack&quot;);
     output(&quot;=====&quot;);
     for(int p = (size - 1); p &gt;= 0; p--)
     {
       output(p + &quot;:&gt; &quot; + stack[p]);
     }
     output(&quot;=====&quot;);
   }
   // Main method for class stack
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     new Stack();
   }
   //============================================================
   // Below are the IBIO simple input and output methods
   // to be included in the Class.

Exercises

Write the method pop, to remove an item from the stack - being sure to watch out for underflow (when there are not any items on the stack).

Write the algorithm which reverses a character String in place (a discussion of this is found on the previous page). To take an input String and split it into characters, you might need something like:

  String s = input(&quot;Please input a String&quot;);
   for (int p = 0; p &lt; s.length(); p++)
   {
     char c = s.getChar(p);
    // process c

To concatenate characters into a String try something like:

  String s;
   char c;
   s = s + c; // string s with char c added at the end (concatenated)

A useful method, top, returns the top element from the stack, if it exists, without popping it. Implement this.

Queue in an array

We have seen a possible way of implementing a queue using a linked list , but this section is concerned with static data structures. So let's see how we might go about using the same array as above, except that we will need two pointers into the array, front and rear.

Recall the items are added at the rear ( enqueued ) and removed from the front ( dequeued ).
	
 [0] 
	
 [1] 
	
 [2] 
	
 [3] 
	
 [4] 
	
 [5] 
	
 [6] 
	
 [7] 
	
 [8] 
	
 [9] 
	
[10]
	
[11]
queue 	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 

It seems reasonable to have both front and rear point to element 0 initially. To enqueue an item, place it at rear then increment rear to point at the next free location.

Check to see if the end of the array has been reached:

**
*Class Queue
*Implements a stack of Characters
*Uses an array - is a static data structure
*/
public class Queue
{
   private static final int SIZE = 12;     // a constant for the queue size
   private char[] queue = new char[SIZE];  // the array to hold the queue
   private int front = 0;                  // the first item in the queue
   private int rear = 0;                   // the last item in the queue

   // Constructor
   public Queue()
   {
     front = 0;
     rear = 0;
     char c;
     do
     {
       c = inputChar(&quot;Input a character ('/' to end)&quot;);
       enqueue(c);
       display();
     } while (c != '/');
   }
   public void enqueue(char item)
   {
     if (rear &lt; SIZE)
     {
       queue[rear] = item;
       rear = rear + 1;
     }
     else
     {
       output(&quot;Queue full - cannot add item&quot;);
     }
   }
   public void display()
   {
     output(&quot;front&quot;);
     output(&quot;=====&quot;);
     for(int p = front; p &lt; rear; p++)
     {
       output(p + &quot;:&gt; &quot; + queue[p]);
     }
     output(&quot;=====&quot;);
   }
   // Main method for class queue
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     new Queue();
   }
//============================================================
// Below are the IBIO simple input and output methods

Exercise

Implement the dequeue method, be sure to test if there is anything in the queue to remove.

You might want to change the Constructor to allow the dequeue to be called:

     c = inputChar(&quot;Input a character ('/' to end, '#' to dequeue)&quot;);

You can either return a character from the dequeue method or output it within the method body.

Once you have got that working, there are a few problems here - try adding asnd removing enough items and we get to a point where the rear pointer has run up against the end of the array, yet there is still space at the front of the array:
	
[0]
	
[1]
	
[2]
	
[3]
	
[4]
	
[5]
	
[6]
	
[7]
	
[8]
	
[9]
	
[10]
	
[11]
queue 	  	  	  	  	  	  	
	
f
	
   s   
	
  s  
	
a
	
d
	space which is unused/wasted 	
front
				
rear

So, what we need to do is wrap the front pointer around to the start again.

However, we have to be able to detect when the queue is full , when the rear pointer catches up with the front pointer.

There are several ways to deal with this problem, the simplest of which is probably to maintain a special flag qFull which we will set true when the front reaches the rear and unset whenever we dequeue an item.

It is also possible to use a qEmpty flag in a similar way.

/**
*Class Queue
*Implements a stack of Characters
*Uses an array - is a static data structure
*/
public class Queue
{
   private static final int SIZE = 12;    // a constant for the queue size
   private char[] queue = new char[SIZE]; // the array to hold the queue
   private int front = 0;                  // the first item in the queue
   private int rear = 0;                   // the last item in the queue
   private boolean qFull = false;          // flag
   private boolean qEmpty = true;          // nothing in the queue initially
   // Constructor
   public Queue()
   {
     front = 0;
     rear = 0;
     qFull = false;
     qEmpty = true;

     char c;
     do
     {
       c = inputChar(&quot;Input a character ('/' to end, '#' to dequeue)&quot;);
       if ( (c != '/') &amp;&amp; (c !='#'))
       {
         enqueue(c);
       }
       else if (c == '#')
       {
         dequeue();
       }
       display();

     } while (c != '/');
   }
   public void enqueue(char item)
   {
     if (qFull)
     {
       output(&quot;Queue full - cannot add item&quot;);
     }
     else
     {
       queue[rear] = item;
       rear = (rear + 1) % SIZE;
       qFull = (rear == front);
       qEmpty = false;
     }
   }
   public void dequeue()
   {
     if (qEmpty)
     {
       output(&quot;Empty queue&quot;);
     }
     else
     {
       char c = queue[front];
       front = (front + 1) % SIZE;
       output(&quot;dequeued: &quot; + c);
       qFull = false;
       qEmpty = (front == rear);
     }
   }
   public void display()
   {
     output(&quot;front&quot;);
     output(&quot;=====&quot;);
     for(int p = front; p != rear; p = (p + 1) % SIZE)
     {
       output(p + &quot;:&gt; &quot; + queue[p]);
     }
     output(&quot;=====&quot;);
   }
   // Main method for class queue
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     new Queue();
   }
//============================================================
// Below are the IBIO simple input and output methods

Exercises

Write self-contained Queue Class that can enque and dequeue Strings or other Objects of your own choosing.

The Class should implement Exception handling so that EmptyQueue, FullQueue and other custom exceptions can be thrown.

Additional methods mught be getFront, getRear to examine, but not remove these items. A method to return the current size of the queue would also be useful.

==Dynamic data structures==
==Objects in problem solutions==
==Recursion==
Example (Java):

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
public static int factorial(int num) {
    int ans;
    if(num !== 1) {
        ans = factorial(num-1) * num;
    }
    return ans;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a simple code to represent the value of factorial.

==Algorithm Evaluation==
===Efficiency of Algorithms===
To optimize algorithms, one must first know whether a certain algorithm is better or worse than another one. In this case, better can mean that the algorithm processes data faster or that less RAM is used. To measure data processing speed, one can use Big O notation.

Big O notation is always in the form of O(expression). The expression inside the parentheses is different for different efficiencies. It almost always contains &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the number of items of data to be processed. The Big O notation of a linear search on an array (of size n) is O(&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;). This means that doubling the array size will, on average, double the time for the linear search to complete.

Big O notation does not, however, indicate exactly how efficient an algorithm is. It only indicates how much the time spent increases when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is very large and is increased. For instance, if a certain algorithm takes &lt;math&gt;0.5n + 2&lt;/math&gt; milliseconds for each item of data, it will still have a Big O notation of O(&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;). This is because when n gets to, say, one trillion, the added 2 will have almost no effect, so it is discarded. In the same way, all coefficients of n are discarded.

Other examples of Big O notation include O(&lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;) for bubble and selection sort and O(&lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt;) for binary search. Note that binary search’s Big O notation is &lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\log_2 n&lt;/math&gt;, because logarithms of different bases increase in approximately the same way when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is large.</text>

=Further System Fundamentals=
==Processor configuration==

===Instruction Register===
An '''Instruction Register''' is the part of a CPUs control unit (as seen below) that stores an instruction. The bits of the instruction register are decoded by a microprogram that controls the computer.

===Accumulator===
An '''Accumulator''' is a register within the ALU (as seen below). It temporarily stores the data from an arithmetical or logical operation, and then writes it to main memory or to another, non-accumulator CPU register (depending on what it is told to do).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Irvine |first= Kip R. |title= Assembly Language for Intel-Based Computers |year= 2007 |edition= 5th edition |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |id=ISBN 0-13-238310-1 |pages=pp. 633, 622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Program Counter===
A '''Program Counter''' is a register located in the CPU (as seen below). It is used to hold the address of the next instruction to be fetched from the immediate access memory for execution by the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Hutchinson Encyclopaedia |publisher=Helicon Publishing LTD 2008.}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Magnetic Disk Storage==

The most common physical device for storing files is the '''magnetic disk'''. A magnetic disk has one or more ''platters'' in the form of disks, covered with magnetic media. ''Hard disk'' platters are made of rigid metal, while ''floppy disks'' are made of more flexible plastic. Each platter on the magnetic disk has two working ''surfaces''. Older hard disk drives would sometimes not use the very top or bottom surface of a stack of platters because they were more likely to be damaged.

The surface of a platter is organized as a number of round rings, called ''tracks''. The group of tracks immediately above one another (as seen in the diagram below) is called a cylinder. 

Furthermore, each track is divided into ''sectors''. The information held in one sector, a ''block'', is the unit of transfer between the disk and primary memory (normally 4K bytes or so). The operating system determines where the blocks for each file are placed.

The data on a magnetic disk is read by read-write ''heads''. The standard configuration (as seen below) uses one head per surface, each on a separate ''arm'', and controlled by a common ''arm assembly'' which moves all heads simultaneously from one cylinder to another.

The rate at which data can be transferred from the disk to the computer is composed of 3 different steps:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#F0F0F0&quot; |Seek time
| The time to move the heads to the right track.
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#F0F0F0&quot; |Latency (rotational delay)
| The time waiting for the sector to come round to the head.
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#F0F0F0&quot; |Block transfer time
| Time it takes to actually transfer the data.
|}


All these times are of the order of tens of milliseconds. The seek time and latency time vary, depending on where the required block is relative to the current position of the heads. It's useful to put all the blocks of a file on one track, to minimize seek times and latencies in accessing the file. Likewise, for a larger file, it's a good idea to have it all on the same cylinder (a set of corresponding tracks on different platters). There are many other placement tricks (such as placing heavily used files on the middle tracks so that the average seek time is reduced). However, since files are of varying sizes, and can change size dynamically, it's not usually possible to place the blocks optimally. &lt;ref name=&quot;Magnetic disk storage&quot;&gt;Magnetic disk storage[http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handshaking===
The definition of handshaking is described as when one computer is establishing a connection between the other computer or any other device that wants to connect to the computer. The handshake can be brought down into steps such as it will verify the connection, the speed and the authorization of the computer that it is trying to connect to. Example: When a modem connects to another modem, the dialling is the handshake between them. Modem handshakes can be muted by going to the control panel. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Handshaking.&quot; &lt;http://www.mrhope.com/jargon/h/handshak.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Handshaking.&quot; &lt;http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/Windows/HTML/IOa3.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Port===
The port connection is commonly found behind the back of the computer it usually resembles a plug-in. Hardware ports allows it to access to external devices. Such as USB, printers, mouse. 

When referring to the internet or the network, a network port is a location where the information is sent. A more commonly used port is the http which is port 80. Which is commonly known as the Virtual Port.

A common way to manage a transfer is to provide a status in bits, which will be sent to a secondary input port. An example would be, a one in a single bit can tell the CPU that the printer is ready to take in more data. If a zero appears it would tell the CPU that the printer is busy therefore the CPU should not send any new data just yet. Another example would be if one bit in a different port could tell the CPU that a keystroke is hit and it is available at the data port. If the zero is shown it means that there was no keyboard stroke. 

[[Image:Portprinter.gif]]  ''An image of a printer port''

===Virtual Port===
A virtual port is an emulation of the serial port. The port can be created by a software which will enable extra ports in the system. A virtual port can be given any name (COM1337, VSP11, etc). There can be an unlimited number of virtual ports in your PC. The more ports the less computer performance it has. 

Virtual ports copy all hardware serial port functionality, including Baud rate, Data bits, Parity bits, Stop bits, etc. They control the data flow, copying all signal lines (DTR/DSR/CTS/RTS/DCD/RI) and customizing pinout. A common virtual port is Bluetooth.  A virtual port can be useful if there are less physical ports on the computer. Another use of a virtual port is to communicate with other serial devices via the internet or LAN and act as if they were connected together. Such examples can be found in applications such as Hamachi and Garena.

===Buffer===
A buffer is a part of the memory used to hold temporarily data while it is moved from one place to another. The data is stored in a buffer which will then be received from an input device such as a keyboard to an output device such as a printer. When a data is moving between processes in a computer a buffer is also used. This can be related to buffers in telecommunication. Buffers can be found in a hardware or software but it is mostly implemented in software. If the data that is being transferred has a different rate at which it is received and processed, then the buffers are typically used in a scenario such as this.  Buffers are in a combination with the I/O to hardware, such examples are the disk drives, sending and receiving data from one place to another, or playing sound on a speaker.

====Buffer and the Cache====
Some cache acts like a buffer. But it is not exactly the same, a cache operates on the premise that the same datum (plural for data) will be read from multiple times. The purpose of a cache is to reduce accesses to slower storage. A Cache is an abstraction layer meaning that it is a way of hiding the details of a particular set of functionality. Such as the OSI 7 Layer Model.

===Data Transfer===

Computers always need to transfer data with other external devices (Input/Output devices). There are two different ways for transferring the data between computer memory and external devices:

====PIO====

''PIO'' ('''P'''rogrammed '''I'''/'''O''') is a method in which processor keeps on reading or writing on a memory unit (8-bits, 16-bits or 32-bits, depending on the device interface) until the data transferring is completed. Obviously this method consumes a large amount of processor cycles.
There are several different speeds of PIO, knows as programmed I/O modes, or more commonly, PIO modes. Table below shows five different PIO modes:

! bgcolor=&quot;#F0F0F0&quot; |Mode 5
| 120
| 16.7
| ATA-2
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
PIO was the only method for transferring the data between devices and IDE/ATA hard disks through the mid 90s.
Three lower-speed modes (Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 3) were defined as part of the original ATA standards document; two more (Mode 4, Mode 5) were added as part of ATA-2 (as well as part of several unofficial standards.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Programmed I/O (PIO) Modes&quot;&gt;PIO[http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/modes_PIO.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Direct Access Memory====

''DAM'' ('''D'''irect '''A'''ccess '''M'''emory) is a capability that allows the data on an external attached device (such as a Disk Drive) to be sent directly to the computer's memory on the motherboard. In DMA method the system issues an I/O command to the device, initiate a DMA transaction and then place the process in a waiting queue and the processor will be free afterwards to do other transmissions or execute codes. The DMA controller will inform the system when its current operation has been completed by issuing an interrupt signal. Although the data is still transferred 1 memory unit at a time from the device, the transfer to main memory now circumvents the CPU because the DMA controller can directly access the memory unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;The 8237 DMA Controller&quot;&gt;The 8237 DMA Controller[http://www.cs.sun.ac.za/~lraitt/doc_8237.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px; padding: 0.2em&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;Let's go more in depth!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As it was mentioned in DMA method the processor is not involved during the whole transmission; but it only initiates the transmission and after that the data can be transferred directly from or to the main memory. But how do the CPU do that?&lt;br&gt;
To initiate a transmission the processor should load three different values into three different registers in the DMA controller. These values are:&lt;br&gt;
     1- identity of the source device&lt;br&gt;
     2- the location in memory where the data transfer begins&lt;br&gt;
     3- the number of bytes to be transferred&lt;br&gt;
The DMA controller then collaborates with the IO unit using the control lines on the bus to perform the handshaking protocol for managing the data transfer. When the transfer is complete, the DMA notifies the CPU via an interrupt. With the DMA, data does not pass through the CPU registers, but directly along the bus from source to destination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Computer Architecture&quot;&gt;DMA – Direct Memory Access[http://www.academic.marist.edu/~jzbv/architecture/CMSC%20415.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Direct Access Memory====
Direct memory access also known as DMA is a feature of modern computers. Within certain computers the hardware subsystems has its access system memory which is used for reading and/or writing independently of the central processing unit(CPU). Many systems use DMA, such example could include disk drive controllers, graphics cards, network cards, and sound cards. Computers that have DMA can transfer data from devices with less CPU overhead than computers without a DMA channel. 

Without the DMA the CPU would be fully occupied for the entire duration of the read and write operation and it would not be able to do any other work. The DMA can start transfer, operate programs, and receive and interrupt from the DMA controller. Which can be useful to real-time computing.

&lt;big&gt;Vote!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Can you please vote and tell us which definition for &quot;Direct Access Memory&quot; is more clear to you? You can respond in the discussion section.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Polling and Interrupts==

One of the duties of the processor in the computers is to manage the devices and programs and since there are many devices connected to the processor and also so many programs (those are running on the OS) the processor needs to be able to figure out what should it do in each moment. Two different ways of doing this are ''Polling'' and using ''Interrupts''.

===Polling===

'''Polling''' is a method in which the processor checks every single device's current status in a loop and looking for data. When new data is available on one of devices it can then read the data and process the incoming bytes.&lt;br&gt;
However this method can work to manage the devices and programs, there are some big problems with it. First, the processor would always be busy with checking all the devices and programs instead of processing data and executing some useful codes. Second, in this method it is very likely that some of arriving bytes are lost when the rate of transfer data is too high.&lt;ref name=&quot;SunSite&quot;&gt;Sunsite  [http://web.archive.org/web/19990429091637/http://sunsite.nus.sg/LDP/LDP/tlk/node86.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interrupts===

An '''Interrupt''' is a signal from a device attached to the computer or a program that is sent to the OS (Operating System) and causes it to stop and figure out what to do next. Interrupts initiated by hardwares are called ''Hardware Interrupts'' while the interrupts that have been made by programs are called ''Software Interrupts'', ''traps'' or ''exceptions''. An average PC supports 16 hardware interrupts and 256 software interrupts. Each type of exception (Software Interrupt) is associated with a routine that takes control when an interrupt occurs. This routine is called ''Interrupt Handler''.&lt;br&gt;
An Actual interrupt that is sent to the processor is called an '''IRQ''' (Interrupt Request). Each IRQ is a binary code that differs from other interrupts and the processor uses these binary codes to distinct different interrupts. However these interrupts may be different for each device and processor but they usually follow a standard. The typical Hardware Interrupts have been shown in the table below&lt;ref name=&quot;Broadband&quot;&gt;BroadBand  [http://www.dslreports.com/faq/1585]&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;br&gt;

When one of the Input or Output devices sends an interrupt to the CPU, before the processor catches it, that IRQ goes through a chip called '''PIC''' (Programmable Interrupt Controller). The PIC selects an IRQ from the highest priority device to pass to the CPU and if the processor is ready to accept that IRQ, the PIC sends it to the CPU. The processor has a flag that illustrates whether or not it is ready to accept IRQs. If the CPU catches the request (because as it was mentioned it can also ignore a request) it temporary stops what it is currently doing and executes the proper code related to that request. When the ISR is completed, the CPU returns to the program it was executing and resumes its previous task.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interrupts&quot;&gt;Interrupt Control[http://www.xgc.com/manuals/m1750-ada/m1750/x1076.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Windows''&lt;br&gt;
In order to find the IRQs of your devices in windows, open the device manager (you can either right click on MyComputer -Or Computer
in Windows Vista- and then click on properties. Then Click on the Device manager. Or simply search for device  manager in your 
computer). Right click on any device and in the form that is opened go to the Resources tab and look at the binary code in fromt of
IRQ.&lt;br&gt;

| '''Comparison between polling and interrupt systems'''
|-
| As it was mentioned, in the polling systems the processor should check the status of all of the devices (and programs those are running on the OS) in a loop to see what should it do next; while in a system which uses interrupts, the processor does not need to keep checking all of the devices and programs, but every device sends a signal to the processor whenever it needs. Obviously in the first method the CPU is always busy with checking the devices and therefore it has less power to execute useful codes and process data. another disadvantage with this method is that a device or program which wants to interact with processor should wait until the processor finishes the loop and turn to that specific device or program. while in interrupt systems, the client sends a signal (i.e. a byte) and informs the processor. as the result the speed of communication between clients and the processor will speed up in the systems those are using interrupts.

===Serial and Parallel Transmission===
Data are transmitted through a communications medium, they are either sent in serial or in parallel transmission. Most of the owners of microcomputers know that their computers are equipped with serial and parallel ports. In which it will enable the computer to transmit both serial and parallel signals. 

In both of the series, the bytes that are sent are sent along a medium. For example if it would send “SYAMIL”, it would sent the “S” first, then “Y” then “A” and so on this goes for serial. As for parallel transmission, they are sent separately, the parallel paths correspond to each bit of a byte so that all of the bits would arrive simultaneously. 

Since parallel is more efficient then serial, it would need more wiring and extra bit paths, besides that it is more expensive then serial. Devices that are located near each other usually will use a serial transmission. For example, a parallel transmission computer would send a word document to a printer that it is connected to. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Serial and Parallel Transmission.&quot; &lt;http://www.blurtit.com/q511025.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of equipment are used in a kitchen. One of the Wikibooks Cookbook's goals is to have an article on each, including uses, alternative equipment if you don't have the exact item, and a buying guide. The various equipment modules can be reached from the following organization pages. Pots and pans hold food, generally for cooking on a firepit. Dark gummy burned-on oil can be removed with acetone, widely available from hardware stores and in diluted form as nail polish remover.

Food is not urgently needed in survival situations, since a human can survive for several weeks without it. However, much like dehydration, hunger can bring about many consequences long before it causes death, such as:
&lt;ul style=&quot;margin-left:200px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irritability and low morale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of mental clarity, such as confusion, disorientation, or poor judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakened immune system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficulty maintaining body temperature (see heat exhaustion and hypothermia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It is actually rather easy to find food in most wild environments, provided one knows where to look. A basic knowledge of animal trapping, hunting, and fishing will provide meat. Equally important is a knowledge of edible plants, fungi, and lichens. One cannot always rely on the most abundant or most easily accessible type of food. To survive for long periods of time, one must maintain a balanced diet. In order to do this, one must consume a balanced variety of foods.

Finding food in the wild depends on your environment (i.e. vegetation, animals, and water sources). Many survival books promote the &quot;Universal Edibility Test&quot;: allegedly, one can distinguish edible foods from toxic ones by a series of progressive exposures to skin and mouth prior to ingestion with waiting periods and checks for symptoms. However, many other experts including Ray Mears and John Kallas reject this method, in main part because a very small amount of some &quot;potential foods&quot; can cause anything from gastric distress to illness or death. An additional step called the &quot;scratch test&quot; is sometimes included. In this step (before mouth contact of the proposed food) one makes an abrasion on the surface of an area of skin (such as with fingernails) and then lightly rubs some of the food product on the abrasion. Foods that cause surface inflammation, discomfort, itching or eruption should be avoided.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A human can survive a maximum of three days without the intake of water, assuming you are at sea level, at room temperature, and a relative humidity. When camping in an area that does have running water, make sure that it is OK for drinking. If you see a sign that says &quot;Non-potable Water,&quot; that means that it is NOT OK to drink. Rather, non-potable water is only suitable for flushing toilets and washing hands.

When camping in an area that does not have running water and toilets, you must either bring water with you, or bring along the means for purifying water you collect when you arrive. Do not assume that because a stream or lake looks clean that it is OK to drink. In general, it is not, and drinking it without treating it carries a high risk of causing diarrhea or vomiting. Do not brush your teeth, cook with, or drink non-potable water without purifying it first.

In colder temperatures and/or with rain or snow the length or likelihood of survival would be greatly reduced. In addition to the aforementioned priorities, length of survival also depends on amount of physical exertion. A typical person will lose 2-3 liters of water per day in ordinary conditions, but more in hot, dry, or cold weather.

A lack of water causes dehydration, resulting in lethargy, headaches, dizziness, confusion, and eventually death. Even mild dehydration reduces endurance and impairs concentration, which is dangerous in a survival situation where clear thinking is essential. Your body requires 4L to 6L of water or other liquids each day in the wilderness to avoid dehydration and to keep your body functioning properly.

Dark yellow or brown urine indicates dehydration. Because of these risks, a safe supply of drinking water must be located as soon as a shelter is built (or even before, depending on conditions).

==Acquiring water==
Water can be gathered in numerous ways: scooped out of a creek or pond; rainwater can be caught in makeshift containers; collect dew from vegetation in clothing articles. Many tree roots and vines contain water, however water from poisonous vegetation can be lethal. Nonpoisonous cactus is also a source of water, confirming the myth- pulp can be removed from the broken stem.

In a survival situation, any water supply may be contaminated with pollutants or pathogens (see Potability of backcountry water). Although little can be done to remove molecular contaminants, particles and microorganisms can be removed and/or killed (see Portable water purification). In a beach situation, digging in the sand below sea level, the sand well will fill with drinkable water; it may taste salty or brackish, but the sand acts as a filter reducing the salt content the further you dig inland. Stagnant water can be made drinkable by filtration through a sieve of charcoal.

Animal blood is not suitable for rehydration as it may be diseased. In addition, because of the nutrients it contains, it requires energy to digest. Mammals all have blood-borne pathogens so the animal must also be cooked. Urine contains salt and other toxins, which also makes it unsuitable to drink, although it can be refined in a solar still.

Many birds, mammals, and some insects, such as bees, ants, and mason flies, are reliable indications of water, either through a stream or a soaked patch of earth.

The U.S. Army survival manual recommends that you use your water whenever thirsty to avoid &quot;voluntary&quot; dehydration. Other groups recommend rationing water through &quot;water discipline&quot;.

While finding water is most important, preventing water loss is also an issue. Resting, avoiding smoking, and breathing through the nose are recommended.

A shelter will protect one from potentially disastrous weather, help prevent hypothermia, and allow restful sleep. It will also boost how you feel emotionally, as it will become a base or home. Therefore, in typical survival situations, a shelter should be able to be moved with you, if possible, and be set up quickly. If one spends too much time on a shelter it takes away from other survival tasks.

Immovable rocks, animal nests, and other obstacles and hazards should be avoided. 

Dry watercourses may be flat, sandy, and comfortable to sleep on, but they will flood in a storm. 

Sunlight provides warmth (which is not always welcome), and can help one to wake up in the morning. However, sunny, open areas are vulnerable to wind which causes convection of one's body heat. 

Heat transfer: an excessively large or well-ventilated shelter will not retain warmth well. 

Flashing (weatherproofing) to provide protection from elements. 
A cave can provide a very useful shelter because it can provide protection from wind, rain and snow and maintains a constant internal temperature. Unfortunately, caves can present additional problems such as ground water, dampness, disease, and wildlife. Histoplasmosis, Blastomycosis, and Coccidiomycosis are several fungi found in caves that can infect the eyes and lungs of cavers. If bird or bat droppings are prevalent, you may want to find a different survival shelter to avoid these fungi. Bats often roost in caves and through their bite they can transmit rabies and other terminal illnesses. Bears also make dens in caves, so before you settle down in one, you should check it thoroughly for signs of inhabitance. 

The simplest and most mobile shelter is a tarp, supported by make-shift frame work or rope. Large leaves, such as ferns or fir branches, can be added to a latticework of branches. Ferns on a shelter provide insect repellent. Branches propped against a fallen tree make a simple and effective refuge, but animals such as ants and snakes may nest under the tree.

A more advanced shelter is known as a debris shelter, which can be constructed without modern tools or implements. It consists of a central ridge pole supported by two forked poles. This ridge pole supports a lattice of branches, which is then finished by leaves or other insulating material.

== Step One: prepare for something small. ==
{{TOC right}}
Survivability depends on what you know, how fit you are and available tools and resources. Fitness is the most important factor, if you are fit you can cope with mistakes and exert more effort to gather resources. The next important trait is having useful knowledge, this prevents making mistakes, reduces wasted energy and helps to keep moral up. It also serve to increase the chances of surviving without tools or resources. If you know how to improvise your own tools and locate water and food you have not only gained time but increased your value to others and you will have an advantage over any competition (including wildlife).

By having tools and resources you will be less dependent on others, reduce your movements/efforts and have something to bargain with if need arises, even for your life. Depending on the situation this can makes you also a bigger and slow target, especially if because of them you became static, for example not leaving your house amidst a flood or an epidemy because of excessive reliance/dependency on what you have stored. Balance is of the essence. 

=== Knowledge ===
Be aware and informed. What could be an usual emergency? Some emergencies are indeed expected to occur. It might be a flood, a hurricane, a tornado, or an earthquake. All this things have a distinct and knowable risk factor, even if unpredictable, some events are dependent on specific geographic location. Do you live near a river bed ? A atomic power plant ?

Knowing your surroundings and local risk factors will always help you be prepared and safer and should be also a factor for you daily decisions. Be aware of emergency plans for the area where you live, work or visit and learn the general actions that increase survivability in expected emergencies, like how to act in an earthquake or a tsunami.

Know your blood type, allergies, the basics of first aid, [[Knots|use knots]], learn how to swim and fish, to handle firearms and bows, to [[Automobile Repair|repair a car]] and drive it, ride a horse and bicycle. Get some camping experience, learn how to tie different utilitarian knots, create fire (especially using only wood), to meditate (or even [[w:Hypnosis|hypnosis]]). This are all tools that will increase your survivability and you do not need to physically carry with you.

=== Experience ===
There is no better thing that first person experience, this is the best way to not only learn but understand your limits and find new ways to solve unexpected problems. It will help everyone survive dangerous situations (such as storms or earthquakes), or in dangerous places (such as the desert, the mountains, and the jungle). Useful skills like lighting a fire, finding shelter, making water safe to drink, finding and identifying food, treating injuries, and climbing, swimming, and using specific or makeshift tools.

The more experience one has the more self confidence and keeping the moral up it is. In order to overcome the effects difficulty it is important to study and understand how stress may affect your action in both good and bad ways.

==== Backpacking ====
Having an understanding about your priorities, the needed supplies to address your requirements is extremely useful. Management of resources and deciding how and what to carry is a science in itself. There is a large quantity of books that deals exclusively with this subject directed to specific target audiences, in special to the habitual traveler but also for the wildlife experience. How and what to pack is a learning process that improves with experience.

Backpackers use lightweight equipment that can be carried long distances on foot, this may include a tent or shelter. Enabling a person to hike across the land, camping at remote spots. Backpacking equipment typically costs more that other type of equipment because of the materials used (resistance and weight) and the necessity of self reliability (like including their own power-supply).

==== Camping ====
Camping and other outdoor recreational activities are great to build self reliance and confidence. It can even provide the experience of being away from civilization. Camping may involve the use of a tent, a primitive structure, or no shelter at all.

Canoe camping is similar to backpacking, but uses canoes for transportation; much more weight and bulk can be carried in a canoe or kayak than in a backpack. Canoe camping is common in North America.

Anther form is the bicycle touring that combines camping with cycling. Where a bicycle is used to carry the gear and as the primary means of transportation, allowing greater distances to be covered than backpacking although less capacity for storage.

Motorcycle camping is more comparable to bicycle camping than car camping, due to the limited storage capacity of the motorbike. Motorcycle camping riders, as well as bicycle touring riders, often use some of the same equipment as backpackers, due to the lighter weights and compact dimensions associated with backpacking equipment.

&quot;Winter Camping&quot; refers to the experience of camping outside when there is sufficient snow on the ground. Some campers enjoy the challenge this form of recreation brings.

Wild Camping too, is a growing choice by people seeking the challenge of camping in the wilderness, without campsite amenities. It is a great way of enjoying the solitude and beauty of the wilderness in its most pure form. It falls into the survivalist experience.

==== Survivalists ====
Survivalist can be defined as experience campers that have learned the skills needed to survive out-of-doors in a situation of scarcity. It require skills in obtaining food from the wild, emergency medical treatments, orienteering, and pioneering.  Skills used on a more permanent basis, or as a component of daily life are referred to as bushcraft.

Campers and outdoors people have adapted their forms of camping and survival to suit extremely cold nights and limited mobility or evacuation. Methods of survival when winter camping include building snow shelters (quinzhees), dressing in &quot;layers,&quot; staying dry, using low-temperature sleeping bags, and fueling the body with appropriate food.

Practicers of this type of wilderness challenge face a different range of dangers. An environment may be dry, wet, hot, cold, high altitude, low altitude, desert, rural, urban, wilderness, subterranean, or an island. There are four basic necessities of life which apply in all of these cases: shelter, water, fire, and food. A fifth is oxygen for high altitudes and subterranean environments, and also specific survival situations such as drowning and landslide/avalanche.

Developments in outdoor equipment and pruning of survival techniques have skewed the scale towards man- if one is prepared, but there is nothing to replace experience in a survival situation.

===== Bushcraft =====
Bushcraft is a long-term extension of survival skills. A popular term for wilderness skills in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the term was popularized in the northern hemisphere by Mors Kochanski and recently gained considerable currency in the United Kingdom due to the popularity of Ray Mears and his bushcraft and survival television programs.

Bushcraft is about surviving and thriving in the natural environment, and the acquisition of skills and knowledge to do so. Bushcraft includes all of the survivalist's skills but also includes more complex knowledge; firecraft, tracking, hunting, shelter building, the use of tools such as knives and axes, foraging, hand-carving wood, container construction from natural materials, rope and twine-making, and many others.

=== Fitness ===
{{TODO|Complete}}

=== Things you should carry with you at any time ===
Strive to at all times carry simple items that in a SHTF situation may make you life easier.

One type of object that should normally be carried is small or dividable item of tradable value. For instance a bracelet or necklace of gold or silver can be easily hidden and designed so links can be loosen to permit smaller trades in case of need or be used as bait for fishing. Depending on the situation most other other items you carry can be used for trade, like a watch or even your shoes.

A good resistant belt, preferably longer than required. The belt buckler can also be a good tool beyond its primary function. Note that a belt can be a rapid way to create a tourniquet, to increase your reach or even to use as support in a zip line.

A time keeper, pressure resistant, non digital wrist-watch (or even better a chain-watch), that does not depend on batteries will be extremely helpfully and as seen above be an easily tradable item, it can also serve as a compass with the help of the sun, and will permit you to keep to a time table so to improve survivability.

For instance in a forest you may not be able to see the sun and in a survival situation you should keep night movement to a minimum, depending on the available light (moon, possibility to make and the duration of a torch) and expertize in night navigation, even in a desert environment where nights will be cooler, and movement easy, it may not be advisable. It may also help avoid the hours of the day that temperatures are higher.

A small and reliable knife, is extremely useful in any situation even in for day-to-day life, for instance in your key-chain. Not only useful as cutting tool or a possible weapon, the metal of the knife may also serve to create fire and serve as a crude mirror for signaling.

=== Things to plan at home ===
Your home should be your base in an emergency. Ownership of the property should be a priority so you have full legal control over it and in dire circumstances no one will be able to claim if from you.

Select a property that is not in a flood basin or too near a river (or any water course), if it is, check historic records for the area and see if you can build it (or if it already is) well above the flood line. Having at least one inflatable boat will also be optimal. Note that this type of location it will prevent you to rely on a well for fresh water since there is a high degree of contaminants that can already be present of the the natural water system or will be carried by any flood, as also make any food planting very susceptible to damage. Near the coast line you will have aggravated problems due to humidity and the presence of salt.

In a location with a high probability of heavy snow, at least one of the doors should open inward and preferably be in the 2-split format, this will prevent you becoming snowed in. Same is valid in areas prone to dense sandstorms. 

Assume 2-3 days without power and plan for that. This implies having three days of food that does not need cooking or refrigeration. Keep extra water put aside, flashlights, radio.

== Step Two: supplies add more ==
Planing for supplies is extremely important and constitutes an economical investment. Any item should be considered on the basis of its longevity, hardiness and usefulness.

Human survival priorities are found in the &quot;Rule of Three&quot;:
* Humans cannot survive more than three minutes without air (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 
* Humans cannot survive more than three hours exposed to extreme low temperature 
* Humans cannot survive more than three days without water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)
* Humans cannot survive more than three weeks without food

{{NOTE|The Rule of Three should be viewed as generalization. The record is 10 minutes, 17 seconds without air; the crew of a boat lasted 8 days without water; people have survived without food for over 40 days. In most survival situations, three priorities must be addressed before any other needs are met at the same time these same priorities may change depending upon environmental or situational factors.}}

There are also optimal times and locations to get your provisions for that special emergency or specialized material, consider that prices fluctuate with seasons for instance in the end of summer and winter season you can get good prices in sporting goods for the season that is ending.

{{:When It Hits the Fan/Generalities/Supplies}}

== Step Three: protection ==
Now you have something worth defend, something that others less prepared my be willing to fight you for. Huddling in the your &quot;cave&quot; fearing the unknown is an unsettling feeling. How does one combat this? Depending on your frame of mind, this is either the most frightening or most exciting part of preparedness steps, you will, in most events be dealing with the most dangerous animal on Earth, man.

In most locations and if not when involved in a catastrophic situations one may rely in the Police (or other state forces) since the event will not be  disruptive enough to make it impractical or place your personal security at a low priority, making you dire situation not particularly relevant in the general context of things.

Protection is a defensive stance, the tool-set may serve other purposes but consider this factor when you plan, since it is linked to what you have a need to protect. 

It is always best to be self reliant, by having a self sufficient strategy for active protection of your self, yours and your resources should be part of your survival strategy, this will help you fight off any intruder or scavenger be it human or beast.

{{:When It Hits the Fan/Generalities/Weapons}}

{{TODO|Focus in strategies especially archaic alarm systems.}}

{{BookCat}}

== Next... Reality Check ==
The most important factors for survival are shelter, water and food, by order of importance. In most situations if you are exposed you will be in danger from the involvement, be it hostile or not at the time you see yourself in dire straits. The sooner you find a safe place and establish the minimum to shelter you from the environment the better changes you will have.

The next priority is locating a water source, without water you will quickly become dehydrated and unable to function, water has also the property to reduce the sensation of hunger (especially if you can warm it).

The last step to become self sufficient is food. These are the three things that will have primal importance in any situation, being deprived of anyone of them will assuredly put your life in danger.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Systems Life Cycle==

===System Life Cycle Stages===

The systems life cycle can be broken down into five stages: Analysis, Design, Implementation, Operation, and Maintenance. 

#'''Analysis''' - The system analyst meets with the users to determine exactly what the user wants, and undertake feasibility studies (whether it is possible for the designers to meet the user's expectations).  
#'''Design''' - In this stage, the programmers design a solution to the user's problem. This can be the most time-consuming part of the cycle, since there are many choices that need to be made. A decision must be made on the types of software, hardware and on the algorithms that are going to be used.    
#'''Implementation''' - The construction (development) of the system; the system is developed based on the design laid out in the previous stage.
#'''Operation''' - Also known as installation, or system launch. The system can be installed as a direct changeover, as a phased introduction, or as a parallel running.
#'''Maintenance''' - Bugs and/or flaws might arise with time, thus, the system will need to be fixed and updated. However, fixing one bug may lead to another bug being created.

===Importance Of Collecting Data===
Gathering data is essential in the analysis stage because you can gain clear insight into the problem. If the problem cannot be identified correctly, a poor solution is guaranteed to follow.

===Methods Of Data Collection===

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|+ 
! Method !! Advantages !! Disadvantages
|-
! Interview 
| Detailed data, can change questions during process (not like questionnaire)
| Time-consuming, problems classifying/quantifying data
|-
! Questionnaire
| Can reach a lot of people, quickly (compared to interview/observation). Numerical analysis possible.
| Questions may be mis-interpreted. People may not respond at all or may do only some questions.
|-
! Document Search
| The data required for the system can be identified accurately.
| Documents may be lacking, out-of-date etc (interview could discover this).
|-
! Literature Search
| Can find descriptions/problems of previous implementations (saves work).
| Problem may not be described (or in detail). Again, working without experienced users.
|-
! Observation
| Observations are independent of user bias (unlike interview/questionnaire).
| Time consuming and observer can affect process: Hawthorne Effect.
|}

===Production of Requirement Specification===
A requirement specification contains what the system will be able to do and how it will be done. This should include:
*The costs of building, testing and running the system (including both hardware and software)
*Estimated time till completion
*List of hardware and software tools needed
*Description of hardware and software functions
*Performance of the system
*List of personnel and allocated tasks

===Feasibility Report===
A feasibility report can be produced during the analysis, design stage, or both. It should include:
*Cost
*Expected benefits
*Time period
*Potential difficulties

===Alternative Solutions===
There are a number of different ways a problem can be solved, with or without using a computer. One consideration you must take into account is the input and output of the solutions. The software itself could be one of three types:
*'''General Application Software''' - This is the least expensive solution but may not include all the features that the user requires. A typical example would be an office package.
*'''Specific Applications Packages''' - These are typically more expensive then general application software and provide a greater number of features. These programs tend to have been written specifically for business.
*'''Tailor Made Software''' - This is the most expensive option but can be customized to do exactly what the customer requires as it is written from scratch.

===Methods Of Testing Systems===
Systems usually go through several stages of testing. Alpha testing is the first stage in which asmall group of qualified individuals examine an early version of the program. Beta testing is when the program is fully featured an released to a wider audience for testing. 

Test data is also used to make sure the program outputs the expected data. We can test the program with:
*'''Normal Data''' - Data that is expected to be entered into the program. Including data at the limits of what is expected. 
*'''Extreme Data''' - This will be outside the normal limits of the program, simulating what happens if a user enters incorrect data by mistake.
*'''Abnormal Data''' - Data that is not expected, for example a string instead of an integer value.

===Methods Of Implementing New Systems===
A new system can be implemented in one of the following three ways:
*'''Parallel Running''' - This is when both new and old systems are run together. This confirms that they both produce the same outputs and if any faults occur they can be fixed with no up-time lost. Staff can be trained without fear of losing data, yet there may be twice as much work to do.
*'''Phased Introduction''' - Parts of the system are implemented at different times, each part is then tested and confirmed, this means it will take much longer to implement.
*'''Direct Changeover''' - Also known as a ''Big Bang'', the old system is immediately replaced by the new one. Users need to be trained before the new system is implemented and there is a risk that it will not work correctly.

===Importance Of Maintaining Systems===
Proper maintenance of a system is essential; clear documentation to begin with helps this progress as programmers will not need to work hard to understand design decision if they are explained in documentation. This reduces the cost of maintanence. Periodic reviews and performance reviews use the same data collection techniques as seen in the analysis sections and indicate whether further improvements or modifications are needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==System Analysis==
===Importance of Formulating A Problem Precisely===
In order to create a good solution it is vital to understand what the problem is, so that the solutions are all focused towards it. There might be team of specialists that work on the problem; and all of them must be fully concerned about the issue. Furthermore the user of the system often knows the matter perfectly and he must be interviewed so that he can provide a good description of his requirements. There is also an economic concern, since the cost of the system is directly proportional to the benefits it will provide, all this information should then be written in a feasibility report. Lastly the most important thing of all; a system must be tested continuously to see if  it satisfies all the requests, it is not possible to test a system without knowing what it was supposed to do.

===Aspects In A Considered Problem===

Various aspects are to be considered in finding a solution to a specific problem. This initial phase of analysis in systems can also be called ''fact finding''. The reasons for this analysis are for the purpose of determining what aspects of the problem can be solved by computer means, what solutions have been used in the past to solve a similar problem, or what the costs may be in generating a new solution. Additionally information can be found such as how much time it may take to install a new system, and the responsibilities given to various persons in the development team. 

All of the information that must be obtained, as described above, can be found through conducting interviews, or sending out questionnaires to employees in a company for example. The development team may also look up a history of the organization to see what information is available about the current system through existing documents. Research into other sources with different solutions to a similar problem and the observation of employees working under the existing system can also be investigated. Obviously, these methods of analysis are used at the development team's discretion, since they all have advantages and disadvantages (see topic 1.2.3 for more)

===Outcomes===
It is likely that after the analysis stage a number of possible solutions will be made. Therefore a decision will need to be made on which is the most suitable solution and whether it is worth making the change.

If the decision is to go ahead with the change a detailed plan must be produced, tasks must be allocated, and a feasibility report must be created.

===Parts That Can Be Solved Using A Computer===
Not all problems that can be solved with a computer are feasible or cost effective once both hardware and software constraints have been taken into account.

===Three Basic Control Aspects===
In general, the three basic control aspects of the system will be:
*Input
*Process
*Output

===Analysation By Modules===
Modular decomposition breaks down the problem into smaller components. We usually find the modules deal with inputs, processes and outputs.

===Parts Of A System===

The main parts of any computer system follow the input-process-output model of data flow:

[[File:Input Processes and Outputs.jpg]]

However, hardware also needs backing storage, as there is no permanent storage in the CPU:

[[File:Inputs Processes and Outputs for Hardware.jpg]]

Layers of software have also been implemented, so no direct contact with hardware is necessary:

[[File:Layers in computer systems.jpg]]

===Data in a System===

When data is in a system it is often shown in flow diagrams with the following symbols:

[[Image:DataFlow.jpg]]

===Data Capture and Output Presentation===

*Data Capture
**Manual Data Entry - Keyboard, mouse (Example: adding client records to a database)
**Direct Data Entry - OCR/OMR scanners, barcode scanner etc (Example: Lending a book or locating borrower details)
**Automatic Data Entry - Sensors (Example: automatic temperature control)

*Data Presentation
**Temporary Displays - VDU, LCD Display (Example: showing a price on a display)
**Permanent Display - Printer (Example: a receipt)
**Electrical/Mechanical Output - Actuator (Example: Sending credit card data from a bank to a cash machine)

===Design Data Structures===

===Hardware Components===

===Suitable Interface===
The major two user interfaces are command line interfaces (CLI) and graphical user interfaces (GUI).

CLI's are much easier to implement and use less memory, however there is a much greater learning curve, yet long-term users may find them quicker than other interfaces.

GUI's are much more complex to implement and use more memory, they also require a mouse. Yet, icons make it easier to remember commands and these are grouped in menus. There is a much smaller learning curve. GUI's can also be referred to as 'WIMP' (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Software Life Cycle==

===Major Stages===

You should outline the major stages in the software life cycle.
One model includes: system analysis, leading to a precise statement of the problem that needs solving (a requirements specification); software design; program construction, including testing and debugging; installation and operation; and maintenance.
Other models are acceptable, as long as they emphasize the cyclical nature of the life cycle.

===Cyclical nature of software production===
Computers systems are used over long periods of time. The software in these systems requires periodic improvement. After the original design and implementation, further analysis, redesign and restructuring are required to accommodate changing needs. This will continue through many cycles of analysis, design, implementation and use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Software Design==

===Data Required===

===Modularity===
Modularity is a concept that has applications in the contexts of computer science, particularly programming, as well as cognitive science in investigating the structure of mind. A module can be defined variously, but generally must be a component of a larger system, and operate within that system independently from the operations of the other components.

'''Modularity in Computer Science'''

Modularity is the property of computer programs that measures the extent to which they have been composed out of separate parts called modules. A modular approach to programming is gaining popularity in fields of artificial intelligence systems integration, where a large-scale general A.I. system is composed of modules that each serve a specific purpose and communicate with each other to produce the system's overall behavior.
Programs that have many direct interrelationships between any two random parts of the program code are less modular than programs where those relationships occur mainly at well-defined interfaces between modules.

===Prototyping===
Prototyping is the process of quickly putting together a working model (a prototype) in order to test various aspects of a design, illustrate ideas or features and gather early user feedback. Prototyping is often treated as an integral part of the system design process, where it is believed to reduce project risk and cost. Often one or more prototypes are made in a process of incremental development where each prototype is influenced by the performance of previous designs, in this way problems or deficiencies in design can be corrected. When the prototype is sufficiently refined and meets the functionality, robustness, manufacturability and other design goals, the product is ready for production.

''see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototyping prototyping] for a more detailed explaination''

===Prototyping Approach===

===End Users===

The end user is a popular concept in software engineering, referring to an abstraction of the group of persons who will ultimately operate a piece of software (i.e. the expected user or target-user).
This abstraction is meant to be useful in the process of designing the user interface, and is therefore built on a relevant subset of any user's characteristics which may include which computer interfaces he/she is comfortable with (having used them before or because of their inherent simplicity), his/her technical expertise and degree of knowledge in specific fields or disciplines, and any other information which is believed to be relevant in a specific project.
When little constraints are imposed on the end-user category, i.e. when writing/publishing programs for the general public, it is common practice to expect minimal technical expertise or previous training in the use of computer interfaces. This is also the general meaning associated with the term end user (see also Luser). In this context, intuitive GUIs (possibly with a touch interface) are usually preferred over more sophisticated command line interfaces for the sake of usability.

===Efficiency===

For Standard Level, only a qualitative treatment or a specific calculation of the efficiency is expected. &quot;O&quot; or BigO notation is required only at HL.

===Debugging===

Testing implies tracing sections of an algorithm, including responses to errors (&quot;dry runs&quot;), as well as the design of test cases, which are then executed. Students must be able to propose suitable test data, and give reasons. 
Debugging has the components of detecting, diagnosing and correcting errors shown up by testing.

===Tools Of Debugging===

Ideally, students should use an integrated development environment (IDE) combining an editor, interpreter or compiler and debugging tools, but this is not a requirement.

===Need Of Documentation===
It will be very important that the documentation supplied with the original system is clear and complete. This documentation will be used to make it easier to design modifications to the system.

===Features For Design===

===Features For User===

It is required to write end-user instructions according to the standards described in the guidelines for the program dossier. Still, other user manuals may be needed (for example, on-line help systems and installations manuals where systems are installed by personnel other than end-users).

'''[[Marchese]] Guglielmo Marconi''' [gu{{IPA|ʎ'ʎ}}e:lmo mar'ko:ni] ([[25 April]] [[1874]] - [[20 July]] [[1937]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] inventor, best known for his development of a [[radio]]telegraph system, which served as the foundation for the establishment of numerous affiliated companies worldwide. He shared the 1909 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]], &quot;in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nobelprize.org, &quot;''[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-bio.html Guglielmo Marconi: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1909]''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Marconi was an active [[Italian fascism|Italian Fascist]]&lt;ref&gt;Physicsworld.com, &quot;''[http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/14/12/7 Guglielmo Marconi: radio star]''&quot;, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[apologist]] for [[Fascism and ideology|their ideology]] (such as the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|attack by Italian forces in Ethiopia]]).

==Radio work==
During his early years, Marconi had an interest in science and [[electricity]]. One of the scientific developments during this era came from [[Heinrich Hertz]], who, beginning in 1888, demonstrated that one could produce and detect [[electromagnetic radiation]]&amp;mdash;now generally known as &quot;radio waves&quot;, at the time more commonly called &quot;Hertzian waves&quot; or &quot;aetheric waves&quot;. Hertz's death in 1894 brought published reviews of his earlier discoveries, and a renewed interest on the part of Marconi. He was permitted to briefly study the subject under [[Augusto Righi]], a [[University of Bologna]] physicist who had done research on Hertz's work.

===Early experimental devices===
Marconi began to conduct experiments, building much of his own equipment in the attic of his home at the Villa Griffone in [[Pontecchio]], Italy. His goal was to use radio waves to create a practical system of &quot;[[wireless telegraphy]]&quot;&amp;mdash;i.e. the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the [[electric telegraph]]. This was not a new idea&amp;mdash;numerous investigators had been exploring wireless telegraph technologies for over 50 years, but none had proven commercially successful. Marconi ''did not'' discover any new and revolutionary principle in his wireless-telegraph system, but rather he assembled and improved an array of facts, unified and adapted them to his system.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, H. S., &amp; Williams, E. H. (1910). ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=06W82x_i0PiNVhgY4to&amp;id=ti8KAAAAIAAJ Every-day science]''. New York: Goodhue Company. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Marconi's system had the following components:&lt;ref&gt;Marconi delineated his 1895 apparatus in his Nobel Award speech. See: Marconi, &quot;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-lecture.html Wireless Telegraphic Communication: Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1909.]&quot; Nobel Lectures. Physics 1901-1921. Amsterdam: Elsevier Publishing Company, 1967: 196-222. Page 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A relatively simple [[oscillator]], or [[spark-gap transmitter|spark producing]] radio transmitter, which was closely modeled after one designed by Righi, in turn similar to what Hertz had used;
* A wire or capacity area placed at a height above the ground; 
* A [[coherer]] receiver, which was a modification of [[Edouard Branly]]'s original device, with refinements to increase sensitivity and reliability;
* A [[telegraph key]] to operate the transmitter to send short and long pulses, corresponding to the dots-and-dashes of [[Morse code]]; and
* A telegraph register, activated by the coherer, which recorded the received Morse code dots and dashes onto a roll of paper tape.

Similar configurations using spark-gap transmitters plus coherer-receivers had been tried by others, but many were unable to achieve transmission ranges of more than a few hundred metres. This was not the case for all researchers in the field of the wireless arts, though. &lt;ref&gt;In the beginning of 1894, [[Nikola Tesla]] was transmitting to a distance of 50 miles from New York City to West Point. See the PBS website, &quot;[http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_whoradio.html Marconi and Tesla: Who invented radio?]&quot; (ed. this is noted as having been accomplished in Leland's book concerning Tesla's &quot;Work with Alternating Currents&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leland I. Anderson, Priority in the Invention of Radio — Tesla vs. Marconi, Antique Wireless Association monograph, 1980, examining the 1943 decision by the US Supreme Court holding the key Marconi patent invalid (9 pages). (21st Century Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, Marconi could only signal over limited distances. In the summer of 1895 he moved his experimentation outdoors. After increasing the length of the transmitter and receiver antennas, and arranging them vertically, and positioning the antenna so that it touched the ground, the range increased significantly.&lt;ref&gt; This fact was known to many as, in 1893, Tesla stated in the widely known   &quot;[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1893-02-24.htm On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena]&quot; speech which was delivered before the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, in February, and before the National Electric Light Association, St. Louis, in March, that &quot;''One of the terminals of the source would be connected to Earth'' [as a electric ground connection ...] ''the other to an insulated body of large surface''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; (Although Marconi may not have understood until later the reason, the &quot;ground connections&quot; allowed the earth to act as a [[waveguide]] [[resonator]] for the [[surface wave]] signal.&lt;ref&gt;Marconi did acknowledge this later in his Nobel Award speech. See: Marconi, &quot;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-lecture.html Wireless Telegraphic Communication: Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1909.]&quot; Nobel Lectures. Physics 1901-1921. Amsterdam: Elsevier Publishing Company, 1967: 196-222. Page 206.&lt;/ref&gt;) Soon he was able to transmit signals over a hill, a distance of approximately 1.5 kilometres (1 mile). By this point he concluded that with additional funding and research, a device could become capable of spanning greater distances and would prove valuable both commercially and militarily.

Finding limited interest in his work in Italy, in early 1896 at the age of 21, Marconi traveled to [[London]], [[England]], accompanied by his mother to seek support for his work. (Marconi spoke fluent English in addition to Italian.) While there, he gained the interest and support of [[William Preece]], the Chief Electrical Engineer of the British Post Office. The apparatus that Marconi possessed at that time was strikingly similar to that of one in 1882 by [[Amos Dolbear|A. E. Dolbear]], of [[Tufts College]], which used a spark coil generator and a [[Crystal detectors|carbon granular rectifier]] for reception.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Thomas Story, ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=0_BNls1ruTf5Rr6WD5&amp;id=qFMbsXGH8pYC The Story of Wireless Telegraphy]''. 1904. Page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John J. O'Neill, ''Prodigal Genius:The Life of Nikola Tesla''. Ives Washburn, New York, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; A series of demonstrations for the British government followed&amp;mdash;by March, 1897, Marconi had transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of about 6 kilometres (4 miles) across the [[Salisbury Plain]]. On [[13 May]] [[1897]], Marconi sent the first ever wireless communication over water. It transversed the [[Bristol Channel]] from [[Lavernock Point]] ([[South Wales]]) to [[Flat Holm]] Island, a distance of 14 kilometres (8.7 miles). The message read &quot;Are you ready&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;BBC Wales, &quot;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/historyhunters/locations/pages/3_1_flatholm.shtml Marconi's Waves]''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Impressed by these and other demonstrations, Preece introduced Marconi's ongoing work to the general public at two important London lectures: &quot;Telegraphy without Wires&quot;, at the [[Toynbee Hall]] on [[11 December]] [[1896]]; and &quot;Signalling through Space without Wires&quot;, given to the [[Royal Institute]] on [[4 June]] [[1897]].

Numerous additional demonstrations followed, and Marconi began to receive international attention. In July, 1897 he carried out a series of tests at [[La Spezia]] in his home country, for the Italian government. A test for Lloyds between [[Ballycastle]] and [[Rathlin Island]], [[Ireland]], was conducted on [[6 July]], [[1898]]. The [[English channel]] was crossed on [[27 March]] [[1899]], from [[Wimereux]], [[France]] to [[South Foreland Lighthouse]], England, and in the fall of 1899, the first demonstrations in the United States took place, with the reporting of the [[America's Cup]] international yacht races at New York. According to the ''Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute'' by the [[United States Naval Institute]], the Marconi instruments were tested around 1899 and the tests concerning his wireless system found that the &quot;[...] coherer, principle of which was discovered some twenty years ago, [was] the only electrical instrument or device contained in the apparatus that is at all new&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;United States Naval Institute, ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=0X69Ty10xaRE_L8yAr&amp;id=egEjvWjbCQgC Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute]''. The Institute, 1899. Page 857.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transatlantic transmissions===
[[Image:Marconi at newfoundland.jpg|center|thumb|555px|Marconi watching associates raise kite antenna at St. John's, December, 1901]]
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:115%&quot;&gt;{{rquote|right|See if you can hear anything, Mr. Kemp!&lt;ref&gt;Page, Walter Hines, and Arthur Wilson Page, The World's Work. Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, 1908. Page 9625&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;
Around the [[turn of the century]], Marconi began investigating the means to signal completely across the Atlantic, in order to compete with the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]]s. Marconi soon made the announcement that on [[12 December]] [[1901]], using a 152.4 m (500 foot) kite-supported antenna for reception, the message was received at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] (now part of [[Canada]]) signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at [[Poldhu]], [[Cornwall]]. The distance between the two points was about 3,500 kilometres (2,100 miles). Heralded as a great scientific advance, there was -- and continues to be -- some skepticism about this claim, partly because the signals had been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmission, consisting of the Morse code letter ''S'' sent repeatedly were difficult to discern from atmospheric noise. (A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/radio/radio_differences.html Fessenden and Marconi: Their Differing Technologies and Transatlantic Experiments During the First Decade of this Century]&lt;/ref&gt; The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;''[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/74/28992/01305565.pdf Marconi and the History of Radio]''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John S. Belrose, &quot;[http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/radio/radio_differences.html Fessenden and Marconi: Their Differing Technologies and Transatlantic Experiments During the First Decade of this Century]&quot;. International Conference on 100 Years of Radio -- 5-7 September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage operated at lower voltage and provided the energy for the second stage to spark at a higher voltage. [[Nikola Tesla]], a rival in transalantic transmission, stated after being told of Marconi's reported transmission that &quot;Marconi [... was] using seventeen of [[List of Tesla patents|my patents]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cheney, ''Tesla, Man Out of Time'', New Jersey : Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cheney and Robert Uth, ''Tesla: Master of Lightning'', Barnes&amp;Noble, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling challenged by [[Scientific skepticism|skeptics]], Marconi prepared a better organized and documented test. In February, 1902, the [http://www.purplesky.co.uk/sources/photos/00061.jpg SS ''Philadelphia''] sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced coherer-tape reception up to 2,496 kilometres (1,551 miles), and audio reception up to 3,378 kilometres (2,099 miles). Interestingly, the maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that for [[mediumwave]] and [[longwave]] transmissions, radio signals travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had only been received up to about 1,125 kilometres (700 miles), less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres, despite some scientists's  belief they were essentially limited to line-of-sight distances.

On [[17 December]] [[1902]], a transmission from the Marconi station in [[Glace Bay]], Nova Scotia, Canada, became the first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. On [[18 January]] [[1903]], a Marconi station built near [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts]] in 1901 sent a message of greetings from [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the President of the United States, to [[King Edward VII]] of the United Kingdom, marking the first transatlantic radio transmission originating in the United States. However, consistent transatlantic signalling was difficult to establish.

Marconi began to build high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea, in competition with other inventors. In 1904 a commercial service was established to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radiotelegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907 between [[Clifden]] Ireland and [[Glace Bay]], but even after this the company struggled for many years to provide reliable communication.

===''Titanic''===
The two radio operators aboard the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] were not employed by the [[White Star Line]] but by the Marconi International Marine Communication Company. Following the sinking of the ocean liner, survivors were rescued by the [[RMS Carpathia|''Carpathia'']]. When it docked in New York, Marconi went aboard with a reporter from the [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']].&lt;ref&gt;John P. Eaton &amp; Charles A. Haas ''Titanic - Triumph and Tragedy, A Chronicle in Words and Pictures''. 1994&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 1912, Marconi gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Titanic regarding the marine telegraphy's functions and the procedures for emergencies at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Inquiry ''Loss of the S.S. Titanic'' 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patent disputes===
:&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;''Main articles: [[invention of radio]] and [[history of radio]].&lt;/div&gt;

Marconi's work built upon the discoveries of numerous other scientists and experimenters. His original &quot;two-circuit&quot; equipment, consisting of a spark-gap transmitter plus a coherer-receiver, was similar to those used by other experimenters, and in particular to that employed by [[Oliver Lodge]] in a series of widely reported demonstrations in 1894. There were claims that Marconi was able to signal for greater distances than anyone else when using the spark-gap and coherer combination, but these have been disputed (notably by [[Tesla]]).&lt;ref&gt;

Marconi’s late-1895 transmission of signals was for around a mile. This was small compared to Tesla's early-1895 transmissions of up to 50 miles. For more see &quot;Nikola Tesla On His Work with Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power&quot;, Leland I. Anderson, Twenty First Century Books, 2002, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov]] stated to the Congress of Russian Electrical Engineers that: &quot;[...]'' the emission and reception of signals by Marconi by means of electric oscillations ''[was]'' nothing new. In America, the famous engineer [[Nikola Tesla]] carried the same experiments in 1893''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The Guglielmo Marconi Case;  [http://www.mercury.gr/tesla/marcen.html Who is the True Inventor of Radio]''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Fascist Party|Fascist regime]] in [[Italy]] credited Marconi with the first improvised arrangement in the development of radio.&lt;ref&gt; Gianni Isola, &quot;Italian radio: History and Historiography&quot;; Special Issue: ''Italian Media Since World War II''. ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'',  August, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; There was controversy whether his contribution was sufficient to deserve patent protection, or if his devices were too close to the original ones developed by Hertz, Popov, Branley, Tesla, and Lodge to be patentable.

While Marconi did pioneering demonstrations for the time, his equipment was  limited by being essentially untuned, which greatly restricted the number of ''spark-gap'' radio transmitters which could operate simultaneously in a geographical area without causing mutually disruptive interference. (Continuous-wave transmitters were naturally more selective and less prone to this deficiency). Marconi addressed this defect with a patent application for a much more sophisticated &quot;four-circuit&quot; design, which featured two tuned-circuits at both the transmitting and receiving antennas. This was issued as British patent number 7,777 on [[26 April]] [[1900]]. However, this patent came after significant earlier work had been done on electrical tuning by [[Nikola Tesla]]. (As a defensive move, in 1911 the Marconi Company purchased the Lodge-Muirhead Syndicate, whose primary asset was Oliver Lodge's 1897 tuning patent.) Thus, the &quot;four-sevens&quot; patent and its equivalents in other countries was the subject of numerous legal challenges, with rulings which varied by jurisdiction, from full validation of Marconi's tuning patent to complete nullification.

In 1943, a lawsuit regarding Marconi's numerous other radio patents was resolved in the United States. The court decision was based on the prior work conducted by others, including [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Oliver Lodge]], and [[John Stone Stone]], from which some of Marconi patents (such as {{US patent|763772}}) stemmed. The U. S. Supreme Court stated that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Tesla patent No. 645,576, applied for September 2, 1897 and allowed March 20, 1900, disclosed a four-circuit system, having two circuits each at transmitter and receiver, and recommended that all four circuits be tuned to the same frequency. [... He] recognized that his apparatus could, without change, be used for wireless communication, which is dependent upon the transmission of electrical energy.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Supreme Court, &quot;''[http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/popov/sentenza.html Marconi Wireless Telegraph co. of America v. United States]''&quot;. 320 U.S. 1. Nos. 369, 373. Argued April 9-12, 1943. Decided June 21, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In making their decision, the court noted, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Marconi's reputation as the man who first achieved successful radio transmission rests on his original patent, which became reissue No. 11,913, and which is not here [320 U.S. 1, 38] in question. That reputation, however well-deserved, does not entitle him to a patent for every later improvement which he claims in the radio field. Patent cases, like others, must be decided not by weighing the reputations of the litigants, but by careful study of the merits of their respective contentions and proofs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Wireless Telegraph co. of America v. United States''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The court also stated that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is well established that as between two inventors priority of invention will be awarded to the one who by satisfying proof can show that he first conceived of the invention''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Wireless Telegraph co. of America v. United States''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The case was resolved in the U.S. Supreme Court by overturning most of Marconi's patents. At the time, the [[United States Army]] was involved in a patent infringement lawsuit with Marconi's company regarding radio, leading observers to posit that the government nullified Marconi's other patents to render moot claims for compensation (as, it is speculated, the government's initial reversal to grant Marconi the patent right in order to nullify any claims Tesla had for compensation). In contrast to the United States system, Mr. Justice Parker of the British High Court of Justice upheld Marconi's &quot;four-sevens&quot; tuning patent. These proceedings made up only a part of a long series of legal struggles, as major corporations jostled for advantage in a new and important industry.

Over the years, the Marconi companies gained a reputation for being technically conservative, in particular by continuing to use inefficient spark-transmitter technology, which could only be used for radiotelegraph operations, long after it was apparent that the future of radio communication lay with [[continuous-wave]] transmissions, which were more efficient and could be used for audio transmissions. Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve). In 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter, the [[Chelmsford, England|Chelmsford]] Marconi factory was the location for the first entertainment radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s in the United Kingdom&amp;mdash;one of these featured Dame [[Nellie Melba]]. In 1922 regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the [[Marconi Research Centre]] at [[Writtle]].

{{rquote|right|His Excellency the Senator Marchese Guglielmo Marconi, president of the Royal Academy of Italy, Member of the Fascist Grand Council}}&lt;/div&gt; 
In 1914 Marconi was made a Senator in the [[Italian Senate]] and appointed Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in the UK. During [[World War I]], Italy joined the Allied side of the conflict, and Marconi was placed in charge of the Italian military's radio service. In 1924, he was made a ''[[marchese]]'' by King [[Victor Emmanuel III]]. 

Marconi joined the [[Italian fascism|Italian Fascist]] party in 1923. In 1930, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] appointed him President of the [[Accademia d'Italia]], which made Marconi a member of the [[Grand Council of Fascism|Fascist Grand Council]]. Marconi was a participant in rallies that fostered fascist beliefs and composed fascist propaganda. Marconi also made speeches as an apologist for the actions of the fascist regime in Italy. 

In 1935, Italian forces [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|occupied]] the African nation of [[Ethiopia]], resulting in near universal condemnation of Italy. Marconi made numerous radio speeches supporting the unprovoked attack, notorious enough that the BBC banned him from speaking on the subject. Marconi was pro-war in the era between the First and Second World War, and he was condemned for such beliefs by many.&lt;ref&gt;EPN, &quot;''[http://www.epn-online.com/page/20084/the-unseen-marconi-get-involved-.html The Unseen Marconi]''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marconi died in Rome in 1937 at age 63, and Italy held a state funeral for Marconi. As a tribute, all radio stations throughout the world observed two minutes of silence. His remains are housed in the Villa Griffone at [[Sasso Marconi]], [[Emilia-Romagna]], which assumed that name in his honour in 1938.

      <comment>/* Problem */ I have corrected &quot;he NASA team&quot; to &quot;the NASA team&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An engineer has to keep in mind that every device he or she creates will eventually fail.  Catastrophic failure should be avoided by all means since this could result in injury or even death. Some main causes of engineering failures are insufficient knowledge, underestimation of influence and ignorance or negligence.

In this chapter some examples of catastrophic failure are given. By studying these examples the engineer can learn how to avoid failure in his or her designs.

==Examples of engineering failures==

===&lt;u&gt;Patriot&lt;/u&gt;===

On February 25, 1991, during the Gulf War, an American Patriot Missile in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, failed to intercept an incoming Iraqi Scud missile[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot#Failure_at_Dhahran]. The result of this failure was the death of 28 US soldiers.

====Problem====

The cause of the problem is located in the computer responsible for the tracking calculations of the incoming Scud missile. This computer keeps time as an integer value in units of tenths of a second, and stores it in registers of 24 bits long. Afterwards, this value is multiplied by a fixed-point 24-bit representation of 0.1 to obtain a 48-bit floating-point value of time in seconds.

The failure is caused by the 24-bit representation of 0.1 in base 2. The base 2 representation of 0.1 is nonterminating: 0.0001100110011001100110011001100....  The 24 bit register in the Patriot stored instead 0.00011001100110011001100 introducing an error of 0.0000000000000000000000011001100... binary, or about 0.000000095 decimal. This means the accuracy of the time is reduced by 0.0001%.

However, the tracking of a missile doesn’t depend on the absolute clock-time, but rather on the time that elapsed between two different radar pulses. Since this time difference is very small, the error of 0.0001% is truly insignificant. This doesn’t explain the deviation of the Patriot missile, but there is a second problem.

The software used by the computer was written in assembly language 20 years ago. It was updated several times to cope with the high speed of ballistic missiles, for which the system was not originally designed. One of these updates contained a subroutine to convert clock-time more accurately into floating-point. However, the subroutine was not inserted at every point where it was needed. Hence, with a less accurate truncated time of one radar pulse being subtracted from a more accurate time of another radar pulse, the error no longer cancelled.

At the time the Scud missile arrived, the computer had been active 100 hours, so the calculated elapsed time had an error of 0.000000095×100×60×60×10=0.34 seconds. A Scud travels at about 1676 meters per second, and so travels more than half a kilometer in this error time. This was far enough for the incoming Scud to be outside the &quot;range gate&quot; of the Patriot.

====Solution====

The solution to this problem was already suggested before the accident. Increase the accuracy of the time representation, by the use of more bits. However, this solution avoids the problem from happening, but doesn’t solve it. If the computer is activated for years without rebooting, the same failure can still occur.

There is a better approach. Simply measure the relative time between the two radar pulses. The clock should always be reset at the first pulse and stopped at the second pulse. This avoids the subtraction of two almost identical big numbers, and its numerical problem.  

====Lesson====

* An algorithm where big numbers are subtracted from each other should be rewritten to avoid this loss of numerical accuracy.
* It’s important to analyze the number of bits used to represent physical parameters, i.e. time, in the design.
* The system designer needs very detailed specifications of all the components he uses.

===&lt;u&gt;Mars Pathfinder&lt;/u&gt;===

On July 4th 1997, [[w: Mars_Pathfinder |the Mars Pathfinder]] successfully set foot on the Martian surface. However, a few days after the start of its mission, the vehicle started losing information due to several system resets. The cause of this problem was located in the embedded systems kernel used in the Pathfinder.

====Problem====

The tasks of the spacecraft are executed as threads with priorities, reflecting the urgency of each task. There are 3 types of threads:

* high priority threads, i.e. the bus management task. 
* medium priority threads, i.e. the communications task.
* low priority threads, i.e. the meteorological data gathering task.

During execution of the bus management task, it will move data in and out of the information bus (the bus that connects all the components of the spacecraft). Access to this bus is synchronized with [[Embedded Control Systems_Design/Operating systems#Inter process communication | mutexes]]. The meteorological data gathering task uses the information bus to publish its data. When publishing, it acquires a mutex, writes to the bus, and releases the mutex. Using the mutexes guarantees that each bus thread waits until the previous one is finished.

Normally, the threads system with priorities and the bus management with mutexes works fine. However, a problem known as [[Embedded Control Systems_Design/Design Patterns#Problems of real time programming | priority inversion]] can occur. Assume that a medium priority communications task is scheduled while the high priority bus management task is blocked waiting for the low priority meteorological data thread. The communications task, having higher priority than the meteorological task, would prevent it from running, consequently preventing the blocked bus management task from running.  Since the communications task is a long-running task, a [[Embedded Control Systems_Design/Real Time Operating systems#Watchdog timers | watchdog timer]] will eventually go off, noticing that the data bus task had not been executed for some time. The watchdog task will conclude that something had gone wrong, and initiate a total system reset. This reset is comparable to a home computer reboot; it clears the registers so that the system can restart without errors.

====Solution====

There are several solutions available for this problem. One of these is called [[w: Priority_inheritance|priority inheritance]]. The meteorological thread will inherit the priority of the bus management task, causing it be scheduled with higher priority than the communications task.

Fortunately, VxWorks contains a C language interpreter intended to allow developers to type in C expressions and functions to be executed on the fly during system debugging. After uploading the right program to change the software of the spacecraft, the problem was solved.

It’s important to realize that priority inheritance is not the best solution to this problem. In complex systems, with dozens of bus tasks interacting, all the tasks will eventually obtain highest priority, and the problem remains. However, in case of the Pathfinder, it sufficed.

====Lesson====

* Coordinate tasks by the use of priorities is not the best approach. This indirect way gives the scheduler all responsibility. It’s better to include the coordination in the system itself [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Asynchronous_activities]. 
* It is important to provide support to intervene when unforeseen errors occur.  
** the watchdog: every ECS should contain a watchdog task, because a system block can never be excluded.
** debugging facilities in the field: without the ability to modify the system in the field, the problem could not have been corrected.
* It is not possible to test every situation completely. If timing (coordination) is important, the amount of bytes is important,…, debugging can always be necessary. 
* Good theory is important: the theoretical solution for this problem was presented in a paper many years ago.
* Correctness is important: the engineer's initial analysis that &quot;the data bus task executes very frequently and is time-critical -- we shouldn't spend the extra time in it to perform priority inheritance&quot; was wrong. It is precisely in such time critical and important situations where correctness is very important, even at some additional performance cost.


===&lt;u&gt;Ariane 5 Flight 501&lt;/u&gt;===

The[[w:Ariane_5_Flight_501| Ariane 5, Flight 501]], was launched on June 4, 1996 and was the first unsuccessful European test flight. Due to a malfunction in the control software, the rocket veered off its flight path 37 seconds after launch 
and was destroyed by its automated self-destruct system when high aerodynamic forces caused the core of the vehicle to disintegrate. It is one of the most infamous [[w:Computer_bug|computer bugs]] in history. What could be the reason behind the sudden change in flight path of the first flight of the Ariane 5? Certainly, reusing similar software code as in the previous [[w:Ariane_4| Ariane 4]] project without simulating was a big mistake.

====Problem====

An operand error occurred due to an unexpected high value of an internal alignment function result called BH, Horizontal Bias, related to the horizontal velocity sensed by the platform. This value is calculated as an indicator for alignment precision over time. The value of BH was much higher than expected because the early part of the trajectory of Ariane 5 differs from that of Ariane 4 and results in considerably higher horizontal velocity values. An internal software exception was caused during execution of a data conversion from [[w: Floating_point |64-bit floating point]] to [[w:16-bit|16-bit]] signed integer value. The floating point number which was converted had a value greater than what could be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. This resulted in the operand error, causing the on-board computer to send diagnostic data instead of real flight data. This diagnostic data commanded sudden nozzle deflections and induced a high [[w: Angle_of_attack |angle of attack]]. (for more detailed information, see [http://www.cs.unibo.it/~laneve/papers/ariane5rep.html Report paper Ariane5])

====Solution====

A simulation of the whole trajectory ([[w: Static_code_analysis |static code analysis]]) should have pointed out the overflow error immediately. This step should have been performed at the stage of architectural design or implementation (prototyping) within the design process. 

====Lesson====

This example illustrates the dramatic consequences of a data overflow software failure, whereby the onboard computer only received diagnostic information instead of realistic flight data. Although there was a back-up system of the failing part apparent in the Ariane5, failure could not be prevented because the backup system used the same software code. 
Some lessons came forward after the disaster with flight 501 happened: 

* Prepare a test facility including as much real equipment as technically feasible, inject realistic input data, and perform ''complete'' and closed-loop [[w: Software_testing |testing]] of the ''total'' system: Although a (software) subsystem worked perfectly on a previous embedded control system, it can still fail as a subsystem in a new embedded system, i.e.: Always question the ''reusability'' of a subsystem. In this case software failed on the Ariane5 whereas it worked very well on the previous [[w: Ariane_4 |Ariane4]] rocket! After the accident, a static code analysis painfully showed the overflow.
See the [[#Therac]]-25 for another failure due to reusing software.
* A sensor has to return reliable data in all circumstances: In this case, the IRS (Inertial Reference System) returned diagnostic data instead of real flight data because of a data overflow of a 16 bit signed integer value. In some cases it should be better that the sensor returns nothing at all (or just a warning sign) instead of unreliable data.
* The high risks associated with complex computing systems took the attention of the general public, politicians, and [[w: Corporate_officer| executives]], resulting in increased support for research on ensuring the reliability of safety-critical systems. The subsequent automated analysis of the Ariane code was the first example of large-scale [[w: Static_code_analysis |static code analysis]] by [[w: Abstract_interpretation | abstract interpretation]].

Note: ''In practice there should always be a trade off between safety, economic, ([[w: Ecodesign|environmental]]) ,... aspects. For example: In the above example the sensor is a critical component to safely put the astronauts back on the planet, whereas a sensor as part of a conveyer belt system is much less life-threatening. Typically, safety is of most priority at the [[w:Aviation|aviation]], aerospace and [[w: Nuclear_fusion|nuclear]] sector!''


===&lt;u&gt;The Space Shuttle Challenger&lt;/u&gt;===

On his 10th flight into space, the [[w:Space_Shuttle_Challenger|Space shuttle Challenger]] disintegrated 73 seconds after take off. 7 astronauts died. The cause of this failure was not only mechanical but also psychological, the so called [[w: Groupthink |groupthink]]!

====Problem ====

Officials of the NASA team decided to launch the spacecraft while ignoring admonitions of the engineers with a sense of invulnerability, given the successful history of NASA. The team worked closely together for a long time and they were under intense pressure  to launch the shuttle without further delay that they all collectively went  along with the launch decision. Engineers however knew that the rubber sealing (an [[w: O-ring |O-ring]]) of the propellant rocket wasn't functioning optimal under freezing temperatures. The cold temperature on the 28th Januar 1986, causing a leakage of heat flow along the O-ring therefore was the avoidable origin of the death of 7 human beings.

====Lesson====

This example shows a hardware failure mode: the effect of temperature on the deformation of material. All components of a system can work perfectly together in most of the cases, but fail in bad [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Hostile_Environment|environmental conditions]], such as the freezing conditions in this case.&lt;br&gt;
An other important conclusion comes forward. A bad design isn't always the only cause of failures. Also psychological aspects matters. This is where the engineer has to be critical in all circumstances and not collapse under [[w: Peer_pressure |peer pressure]]. Especially at the stage of usage of an embedded control system, operators have to check whether the environmental conditions fall within the design characteristics before starting up the system. Failures because of such psychological aspects are often hard to overcome and can be seen as an [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Failure_modes_and_prevention#operational|operational failure cause]].


===&lt;u&gt;Corrosion disasters&lt;/u&gt;===

Corrosion is often a hard to fight ''hardware failure mode''. Many times disasters happen when materials collapse because of corrosion. Two of them are given below:

*Sinking of the [[w:MV_Erika|Erika]]:
Erika was the name of a tanker built in 1975 and sank 70 km from the coast of France on December 13, 1999.Tons of heavy fuel oil ended up in middle of the sea, causing one of the greatest environmental disasters in the world. The ''economic consequences'' of the incident have been dramatically felt across the region: a drop in the income from tourism, loss of income from fishing, and a ban on the trade of sea products including oysters and crabs have added to the discomfort.

Corrosion problems had been apparent on the Erika since at least 1994. In addition, there were numerous deficiencies in her firefighting and inert gas systems, causing explosion risks. [[w:Lloyd's_List|Lloyd's List]] reported that severe corrosion had been discovered just weeks before the incident. However, no immediate remedial action had been taken.

*The [[w:Aloha_Airlines-vlucht_243|Aloha]] incident: 
On 28 April 1988, the Aloha Boeing 737 aircraft serving the flight suffered extensive damage after an explosive decompression in flight, but was able to land safely at Kahului Airport on Maui. One hostess was the sole fatality as she was blown out of the airplane, while another 65 passengers and crew were injured. In the  aircraft, evidence was found of multiple site [[w:Fatigue_(material)|fatigue]] damage leading to structural failure. The [[w:National_Transportation_Safety_Board|National Transportation Safety Board investigation]] report issued in 1989 attributed the incident to the failure of the operators maintenance program to detect corrosion damage. Because older airplanes are commonly not destroyed and will probably end up in service with another operator, safety issues regarding aging aircraft need to be well understood by the engineer and safety programs need to be applied on a consistent basis.

====Lesson====

Aging effects and corrosion of materials are not visible while the product is in test phase but have to be considered unavoidably! While designing large embedded control systems, engineers should have a long term vision and therefore look at the different Points Of View in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Embedded_design_process the design process] of the company. Services, maintenance and testing after sale can be solutions for large embedded systems and can prevent the company from a bad name at long term.

=== &lt;u&gt;Case Study: The Therac-25&lt;/u&gt; ===

The [[w:Therac-25|Therac-25]] was a computer-controlled [[w:Radiation_therapy|radiation therapy]] machine, which severely overdosed six people between 1985 and 1987. Three of them died.
A case study of the Therac-25 will reveal following design difficulties:
* Software can fail
* Testing can be difficult, but is indispensable
* Reuse of software can be dangerous 
* Safety and usability are conflicting design criteria
In this case the mistake was made of reusing and trusting old software. This is typically a mistake made in [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#High-level_design|high-level design]].

This text will first discuss the background of the machine. In a following section some relevant accidents are described. Next, the text will focus on some software issues related to the accidents. In a final section some engineering lessons that can be learned from the accidents will be discussed. 

==== Background ====

The Therac-25, produced by [[w:Atomic_Energy_of_Canada_Limited|Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) and CGR, was a medical linear accelerator. Such accelerators produce high-energy beams in order to destroy tumors with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissue. The Therac-6, capable of producing [[w:X-ray|X-rays]] only, and the Therac-20, a dual-mode (X-rays or [[w:Electron_beam|electron beams]]) accelerator, were predecessors to the Therac-25. Both machines were versions of older CGR machines, which already had a history of clinical use, augmented with a minicomputer. They both had limited software functionality: the computer merely added convenience to the existing hardware. Hardware safety features from older machines were retained.

A few years later, AECL developed a new acceleration concept (“double pass”) which required less space, was easier to use and more economical to produce. This concept was used in the Therac-25 dual-mode linear accelerator.

In each mode (electron or X-ray), the necessary tools to create the proper beam were attached to the turntable, which rotated the equipment into the beam. Correct operation of the Therac-25 thus was dependent on the position of the turntable.
In the case of the X-ray mode, a beam flattener, mounted to the turntable, was used to create a uniform treatment field. In order to produce an output comparable with the electron mode output, this required a high input dose rate. A wrong position of the turntable lead to the wrong position of the flattener and resulted in a high output dose. Obviously, this is a grave hazard when using dual-mode machines.

Although the Therac-25 was controlled by the same computer as the Therac-6 and Therac-20, there were some differences. The hardware of the Therac-6 and Therac-20 was capable of standing alone (for instance, mechanical interlocks which ensured safe operation). However, the software of the Therac-25 had more responsibility for maintaining safety: the machine relied much more on the software instead of hardware safety mechanisms. For the software design of the Therac-25, design features and modules of the Therac-6 were reused. The software also contained some Therac-20 routines.

In the Therac-25, it was the software’s task to control and check the turntable’s position. The software was not flawless though as six people received a massive overdose. This is explained more in the section [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Learning from failure#Accidents|Accidents]].

When the software detected an error the machine could shut down in two ways:

* ''Treatment suspend: ''which required a machine reset to restart
* ''Treatment pause:'' which required a single key command to restart the machine.
When a 'treatment pause' occurred, the operator merely had to push the P-button to &quot;proceed&quot; and resume treatment without having to reenter treatment data. When this feature was called five times the machine would automatically suspend treatment.

==== Accidents ====

&lt;u&gt;July 1985, Ontario (Canada)&lt;/u&gt;

About five seconds after activation of the Therac-25, the machine shut down. It indicated a 'treatment pause' and that no dose was given. The operator tried a second attempt at treatment by pushing the &quot;P-button&quot;, but the machine kept shutting down four more times until it went into 'treatment suspend'. After the treatment, the patient complained of a burning sensation to the treatment area. In reality the patient was given a large overdose, approximately 100 times the intended dose.
Normal single therapeutic doses are about 200 rads. Doses of 1000 rads can even be fatal, if delivered to the whole body.

After investigation of this accident AECL found some weaknesses and mechanical problems, but could not reproduce the malfunction that occurred. AECL then redesigned some mechanisms and altered the software to tackle these problem. After these improvements AECL claimed that &quot;analysis of the hazard rate of the new solution indicates an improvement over the old system by at least five orders of magnitude&quot;. The hazard analysis, however, did not seem to include computer failure. Thus, more accidents occurred.


&lt;u&gt;March 1986, East Texas Cancer Center (ETCC)&lt;/u&gt;

The operator had lots of experience with the machine and could quickly enter prescription data. She wanted to type &quot;e&quot; (for electron mode), but she had pressed the &quot;x&quot;-button (for X-ray) by mistake. To correct this, she used the &quot;up-key&quot; and quickly changed the mode entry. The other treatment parameters remained. To start treatment she hit the &quot;B-key&quot; (beam on). After a moment the machine shut down and showed the error message: &quot;MALFUNCTION 54&quot;, which was not explained nor mentioned in the machine's manual. The machine went into ‘treatment pause’ which indicated a problem of low priority. The machine showed an underdose, so the operator hit the &quot;P-button&quot; to proceed treatment. Again the machine shut down with a MALFUNCTION 54 error.
The patient complained he had felt something like an electric shock and was immediately examined. The physician however suspected nothing serious. In reality the patient received an immense overdose. Real doses of 16500 to 25000 rads were estimated after the facts. Five months later, the patient died from complications of the overdose.


&lt;u&gt;April 1986, East Texas Cancer Center (ETCC)&lt;/u&gt;

Three weeks after the first accident at ETCC, a similar one occurred. The same operator noticed an error in the mode and used the &quot;up-key&quot; to correct it. Again the machine showed a MALFUNCTION 54 error. This patient died from overdose three weeks after the accident.
The ETTC physicist immediately took the machine out of service after this second accident and investigated the error on his own. The operator who remembered what she had done, worked with him. With much effort they were able to reproduce the MALFUNCTION 54 error. The key factor in reproducing this error was the speed of entering data: if the data were entered quickly the error occurred.

The same computer bug was present in the Therac-20. But because the Therac-20 had independent hardware protective circuits, this problem was just a nuisance.

==== Problem ====

Just a small part of the software will be studied, yet this can demonstrate the overall design flaws.

The two basic mistakes involved in the accidents are:
* poor software engineering practices
* building a machine that relies on software for safe operation


[[w:Race_Condition|Race conditions]] as a result of the implementation of multitasking are possible. Following reasons state why:
* Concurrent access to shared memory is allowed
* Aside from data stored in shared variables, there is no real synchronization
* The &quot;test&quot; and &quot;set&quot; for shared variables can’t be divided into two single operations.
These race conditions played an important role in the accidents.

[[Image:Treat_Therac_25.gif|right|thumb|450px|Figure 1: Tasks and subroutines responsible for the ETCC accidents (inspired by Nancy Leveson)]]


&lt;u&gt;Software bugs for ETCC accidents&lt;/u&gt;

Figure 1 illustrates the treatment process. The treatment monitor (Treat) controls the eight treatment operation phases or subroutines according to the value of the Tphase variable. The subroutine Datent (data entry) and the Keyboard Handler task use a shared variable (data entry complete flag) to communicate with each other. Once the data entry is complete, the Keyboard Handler task changes the value of this shared variable, which denotes Datent to change the value of Tphase. The Datent subroutine exits back to Treat, which will reschedule itself in order to start the following subroutine.

Another shared variable, MEOS, contains the mode and energy level specified by the operator. MEOS exists of 2 bytes: a low-order byte to set the turntable and a high-order byte, used by Datent, to set several operating parameters.

The operator is forced to enter mode and energy level by the data entry process but he can edit the data later. A problem can occur when the operator changes the data in MEOS after the ‘data entry complete’ flag has been set by the Keyboard Handler task. Datent is then already exited and thus won’t detect the changes. However, the turntable is set in accordance to the low-order byte of MEOS and can therefore be inconsistent with the information in the high-order byte. This inconsistency apparently can’t be detected by the software.

After Datent finished setting the operational parameters, via the high-order byte information, it calls the subroutine Magnet, which sets the bending magnets of the turntable.
Following pseudocode shows relevant parts of the software (taken from the paper of Nancy Leveson, p. 27):

'''Datent'''
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; mode/energy specified &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;begin&lt;/b&gt; calculate table index
     &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/b&gt;
       fetch parameter
       output parameter
       point to next parameter
     &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;until&lt;/b&gt; all parameters set
     &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;call&lt;/b&gt; Magnet
     &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; mode/energy changed &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then return&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;end&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; data entry is complete &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; set Tphase to 3
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; data is not complete &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; reset commando entered &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; set Tphase to 0
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;return&lt;/b&gt;
'''Magnet'''
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 Set bending magnet flag
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/b&gt;
   Set next magnet
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;call&lt;/b&gt; Ptime
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; mode/energy has changed &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; exit
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;until&lt;/b&gt; hysteresis delay has expired
 Clear bending magnet flag
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;return&lt;/b&gt;
'''Ptime'''
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; bending magnet flag is set &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt;
     &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; editing taking place &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt;
       &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; mode/energy has changed &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; exit
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;until&lt;/b&gt; hysteresis delay has expired
 Clear bending magnet flag
 &lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;return&lt;/b&gt;

It takes about 8 seconds to set the magnets. The subroutine Ptime is used to introduce this delay. Ptime is entered several times, because several magnets have to be set. To indicate the bending magnets are being set, a flag is initialized when Magnet is entered. This flag is cleared at the end of Ptime. When an editing request is submitted, the keyboard handler sets a shared variable which is checked by Ptime. If edits are present, Ptime will exit to Magnet, which then exits to Datent. However, this shared variable is only checked when the bending magnet flag is set. But this flag is cleared after the first execution of Ptime. So any edits performed after the first pass through Ptime will not be noticed! In the ETTC accidents the error occurred, since the edits were made within 8 seconds. Hence Datent never detected the changes. This problem was partially solved by clearing the bending magnet flag when all magnets are set (at the end of Magnet).
==== Lesson ====

Some lessons can be learned from these accidents.

*'''Do not ignore or overrely on software'''&lt;br&gt;Engineers may not assume a problem is caused by hardware. Extensive testing and safety analyses at software level is necessary, not on system level alone. Every safety-critical system should have incident analysis procedures that are applied whenever a problem is about to occur that might lead to an accident.


*'''Be careful reusing software'''&lt;br&gt;The reuse of software does not imply safety because it already has been exercised extensively. Revising and even rewriting the entire software may be safer in many cases, because every new development will introduce its own (new) errors.


*'''Design for the worst case'''&lt;br&gt;It is crucial that an error is detected and indicated properly (towards the operator) in order to take the right steps. A way to obtain correct information about the errors is by designing error detecting code into the software from the beginning. Self-checks, error-detection and error-handling features must be given high priority in making tradeoff decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Personal Development: Classroom Community and Character Development - The Tribes Program'''&lt;/big&gt; - (Kate R, Ayanda, Jeff M, Natalie, Laura B, Jamie T)

===Thesis===

	The education system today is evolving beyond traditional teaching methods.  Presently, educators are becoming more aware of the significant role that schooling plays in the personal and social development of students.  The atmosphere of a classroom has the ability to contribute to or detract from a student’s development and opportunity to learn.  Successful students will emerge from positive learning environments that promote community development, cooperative learning, and character education.  The Tribes program focuses on implementing these characteristics into every school in order to ensure that all students succeed.   
	
The Tribes program is a process of establishing a positive culture of learning and human development throughout an entire school community.  Tribes began in the early nineteen seventies in response to the concern that educators and parents were having over low test scores and a rise of school behavioural problems.  Jeanne Gibbs, the former Executive Director of the Centre for Human Development and co-creator of the Tribes process, piloted a group development process that would fundamentally change the atmosphere of schools.  Gibbs believed in the good of all students and argued that it was the systems that surrounded the students that impacted their lives and needed to be the focus of change (Gibbs, 1995, p.399).  The pilot program was a success and led to the creation of Tribes.  The overall goal of Tribes is, “to engage all teachers, administrators, students, and families in working together as a learning community that is dedicated to caring and support, active participation and positive expectations for all students (Gibbs, 1995, p.22).” Tribes is an effective and practical program that all teachers have the ability to implement in their classrooms.  The program is appropriate for all levels of the school system and can be successfully implemented in the music, drama, and arts classroom.  Tribes ensures that all student receive a complete personal and social education.  

===Community Development===

	The Tribes program involves the creation of long-term learning groups in the classroom.  However, before the class is ready to build their tribes, it is important that the whole class is an inclusive environment.  The first several weeks of a school term should be used to build community in the classroom and to establish a positive social climate.  Students should engage in activities where they are able to get to know each other, learn the important norms in the classroom, and become comfortable in the environment.  The teacher should encourage participation and help students become comfortable with group sharing.  The teacher must also demonstrate what their role is in the classroom.  In the Tribes model the teacher is there to guide the students in their learning process.  The role of the teacher is to present the subject to students, challenge them to work cooperatively through the information, and be there to give support and answer questions (Gibbs, 1987, p.36).  The teacher must therefore establish effective communication with the students.  This is a necessary component to the development of a positive teacher student relationship (Woolfolk, p.427).  This period of community building is essential to the success of the Tribes model.

	Throughout the community building period it is important to develop guidelines for what students need to do in order to feel they are in a trusting group.  The Tribes program has created four basic tribal norms for all classrooms to abide by.  The first norm is Attentive Listening.  Students should learn how to pay close attention to the words and feelings of their classmates.  Respect and care should always be a part of attentive listening.  The second norm is No Put-Downs/Appreciation (Gibbs, 1987, p.21).  The Tribes program believes in the importance of nurturing students’ self-esteem, and the discouragement of negative remarks is a key component to the increase of self-esteem (Woolfolk, p.71).  Encouraging students to value each other and state the appreciation of other’s unique qualities is another important part of helping students to feel self-confident.  The Right to Pass is the third tribal norm.  This norm means that students have the right to determine to what extent they will participate in group activities.  This norm helps to develop a safe space in the classroom because students are aware that they have a right to privacy.  Students also see that they are able to take responsibility over their own well-being and through this process students will develop the courage to become more open with their peers.  The last tribal norm is Confidentiality.  Students are assured that all sharing that is done within the classroom is honoured and will not be revealed.  It does not mean that students cannot share what they did in class, but rather that gossiping is forbidden (Gibbs, 1987, p.40-41).  Each of these tribal norms has equal value in the classroom and should be observed at all times.  Teachers should encourage the class to help each other stay true to the norms so that the students are also responsible for the creation of a whole class community.  

===Cooperative Learning===

Once the teacher feels that the class has created a positive and inclusive environment the students are ready to create their long-term learning groups.  In order for the groups to be successful the teacher must balance the members sociometrically.  The teacher must assign an age appropriate number to each tribe.  For elementary and middle school students there should be groups of four and five.  For high school and adult classes groups of five and six are appropriate.  The number of male and female students in each learning group should also be balanced.  Leaders in the class should be distributed among all the tribes.  Students who are of high and low peer acceptance should also be distributed evenly among the tribes.  Once the composition of the tribes has been determined the teacher should create an exciting activity for students to find their tribe (Gibbs, 1987, p.51).  The process of building tribal cohesion should then begin.  Each group should go through the process of inclusion, influence, and affection.  These stages involve the students building trust within the group, creating an atmosphere of support and care, and discovering their value within the group.  This process ensures that groups become unified and will be able to act as a true cooperative learning group (Gibbs, 1987, p.24).  
	
The purpose of the tribes is to not only create social connections among students, but to allow students to engage in cooperative learning.  Cooperative learning allows students to work together to maximize each other’s learning.  In a tribe, students share personal concerns and feelings with each other, as well as plan, problem-solve, discuss, and complete work from the curriculum.  Cooperative learning is beneficial for students because it has positive effects on their personal and social development, as well as their learning process.  For example, studies have found that cooperative groups can help increase students’ empathy, tolerance, and friendships (Solomon et all., Woolfolk, p.333)  In addition, it has been discovered that cooperative work can help students with their information processing.  Through discussions students are better able to organize and expand their knowledge, make connections and review material.  Cooperative work also encourages students to think critically and problem-solve in a group situation (Woolfolk, p.333).  In order for cooperative learning to be successful the groups need to maintain an atmosphere of positive support for all members.  Groups must also assume responsibility for themselves and their achievement of goals.  The teacher should never participate directly in the group, but should always maintain control and intervene if the social cohesion of a group breaks down.  The Tribes program is an effective way to create an environment for successful cooperative learning.  The tribes become support systems for the students and create a positive space for learning (Gibbs, 1995, 49).

===Character Development===

	The overall mission for Tribes is, “to assure the healthy and whole development of every child so that each has the knowledge, skills, and resiliency to be successful in a rapidly changing world (Gibbs, 1995, p.22).”  Essentially, the mission of tribes is to help students with their character development so that they can make a positive influence in society.  Throughout the entire process of tribes character development is a main component.  Character education is embedded in the Tribes program without it being lessons based on specific values.  The process of working in groups, for example, encourages helpful behaviour in students, it promotes inclusion and the celebration of diversity.  Students are encouraged to express their views as well as respect different points of view.  In groups, students also learn to establish trust among members, and through group work they become kind and caring individuals.  In addition to social values students also develop their self-actualization.  Students are encouraged to build their personal identification, and their skills, talents, and gifts are identified and valued by the whole class.  Students are also encouraged to develop self-respect and resiliency so that they can be socially responsible both in the classroom and in society (Gibbs, 1987, p.69-70).  Overall, the Tribes program is a beneficial process for students to participate in because it helps students to better develop their whole selves.



===From Theory to Practice===


The Tribes program has numerous connections to a number of the concepts outlined and discussed in the textbook.


&lt;u&gt;Motivation&lt;/u&gt;

The Tribes program fosters both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in several ways.  Tribes places emphasis on the acquisition of knowledge and skills that will serve students throughout their lives.  For this reason, the Tribes program is applicable and valuable to students – in and out of school – and many may be intrinsically motivated to participate and develop as individuals.  
The group dynamic around which Tribes is centered also contributes to students’ extrinsic motivation in a number of capacities.  For one thing, students’ may experience an increased desire to participate in activities that are community, or group, based.  Students often appreciate the opportunity for increased interaction and collaboration among peers. Tribes requires participants to provide each other with positive feedback and reinforcing statements of support which can be a powerful motivating factor.  Additionally, students may mimic the positive behaviour of others in their Tribes group(s).  
Tribes has the potential to help students develop as more self-regulating and responsible individuals.  Because students are extremely involved in the learning process, they have great control over their own learning and actions in general.  


&lt;u&gt;Self Concept&lt;/u&gt;

	Tribes can have a powerful impact on students’ positive perception of themselves.  The appreciation statements students are required to make about one another may help individuals to recognize their particular strengths and talents.  Tribes also offers students the opportunity to work in groups and be independent with regard to their own learning and behaviour, all of which may lead to increased self confidence in their abilities, as well as increased self-worth.
The four sources of self-efficacy (listed below) outlined in the textbook relate closely to this aspect of student development.
1.	Mastery experiences
2.	Level of arousal
3.	Vicarious experiences
4.	Social persuasion
When a student’s self-efficacy is healthy and well developed, he/she will put forward greater effort.  Additionally, increased self-efficacy also effects the student’s ability to set goals for him/herself and directly connects to his/her motivation with regard to a particular task or tasks.  This co-operative goal structure can support and enhance students’ motivation within a community-based setting.

''Potential problem'': While the group dynamic supports both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, it may also affect some students in a negative way.  Students may feel increased pressure or anxiety to contribute to the group, while others may refrain from participating at all for fear of humiliation. 


&lt;u&gt;Behavioural Views of Learning&lt;/u&gt;

The positive/affirming statements involved in the Tribes program act as reinforcers –  they strengthen or maintain the students’ positive behaviour and/or response(s).  One of the great things about Tribes is that is does not involve or condone punishers/punishment.  In fact, the program goes out of its way to ensure that this negative reinforcement does not take place – for example, all participants are enabled with the ‘right to pass’ on any given activity, without negative consequences or repercussions of any kind.

''Potential problem'':  One of the possible problems with the group/community approach is that, while all opinions are respected and all participants are expected to be positive and contributing group members, there may be individuals who are not satisfied with a particular group decision.


&lt;u&gt;Classroom Management: Establishing goals&lt;/u&gt;

	One of the ways in which Tribes positively impacts the positive environment is through increased student engagement. For reasons previously outlined, the Tribes program supports both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for students.  Increased motivation will lead to increased engagement in the classroom activities and environment and thus students will have the opportunity to participate in and produce quality, meaningful experiences.  Additionally, as mentioned above, Tribes helps students developed greater self-management, self-control and responsibility, all of which are extremely valuable with regard to ease of classroom management.
	
The 4 Agreements of Tribes communities:
1.	Attentive listening
2.	Appreciation/no put downs
3.	Right to participate/pass
4.	Mutual respect
The clearly established rules and procedures of Tribes also help to establish a positive classroom environment and decrease issues related to classroom management.  These four agreements, in particular, are designed to foster cooperation among students as well as self-acceptance.


&lt;u&gt;Classroom Management: Prevention&lt;/u&gt;

Kounin identifies a number of factors that help to prevent classroom management problems:
1.	Teachers must take student differences into account
2.	Teachers must maintain student motivation
3.	Teachers must reinforce positive behaviour.
Kounin goes on to state that individuals who are skilled at preventing classroom management issues all have four areas of skill:
1.	“Withitness”
2.	Overlapping
3.	Group focussing
4.	Movement management

The connection between Kounin’s ideas and the Tribes program are highly evident and, additionally, Tribes builds on these concepts by expanding the ‘preventer’ to include students as well as teachers. Because Tribes places great importance on student-directed learning, activities and environment, the students are all actively involved in contributing to the atmosphere of the classroom and directly connected to the classroom management problems (or lack thereof).


&lt;u&gt;Learning Environment: Establishing Community&lt;/u&gt;

Johnson and Johnson outline ‘three Cs’ of establishing a positive classroom community:
1.	Cooperative community
2.	Constructive conflict resolution
3.	Civic values

These principles are essentially the basis for the Tribes program. Johnson and Johnson identify ‘positive independence’ as individuals working together to achieve mutual goals.  This concept is a crucial part of Tribes – connecting to student self-direction, motivation as well as cooperation and affirmation.  Constructive conflict resolution is another important part of Tribes – seen in students’ right to pass as well as the ban on put-downs.  Additionally, Tribes supports the ‘I feel’ method of communication between students – particularly those in conflict with one another – and helps students to understand the emotion behind actions and behaviour, rather than allowing an aggressive action/behaviour to proceed with no understanding on the part of the aggressor or the recipient.  
Finally, because Tribes also aims to foster students’ character development, the idea of ‘civic values’ is also extremely applicable.  According to Kounin, students come to understand values through direct teaching, modelling, literature, group discussions and the sharing of concerns.  Again, Tribes takes this a step further by assigning these duties to, in addition to the teacher, the students themselves.

===Structuring a Tribes Lesson Plan===

Tribes lesson plans are generally structured to include 5 distinct steps:

1.	Energizer

2.	Circle Talk

3.	Learning Activity

4.	Reflection

5.	Appreciation


Each step addresses at least one of the  “Five E’s”: 

1. Engage

2. Explore

3. Explain 

4. Elaborate

5. Evaluate


'''&lt;u&gt;'''Step One: Energizer (Engage)'''&lt;/u&gt;'''

The purpose of the energizer is to serve as a warm-up and transition.  The energizer should prepare students physically and mentally for the upcoming learning experience in a fun and engaging manner. 


'''&lt;u&gt;'''Step Two: Circle Talk (Engage, Explain, Explore)'''&lt;/u&gt;'''

The circle talk is a way for students to become more familiar with themselves – their strengths, abilities, gifts, etc. in relation to the upcoming learning experience.  It is important that during the circle talk all students adhere to the four “community agreements” of the Tribes program.  This includes listening attentively while others speak, showing respect for the feelings and ideas of others, avoiding put-downs and showing appreciation, and honouring each others’ right to pass.  


It is up to the individual teacher to ensure that the circle talk is effective.  Some suggestions include:


- Remember that this is a time for everyone to speak – not just the teacher

- Allow at least 3 second of thinking time after asking a question

- Consider your students and decide what method of taking turns will work best.  Can the group handle speaking out randomly whenever they have something to contribute, or do they need more structure, such as using a ‘talking stone’?


&lt;u&gt;Step Three: Learning Activity (Engage, Explain, Explore, Elaborate)&lt;/u&gt;

Learning activities should help students to connect the new information being presented to prior knowledge and experiences.  A good way to do this is by starting the activity with personal YOU questions.  Examples of YOU questions include:


- How do you feel about the subject?  

- What experience do you have with this subject?
 

When students are responding to these questions, it is best for them to be in groups of no more than four.  This allows every student a chance to speak, and is less intimidating than sharing personal thoughts and experiences with the entire class.

The learning activity should require cooperative interdependence from students, so that every student is an important and necessary part of the process.  A great way to ensure cooperative interdependence is by having each member of each group take on a specific role.  Examples of roles include:

-	Facilitator

-	Recorder

-	Encourager

-	Summarizer

-	Time Keeper

-	Materials Manager


NOTE: It is important that students do not take on the same role every time – all students must have practice fulfilling each role.


'''&lt;u&gt;'''Step Four: Reflection (Engage, Explain, Explore, Elaborate, Evaluate)'''&lt;/u&gt;'''

Reflection is an important step in any learning process.  Research has shown that reflection can significantly increase the amount of information and number of concepts students retain.  There are three types of reflection questions:


1.	Personal Learning Questions (about what the student has learned or felt)

2.	Social Questions (about the interactions between group members during the learning activities, and what collaborative skills were used)

3.	Thinking Questions (about the actual content of the lesson, and what skills were required to understand and work with the information and concepts)


NOTE: It is not necessary for students to always answer the reflection questions out loud.  Students should be allowed the option of simply thinking about their answer, or of writing it down.


&lt;u&gt;
Step Five: Appreciations (Engage, Explore, Evaluate)&lt;/u&gt; 

This step is a great way for students to develop a sense of community and trust with one another.  Students can express appreciation for the efforts and accomplishments of the other members of their group, and can point out each other’s strengths and skills.  This step is especially important for high school students, who greatly value the opinions of their peers.  High school students often find praise or acknowledgement from a peer to be more meaningful than praise or acknowledgment from a teacher.

===Sample Tribes Lesson Plan===


This is a sample of a lesson plan that could be used on one of the first few days of a semester to introduce the Tribes program and help students develop a trusting and collaborative atmosphere in the classroom.


&lt;u&gt;Energizer: Three Ball Pass (5 – 7 min.)&lt;/u&gt;


This game helps students learn and remember each other’s names.  It also requires them to work collaboratively as a team. 

Start with the students standing in a circle.  The leader will begin the game by calling out the name of a student and tossing the ball to him/her.  That student will then call out another student’s name and toss the ball to him/her.  This will continue until every student has been tossed the ball, with no repetitions.  

The students should then repeat the same pattern of tossing, trying to increase their speed.  Once they have accomplished this pattern once or twice, a second ball can be added.  The second ball should be tossed in the same pattern as the first.  Once a ball has reached the end of the pattern, it should start all over again, so that the two balls are constantly in motion.  A third ball should then be added.

To increase the challenge of the game, any of the following strategies can be used:

-	The second ball can be thrown in the reverse pattern of the first

-	Each ball can be given its own pattern

-	The group can time themselves and try to beat their own best speed


&lt;u&gt;Circle Talk: Elements of a Positive Classroom (10 – 15 min.)&lt;/u&gt;


Discuss what elements help to create a positive classroom environment.  Students can suggest what they would like to see/feel in the class, and things they would like to avoid.  Students can share examples of situations and environments that have been positive and why, and ways they personally can contribute to a positive classroom.  


&lt;u&gt;Learning Activity: Brainstorming the 4 Agreements (15 – 20 min.)&lt;/u&gt;


Split the class into 4 groups.  Each group will start at one of the four flip-charts that have been set up around the room.  Each flip chart will have one of the Tribes Agreements written at the top:

1.	Mutual Respect

2.	Attentive Listening

3.	Showing Appreciation/ No Put-downs

4.	The Right to Pass


Explain to students that this is a brainstorming activity, and that there are no right or wrong answers.  Explain that the idea is to write down or sketch thoughts, ideas, feelings or images that come to mind when they consider the words on the flip-chart.  Remind them that they should work quickly, without commenting or discussing.

Give the groups 3-4 minutes at the first flip-chart to record their immediate reactions.  Once the time is up, have them rotate around to the next flip-chart. Each group should spend 3-4 minutes at each flip-chart, rotating through until they have worked at all four stations. 


&lt;u&gt;Reflection: Reflecting on the 4 Agreements (5 – 10 min.)&lt;/u&gt;


Post the charts up where everyone can see them, and have the students sit facing them.  Pose the following questions to students:


Personal Learning:

-	How do you feel about each of these agreements?

-	Which agreement do you personally think is most important and why?


Social Learning:

-	What would have happened differently during this activity if we had judged, commented or discussed the ideas instead of simply writing them down?

-	How much did you personally participate?


Cognitive Learning:

- Did you learn anything new about these concepts and their importance?
 

&lt;u&gt;
Appreciations: Appreciating the Members of Your Group (5 – 10 min.)&lt;/u&gt;


Invite students to share statements of appreciation, or recognition for others in their group.  Because this is the first time the class has done this, you can suggest that they start their statements in any of the following ways:

===Tribes in Action: The Secondary Dramatic Arts Classroom===


After a basic introduction to the Tribes program it is clear that there are four agreements required to initiate the tribes program into a school or a classroom are attentive listening, appreciation/no put-downs, right top participate/pass and mutual respect.  It is also clear that there are three stages of group development, beginning with inclusion, building through influence and ultimately creating a community.  If Tribes is a medium through which a community can in fact be created, one must understand what a community in a drama classroom might look like.


&lt;u&gt;A Community in a High School Drama Classroom&lt;/u&gt;

It is especially important for students in a dramatic arts classroom to feel safe since many of the techniques and issues raised, as well as the collaborative nature of drama projects require students to stretch their comfort limits and take risks.  Building a community among the students is an essential part of a functional and productive drama classroom.   Since drama involves taking risks, it is appropriate to look at strategies of creating communities for high risk students.   In their case study, “Serving Rural Youth at Risk: A Portrait of Collaboration and Community,” Robert Rossi,  Pamela Vergun and Larry Weise describe eight commitments that students must share in a community:  a shared vision and shared values, a sense of purpose, an incorporation of diversity, open communication, active participation, caring and trust, teamwork, respect and recognition.* Although this case study is focused on serving rural youth at risk, all eight of the aforementioned commitments are also essential in a drama classroom.  Consider the production of a play;  a diverse group of students, with a diverse mix of skills and interests, share a vision of performance in which every person plays a respected and recognized role whether that be as an actor, technician, designer, musician or writer.  As the show approaches, everyone must trust the individuals of the group and actively work together. 


&lt;u&gt;Inclusion and Influence as Community Builders&lt;/u&gt;

Since community building is a necessity in the dramatic arts classroom and the Tribes program describes community as the product of inclusion and influence, then a dramatic arts teacher needs practical strategies to incorporate inclusion and influence in their classroom. The Tribes program breaks these strategies into four categories: active listening, expression of appreciation, reflecting upon experience and collaborative work.  Each of these categories involves an essential aspect of the dramatic art form and each can also be cultivated through a variety of exercises that can easily be incorporated into the dramatic arts classroom.  


''1)  Active Listening''

Drama inherently requires active listening for acting and improvisation.  An actor can not act in a scene without listening to their partner or improvise a scenario without listening to the offers on the table.   Try these games to train active listening skills:


  '''Blind Association Circle''' 
  With the entire group standing in a circle, establish a rhythm, by swinging a hand. Once a rhythm 
  is established, one player starts by tossing a word to their neighbour, who associates on the word 
  and tosses another word.  It is important to stay in the rhythm. Tell the players to just say 
  `banana` if they feel they cannot think of a word, as long as the rhythms does not get broken. 
  Once the association has been to each player, continue, repeating the same pattern.  As this is 
  going on, the teacher will tap all players, gently on the shoulder, at tree different times.  The
  first tap: players close their eyes but continue the free association, sticking to the rhythm.  
  The second tap: everyone starts walking around (carefully!), eyes still closed.  Players have to 
  recognize the voice of their ex-neighbour in the circle to know when it is their turn.  Third tap: 
  all players, still eyes closed, and still associating, try to reconstruct the circle.  Exercise is
  over when everyone is in a circle again. Trainer should keep an eye on players so they do not 
  walk into anything.
  

  '''The Paperclip Game''' 
  Have the players form a line across the back of the playing area.  One person steps forward and 
  says what object he/she is and what their function is, such as &quot;I'm a paperclip, and I hold loose 
  papers together.&quot; A second person steps up and says what object he/she is, and what their similar 
  function is, such as &quot;I am a rubber band and I hold loose pieces of mail together.&quot; At that point
  a pattern is established and one-by-one everyone steps forward to heighten the pattern: 
  •	I am twine and I hold loose recyclable newspapers together. 
  •	I am shackles and I hold loose chain gang prisoners together. 
  •	I am religion and I hold loose communities together. 
  Repeat until it is as heightened as it is going to get, then start over again with a new object 
  and function.  This game is great to encourage students to actively listen for patterns and 
  heighten what has already been established.

Active listening is also an important skill for audience members to learn and apply. Encourage students to employ proper audience etiquette through active listening.  Create checklists or questions for students to answer while viewing each other’s work.  
  
  '''Questions could include:'''  
  •	What particular gestures, lines, or moments stood out as creating a believable 
         character?
  •	How did the performers relate to one another and when was it clear that they were 
         listening and responding to each other?
  •	Did the pace or rhythm of the production seem smooth or did it drag?
  •	How was the meaning of the text communicated through words, actions, or symbols? 
  •	What were the major desires, goals, objectives, and motivations of the characters 
         and how did these help you understand the meaning of the text? 
  •	Were the characters realistic, symbolic, allegorical or totally divorced from reality? 


''2)  Expression of Appreciation''

Teachers can build in activities to help students express their appreciation for one another’s work after a specific exercise, at the end of each week or at the conclusion of a unit or production.

  '''End of an Exercise: Oscar Speech Journal'''
  Ask each student to write an “Oscar Speech” thanking those who made their success in this activity 
  possible today; who helped you and in what way? Remind students that they can also thank themselves. 

  '''End of the Week: Secret Admirers'''
  At the beginning of each week, give each student a small card with the name of another student in 
  the class written on it.  (Be sure to keep track of who has been given what names which will help 
  you minimize repeats and deal with any inappropriate notes.)  Over the course of the week everyone 
  has to watch for one great thing they noticed their person do in class and then record it on the 
  card.  On Friday collect the cards then hand everyone their secret admirer note.

  '''End of a Unit: High Fives''' 
  Give each student a piece paper and instruct them to trace their hand on it.  Then they must 
  creatively add their name to the hand.  Sitting in a circle, pass the hands around so everyone 
  can write a thank you, complimentary or congratulatory message on each persons hand: a high five. 



''3)  Reflecting upon Experience''

Here are a couple of ways to facilitate personal reflection within a group.  Either can be done after any significant shared experience such as a production, unit, trip, or exercise.

  '''Spider Webs'''
  Have the entire class sit in a circle and give one person a ball of yarn.  That person will reflect 
  upon the present experience: something that worked well, something they learned or really enjoyed, 
  something that was memorable, etc.  Once they have finished they will wrap the yarn around their 
  wrist a couple of times and then through it across the circle to another person.  That person will 
  do the same thing.  Once the yarn has been to everyone once or twice, a web will have been created 
  in the middle of the circle.  Open a discussion about the nature of a web and how that relates to 
  our shared experiences here in the drama room.


  '''The Good, The Great and The Goal Tableaux''' 
  Divide the class into groups of 3 or 4.  Each group will decide upon a good part and a great part
  of the present experience.  The group will also think about what their goal or goals might be in 
  relation to the present experience.  Once all three things have been clearly decided upon, the group 
  will create a tableau to illustrate each.  The groups will present all three and the class will 
  describe what they saw, opening a group discussion after each presentation.  


''4)  Collaborative Work''

The majority of all work in the dramatic arts classroom is collaborative.  The curriculum itself is working to build community through inclusion and influence, however, an easy way to introduce the idea of collaborative work is through cooperative games.  These types of activities are great for early in the semester and require students to work in order to solve a problem or succeed as a group. 

  '''Shrinking Island'''
  Divide the class into groups of 6-10 students and give each group a blanket.  Ask the students to 
  stand on their   blanket and then explain that this blanket is a shrinking island.  The students 
  must get off their island and make it shrink (fold it in half) now the students must al get back 
  on. Continue shrinking the islands to see which group can work together to stand for five seconds 
  on the smallest island.
 

  '''Magic Carpet'''
  Divide the class into groups of 6-10 students and give each group a blanket.  Ask the students 
  to stand on their blanket and then explain that this blanket is a magic carpet.  Describe flying 
  through the air and get them to act out their adventure.  Now the carpet loses control and is 
  about to crash.  The landing instructions are on the bottom of the carpet, so each group must 
  work together to flip the carpet, while it is in mid air, in order to see the instructions.  
  No one can fall off!

===&lt;u&gt;Elements of Tribes that Relate to Visual Arts&lt;/u&gt;===

There has been an educational movement where teachers and administrators alike where they have become very interested in a program named Tribes.  In this part of the paper, two concepts are going to be explained. For the first part the ideas and process of Tribes in relationship to Visual Arts will be explain.  Through this explanation, an evaluation and critical ideas are presented in order to figure out away in order to incorporate Tribes in a Visual Arts classroom in a high school setting. 
	

Tribes is a program which was first developed for elementary school but has recently been modified to be able to be incorporated into high schools.  It is a step-by-step program which is designed to achieve precise learning goals. In order to achieve these learning goals, there are four agreements which need to be introduced by the teachers and honoured by the students within the whole school. Tribes in Visual Arts, is a process of establishing a positive culture of learning and human development not just within individual classrooms but in an entire school based community.  For the program, Tribes wants to assure the healthy and whole development of every child so when they go out into the work force they are able to be knowledgeable, skillful, and determined to be successful.


There four agreements which can be easily incorporated into Visual Arts which are key to Tribes.  These four agreements are (1) attentive listening, (2) appreciation/no put downs, (3) mutual respect, and (4) the right to pass.  In order to achieve all these elements within the Tribes program students need to learn a variety of skill which will help them to be able to collaborate and work will in long-term groups.  These skills include: helping each other to achieve tasks together, set goals and solve problems, monitor and assess progress and celebrating achievements.
	

When introducing Tribes to your Visual Art classroom, there are a number of things the teacher needs to do in order to make the program successful.  The first thing the teacher needs to do is introduce Tribes and explain it to the students in student friendly language.  The second thing the teacher needs to do is divide the class into groups which are balanced in terms of student strengths verses student's weaknesses.  Thirdly, the teacher needs to establish tools and techniques to help build group inclusion within the individual groups and as a class as a whole.  Once the students are in their groups and they have ideas about inclusion the teacher now can start transferring their power over to the students. 


In order to implement Tribes into a Visual Art class there needs to be a structure established based off of three things.  The first thing is cooperative learning, the second being character education and last of all, community development. Students become members of long-term learning groups.  In terms of cooperative learning students would be divided into groups.  For junior grades the groups would consist of 4 to 5 members and in high school the groups would consist of 5 to 6 members. For character development students incorporate their values into the everyday life in the classroom and they also learn essential collaborative skills.  Last of all, for community development students need to feel like they are part of a caring and safe classroom environment.


As mentioned above, for Tribes to work to the fullest extent, it has to be implemented in all classrooms.  This part of the paper will examine one possible way in order to implement it into a visual art classroom through a mural project.


===&lt;u&gt;Visual Arts Mural Project and Tribes&lt;/u&gt;===


In visual arts students develop many skills which can be directly linked to the ideas of Tribes.  Visual arts, developed respect for other opinions and feelings without being judgmental, promote cooperative learning where students develop problem solving skills, create a caring and trustworthy environment where students feel they can express themselves freely and last of all, the appreciation of cultural values.  All these elements that are developed in a visual art classroom help students socially develop so they will be able to be active citizens within a community.  It also helps student to be able to cooperate and work well together in large group in order to successfully create a class mural.
	

When starting a class mural project in a visual art classroom, a community must be build just like in Tribes classroom community must be created.  When building a community, make sure students understand that the activity is a group activity and they will have to work with everybody in the class.  This might be a hard thing to do in a visual art classroom because for many visual art project students work alone reflecting and thinking about their art.  Many students might be reluctant to have to work and create art with their fellow classmates when they are generally used to working alone on their art.  Students need to understand that many project that artist work on in today's world are done collaboratively.  To prove this point you might want to show students examples of work done by a group of artist.  Overall, students need to understand that large scale murals are done by groups of people.  
	

Once the students understand that they will have to work in group to create the class mural, the teacher can start and activity where the class brainstorms possible ideas for the mural.  It is really important to be inclusive and make sure all the students understand that every body's ideas are important.  This concept in Tribes is also important.  One issue that might develop with the students is decided on one idea when you might have several.  One way to solve this issue is to create lists where students would vote of the ideas presented. 
	

Keeping with the ideas of Tribes students need to influence the look of the mural.  In order to do this the teacher can create design projects to give students the power to influence to look and ideas behind the mural.  What students can do is create their own drawings on how they wish the mural to look.  Once the drawings are finished, have all the drawings posted around the class and develop a classroom discussion on which images they want to use for the mural.  Remember when having such a discussion it is important that students are nice and not mean and degrading towards their classmate's image.  To avoid negativity you might want to create an answer sheet for the murals so when the student talks they are using their sheets as a reminder of what they want to say.  Once decided on the design of the mural divide the mural up so every student gets an equal amount of the mural to create as their own.  
	

There are many things that teachers need to keep in mind when creating Tribes in their classroom particularly in terms of a large scale mural project.  Teachers have to make sure their instructions are clear and that every student in their class understands them.  Secondly, in order to make the project run smoothly teachers need to create a time schedule and emphasise how important it is to following it. Overall, when creating such a large collaborative piece or any visual arts project it is really important for the teacher to keep the students engaged.  Also, when creating a mural or class project of this scale it’s a great opportunity for teachers to get the parents involved in a school art exhibition.

===&lt;u&gt;Introduction&lt;/u&gt;===



'''Preamble'''


One of the key tasks for teachers of all subjects is to be able to assess and evaluate student performance.  Various disciplines employ a range of assessment and evaluation techniques, which can be tailored to meet specific student needs and goals.  Although it can sometimes be a challenging task for all teachers, it is especially so within disciplines where subjective/qualitative assessment is required – the arts.


Assessment and evaluation are uniquely elusive when it comes to subjects like Visual Art, Music and Drama.  In addition to measuring knowledge and understanding, thinking, communication, application, effort and technical skill, teachers are given the difficult task of gauging a student’s creativity.


Creativity is understood to be a highly individualized quality – it can materialize in an infinite number of ways that rarely fit into a given set of criteria.  In fact, the premise of creativity rests on the synthesis of new and unconventional ideas.  Creativity is also something very personal – it often represents an emotional investment by the student and, therefore, requires sensitivity on the part of the teacher.  These challenges raise an important question: '''''how might teachers go about assessing and evaluating creativity in student work?'''''



'''What does it mean to be creative?'''


According to dictionary.com, the adjective ''creative'' is defined as ''having the power or ability to create''.  This definition appears to focus on someone’s ability to produce rather than the quality of the work produced.  This view of pluralism is sometimes criticized in artistic circles for perpetuating the trend to make things for the sake of making things.  An example might be an artist who produces vast volumes of work, but spends little time contemplating the significance of each piece.  This person is productive but is he or she creative?  Later in this book, we will be looking more closely at the role of self-reflection and self-assessment in creative processes.


'''''Creativity''' – the ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships and to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, etc.; originality, progressiveness, or imagination.'' (dictionary.com)


The initiative to transcend conventions and create meaningful new ideas engages the students’ higher order thinking skills that deal with Application and Synthesis as per Bloom’s Taxonomy.  This indicates that creativity operates at a fairly high level of cognition.  It also means that in order to function at that level, students must build upon the more fundamental cognitive skills such as Knowledge, Comprehension and, in turn, Analysis.


So, for example, a student of classical music will learn notation first (knowledge).  He or she will then gain an understanding of musical theory (comprehension).  Finally, the student will practice the ability to examine the qualities of existing pieces of music (analysis) before applying all of the above to compose an original piece (application and synthesis).


The way we assess or evaluate higher order thinking is important because there is a certain risk involved for students.  In synthesizing new ideas, students open themselves up to peer criticism and possible embarrassment.  For this reason alone, many learners choose to “play it safe” and conform to what the majority of their peers are producing.  Therefore, it is crucial to consider the effectiveness of the different methods of measuring creativity.



'''Assessment vs. Evaluation'''


For the sake of further discussion, it is important to distinguish between ''assessment'' and ''evaluation''.  While the two functions are commonly paired, they differ considerably in purpose and approach.


'''''Assessment''''' is generally understood to be formative.  In other words, assessment takes place while learning is happening.  It is an ongoing process that is intended to improve learning by allowing the teacher to respond to student needs as they become apparent.  This approach is associated with holistic/constructivist methodology because it provides a “safe to fail” environment that encourages self-expression and creative risk-taking.
 

'''''Evaluation''''' is summative – it is normally done ''after'' a unit of learning has been completed.  Evaluation focuses on the formal grading of student work and, therefore, it is numerical and final.  It is often associated with competition, performance and risk.  While grades can be a powerful extrinsic motivator, they do little to encourage students to try new things because students want to minimize the above risk.


Are both assessment and evaluation appropriate methods for gauging creativity?  Teachers, students and parents would agree that creativity should be rewarded.  While assessment tends to offer more flexibility in working with subjective qualities, evaluation appears more readily applicable to the appraisal of technical skill and effort levels.

===&lt;u&gt;Peer Assessment and Professional Arts Juries&lt;/u&gt;===



This report uses the &quot;Peer Assessment&quot; model as prescribed by professional arts funding agencies such as The Canada Council for the Arts, the Ontario Arts Council, and the Toronto Arts Council to address the issue of how creativity may be evaluated in a contemporary high-school arts classroom.  For the purpose of this address, my principal source is The Canada Council for the Arts. In brief, there are advantages and disadvantages to this model, however, its' effective use in the classroom makes specific demands on the evaluated which may, or may not, be compatible with the learning objectives of the teacher. 


The following discussion on Arts Juries is broken into four parts: 
:'''1) How They Work;''' 
:'''2) When They Work Well'''; 
:'''3) When They Don't Work'''; 
:'''4) Peer Assessment in the Classroom'''.


'''1) &lt;u&gt;How They Work&lt;u&gt;''' 

Juries are selected from creative practitioners within the discipline being judged,  (dance, theatre, music, visual art), and are—within each discipline—specific to certain job descriptions like, performer, writer, director, producer, administrator. Juries must also be balanced in terms of gender, cultural background, and political/religious/aesthetic affiliation. Most juries need four to six people. Canada Council (CC) Jurors are paid well relative to a freelancer’s wage.


Juries are selected by an executive board, who also produces the event: handling communications; travel and lodging for out of town jurors, delivery of all print materials (a substantial amount of paper is used), and catering.


The executive also administers the adjudication, handling applications, to printing, to overseeing the 2 to 3 day process by providing structure to the meetings, and accelerating the process of elimination, which is what the whole thing is about. The criterion of adjudication is determined by the jury, based on vague administrative guidelines. 


Essential parts of the application:
*a clear and justifiable mission statement
*an accessible track record: media documentation, press reviews, endorsements and testimonial
*an application is judged by comparing the proposition with the company’s mission statement and track record 



'''2) &lt;u&gt;When They Work Well&lt;u&gt;'''

In brief, when the process works well, you get the funding you asked for, then execute the responsibilities you’ve outlined in your grant application.  Although it is hard to guage what any one successful candidate may learn from the process, there are a number of qualities successful applicants seem to have in common. By looking at a few of these it is possible to infer a learning curve for the evaluated over time.


'''organizational:''' Good grant writing requires detailed record-keeping and the maintenance of healthy professional relationships. Because most grant applications require a press file—print reviews, features, interviews and transcripts from broadcast media—the artist has to have these at hand. Also, because most applications require a sponsor, or professional endorsement of some sort, successful artists must maintain relationships with respected, often senior, members of their artistic community. Having a friend is one thing. Having a friend who is a respected member of your artistic community who is willing to both, risk his or her artistic reputation before the CC, and, take the time necessary to review your application then write an endorsement which speaks to the details of your proposal, is quite another thing.  


'''metacognative:''' Successful, grant-getting, artists must be rigorously self-aware of not only their body of work, but also, of their creative process because, for most artists funded by the Canada Council (CC), their initial successful grant application is the first substantial step in the creation of a new work. Also, because most grants are awarded to fund a specific phase of artistic development in the creation of new work, the artist is required to be detailed in imagining their artistic process, securing the personnel and means of production, budgeting for expenses, and determining the length of time necessary to fulfill their artistic obligations for the money awarded.  The end result is that a successful artist knows who they are, what they have done, what they plan to do, how they work, how they have failed and succeeded in the past, exactly how they hope to achieve their next task, who they can call on for help, and how much time they will need to accomplish their proposed short-term goals.  


'''responsibility:''' Accountability is the key to successful grant-getting. Artists have to make good on their previously funded promises, and continue to develop according to their own often-stated prescriptions for success. 



'''3) &lt;u&gt;When They Don’t Work&lt;u&gt;'''

There are significant downsides to Peer Assessment as practiced by the CC. Here are a few.


'''emerging artists:''' Because so much of the grant application is dedicated to assessing an artists’ creative ‘track record’ it can be difficult for the new artist to state their future claim against their past record. This aspect of the process requires new artists to seek respected artistic mentors for ongoing support, and legitimate media outlets for recognition. 


'''results are final:''' Lessons for unlucky applicants can only be achieved accumulatively over several failed attempts, and a synthesis of imperfect feedback.  Usually a simple sentence of anything like criticism appears in the rejection letter. A follow up appeal might yield something along the lines of, “…the jury didn’t feel that the application was strong enough to justify a new direction in terms of your mandate.”


'''subjectivity:'''  All judgments in any creative process, no matter how well structured, are subjective and fallible. At the extreme end of this paradigm is something called ‘low-balling’ whereby one low score from any juror on any round of evaluation can sink a proposal. This tactic is often the preserve of the grudge-bearing juror who has failed to disclose their bias to the rest of the jury.  This is rare, although every unsuccessful candidate will undoubtedly claim to have ‘an enemy’ on the jury…and sometimes they are right. What works against the tendency toward spurious judgment is the peer process itself. The process is intense, and usually lasts two or three full days. Also, any one juror may well find his or herself in the company of four or five substantially qualified, and well-connected, artistic peers who are more than capable of arguing aesthetic principles, and justifying their choices in a thoroughly rational manner. There is nothing whimsical about this process. Those who treat their role as an adjudicator lightly (or strictly emotionally) will not be asked back, will embarrass themselves in front of influential members of their community, and, will jeopardize their standing with the country’s most powerful arts funding body.  



'''4) &lt;u&gt;Peer Assessment in the Classroom&lt;u&gt;'''

The virtues engendered by successful grant-getting artists are compatible with the goals of arts education to a limited extent, namely, the virtues of self-awareness, metacognition, demonstrable discipline in terms of process, organization, and accountability. In the classroom however, it is difficult to establish a deep sense of accountability because the goals for success in the classroom are not as well defined for the students as they are in the professional arts where all candidates strive for just one goal: to get the money. If all students were driven to achieve but one goal—good marks for instance—then it might be easier for the teacher to police against favouritism, and harsh judgments, but this is not the case. Many students are all too willing to risk getting a good mark for the sake of peer-pressure, status-achieving behaviour, or short-term popularity.  


The task then, for a teacher who wishes to implement this type of assessment structure, is to start early in the academic year, work closely with the jurors for the first few cycles, and then be willing to use the process as many times as is necessary for the students to see the repercussions of their actions as jurors and prospective candidates.  The learning curve really takes off once students can weigh the cost of a previous harsh judgment when it is their turn to be judged. 


If well-done, this type of assessment can foster academic skills for students in three significant areas: metacognative; critical/analytical; intra-personal accountability. It does need to be scaffolded though, and the likelihood of success is much greater with mature students in a studio/conservatory type of environment where students learn together in close-quarters over the course of more than one year.

===&lt;u&gt;Self-Assessment &amp; Evaluation&lt;/u&gt;===



'''Definition''': &quot;The evaluation or judgement of ‘the worth’ of one’s performance and the identification of one’s strength and weaknesses with a view to improving one’s learning outcomes” (Klenowski, quoted in Ross 2).


&lt;u&gt;Three Types of Self Assessment&lt;/u&gt; (Rose 4-6)

:1.  Co-created rubrics for assignments:  Students and teacher discuss and list what the evaluative criteria or goals of an assignment should be as well as defining the levels of success for those criteria.
:2.  Short answer questionnaire: Students are asked to respond to questions about their performance.  For example:
::- What was good about your performance today?  Name three things and explain why.
::- What needs improvement?  Give 3 ideas.
::- Explain some exercises that would help you make those improvements.
:3.  Students rate themselves in specific areas of their performance and conduct.  For example:
::- On scale of 1-5, rate yourself on the following criteria:
:::i.  I came to class having practiced all of my parts.  
:::ii. I  come to class on time and promptly assemble my instrument. 
:::iii.  I can hear when I am playing well.

				    
&lt;u&gt;Why Teacher’s Use Self-Assessment&lt;/u&gt; (Ross 2)

:1.  It gives students the opportunity to contribute to the criteria on which their work will be evaluated increases their engagement with the work.
:2.  It contributes to variety in assessment methods, which aids in maintaining student interest and attention.
:3.  It provides information that might otherwise not be as easily determined:
::- Students are given a forum to assess and comment on the degree of effort they put into an assignment.
::- Students often bring unthought-of criterion to attention that a teacher might have otherwise overlooked.
:4. Some argue that students learn more when they share the responsibility for assessment and that increased attention and engagement lead to increased learning.


&lt;u&gt;Is Self-Assessment Reliable?&lt;/u&gt; (Ross 3)

Research shows that self-assessment strategies have been largely consistent, especially with older students (i.e. Grades 7 and up) who might better understand the criteria and how to apply them.  Self Assessment strategies have been more effective with shorter assessment periods. Longer assessment periods would suggest larger assignments with a greater number of criterion that are harder for students to remember and regulate.


&lt;u&gt;Does Self-Assessment Provide Valid Evidence of Student Performance?&lt;/u&gt;(Ross 3)

There are some discrepancies in this area:
:1.  Student ratings are often higher than teacher ratings when the assessments contribute to a grade, as the temptation to inflate their own grades seems to skew student judgement. 
:2.  There tends to be more consistency in student ratings when students are informed that their ratings will be compared to the teacher’s (i.e. using the same rubric) and that they will have to explain any large discrepancies between their ratings and those of the teacher.
:3.  Students may confuse their ability to meet the criterion of an assignment with the effort that they put forth to meet that criterion.  In light of what students might regard as a great degree of effort that was put toward an assignment, they might be more inclined to inflate their ratings to reflect their efforts.  
::- As problematic as this might seem, it does give the teacher the opportunity to identify and act upon student difficulties that might otherwise go unidentified.


&lt;u&gt;Strengths of Self-Assessment&lt;/u&gt; (Ross 7)

:1.  Students have a better understanding of their goals through their active role in creating the dimensions of a rubric.  Thus, there is often a greater degree of success in attaining those goals. 
:2.  Students have commented that self-assessment was a fairer form of assessment because it allowed them to incorporate criterion that would not otherwise be included (such as student effort or extra-curricular time commitments).
:3.  Students can communicate information to the teacher (i.e. goals and rationale) that they would otherwise not be able to.
::- Self-assessment gives students information that they can use to improve their own performance on an assignment by encouraging students to focus on attaining specific criteria and tracking their own improvement in those areas.  


&lt;u&gt;Weaknesses of Self-Assesment&lt;/u&gt; (Ross 7-8)

:1.  There is a concern that students will lower academic standards by inflating their ratings on their assessment of their own work.
:2.  Some students might not want to participate in the process, feeling that it is not their responsibility to carry out what they regard as the “teacher’s” job.
:3.  Such an attitude might decrease student motivation and commitment to their work.  Nonetheless, this does not apply as much to uses of self-assessment in the formative assessment of student work that would be taking place throughout the progress of a curriculum unit.  In conjunction, self-assessment and teacher feedback can be powerful tools in helping students succeed with their work.
:4.  It takes a lot of class time construct rubrics with students.  It can often take up to three periods to work out the details of a student created rubric.  Revised drafts often need to be presented to and reworked with the class over the period of a few days.   


&lt;u&gt;Four-Stages Involved in Making Self-Assessment More Effective&lt;/u&gt; (Ross 8-9)

:1.  The teacher should not surrender control when creating rubrics.  The teacher should use the process as a means to develop students’ deeper understanding of expectations in a manner that will allow them to relate to those expectations in their own language.  
:2.  The teacher must explain how to apply the criteria of a rubric by providing exemplars as well as modelling the desired expectations for the class.
:3.  The teacher should promptly provide comments and feedback for a student’s self-assessment in an effort to clarify the expectations and criteria within a rubric.  Comparisons between a student’s self-assessment and the teacher’s (or a peer’s) assessment of the same work using the same criteria may be use to resolve discrepancies and discourage inflated ratings.
:4.  The teacher should assist their students in using self-assessment data/ratings in a manner that would improve their performance with future assignments.  Providing students with recording forms to track performance over time will help them establish links between their immediate goals and their long-term goals.

===&lt;u&gt;Case Study: A Model for Self-Assessment and Evaluation&lt;/u&gt;===

In music class, students are expected to improve their technique and sound when it comes to playing an instrument.  Many teachers still enforce the standard practice of a playing test, which is typically done in front of one’s peers on a specific day.  But how can you truly assess someone of his or her growth when performance anxiety may play a huge role in the end result?  Some teachers have found that this rigid process is very ineffective in terms of progress assessment; although it may only require one day to ‘get through everyone’, it often becomes an unfair judgment.


Technology today is far more innovative than when I was in high school, even though that was only five years ago.  The following process is one that I plan to implement into my music classroom, and although I cannot take credit for the idea, I hope that other music teachers, like me will put this strategy into effect.  


A student enters the classroom knowing that today is the day that he will be tested on his trumpet.  He is a grade nine student who has only just begun playing and instrument for the first time in September.  It is now late in October, and he has been practicing hard both at home and in the morning ensemble classes.  He is not scared, because he knows that there is no pre-judgment, as he has never been tested before.  Yesterday, the teacher assured the class that they would not have to play in front of one another, but rather only her, in one of the practice rooms as the rest of the class has the period to work in sectionals on the two pieces of repertoire that they have been learning.  She then explains that she will be recording each of their playing tests as a way of assessing their progress throughout the year.


The teacher begins the class by leading a warm up so that everyone is in top-notch form.  Students will then take turns taking their test in the practice room as per a sign up schedule that was posted in the class last week.  Once the student enters the practice room, he or she is allowed to set up the music stand in which ever way is most comfortable for them, along with deciding whether they want to sit or stand.  From there, the teacher records the playing test while making a few notes.  Once the student has finished, her or she has the option to record again.  This is important especially for the first test as many students suffer from performance anxiety.  


A few days later, when all the playing tests are done, the teacher has each student listen to their playing test, assess what they have just heard, and only then does she explains to them their rubric markings.  The teacher may need to play the playing test a second time in order to accurately explain her assessment, and this is a good idea as it allows the student to have both a visual and aural assessment.  The teacher highlights the appropriate sections of a rubric in one distinct colour, gives a photocopy to the student and stores the original in a specific file for each student.  When the next playing test comes around, the teacher will use this original rubric for each student, but will highlight the appropriate sections in a different colour.  This process will allow students to visually see their own progress as well as areas in which they can improve.


This is a very strong way of assessing creativity as it includes both teacher and self-assessment.  It also allows the students to build on their learning, and to see how far they have come since the beginning of the school year.  Teachers should allow the students to compare their progress by listening to past recordings throughout the year, as this is also a great tool for motivating students to learn.  It is especially important that students listen to their first playing test following the last test of the year.  What a great way for students to see the actual result with documented proof.

===&lt;u&gt;A Unit Based on 'Creativity'&lt;/u&gt;===

'''''From Personal Experience...'''''

During second practicum, I decided that I wanted to further explore various approaches to assessing creativity within the classroom setting after having done a lot of research and engaging in great conversations with my seminar group.  With permission from my associate, I designed a ‘Self-Reflection’ unit for the grade nine vocal music classes that allowed them to explore their creative side while learning basic skills on how to analyze music.  I tailored this unit towards the current interests of the grade nines as I used a variety of music samples from those artists who they listen to on a daily basis.  I used weekly listening quizzes as a diagnostic assessment for what the students needed specific lessons geared towards and I fabricated my lessons to fill in the gaps in their learning.  


The summative activity for this unit was the ‘Self-Reflection’ project (or presentation), for which I allowed the students the freedom to choose how they wanted to create the visual aspect, but at the same time, I guided them through the assignment with a clear outline of specific requirements that needed to be included in some manner.  The various dates for this project were clearly outlined on a calendar in the classroom, so that the students would always know what to expect during each class.  A total of one hour of class time was given for this project over a span of two weeks (excluding other accompanying activities), which allowed them to collaborate with one another in order to format their project.  During this time I divided my time equitably between the class in order to give guidance or support in any possible means that I could.  


Just as there always seems to be one student who has trouble staying on task, so was the case in both of the grade nine classes.  In order to ensure success from all the students, I had the students write a ‘progress report’, which was their opportunity to tell me, in writing, what they were creating for their project, what they had done thus far, and most importantly what supports I could give them (if needed).  This activity confirmed many of my initial observations, which highlighted that the vast majority of the students in both classes were making good progress; however a few students did not fit into this category and I quickly turned my attention towards them.  A couple of the students had been off ill and needed some assistance as to how they might get started so late in the game, whereas other students were fundamentally unsure of their project.  I addressed each matter individually and offered extra help before and after school, which was an offer that I had extended to all students.  I myself created my own project to share with the students, which further excited some, or gave direction to those in need as the students became more self-directed.  


The summative project was due the week following March Break as I did not want any of the students to feel pressure to do work over the break.  I was thrilled with the projects that came in as they were all very individual and contained a great deal of creativity and imagination.  I received projects ranging from abstract drawings to music videos, dance presentations to original piano compositions.  I evaluated each project based on four rubrics, (*) which included assessment strategies both formal and informal: 
	
*1) Theory   
*2) Communication (the project/presentation itself)
*3) Creation* (the process) 
*4) Thinking and Inquiry (written reflection)

Marking these projects was very difficult even after creating a rubric with the students however, I decided to mark based on the rubric for everyone first, and then assigned four separate grades based on the rubric and strands of assessment and then gave consistent equitable grades.  I put a lot of thought and consideration into these grades and provided each student with detailed comments regarding their areas of strengths and personal connections to their project.


'''''Reflection'''''

The response that I received from this unit was overwhelmingly positive and not only did I receive praise from my associate (as this unit “encouraged students to explore other avenues of art”), but I received a phone call from one of the grade nine parents who was very thankful for my “allowing [of her] daughter to explore such creativity and share her gifts (for the first time) with an audience (the class)”.  This particular student had written an original piano composition based on the song Winter by Tori Amos, and not only was it an outstanding piece, but she performed it with extreme grace, passion and confidence.  


My experience with this unit was very rewarding, full of many unforgettable moments that I will always treasure.  I believe that each person has a gift to share and this project allowed me to uncover many hidden talents within the various arts disciplines.  It is projects like these that students will never forget as you take them ‘outside the box’ from the traditional ways of thinking.  The students have learned a new appreciation for songs they relate to on a personal level and I learned the value of assessment and feedback as seeing the students read over my comments was a very rewarding experience.

== Magical Creatures ==

Forgive me for poking my nose in here, but I see that withinFocus hasn't answered your question yet, so I thought that as another relatively major contributor I should try to answer.

Features in a magical creature? Well, that's very much up to you. What normally I would suggest there would be either a quick description of the physical or magical characteristics of a creature, with emphasis on the specific characteristics that are involved in the story. For instance, the Murtlap, characteristics could mention basic shape (rat-like with sea-anemone-shaped growth) and definitely should mention story related features (tentacles have healing qualities). Creatures like the Ashwinder, of course, that have no real story role, should only get a physical description. We have to limit the amount of description, that box being meant for a quick once-over only.

Hope that helps. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:46, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

:It did help. Seeing as some creatures have quite a few features, I was wondering which go in that box. Thanks --Cysiro ([[User:Cysiro|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;]]) ([[User_talk:Cysiro|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]) 17:11, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

::Just have to pick the most important... important being what, if anything, plays a part in the story. In the case of Acromantulae, it's hard to tell... spiders, venom, large size, sentience, and ability to talk are all important. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:30, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

:For editing questions Chazz is your best bet as he's the most active lately. Thanks for your contributions. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:04, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

== Info boxes at the top of the article ==

I note that in the info area for the spell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wingardium Leviosa|Wingardium Leviosa]], you have added a link back to Magic#Spells. Generally, we haven't been doing that; normally, we would just leave it as &quot;Spell (Charm)&quot;. While I understand the reasoning, there are about a hundred magical items that would have to be altered at this point if we were to make that consistent, and probably two hundred characters... and characters would be a real bugbear, as (for instance) Draco is in the Slytherin House group, in the Death Eaters group, in the Malfoy Family group, and in the Inquisitorial Squad (if we have as yet created a group for them), and which of those would you link back to? I suspect it's probably best to just allow backtracking by means of the &quot;breadcrumbs&quot;. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:20, 11 April 2008 (UTC)
:I did see your response here, and felt I couldn't add anything to it... why I said nothing.
:I'm still not convinced of the value in having a back link to the magic page, but I have no objection to it. It is slightly redundant because of the breadcrumbs (top left of page, any Magic page will have links to Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter &gt; Magic on it) but because it goes back to the section rather than just to the Magic page, it still has some small value. I won't quibble, and won't revert, if you want to put those in. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:16, 13 April 2008 (UTC)

== Clabbert ==

I'm away from my sources and can't check that at the moment, but that page is scheduled for a visit soon anyway. If you wish, you can move the page, which would correct the spelling; or I can do that later -- someone's going to have to revisit that page anyway.

By the way, signing your comments with four tildes &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; is always appreciated, as that way we know immediately who made the comment. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:05, 11 April 2008 (UTC)

:I moved the Clabert to Clabbert, and changed it on the Magic page. I'm not sure how to delete the old one. ~''Cysiro'' ([[User:Cysiro|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;]]) ([[User_talk:Cysiro|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]) 07:14, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

::Taken care of. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:58, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

== One other thing... ==

So long as you are going through the various magical items, there is one other thing that you might look at. We changed the standard framework some time back, so as to allow some magic description before the spoiler, and that change has not yet replicated throughout the Magic area. If you could, it would be useful to make that change as you go by...

The old framework looked, in part, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

== Analysis ==

&lt;/pre&gt;

Updated, the same part looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;

== Overview ==

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

== Analysis ==

&lt;/pre&gt;

If you could, inserting that Extended Description, and perhaps breaking the text into what belongs before the spoiler warning, and what belongs after, would be extremely useful. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:39, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

== First sentences ==

I have no real issue with it either way... but it has been bold italic since I started working here a couple years back, so I have continued in the same vein. If there is guidance in a Wikibooks style guide, I would accept that over Wikipedia's style guide. 

One thing to be aware of: I suspect there are at least 300 pages that are done consistently in the bold italic style. It would be a tedious job to make the change to simple bold, and we stand a very good chance of losing consistency. I personally feel that there is no point in making a change that involved for purely cosmetic reasons. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:30, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

:Actually, the [[WB:MOS#Content layout|Wikibooks Manual of Style]] states: &quot;It is suggested that: ...the first use of the title words or words that are akin in sentiment to the title words are marked in '''bold'''... when a new term is introduced, the term is ''italicised''.&quot; I suppose that the idea of bold and italics was that this is not only the title, but the first use of the term. And of course, it is only suggested, which tends to lighten the weight of the recommendation.

:That said... I have no objection if you want to change the standard, but I don't see any significant difference in appearance, and don't think it's worth the effort of doing it manually. If I felt a need for it, I would talk to Whiteknight, and see if he could do it with a bot. If you do want to it manually, I would drop a note on Whiteknight's, mike.lifeguard's, AdRiley's, and withinfocus' Talk pages, so they don't revert you thinking you're vandalizing.

:And I will quietly point out that you were, at one point, going to go through the magic pages classifying spell types, and lost interest after doing 9 of the hundred or so. If you are going to change formatting like this, you really should plan to set aside enough time to do the whole project, rather than leaving us with two different standards. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:37, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

Yeah, I'm not really interested in that so please don't continue. We've been doing it this way since the book's inception and I don't really care what any style guides external to our book are saying (despite that they don't disagree with what we're doing anyway). We have our own procedure and two of us (me, the person who created the entire system in the first place, and Chazz who does almost all the editing nowadays) aren't that interested, so I'll say this is a no-go. Please revert what you've done or tell me what you've done and I will take care of it. I like that you want to do work here, but I don't feel this is a supported change and there is better work to be done elsewhere. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:36, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks for changing it back. In the end I feel we could definitely use your talents on something else and don't think such a change is necessary. If you were to see our book in LaTeX or PDF format you would notice that it's more pleasing to the eye as well. I certainly don't want to scare you away from the Guide. Good luck with all the other tasks our book needs. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:12, 13 July 2008 (UTC)

== Magic item... ==

Hate to trouble you with this. I note that you made a change so that Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes was a footnoted reference... but somehow, that also made all of the Unforgivable Curses become footnoted with Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Did you want to straighten that out? Or should I? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:32, 13 July 2008 (UTC)

:A bit of a fight to find information on reference groups, but it is now dealt with. And it's not ideal, but it is, I think, the best we can do for now. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:09, 13 July 2008 (UTC)

== In re Rolanda Hooch ==

I am somewhat unsure of whether Rolanda is actually given as a name for Madam Hooch in the books or not. I seem to have a faint memory of McGonagall using the name in warning at some point, but I don't know exactly where and I can't put my finger on it now.

On the other hand: According to the FAQs on Rowling's site, there were in fact two sets of cards, the trading cards game and the Chocolate Frog cards. While Rowling has stated that she was the author of the descriptions on the cards, she didn't say which set, though of course it could be both. As such we could consider the cards canon as well, though we tend to deprecate them. The reason we don't have Quirrell's full name on the article title is that one set of cards gave his name as Quirinus, the other as Slatero, leaving us with no valid authority. Apparently, both sets of cards give Madam Hooch's first name as Rolanda.

On the gripping hand: I am currently working my way through the characters, trying to complete at least the &quot;role in the books&quot; sections. Several supporting characters appear many more times in the books than they do in the summaries: Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan being classic examples, along with Alicia Spinnet, Katie Bell, and Angelina Johnson. I'm keeping notes of these characters as I find them, and will do a full re-read of the series with them in mind once I've finished the easy ones. Madam Hooch is already listed among them; if it turns out that her first name is not given in the books on careful re-read, I will change the article name.

I would suggest that the person to ask there would be Withinfocus. I'm really more of a writer; he's more on the policy side. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:31, 8 October 2008 (UTC)

== Umm... a small suggestion? ==

Instead of going over and over and over stuff that is already present, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|one particular chapter of the Muggles' Guide]], perhaps I could suggest that there are still a lot of empty areas, notably in analysis both of the books and of the characters, that could use new content? I'm not saying that what we have is perfect, but I think that at the moment we are still far more in need of new stuff, rather than polishing what we already have. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:40, 17 October 2008 (UTC)
:Where else? Oh, there are so many... let me see. At this point, we have summaries for all of the chapters of the books, but the Analysis and Greater Picture sections on all of them are sorely lacking, except in a few places like PS1, which has, I think, rather been worked to death at this point. We're sort of breaking questions in the chapters into Review for the ones that are answered in the summary, and Further Study for those that aren't. In Characters, I'm dealing with the role in the books sections, but the Analysis still needs work in a lot of places. Many bits of Magic still need Analysis and Greater Picture. Many of the magical creatures mentioned in FBaWTFT need actual write-ups; they are just placeholders now, but as it was ChazzJr who wanted them in there, if he doesn't write them up I guess it will fall to me. Major Events are languishing, and we're likely to have missed several, particularly ones that occur in DH. I guess, pretty much across the board, we need work on analysis. If you don't feel that your strength lies in analysis, we still need Overview and General Description work done on a lot of items in Magic and Major Events.

Ke2 is considered to be a very dubious move. The problems with 2. Ke2? are that the King move prevents castling to protect the King, endangers the King, ignores development and the center, and blocks the Queen and Bishop, which are the two pieces that are free after 1. e4. All that being said, it can be used as a surprise to unseat Black, as many novices may be unable to cope with the unfamiliar board positions of the Boungcloud Attack. However, if it has been encountered before, it usually results in a defeat for White.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Creativity and Mindfulness'''&lt;/big&gt; – (James C, Lisa, Eli, Jonathan, Christopher)


'''Thesis'''

Creativity and mindfulness are two psychological elements highly conducive to effective learning.  By facilitating creative approaches to educational tasks, students are better able to actively participate in the learning process in a potentially open, engaging and stimulating manner.  A creative mindset forces a teacher to think outside the box, abandoning more traditional approaches to education such as lecturing, excessive overheads, learning strictly by rote, or a “chalk and talk” methodology.  Creative thought (or divergent thought) is defined as “a mental process involving the generation of new ideas or concepts, or new associations between existing ideas or concepts” (Wikipedia).  In context of education, creativity encourages an educator to attentively assess the various types of learners within the classroom, and to actively employ original and appropriate approaches to learning to reach all levels and skill sets.  Attention is one of the most powerful tools to be exploited by an educator in terms of student engagement.  The question is: how does a teacher achieve and sustain high levels of attention within the classroom?  We would argue that innovative and creative approaches to lesson plans and classroom instruction are one of the most effective means of achieving this state. Let us now explore some strategies involved in creating such approaches. 

As explored by Woodfolk et al., educators can implement a variety of creative teaching techniques in the classroom including: spontaneous and surprising physical action, the use of bright colour on the board and with notes, the use of scripted and spoken word with academic subjects, posing intriguing questions, variance in tasks and instruction, changing physical environment (lighting, décor), and variance in vocal tone and volume level during instruction.  In order to gain student’s attention, avoid flicking lights or clapping hands as in a traditional approach.  Instead, try to incorporate the sound of a bell, a wind chime, or even a Tibetan singing bowl (as recently done in a class workshop).  The intention is to emphasize “variety, curiosity, and surprise” (Woodfolk et al.) within students. 

'''Mindfulness'''

Mindfulness, practiced both by teachers and students alike, is yet another positive means of maintaining focus, building classroom community, and optimizing learning potential.  Mindfulness can be approached from two major aspects: cognitive, psychological mindfulness (general awareness and attention), or an Eastern, Buddhist approach to mindfulness including the practice of meditation, consciousness and the application of current moment perception (the power of the “Now”).  From the Western standpoint, mindfulness is defined as an active attentiveness to task and detail.  This is a quality that all educators and parents alike strive to nurture within a student in terms of their daily focus regarding academic tasks.  From the Eastern standpoint, mindfulness is defined as “a technique in which a person becomes intentionally aware of their thoughts and actions in the present moment, non-judgmentally” (Wikipedia).  It should be mentioned that mindfulness is a skill that needs to be both practiced and developed.  Ideally, an educator could provide a student with the tools to enhance this skill.  Further, in order to facilitate an environment conducive to mindfulness, considerations around disciplinary measures needs to be taken into account.  Educators need to move away from a dictatorship approach to discipline to create an open, safe space for students and teachers alike to explore “the self”.

Let us explore the benefits of mindfulness in an educational setting and some of the tools used for its development.  Meditation is among the strongest act of pursuing mindfulness and there are several forms to partake of including: breath, mantra, visualization, and contemplation.  The intention of meditation is not necessarily to achieve a mindset completely devoid of thought, but rather a state of acknowledging thought and allowing it to pass through the consciousness without preoccupation.  Several studies have been conducted to display how mindfulness and meditative practices actively reduce distraction and help to avoid stress.  This is of particular use in the classroom to assist students with focus, and coping skills around stressful situations such as testing and examinations. 

Current moment perception also assists a student with actively receiving a speaker by removing a preoccupation with either the past (regret) or the future (anticipation).  With this type of self-focused exploration, students and educators develop the ability to “show up” in the classroom and in their daily lives.  They are better able to engage in active listening, be analytical with subject matter, and integrate their learning into their life experience.  Other benefits include the development of openness, self-awareness and insight, enhanced speaking and listening skills, and a consciousness of the diversity around them.  From a place of self-understanding comes an ability to appreciate the richness of another individual’s life experience.

'''Contemplative Education'''

A specific philosophy of higher education that actively implements the above-explored techniques is known as Contemplative Education.  Founded in the United State in 1974 by educator and practitioner Chögyam Trungpa, this mindful practice was incorporated into the Liberal Arts studies at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado.  Contemplative education “ infuses learning with the experience of awareness, insight and compassion for oneself and others through the practice of meditation and contemplative disciplines. It seeks to integrate the best of Eastern and Western educational traditions, helping students know themselves more deeply and engage constructively with others” (Wikipedia).  The act of learning is not solely a thinking mind activity, but rather an opportunity for a student to also examine their inner beings as a means of completely integrating what they have been taught.  The engagement in mindfulness awareness allows a student to reside in the present moment and to potentially deepen their academic study.  This philosophy was further applied to higher arts education with the Bachelor of fine Arts in Jazz and Contemplative Studies curriculum at The University of Michigan School of Music.  Within this program, meditation practice was combined with related studies in jazz and overall musical training.

“The value of contemplative education is measured in students’ ability to put their wisdom and insight into practice through creative, helpful and effective action” (Wikipedia).

'''An Exploration of Community'''

Creativity and mindfulness are elements actively supported in present-day communities including private, public and independent educational institutions throughout the globe.  We will further examine the application of these elements through community and educational philosophy models that demonstrate how creativity and mindfulness are actively nurtured, and positively implemented to produce abundant learning outcomes.  Such pedagogical models and communities include the One World Program at George Vanier Secondary here with the Toronto District School Board, an intimate spiritual university in New Brunswick called St. Stephen’s University, and the international Waldorf system.  With the exploration of these models and communities, we hope to abundantly express to our readers the importance of creativity and mindfulness in combination, and the potential abundant learning outcomes from their application within the classroom.  These models will be explored in terms of our text's theories, and used further to make recommendations to us - the new teachers entering the profession.  We will also be exploring and suggesting techniques to both promote and develop mindfulness more deeply.

'''Creativity'''

'''Introduction'''

What is creativity?  Is it something that can be learned in a classroom?  Certainly creativity means many things to many people and is often dependent on context for its definition.  The creative process involves many complex layers of cognition and though it is questionable whether or not we will ever fully comprehend all of the exact science behind creative thought, we can offer four characteristics often associated with creativity.  First, creativity always involves thinking or behaving imaginatively. Second, overall this imaginative activity is purposeful: that is, it is directed to achieving an objective. Third, these processes must generate something original. Fourth, the outcome must be of value in relation to the objective.

'''Theory'''

The definition of creativity is often assumed to imply a purely artistic setting, but is creativity not also a large component of science, mathematics, engineering, and business?  Without a quick definition for creativity that will suit all people at all times, we can examine some of the thought processes behind creative thought so that we might better understand how to foster creativity in our classrooms.  Leslie Owen Wilson, a professor of philosophy and education at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, highlights two types of thinking that are involved in creative thinking - ''convergence and divergence''.  

'''Divergent''' thinking is most usually associated with the ability to elaborate, to fluently think of varied and original ideas.  Brainstorming is one example of this type of thinking. 

'''Convergent''' thinking is defined as “the ability to use logical and evaluative thinking to critique and marrow ideas to ones best suited for given situations, or set criteria.”  This type of thinking is used to make well-formed decisions after consulting and evaluating an array of ideas and information (Wilson, 1997).  

The creative process involves a combination of these two types of thinking, forcing the practitioner to constantly transition from the scattering of ideas (brainstorming) to the refining of thoughts and concepts most applicable to the given situation (convergence).  This process can involve a lot of trial-and-error type of experimenting, but, as Wilson points out, the most successful “creative thinkers” are the those who were/are persistent with their efforts.  

Though the definitions for creativity may be infinite one thing that seems to be a consensus among cognitive theorists is that a “eureka!!” moment, or moment of creative inspiration cannot come of its own volition.  In order to achieve such a breakthrough, the practitioner must first have studied and attained a workable knowledge of requisite techniques and/or subject matter.  Without such knowledge, creative thought becomes aimless (devoid of  purpose) and lacks any concrete objective on which to substantiate value or relevance.

'''Application'''

At Georges Vanier secondary school in Toronto, Ontario there is a program called the One World Youth Arts Program (OWYAP).  This program is offered to students as part of the music curriculum and provides an open forum where students can share ideas and develop their creativity.  It is an open-enrollment program, meaning there are no prerequisite courses or formal music training required for admission.  Along with being a music course, the OWYAP offers students a chance to explore and embrace the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Through their music, students are encouraged to promote positivity, a strong spirit of community, and the idea that change starts from within. 

The delivery model for OWYAP is more that of an art or music recording studio than a traditional instrumental-music classroom.  Using Cubase software, students work individually at computer stations composing original scores, learning basic piano skills and elements of harmony.  They also have opportunity to collaborate with classmates on recording projects and/or live performances.  

The OWYAP stays true to our statements regarding creativity in that the more knowledge and ability students gain in terms of music theory, piano skills (the main interface with the Cubase software is a piano keyboard), and the recording equipment, the better able they will be to create coherent, imaginative and original compositions.  The core components of the OWYAP curriculum are student-derived, which allows the course to be tailored to individual wants and abilities.  This strong personal element provides students with the time and confidence to experiment with their work, allowing them to explore both ''divergent'' and ''convergent'' methodologies.  The main task for the instructor in such a setting is making sure the students stay on task, encouraging them to realize how their final product shows true value and connection to the original objective.  Having several chances to create original works throughout the semester allows students to see (hear) the improvement in their work and realize that knowledge is necessary for progress.      

Through promoting acquisition of a stronger skill set and knowledge base in a practical setting, as well as providing opportunity to immediately implement such newly acquired skills in a supportive environment, the OWYAP exemplifies an ideal classroom model for the development of creativity. 

'''A Challenge to all Classroom Instructors'''

The One World Youth Arts Project at Georges Vanier is a unique setting indeed and we can’t all be expected to provide such a highly individualized atmosphere for our students.  However, what we can do is try to realize specific elements within the OWYAP that promote creative thinking, supportive community and engaging curriculum, and work towards incorporating those elements into our own lessons.  The push towards standardization over the past century has become infectious even to our own personalities.  As classroom instructors we should not strive to get everyone on the same page, but challenge our students to find their own page, bringing original thoughts and personality into our classrooms.

'''The Role of Community'''

'''Introduction'''

While creativity has long been held as a formative aspect of any learning community, its converse is said to be just as true. The community in which an artist is raised and develops her craft has incredible significance in terms of her effectiveness and growth. Specifically, learning communities that value genuine relationships and caring are better facilitators of creativity. 

Another factor that is directly related to the quality of one’s learning community is one’s capacity for self contemplation, or mindfulness. Logically, communities that intentionally create space for mindfulness, or put another way (ironically), are mindful of its members’ mental wellbeing, tend to demonstrate a greater overall level of mental health and stability. Throughout this section, the validity of these claims will be demonstrated both theoretically and by referring to a specific example of such a community, currently functioning on our planet Earth.

'''Theory'''

In order to proceed, it is necessary to both identify what constitutes a genuine relationship, and define the term caring. Woolfolk et al. refer to an author named Nel Noddings, who for over ten years has written extensively on the value and importance of caring within educational systems. A core argument under-girding Noddings’ views, is that caring is an intrinsic necessity of human life - all people want and need to be cared for. She claims that it is a “longing for goodness that arises out of the experience or memory of being cared for…” (Flinders 2001, p. 211). An encounter with a student is definitive of caring when it exhibits the following characteristics: the ‘carer’ is reflectively oriented toward the ‘cared-for’ in a way that is receptively attentive, the carer demonstrates an active helpful interest that assumes action, and all of this is recognized by the ‘cared-for’ as an act of caring - that is, a measure of perception is required to authenticate the experience. Relationships between teachers and students that consistently involve this kind of caring might be called genuine relationships. 

Hence, having defined these terms, it is the learning communities that deliberately incorporate the primacy of genuine caring relationships into their vision that are the focus of this section. These structures tend to exclude those educators who are concerned solely with the financial aspects of their occupations to the exclusion of all else - those who are “putting in time” and do not care about their students.

Creativity can be described as the spontaneous human response that results from provoked emotional dispositions. While such response might occur in an atmosphere of oppression or constraint, it absolutely flourishes when expressed from within an atmosphere of security, affirmation, and constructive inquiry. Hence, schools that foster these characteristics are excellent facilitators of creativity. 

Finally, while there are many individuals who have undertaken self-contemplative tasks, the degree to which a community encourages such behaviour directly affects the success of it. While this might seem obvious, it is imperative to recognize the simple reality underlying this idea: in our day and age, if you don’t make time for it, it will not happen. Also, it is important to note that, while certainly having roots in Eastern mythical religions, self-contemplation is a mental health activity that transcends boundaries of all kinds, being found in all major religions and people-groups throughout the world. For that reason, it is completely viable as a solution for stress, and may be effectively used in some capacity within any educational institution to promote mental health and wellbeing.

'''St. Stephen’s University'''

One such institution (though be it post-secondary) is a small trans-denominational Christian liberal arts school in the tiny town of St. Stephen, New Brunswick. This school has begun to draw world-wide attention for its uplifting community dynamics, which among many other things, foster both creativity and self-contemplation. The school is situated on a hill near the St. Croix river - a scenic property that supports a number of individual rustic multipurpose buildings, all of which have both bedrooms and classrooms. From simple maintenance to cleaning, students living within these buildings are responsible for their cleanliness on a scheduled weekly basis. Excellent cooking is also done by the students, who eat in a large family-like room with lots of small tables to facilitate interpersonal relationships: professors and students alike eat together and informally discuss issues both academic and personal.

Mindfulness, or contemplative space more generally, is fostered in many ways at St. Stephen’s University. First, there are three weekly chapel meetings that happen after lunch, where various members of the community and student body are invited to share an inspirational message. Second, time for prayer is allocated before the beginning of any meal. Specifically, those who are waiting in line for food form a rough circle, join hands, and rather than only offering words of thanks for their food, pray for those in need in their community, or even pressing issues facing the world. Third, contemplative space is considered especially important in class settings, where significant issues are often discussed in terms of their personal relevance and meaning. Lastly, physical space is abundant on the property, which is full of unique nooks and crannies that can be used for reflective purposes.

Genuine relationships and caring are of supreme importance for this school. Many of the professors at the university have moved to this small town of 3000, in order to be more closely involved with the school and deepen its sense of community. While professional boundaries are always upheld, many of them even invite students into their houses for meals or other events. Living in residence is mandatory at SSU, as they believe that the experience of living in close proximity to others is a valuable life tool. 

Within this context of genuine relationships and consequently acceptance, creativity flourishes. The school brims with artists of all kinds: musicians, sculptures, painters, poets, and more. Each year the school hosts a fantastic arts night featuring student compositions and works. Furthermore, students are specifically invited to use their creativity within the community for purposes of social justice and healing. In general however, the focus of the school is to promote academic excellence combined with competence in life. Overall, this produces highly motivated students unlike many other Canadian universities, whose students often report the contrary.

'''A Translation into Our World'''

Within the public school setting (at both elementary and secondary levels), deliberate considerations need to be made about the quality of the community the students and teachers are both involved in. While this is certainly related to external factors, perhaps the greatest factor is internal: the vision that unifies a school’s staff, and the degree to which its teachers adhere to it. Even if we as teachers, find ourselves in schools that do not overtly mandate their governing members to the necessity of genuine relationships or to the use of mindfulness, we ourselves can make choices to orient ourselves in such ways, and perhaps thereby provide the help and encouragement that students need to survive in such hostile places.

'''Waldorf Education''' 

'''History'''

Waldorf education has its roots in the spiritual-scientific research of the Austrian scientist and thinker Rudolf Steiner.  In April of 1919, Rudolf Steiner visited the Waldorf Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart, Germany. Germany, defeated in war, was on the brink of economic, social, and political chaos. Steiner spoke to the workers about the need for social renewal, for a new way of organizing society and its political and cultural life.  
Emil Molt, the owner of the factory, asked Steiner if he would establish and lead a school for the children of the employees of the company.  Steiner agreed but set four conditions: 1) that the school be open to all children; 2) that it be coeducational; 3) that it be a unified twelve-year school; 4) that the teachers, those individuals actually in contact with the children, have primary control of the school, with minimum interference from the state or from economic sources. Steiner's conditions were radical for the day, but Molt gladly agreed to them. On September 7, 1919, the independent Waldorf School opened its doors.
There are now more that 900 Waldorf schools in 83 countries around the world, Waldorf education is the fastest growing independent education movement in the world.  

'''Developmental Structure'''

The structure of the education follows Steiner's pedagogical model of child development, which views childhood as divided overall into seven-year developmental stages, each having its own learning requirements; the stages are similar to those described by Piaget.

'''Early Childhood'''

Waldorf schools approach learning in early childhood through imitation and example. Extensive time is given for guided free play in a classroom environment that is homelike, includes natural materials and provides examples of productive work in which children can take part; such an environment is considered by Waldorf pedagogues to be supportive of the physical, emotional and intellectual growth of the child through assimilative learning.

'''Elementary School Years'''

Waldorf schools regard learning at this stage as artistic and imaginative. The elementary school centers around a multi-disciplinary arts-based curriculum that includes visual arts, drama, artistic movement (eurythmy), vocal and instrumental music, and crafts.

'''Adolescence'''

To meet the developing capacity for abstract thought and conceptual judgment Waldorf schools place the emphasis on learning through intellectual understanding and ethical thinking, including taking social responsibility.  Although education now focuses much more strongly on academic subjects, students normally continue to take courses in art, music, and crafts. Pupils are encouraged to develop their own independent and creative thinking processes. 

'''Mind, Body, Spirit''' 

The specific goals of Waldorf education are:
1.   Creative thinking including: imagination, flexibility, and focus
2.   Emotional intelligence, empathy, and self-esteem
3.   Physical vitality, stamina, and perseverance
4.   Spiritual depth gained through an appreciation and responsibility for nature, work, and for their fellow human beings
Waldorf education addresses these goals through interdisciplinary, integrative practical, artistic, and intellectual elements, and coordination with the natural rhythms of everyday life. The Waldorf approach emphasizes the role of the imagination in learning, developing thinking that includes a creative as well as an analytic component. 

“For us being human is to be artistic and to express yourself through the arts. So for us it's not a tacked-on added extra, we try, certainly in the younger years to make every lesson artistic. We start with music, we have verse, we draw in books, we express visually, all of these things give the child security, and it also fosters in them a feeling for other people, and a feeling for beauty, which for us is very central to living.  ” Andrew Hill, Waldorf Class Teacher

Waldorf education is designed to simultaneously foster creativity and mindfulness or emotional intelligence. Waldorf students acquire the ability to express themselves through painting, drama, music, crafts, movement, and writing. All lessons are reinforced through the learning community that is established around each class where one teacher, one group of children, and their parents remain together for eight or more years. Waldorf education fosters self-esteem by recognizing that each child brings gifts above and beyond the ones that can be measured on an exam. The book, Habits of Mind, published by the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, relates a series of attributes that describe what intelligent people do when they are confronted with problems that are seemingly unsolvable. These attributes, such as: Persisting, Managing Impulsivity, Listening with Understanding and Empathy, Thinking Flexibly, Gathering Data Through All Senses, and Responding with Wonderment and Awe, are woven into the Waldorf approach to education.

'''Recommendations for Mainstream Education'''

The holistic, spiritual, creative and mindful basis of Waldorf education is considered to be a healing education that would benefit all students regardless of ability or need, an education that is universally designed.  Mainstream educators have recommended the integration of the arts into traditional content, a pedagogy that embodies the American psychologist Howard Gardner’s “Theory of Multiple Intelligences” and the current trend in education of Differentiating Instruction, as an effective stimulator of spiritual-aesthetic, intellectual and physical development as seen in Waldorf education.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ART EDUCATION FOR THE BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED==
===Thesis=== 

Art education is essential for a well-rounded academic program that contributes to higher order thinking skills across all disciplines.  Art education provides children with a fully integrated appreciation of culture and community.  Art is a powerful means of expression that enables the child to develop a wide range of skills such as: leadership, teamwork, communication, self-discipline, self-expression &amp; creativity.  Art education has many benefits and students with special needs should not be excluded, however, often teachers are ill informed of the variety of ways to integrate a child with special needs in the arts classroom.  This paper will discuss: the importance of learning visual art, understanding visual impairments, how to foster an inclusive atmosphere, motivation as well as provide an array of teaching strategies in the visual arts classroom for the blind and visually impaired student. 

===The Importance of Learning Visual Art===

In the 1980’s arts education for the blind was thought to be unimportant or impossible, there was a clear need to be met- busy teachers needed not to reinvent the wheel but the blind and visual impaired students needed not to be excluded.  Some may inquire, “Why teach art to people who are blind?” People with sight loss/impairment are as likely to have a need to make and appreciate art as those with sight, their mental visual activity continues even after loss of sight and engagement in the visual arts is possible regardless of the degree of their visual activity.  Despite a students abilities, arts education will help all students develop critical thinking skills, language skills, cooperative learning, self-awareness, self-confidence, sensory development (there is multi-sensory art experiences in the creation of art) and manual dexterity (working with a variety of tools and materials). 

===Understanding Visual Impairments===

Studies indicate that 10-20% percent of people considered legally blind are totally without sight, and 20% of school-age children are visually handicapped have no useable vision.  However, 80% of visually impaired individuals have some residual vision that can be used in daily activities (Besr &amp; Corn, 1983).  This information aids art educators in understanding why the majority of people who are blind are able to respond to some visual stimuli, and why their visual memories act to enhance the creation process.  There are three main categories of vision loss: Loss of central vision caused by disease, loss of peripheral vision and or overall blurring or haze.  However, we must be mindful that not all visual impairments are the same, for example, in a classroom with all visually impaired students, each student will have individual characteristics to their sight loss or impairment.  Student’s functional needs will also vary, some students may use vision for aspects in learning whereas others will not, it is of importance for all educators to familiarize themselves with a students IEP so that they may accommodate their individual needs.

===Fostering an Inclusive Atmosphere===

In order to implement inclusiveness in the classroom it is important to be aware of any form of stereotyping, for example, blind and visually impaired people relate to the visual arts in a variety of ways, just as sighted people.  Some students may enjoy tactile contact with art while others may demonstrate very little interest in touch as a means of artistic or aesthetic experience, regardless of the characteristics or degree of their visual handicapped.  Some students learning and appreciation of the arts involve creative process and imagination, rather than merely touch as a means of art education. These student would benefit most by stimulating their visual memory, you can achieve this by describing an event, place or object, which may trigger their memory and personal experiences. Personally, I may evoke this in the students to trigger various levels of emotion, which may allow them to produce astonishing works of art that are highly emotive and self-expressive.  According to Rogow (2000) people with visual impairments rely on their environment as a crucial role in providing a means to explore the world around them; when vision is absent language serves as a means to establish and maintain contact with other people.  Educators must avoid phrasing instruction with: “This or that, here or there” to avoid confusion, you must be able to communicate with specific verbal instruction, doing this will allow the visually impaired student to feel confident &amp; included in the classroom.  Dokecki (1966) states that it is important for teacher to use verbal communication naturally, and not hesitate or avoid using words such as “see” or “look” because visual terms are necessary for all student to have complete competence in language so that they may participate as functional members in society.

===Theory: Motivation===

Once you establish a friendly and trusting relationship with the student an approach to help motivate them is to build their self-esteem and confidence by sharing with them famous artists that had visual impairments, including but definitely not limited to artists such as: Monet, Van Gogh, Degas and Rembrandt etc..  There are also many contemporary artists with visual impairments that you may wish to invite as guest speakers or to conduct a workshop, perhaps you may even wish to take you class on a field trip to view an exhibition by these artists.

===Specific Strategies for the Visual Arts Classroom===

Initially, it is essential to integrate the student with impaired vision into the classroom by describing the configurations of room, if you must change the position of furniture in your classroom remember to describe the new configurations to the student.  Teacher should also inform students that use optical devices that they may move closer to diagrams or demonstrations. Educators must also accommodate students by eliminating clutter, placing materials within reach of the student and being mindful of the size, colour and contrast of print on handouts.  Lighting is also of importance for students with impaired vision, some may find window glare and light reflecting off shiny surfaces unbearable, to accommodate them you can position demonstrations in other places in the classroom, adjust shades and allow students to move seats if so desired. It is also wise to identify yourself when you approach a visually impaired student as well as seek permission from the student before you physically guide them to an object.  Teachers must be mindful that a person classified as legally blind may still have usable vision, in which it does not significantly alter functional ability and it is important to realize that a legally blind person may be able to function visually for a variety of tasks.  However, some students with visual impairments may need to look off center to see things more clearly, it is important not to interpreted that as inattention or negatively on the part of the student.  

Visual Art teachers may question to what extent a blind person can appreciate and create art and to whether or not they have the necessary knowledge in order to provide the blind or visually impaired student with the best arts education.  An educator may inquire- Can blind persons learn about different art styles?  Can blind people learn as sighted people do to identify different time periods?  Blind people can learn to understand perspective in a tactile drawing, but can they learn to understand perspective in an artwork?  Are blind or visually impaired people limited to sculpture or can they learn to draw? What are light, colour and form to a blind person?  Perhaps we can better understand a visually impaired or blind person if we attempt to comprehend a glimpse of their experiences. For example, lets us imagine that we are nearsighted and we remove our glasses to watch television, the images are not being viewed as intended by the network but rather the images appear dream-like with patterns and construed colour, for some this may be a negative experience but for the artist, this is a rare and amazing gift.  This experience opens the artists up to a world where her or she is able to transform these experiences into personal interpretation based on only how they see the world.  Parents and arts educators should encourage this and assist the students by stimulating their visual memory and or emotions.  People that are blind or visually impaired have the ability to draw quite accurately; they are able to transfer knowledge from exploring the world around them to depicting vantage point and perspective in their artwork.  For e.g., they are able to understand and draw the side-view and top-view of a vehicle and they can identify foreground and background- they know that the girl standing in front of the tree is larger in the picture plane then objects in the distance.  Revensz (1950) concluded that people with visual impairments do have some form of spatial perception, which was based on the records from Von Senden’s 1932 study of people with visual impairments (pp.86). However, Revensz also proposed that people with visual impairments cannot “properly” perceive beauty or create artistic images (pp87). Quite frankly, I find that statement rather appalling because his definition of beauty and creation is defined by the sightless person not being able create works of art based on their inability to see object’s in this world of all it’s beauty, nature &amp; glory. He states that the blind person is limited to only the “material sphere” but who is to say that beauty can only be expressed through ones visual experiences, on the contraire I believe what restricts many artists in the creation process is over-analyzation, responding with minimal sight to a stimulus can inspire remarkable works of art that are beautiful, memorable and emotionally compelling!  “Only when he no longer knows what he is doing does the painter do good things” (Degas).

===Equipment, Material &amp; Instructional Suggestions===

Other things to consider is equipment and materials in the classroom, such as: enlarging devices, magnifying lens, three-dimensional Marquette’s and tactile materials such as drawing boards (which add great tactile and/ textural elements to the composition), raised-line paper, raised-line drawings of images, diagrams, charts &amp; illustrations.  Raised-line drawings will assist the teacher in explaining art history to the blind or visually impaired student.  The use of visual storyboards and technological aids may enhance the concept of the lesson or demonstration.  When teaching painting, place colour in the same order on the palette from left to right- white, yellow, orange, red, purple, blue, green, brown and black.  Use non-spill containers for liquid mediums and place paint containers in a narrow lipped tray, organize all dry mediums (For e.g., Conte, pastel, colour pencils etc.) in a specific order and keep all heat emitting equipment in a safe and controlled area away form traffic zones.  Students that are blind or visually impaired enjoy working with high contrast mediums, so it is feasible to have some bright paint available.  Lastly, check frequently for the student’s comprehension as instruction proceeds and be mindful of background noises that can make instruction inaudible. 

===Conclusion===

Students with special needs will enter our classrooms, we as Art Educators need to share our passion for the arts with these students, often these learners are “overlooked” or “worked around” because of our lack of tools or knowledge, however the best way to inquire this knowledge is to get to know our students, to further educate ourselves of their needs as well as to encourage them to expressed themselves and to take risks in their work.  Art educators need to provide blind and visual impaired children with the same opportunities as their peers, by being mindful of any stereotyping, by teaching them art skills, by exposing them to a variety of mediums and through teaching them about great art in order to encourage art appreciation and a love for life-long learning.

==SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS IN THE MUSIC CLASSROOM==
===Thesis===

Being an arts educator to special needs students is both a rewarding and challenging task.  Teaching the arts, specifically music, can be a motivating and fun way to teach all children, especially those with distinct learning needs.  Essentially, the purpose of this paper is to show the benefits of teaching the arts, in specifically music, to students with special needs, to express the importance of creating an inclusive environment in the classroom, and to also discuss certain strategies, resources, and ideas to use in the secondary school level to help special learners succeed.  

===The Importance of Learning Music===

It is important to note the benefits that learning music can have on a child’s growth and development.  Firstly, music has been shown to help students who are cognitively challenged.  For example, learning through songs works as a mnemonic device to assist in memory and learning by organizing and breaking down information into pieces, thus, making it easier for a student to retain and encode what they are learning (Lazar, 2008) . Thus, when teaching a student a concept such as the alphabet, the months in a given year, or a historical figure, if taught through a song, there is a greater chance that students will learn and retain these concepts easier.  Teaching music has also been shown to benefit students with communication barriers.  Essentially, singing and speech share many similarities because when a person sings, this requires them to use their speech as well.  For example, songs of varying lengths can increase the duration of a child’s speech, while rhythm can be used as a timing cue to aid in speech pacing and intelligibility (Lazar, 2008). Thus, music can be used as a means to improve a student’s functional communication.   Lastly, learning music has been shown improve and develop a child’s gross motor skills.  Research shows that basic skill areas such as visual-motor integration, bilateral integration, imitating movement, or crossing midline can be targeted with rhythmic activities (Lazar, 2008).  For example, learning a particular dance style, or learning songs such as The Hokey Pokey, provide opportunities for the growth and development of a variety of motor skills.  Thus, the aforementioned information exhibits how music can positively impact a child's growth and development.     

===Fostering an Inclusive Environment===

When teaching special needs students, it is crucial for an educator to foster inclusion in the classroom.  Implementing an inclusive atmosphere allows all students to feel valued, included, and appreciated.  There are a variety of considerations for inclusion in the classroom that educators should be accustomed to.  Firstly, it is crucial for an educator to know their students.  For example, if a student has an Individual Education Plan (IEP), it is imperative for an educator to read through that student’s IEP and find out as much about the student’s disability as possible.  From this, an educator can deduce what services the student might need in the classroom, what the strengths and weakness of the student are, etc.  Also, it is important for educators to know their colleagues and the Special Ed staff within the school.  Resources such as these can offer a wealth of strategies pertaining to how certain students learn best, and also how to interact with particular students.   Thus, by researching and examining the disabilities of students in the classroom, an educator can make the proper accommodations and modifications which will not only ensure student success, but will also create an inclusive environment. 

===Theory: Motivation===

There are a variety of specific strategies that a secondary school educator can utilize in order to meet both the needs and interests of special learners in the classroom.  For example, if an educator comes across a student with a physical disability, how would they go about choosing a suitable instrument for them to play?  When selecting musical instruments for students with special needs, as with any other student, it is crucial for an educator to be aware of what motivates and interests the student.  This is a most important factor when choosing suitable instruments, because special learners will often overcome enormous odds when they are determined and inspired to do something (Hammel, 2004).  Also, when learning a new musical instrument, especially if no prior knowledge in music is evident, motivation and persistence are both essential.  Thus, when students are motivated, there is a greater chance that they will succeed which is why an educator must ask themselves, “What instrument holds the most attraction for the particular student?

===Specific Strategies for the Music Classroom===

Although motivation is key in terms of choosing a suitable instrument for an exceptional learner, depending on the student's needs, there may be a limit as to what instrument that student can play.  This is why exceptional learners need to be individually evaluated to determine both instrument preference and instrument suitability related to their particular disability. Nonetheless, there are a variety of instruments that can be adapted to suit the needs of all students.   For example, the piano can be adapted for one-handed players.  Essentially, a pianist who uses one hand will need music that combines the melody line with the accompaniment.  Fortunately, there is a vast selection of repertoire of music available for left-, or right-handed piano players.   Although standard brass instruments such as the trumpet are played right-handed, it is possible for it to be played left-handed.  In essence, only one hand is involved in forming the notes of the trumpet, whereas the other is used to support the instrument.  Thus, to compensate for this, all the teacher has to do is provide music stand which in turn, would support the instrument.  Lastly, stringed instruments can be adapted for one-handed players.  This can be done by playing with the bow in the left hand, and also, by bowing with a prosthesis.  Thus, when selecting instruments for students with special needs, it is crucial for an educator to be open-minded and accommodating.  


Lastly, there are a variety of ways to adapt and modify specific music for students with visual and learning disabilities.  For example, one way a piece of music can be altered is to have the student highlight the alternate staves.  Doing this would benefit a student with a visual impairment, or one with a learning disability who has trouble processing and following information.  Another way to modify a piece of music would be to write out all of the accidentals found within the key signature in front of the corresponding note(s).   This would be beneficial to a student who is cognitively challenged and has difficulty perceiving organizing information, as well as linking specific details together.  In more extreme cases, a final option would be to simplify the music by including only two or three notes.  The educator could then gradually add the rest of the notes onto the music once the student progresses and feels comfortable.  Thus, there are a variety of ways in which an educator can modify a specific piece of music to suit the learning needs of his/her students.

===Conclusion===

Therefore, the aforementioned information clearly shows how an educator can integrate, accommodate, and include special learners into a High school music classroom.   Moreover, one can see the importance that learning music can have on a student’s growth and development.  Also, the abovementioned information shows how many things in the music classroom, such as instruments, and the music itself, can be adapted and modified to suit the needs of special learners.  Doing this would allow special learners to experience and feel a sense of belonging and inclusion in the classroom.  Thus, although teaching and integrating special needs students into the classroom can be a challenging task, the rewards of seeing those students succeed despite the odds, significantly outweigh the challenges that the teacher and student could experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Arts for At-Risk Students'''&lt;/big&gt; - (Megan, Liz, Alex, Suzane, Alison D)

'''''What is an &quot;At Risk&quot; Student?''''

There are varying ideas as to what an at-risk student is.  Some suggest that an at-risk student is simply a student who is danger of 1) low academic achievement; or 2) dropping out of school.  However, this over simplification leads to dissent about whether or not those two criteria are actually worth the worry and that students who are defined as at-risk may still have successful and fulfilling lives.  Edward Rozycki writes in his article'' Identifying the &quot;at-Risk&quot; Student: What is the Concern?'': 

:::''Does low academic achievement in the lower grades, in high school, even, condemn one to a life of despair and ruin? I would think not. People mature at different rates and may not be able to take advantage of school offerings until well past their teen years. This is why community colleges have grown up. This is also why many traditional universities have special admissions programs. To pretend that life is over if high achievement has not happened before age 18, is to approach hysteria.
What about &quot;dropping out&quot; of high school? One of the things researchers complain constantly about is the vagueness of the term &quot;dropout.&quot; A student who &quot;drops out&quot; of a given high school may enroll in another. The statistics may not be adjusted to reflect this. Or she may complete a GED and go on to college through special admissions. Or she may go to community college, make up her high school work and go on to a four-year program. Or she (or he) may get a technical certificate, get a job in industry and continue her education in the corporate world.''

This definition relies heavily on statistics and grades.  Rozycki does not agree that one can only look at 'at-risk' students as being those who are in danger of getting 'bad grades' of dropping out and believes that the definition of 'at-risk' needs to be broadened.  

In his book ''Practical Classroom Strategies'', Michael Tudor gives a much better description of an at-risk student.  He states that:

:::''The term 'At-Risk' has been used to describe a population of students who are experiencing an unsuccessful education.  These students have not acquired the skills which society thinks is necessary to transfer to post secondary education or even to join the work force.  At riskness can cover problems ranging from incomplete homework and skipping classes to dropping, drug addiction, and suicide. '' 

This definition not only describes students at-risk for problems in school but also students who will be at-risk for having problems in life.  This definition supports the need to identify and aid those students who are at-risk in our school systems so that they can move on to post-secondary destinations with success.
  

'''''How does a student become at-risk?'''''

There are several factors that might play a role in creating an at-risk student. 
 
a. Living in high-growth areas

b. Living in unstable school districts

c. Being a member of a low-income family

d. Having low academic skills (though not necessarily low intelligence);

e. Having parents who are not high school graduates

f. Speaking English as a second language

g. Being single-parent children

h. Having negative self-perceptions; being bored and alienated; having low self-esteem

i. Pursuing alternatives; males tend to seek paid work as an alternative; females leave to have children or get married

j. Mental/physical illness

h. Not liking one's teacher or classmates (uncomfortable in the classroom/poor learning environment)


'''''How to Identify an &quot;At-Risk&quot; Student'''''

To help at-risk students, a school has to first identify those students who are at-risk and exactly where they need help in order to get them to become successful.  To do this, you cannot only look at a students grades or attendance, although those are both helpful factors in the identification of at-risk students.  Some students may only find themselves at-risk in one subject area but doing perfectly well in another or a student may be doing well academically but be at-risk of dropping out due to depression or to find work to help a low income family.



'''''The Program - ArtSmarts'''''

'''''Assumptions that Underpin the Program'''''

The ArtsSmarts program is often implemented in schools with a history of poor achievement and attendance, behavior problems, low parental involvement, and high staff turn-over.  The program operates on the assumption that integrating arts into the curriculum and into the classroom will improve the school experience for students, resulting in greater engagement of students in school.  Arts educators often contend that the arts and cross-curricular learning help students develop positive attitude toward school and others (less behaviour problems, more participation, and improved attendance); a sense of community and belonging; thinking skills, including improved comprehension, interpretation, and problem solving abilities; and a better self-concept of themselves as students because of their achievements in the arts, a strong work ethic (persisting in the face of difficulties). 

Today we recognize that not all students learn well through traditional methods: learning through the arts allows teachers to reach out to multiple intelligences by utilizing various different instructional strategies.  The arts are fun and make students feel good about themselves: in a supportive, creative classroom, the arts encourage enthusiasm, curiosity, interest in the learning, and build self-esteem.  Additionally, integrative activities help create a positive, emotionally connected learning environment and encourage the cultivation of closer relations between students and their teacher. Because students are more engaged in their learning and they may begin to experience small success, which helps them develop self-esteem, leading them to work harder and taking pride in their work.  


'''''Psychological Theories seen in the Program'''''

The most important theories seen in the ArtSmarts program are motivational theories. This program is designed largely to improve students' motivation to study a variety of academic subjects by incorporating arts and creative tasks into these subjects. This program gives students ownership of their artistic projects, such as murals or maps, and allows them to personalize their subject knowledge and make it relevent to their lives. This is an example of how the ArtSmarts program increases intrinsic motivation in students. Students are motivated by their desire to succeed and their pride in their own work, rather than extrinsic factors such as grades or material rewards. 

This program also relates to the Humanistic view of motivation, which emphasizes personal freedom, choice, self-determination and striving for personal growth. This program allows students to learn science, math, geography and other subjects in a way that allows them to make artistic choices, challenge themselves and grow through seeing their project through to completion. This program also builds self-esteem and self-worth and associates these with learning and school. Students begin to feel good about their school work and associate their positive feelings of self-esteem with learning, perhaps for the first time!

ArtSmarts also relates to the sociocultural views of motivation, which states that people engage in activities to devlop knowledge as they maintain their identities and interpersonal relations within a community. In other words, students learn how to be students through watching their peers and teachers. In this case students also learn how to be creative through watching community artists. They also witness these artists' learn through their work, providing lessons about life-long learning as well. Students improved self-efficacy through seeing others create tasks vicariously, thus improving their own performace or desire to complete similar activities, knowing they can be successful in this as well. Through watching community artists and their teachers participate successfully in these activities, students begin to find these artistic academic activities meaningful and worthwhile.

Finally, this program allows students to learn how to set goals. Students set goals about their individual works, creating mastery goals about mastering the artistic task set before them. Students also set social goals for interacting with their fellow artists on large projects. Many students will also set performance goals, to avoid looking stupid or inept in front of their peers, which will motivate them to put more effort into their school work. 

Of all the psychological theories we have studied in class, this program is most strongly tied to motivation. Students in ArtSmarts find meaning in the curriculum through working on authentic, artistic tasks and find positive reinforcement for academic work. For some at-risk students this program may be the first time they receive this positive reinforcement in a school atmosphere, which may deter negative behaviour and increase their engagement in learning. 

'''''Support for the Program'''''

In his studying of arts-based programs, Wahlstrom (2003) noted in that students who were not usually class leaders frequently took on leadership roles in the arts-integrated lessons, and children with disabilities of all types were more fully integrated into arts activities than other classroom activities.  Standardized tests of creativity also showed more highly developed creativity in students who participated in an arts-based program (Caslan 22). In surveys of the ArtsSmarts program, teachers, students and artists all reported positive changes in student behaviour, including increased attendance, homework completion and engagement in class, and fewer behavioural problems. Improved self-esteem students demonstrated strong artistic skills, readily took extra work home and learned more than they normally would. Many teachers observed that normally disruptive students often become focused and produce excellent work in arts activities (Caslan 19).  

ArtsSmart’s developed student questionnaires to explore four components (content, context, process and product, according to Karen Hume’s engagement model), and administered them to a large number of students who were being taught by an ArtsSmarts team.  The results of the survey suggested that students felt that the activities involved in the ArtsSmarts program were challenging and beneficial.  Students also indicated that they felt that through hard work they could be successful in all of the activities they were involved and that the activities motivated them to work harder and to feel proud of the work they had done.  (ArtsSmarts, Deconstructing Engagement 9-16).

The majority of students (78% agreed, 18% disagreed, and 4% were missing) were proud of the work they did in ArtsSmarts; most of the students (81% agreed, 13% disagreed, and 6% were missing) said that they could do even the hardest work on the project if they tried; and over 85% believed that they learned a lot from the artist. More than 80% of students believed that they were thinking more than just doing easy work. (Deconstructing  Engagement 13)

The majority of students (79% agreed, 16% disagreed, and 4% were missing) involved in the ArtsSmarts projects also believed that what they learned in the project could be used in other subjects. Almost 80% said that they would like to do an ArtsSmarts activity again, and most of them (68% agreed, 27% disagreed, and 5% were missing) said they worked harder on this project than any other project before.  (Deconstructing  Engagement 13)


'''''Some problems with the Program'''''

On the ArtSmarts website there are a variety of case studies from schools who have implemented the program. This site does a good job of documenting the program from its implementation to the aftermath. From these cases studies we will discuss the most common problems with the schools, seen in these schools.

Some problems with the program include: lack of support from parents, teachers and administrators, lack of teacher training in the arts and lack of measurable results in attendance and student behaviour. According to a variety of case studies published on the ArtSmarts website, the lack of support from parents stems from the belief that students should be focusing on math, science and literature rather than &quot;wasting time&quot; with the arts. Many teachers lack the necessary training to design and present curriculum material through artistic tasks, and many teachers in previous ArtSmarts schools became frustrated at incorporating the program into their schools. They wondered instead why they could not simply present the material to students in traditional, and in their opinion proven, ways. School administrators sometimes saw the programs as too expensive or cited a lack or resources as their reason for not supporting the program.

Finally, while most schools implemented the program as a way to increase standardized test scores, curb violence or improve attendance, not many obvious signs of improvement were seen in these areas. In some schools standardized test scores actually decreased, but in most they did not change drastically one way or the other. Though teachers reported increased motivation in their students attendence increased only 3-5% at most. Similarly, most schools reported that violence either remained the same as before the program or actually increased during the program.

'''Some ways to improve the program:'''

The most important thing to keep in mind when evaluating the effectiveness of the ArtSmarts program is that most of what the program accomplishes cannot be measured by standardized testing, attendence or incidents of bullying. Standardized tests are content based, and student success depends not only on the knowledge of the material, but also on the amount of sleep students have before the test, their comfort in the environment, nerves, what, if anything, the students have had to eat and other personal factors. Attendence and bullying also depend less on the material presented in the classroom and more on outside factors such as students' family lives, physical and mental health and personality. The biggest noted difference seen in incorporating the ArtSmarts program is the huge increase in student motivation, engagement and pride in their own work. Though these positive changes will increase students desire to put more effort into their school work. Many teachers in the case studies also mentioned an increased sense of community in their schools. These things cannot be easily measured in a concrete way, but are essential to the success of struggling, at-risk students. None of the indicators of success mentioned above can fully measure these things. 

Secondly, many schools implemented this program expecting it to fix all the school's problems. Obviously students are diverse and there is no one solution to fix all social issues found in schools. Though the ArtSmarts program increases motivation, it cannot be expected to fix bullying and attendence issues in the course of a few months or years. This program offers one solution for these issues. Perhaps in order to help improve these issues we need to combine this approach with other solutions, rather than solely improving this program.

Below are some suggestions for improving the program:
* Though ArtSmarts offers grants, schools may need to raise funds
* This program works better in an area with many resources and artists close by. Perhaps technology such as video conferencing, email, webcams and even exchange programs could allow this program to be available for those in more remote communities.
* More professional development opportunities are necessary for non-arts specialist teachers and should be provided and paid for by their schools professional development budgets. Arts specialist teachers could take the lead on these professional development sessions and collaborate to write reference guides, lesson plans or strategies for their fellow teachers.
* A new ArtSmarts school could be paired with a more established ArtSmarts school, to allow for collaboration, resource sharing and an opportunity for teachers and administrators to learn from their mistakes.
* The ArtSmarts program alone does not provide an all-purpose fix for all school problems. Perhaps this program could be combined with the implementation of peer-mentoring, counselling, leadership programs or community outreach programs, to offer more solutions for issues in attendance and bullying. These issues are complex, and no one solution works for every student.

The most important thing to note about this program is that it makes positive changes in every school it is implemented in, but in different ways. Each school is different, but each sees increases in motivation, excitement, engagement and community. This program does not market itself as a &quot;quick-fix&quot; to school issues. It is accountable and encourages outside investigation of the program to improve ArtSmarts.

===2. Qf3===
This move is a weak opening because it develops the queen too early and subjects it to attack, and deprives the knight of its best square.

As with the similar [[../2. Qh5|2. Qh5]], White hopes for the scholar's mate: 2.Qf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5?? 4.Qxf7#.  In both cases, Black can easily avoid the trap. However, the Parham Attack is more forcing and stronger -- first requiring Black to defend his e-pawn (usually with 2...Nc6), then after 3.Bc4 forcing Black to play a sub-optimal move (3...g6 virtually committing Black to a fianchetto rather than a more aggressive placement of the bishop; 3...Qe7 blocking the bishop; or 3...Qf6 taking away the knight's best square). 2.Qf3 places no such impediments on Black's development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Arts and Science/Technology'''&lt;/big&gt; - (Hassan, Irene, Tearney, Mark)

“We must not forget that computers are tools, not ends in themselves.”  This is a statement made by Diane Ravitch, a historian, in her article The Great Technology Mania about the implications of trying to succeed at maximizing student achievement through technology.  She goes on to make an even bolder statement about their being “no evidence that use of computers or the Internet improves student achievement.”  In an age where computers and technology seem like the silver bullet everybody in the education field has been looking for, Ravitch’s statements come as a surprise.  However, a closer look reveals not only economic implications for this unsubstantiated technological revolution, but psychological ones as well.  Although it is the assumption that “computers improve both teaching practises and student achievement” and that “To make tomorrow’s work force competitive in an increasingly high-tech world, learning computer skills must be a priority” (The Computer Delusion, Oppenheimer) a lot of evidence points to the contrary. 

A case study facilitated by both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem examined computer-aided instruction (CAI) in Israeli classrooms from 1994 and 1996.  Over this period the results reported did not support the view that CAI improves learning. “The researchers’ found that fourth and eighth graders with CAI showed no improvement or even worse performance on achievement tests after CAI began” (The Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions).  What’s more is that some of the fourth graders showed significantly lower math test scores after CAI began.  It is important to note that these researchers didn’t have a bias against technology but simply argued that the “theoretical case for the CAI is not well-developed, and there is good reason to believe that computers can actually be a diversion” (BI for PPS).

What this extends to, with the technological bandwagon overflowing with advocates from the educational side of things is a reallocation of other educational resources.  This is demonstrated in the case above with the Israeli Ministry of Education spending $105 million on computers during the researches three year period – an estimated amount that could have alternately funded about 3500 teachers for one year.  Other examples include The Kittridge Street Elementary School, in Los Angeles, eliminating its music program to hire a technology coordinator and administrators in Mansfield, Massachusetts dropping “proposed teaching positions in art, music, and physical education” (Oppenheimer), and then spending $333,000 on computers.  This is all very interesting considering recent research has suggested that “music and art classes may build the physical size of a child’s brain” and even has more significant influence on student’s success than computers in subjects like math, science, and engineering.

The primary advocate of this type of work is Jane Healy, an educational psychologist who wrote Endangered Minds: Why Children Don’t Think and What We Can Do About It (1990).  In her book she writes that “visual stimulation is probably not the main access route to nonverbal reasoning.  Body movements, the ability to touch, feel, manipulate, and build sensory awareness of relationships in the physical world, are its main foundations”.  Obviously when it comes to computers and their use in the classroom “the senses have...little status”.  “As well she and other psychologists think that computer screens flatten information into narrow, sequential data.  This kind of material, they believe, exercises mostly one half of the brain” (Oppenheimer).

Many research papers have been devoted to looking at arts influence on student’s success and achievement.  What makes this interesting is that Arts education classically steers away from using computers as a means to an end.  One such research paper is Critical Evidence: How the Arts Benefit Student Achievement by the director of Educational Systems Research, Littleton, Colorado , Sandra S. Ruppert.  In this paper Ruppert links several key phases of cognitive development to Arts Education.  These include but aren’t limited to; Thinking Skills, which is encompassed by “reasoning ability, intuition, perception, imagination, inventiveness, creativity, problem-solving skills and expression” (Ruppert);  Social Skills, which is defined by the promotion of positive growth in “social skills, including self-confidence, self-control, conflict resolution, collaboration, empathy and social tolerance”; as well as the motivation to learn which can be categorized by “active engagement, disciplined and sustained attention, persistence and risk taking, among other competencies”.

In other words if we are to prepare students for work in the 21st century computers is not the best way to achieve increased success.  This is emphasized by people that share the concern that computers aren’t the best way to make successful employees.  Kris Meisling, a senior geological-research adviser for Mobil Oil is quoted in Computer Delusion as saying “people who use computers a lot slowly grow rusty in their ability to think.”  What’s even more shocking are the comment Karen Chelini, the director of human resources for LucasArts Entertainment said: “With traditional art training, you train the eye to pay attention to body movement.  You learn attitude, feeling, expression.  The ones who are good are those who as kids couldn’t be without their sketchbook.” (The Computer Delusion)  It is evident then that people on the front lines of hiring for even the most computer driven companies are looking for thinkers and they believe these aren’t the people that learn through a computer.

'''Links Between Arts and Technology in Practice'''

	Amidst all the discourse on the benefits or potential hindrances of new technology in the education system, a handful of maverick entrepreneurs and educators are using technology in arts education to build communities.  Two examples of programs that reach out to struggling youth and empower them with the ability to use new technologies for their own creative development show that while the new media may have some shortfalls when applied in a classroom, sometimes it is just the bridge to lead students back to success in school and out.   One organization, Regent Park Focus, was formed to give the immense youth population in the neighbourhood of Regent Park in downtown Toronto a voice.  The One World Youth Arts Program is a pilot program at Georges Vanier High School where students there are given the opportunity to create music using current music production software.  Both programs show a holistic form of educating the students and empower every individual in the program with a sense of value and shared responsibility, turning more students back into learning and succeeding in school.

	The arts program in Regent Park was created to fill a void that was unraveling the community.   According to current statistics, the percentage of residents under the age of 24 was approximately 44%.   More than 50% of the population in Regent Park does not speak English in the home, and more than 50% are also visible minorities.   The area itself has been the scapegoat for years as a hub of crime and violence, and before there was a great desire on the part of the community to bond together and work collectively to defeat the stereotype associated with that area.
Regent Park is a youth-based organization in the downtown Toronto community of Regent Park.  Students here learn skills and relevant information about new technology related to the arts.  

	The organization was created and led by a group of adult professionals including Adonis Huggins and Steve Blair, who coach youth from around the community to run their video, radio, and music production suites.  
By giving the students creative control, their engagement and sense of self-empowerment is strong enough for give them more autonomy in the development and process, providing opportunities for leadership.  The success of this organization stems from the youth that have benefited from the program who were at-risk, disenfranchised students in what is considered one of Toronto’s “vulnerable” communities.  
Youth and children working in the Regent Park Youth Focus organization are positively motivated to succeed in their group projects through public exhibitions, film fests, and worldwide online access to their work.  They are also interested in their community, feel welcome and safe and do not feel the pressures of grades to push them to succeed in their work at the program.  The benefits are contagious, and once they have seen what a great job they can do in this arena, their confidence will increase and hopefully influence their future goals.

	By putting “culturally relevant pedagogy” into practice, the students will be able to contribute more as they are working within a group of shared interests or experiences.  The radio, video, and music productions that the students create relate to topics that affect their lives, their friend’s lives, and their family’s lives.  This awareness that students develop through these types of organizations foster local advocacy and activism that forms a values foundation upon which students can feel supported by in their educational or career pursuits.  For those who are struggling in school, finding an interest on an area of expertise that they can expand on is often the hook or anchor that helps them steer through the sometimes-rocky path of secondary education.  

	The One World Youth Arts Program is a pilot project created by high school music teacher Stephen Lashbrook.  It is an open level course that students join and learn valuable skills in music production, creating songs and compositions that are entirely their own and speak to their own lives and concerns.  Similarly with Regent Park Youth Focus, the One World Program has shown the highest success with students who are disenfranchised or considered on the margins of the rest of the community.  In other words, anyone who feels like a minority or whoever feels like not enough material in the current education system speaks to them and their own experiences.  Student success creates “positive reinforcement”, which can spread outside the program and into the classrooms and in the communities and creating music and video productions also stimulates “metalinguistic” and “metasymbolic” awareness.  Arts programs incorporating technology is also an example of cognitive apprenticeship, wherein the students acquire skills from an expert and develop a relationship based on this exchange.  As Piaget has argued, youth and adults rarely enter into formal-operational learning unless they are engaged and interested in the material.  By allowing students creative control in a music classroom, the opportunity is risen for the students to be able to express themselves using musical instruments and new technology.  The production media is their “tools” for cultural expression, while their language, style, and message makes up their “symbol systems”.

	The One World Youth Arts program is being supported by the TDSB, and there are hopes that this type of program which has proven to increase student success will spread to more schools in areas where students need it most.  There is a growing demand or need for arts based programs to offer students a more tangible, relevant form of individual expression and by integrating new technologies as well gives students even more technological literacy, creative problem-solving skills, alongside the inherent community-forming bonds that both learning spaces provide and foster.

	Overall, these programs show that mixing technological skill alongside individual creative expression allow students to make their learning more relevant and useful in their lives and career pursuits.  Because they are accessible by all levels and backgrounds, students immediately feel the benefits of an inclusive learning environment where everyone has something to contribute and the products of their labour are given the value they deserve.

'''The CyberARTS Program'''

Ontario's new CyberARTS Program is another &quot;culturally relevant&quot; educational initiative which merits analysis.

CyberARTS is a specialized, multi-disciplinary, integrated arts and technology program available in several Ontario schools: 
:*Don Mills Collegiate Institute 
:*Don Mills Middle School
:*Northview Heights Secondary School
:*Charles H. Best Middle School
:*Western Technical-Commercial School 
:*Lakeshore Collegiate Institute
:*Innisdale Secondary School 

Certain schools, like Don Mills Collegiate, offer additional technology fused courses such as CyberGEOGRAPHY, CyberHISTORY, CyberCIVICS and CyberCAREERS.

The CyberARTS program was created in 1995 by educators who saw a need for enriched learning through the arts.  The student-centered curriculum focuses on project-based learning that integrates arts and technology.  

CyberARTS students spend approximately half of every day studying academic core subjects. The remainder of their day is spent gaining credits in Comprehensive Art, Extended Media, Communications Technology, and Computer Science.  Students may opt to learn Music, Drama, Dance, or Media Studies or take advantage of Co-op opportunities.

As the CyberARTS program is still a very new initiative, course content differs from one school to another.  Consistent among schools is a focus on the Visual Arts.  Units of study include: 
:*Traditional art studio activities
:*In-depth art history and theory
:*Art analysis and appreciation
:*Life Drawing
:*Portfolio Preparation
:*Exhibition Opportunities
:*Career Exploration
:*Co-op

The Arts component is invariably tied to Technical Studies, which include:
:*Advanced Computer Skills
:*Animation: 2D and 3D
:*Graphic Design Principles
:*Ergonomics
:*Desktop Publishing
:*Web Design
:*Digital Photography
:*Multimedia
:*Film and Video Production
:*Consumer Behaviour and Advertising

In addition to learning art, design, and technology, the students are also taught important skills such as organization, work ethic, presentation skills, professionalism, career building and post-secondary education planning.  Thus, the program features a opportunity to complete '''authentic tasks''' – tasks that have some connection to real-life problems the students will face outside the classroom.

CyberARTS is committed to both formal and informal experiences in Cooperative education and in the development of curriculum to provide &quot;real world&quot; projects that extend beyond the classroom.  Educational Partners include Apple Canada, Kodak Canada, Rogers Communications, the Art Gallery of Ontario, Sheridan College and the Ontario College of Art &amp; Design, among others. Partners provide software and hardware support as well as training and educational consulting for special projects and initiatives. 

'''Problem- based learning''' is another important aspect of the program
All CyberARTS students are expected to contribute to the program, school and/or greater community. These community hours will involve student application of their artistic, creative design and technological abilities in a variety of areas, such as:
:*Graphic design for the school newspaper or yearbook
:*Fashion Design for a schooI Fashion Show 
:*Stage Design for the Drama and Music Program 
CyberARTS students are expected to take on leadership roles in these activities as part of the curriculum and skills training. 

Entry to the high school program is based on a successful audition, interview, and application package.   In addition, a portfolio or sketchbook is highly recommended. 

The audition involves completing a creative activity, such as a still life drawing. The interview is with two CyberARTS teachers, a senior CyberARTS student, and often a guest artist. The main purpose of this interview is to see what kind of a person the student is. Can they think outside of the box? Do they have potential in this program? All of these questions and more are explored in this process. The application package includes a student information sheet, an interest and background form, two teacher reference forms, a creative writing piece, and a release of information form. Prospective students are required to have this package into the school of their choice by the beginning of January.

'''Media Arts, Cyberdisciplines and the Use of Cultural Tools'''

Psychologists recognize that culture shapes cognitive development.  A major spokesperson for this sociocultural theory was a Russian psychologist named Lev Semenovich Vygotsky.  Vygotsky’s work began when he was studying 'learning' and 'development' to improve his own teaching.  He wrote about language and thought, the psychology of art, learning and development, and educating students with special needs.  Vygotsky’s work was banned in Russia for many years because he referenced the ideas of Western psychologists.  However, within the last twenty-five years  Vygotsky’s ideas about language, culture and cognitive development were “rediscovered”  and have become major influences in the field of educational psychology.

Vygotsky believed that human activities take place in cultural settings and cannot be understood apart from these settings. He realized that people use '''cultural tools''', including symbolic tools (such as maps, works of art, signs, codes and language) play and important role in cultural development.  Our understanding of “cultural tools” has also expanded to include real tools , such as the abacus and rulers;  today we would add computers, video equipment and the internet. 

Vygotsky upheld that cultures create tools to support thinking and mediate higher order mental processes.   Children’s knowledge, ideas, attitudes and values develop by using and appropriating the ways of thinking provided by their culture. Children transform the tools as they construct their own representations, symbols, patterns and understandings.

Sound familiar? It should, because this is the heart of Media Arts and CyberArts education.  Students of these disciplines sublimate cultural resources, critically process these materials, and construct representations of their understanding of the world around them.   Often, these representations will manifest as works of literature and visual art.  As students learn and grow, they continue to refine their skills and understanding of the world they are part of.  

It should also be noted that Vygotsky promoted a concept of '''assisted learning''', or guided participation in the classroom.  Assisted learning requires scaffolding, giving information, prompts, reminders and encouragement in the right time and in the right amounts, and then gradually allowing students to do more and more on their own.

Appropriately enough, the CyberARTS program uses this same “assisted learning” system. Curriculum is designed so that the teacher is a facilitator, manager, producer, and support, while students take an active role in problem-solving the task at hand, be it creating a publication, authoring interactive DVDs, creating a portrait or organizing a conference.

Talk to any teacher in the TDSB and they will likely tell you that there is a sustained push from the school board to integrate and expand the use of technology in their teaching and professional development. While the board itself has no publicly available mandate on the subject, a host of technology initiatives at the local and provincial level would seem to uphold this popular impression. Most commonly referred to under the moniker of “e-learning,” these initiatives offer various levels of resources and options for networking, collaboration and education. While their efficacy is in many ways debatable, their integrated presence at all levels of educational policy and delivery in Ontario mark out a community of sorts, which has the potential to fundamentally alter the ways through which both students and teachers learn.

	But what exactly is “e-learning”? And how is it financed and implemented? These seemingly straightforward questions immediately problematize the concept, underlining some inherent flaws in the vision of technologically mediated public education. To begin with, e-learning basically refers to anything done via computer network. So the word itself (like “the internet” before it) is as broad as it is imprecise. It could be almost anything. But for it to be truly transformative within the educational model requires 
up-to-date, functioning hardware and software, which most schools don’t have and can’t afford on an ongoing basis. It also requires technologically adept teachers. Simply buying computers, isn’t enough – fully integrating technology into the curriculum requires ongoing training and professional development. That said, things are changing, however glacial the pace. And the ideas behind e-learning initiatives will continue to gradually change the shape of public education over the years to come.  

	Regardless of the ability of schools to access it, there are plenty of e-learning resources available to teachers and students in Toronto, from the basic to the complex. These include inter- and intra- school networks and resources, online courses and curriculum, and a growing number of peer-to-peer interactive online tools. Most schools, for example, have a “Teacher Share” directory on their network, through which teachers can share resources. It is only accessible from desktops at the school itself (which is a real limitation, as it would be ideal if it could be accessed from home). However it is a handy way for departments, and whole schools, to collaborate on resources. On a more involved level, ABEL (advanced broadband enabled learning, a non-profit service out of York University) is subscribed to by Toronto and York Region school boards and runs workshops and training, as well as developing curriculum and providing a “virtual community,” including access to online collaboration, development and resource tools. The Ministry of Education has it’s own initiative along these same lines: e-learning Ontario aims to be “a facilitator of online education … providing resources to engage students in learning, as well as an opportunity for teachers to share resources with colleagues across Ontario” (Ministry of Education, 2008). And the Toronto District School Board has set up its own detailed and comprehensive set of electronic resources called “cyberlinks.”

	One such link takes you to e-pals.com, a “global community of classrooms” through which groups of students can safely connect and chat online. This site also hosts its own blogging technology and collaborative projects, providing numerous fantastic online opportunities for extending and enhancing the curriculum. In fact, as is the way of the internet, any one of the TDSB-sponsored sites listed above will open up a myriad of further possibilities. The very real problem then becomes how teachers can find the time to sort through them all, let alone use them productively. While part of the value of the board and ministry sites is they are doing a significant amount of filtering and sorting, the sheer quantity of available material is equal parts valuable and overwhelming.

	Because of this, in my experience the most effective way to approach the use of technology in the classroom is with a concrete need in mind. That way, it becomes a focused quest, less about “What can I do?” and more about “How can I do this better with the available tools?” For example, when teaching Art History, I was confronted by the problem about how to source copyright-released fine art images of suitable quality to project in class. This is actually a significant impediment to teaching high school art, as most schools don’t have extensive or up-to-date slide libraries, and all art is copyright-protected. And, as most art is shown via projector, it makes perfect sense that the best solution to this problem would be a central online library of sorts. And as I discovered, this exists in the form of ArtStor.com, which offers educational copyrighted access to tens of thousands of art images that can be projected via the web interface, saved into slide shows, interactively enlarged to focus on pertinent details, and shared between users. It is an example of the kind of really sophisticated interfaces that are starting to exist, and that hopefully our public education will have access to some day soon. 

	A broader pedagogical issue that e-learning in its current form addresses is the hindrances to learning brought about by conflicting schedules and geographic impediments. The ubiquitous wikipedia, acrobat, and google have all developed collaborative tools (wikibooks, acrobat connect, googledocs) through which multiple users can work on the same document from their home locations, which makes group work a more accessible option for students. More significantly, there are a wide range of online courses available through various school boards such as the TDSB’s “Virtual School,” which are supported by the Ontario Ministry of Education’s “Learning Management System.” The TDSB promotes its Virtual School as “a real school operating in an online environment.” It officially opened in September 2000, and has its own teaching staff, guidance, a Principal, library, learning and health resources, as well as a career center, and offers 20 courses, which change annually according to student needs. (Toronto District School Board, n.d.). There are many reasons why students, particular those deemed “at risk,” may be unable to attend regular classes. For them, e-learning for credit courses may be their only option for completing their high school education. And while this type of e-learning carries with it a very real limitation in that it requires home-based computer access, it is clearly a significant improvement in access for many students.

	It should be clear by now that e-learning resources and programming come in all different forms, from the basic to the complex, and address a wide range of pedagogical needs. They present both students and teachers with remarkable ease and flexibility of access, as well as almost limitless resources, provided that the tools and means of access are available to them. Moreover, beyond the advantages and practicalities discussed above, electronically-referenced educational strategies have numerous potential psychological benefits. Technology in the form of text messaging, blogs, Facebook and MySpace has become a central focus in students’ lives, and a primary mode of communication. Raised with a lived understanding of the internet as a basic source for interest, investigation and communication, today’s tech-savvy teens have the potential to benefit significantly from e-learning. Firstly, there is a strong “intrinsic motivation” factor, as it is basically an interest-related activity that is in and of itself rewarding (Woolfolk et al., 2003, p.355). On top of this, as Piaget theorizes, effective educators need to respond to how kids think and problem solve (Woolfolk et al., 2003, p.38), and electronic learning naturally taps into this by utilizing students’ technological knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Moreover, both Vygotsky and Piaget promote social interaction as the basis of cognitive development (Woolfolk et al., 2003, p.43), so it follows that by increasing the scope of student’s interactive relationships, we will be enhancing their cognitive development. 

	Technology is becoming an increasingly relevant tool in our “cultural tool box” (Woolfolk et al., 2003, 44).  It can be seen as both a “real” tool (hardware, software), and a symbolic tool (language, communication protocols). As these tools are developed and refined through usage, the employment of technology through e-learning can be seen to increase not only student learning but their ability to function and succeed in the world. What is particularly interesting here is the particular ways in which community is utilized and developed around e-learning technologies. Existing as a virtual space, these communities nevertheless function as hubs for communication and interaction. And within these hubs, new knowledge is being formed as our “cultural tools” are developed and refined. Where will this take us? In terms of public education in Ontario, e-learning is at a stage when much is possible, and little has taken place. However, through expanding on the notion of what community means, and what a learning environment is, these initiatives are moving education into an interesting and potentially transformative new space.

&lt;big&gt;'''Lesson Plan Example Using Technology and Art Interpretation in a History Course'''&lt;/big&gt;
'''Lesson Title: Who is Napoleon?

Unit: French Revolution and Napoleon

Course: The West and the World, Destination 1'''

Background:
 
Students will have learned about the height and wane of the French Revolution, and maybe have heard Napoleon’s name float around amidst these lessons, but never received a full lesson on him, his military achievements, and his ambition and rise to power.  They will have had lessons on French nationalism, capitalism and slavery, the rise of the middle class in Europe and the declining intensity of the Revolution.


Expectations from the Ontario Curriculum 2005 edition:

S.W.B.A.T...

1.	Draw conclusions based on supporting evidence, effective analysis of information, and awareness of diverse historical interpretation (p.203).

2.	Analyse different forms of artistic expression and how they have reflected or challenged the societies in which they have appeared (p.198)

3.	Demonstrate an understanding of the importance and use of chronology and cause and effect in historical analyses of developments in the West and throughout the world since the sixteenth century (p.196).


Lesson:  Day 1 Part 1 – In Class


Intro and Q+A 							10 minutes


The class will come in and sit in their desks, observing two pictures of Napoleon right at the front of the room, on the black board.

•	Suggestions: J.L. David’s The First Consul crossing the Alps via the great Saint Bernard Pass,1801; http://www.napoleon.org/en/gallery/pictures/files/The_First_Consul_crossing.asp; Adolf Northern’s Napoleon’s Retreat from Moscow; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Napoleons_retreat_from_moscow.jpg 

Above the pictures the central question:

“How do we know who Napoleon was and what role he played in history?”
	
		
1.	What clues can you find in this picture that tell us what is going on? Let’s brainstorm on the board.

2.	How do you think this image portrays a powerful political leader?

3.	Now let’s look at the second picture. Can anyone tell me how this picture is the same or different? Let’s list the similarities/differences on the board.

4.	What kind of man do you think that this person was, according to the picture?

5.	Do you think this image was created at a high or low point in Napoleon’s career?

6.	Who do you think saw this image? How did this influence the public understanding of who Napoleon was and how influential he was at the time?

Students are going to be handed out a different online link to an image of Napoleon.  For the remainder of the class, the students will go to the computer lab and discover the image to which they have been assigned.  


Day 1 Part 2: In Lab

On the computer, they will write a paragraph describing the picture and what it says about Napoleon, at different times of his career.  They may use the textbook to help them tie the image to the related part of Napoleon’s career. 

Once they have completed writing and typing the paragraph, they will send the paragraph to the teacher’s class email provided on the handout.  The teacher will take the text and post it online as part of a class blog, with credit to the students, and links to the images.  This part can be done during class, or overnight if the teacher has extra time.

By the second day, they should have a paragraph ready, and the next class will take place entirely in the computer lab, where they will continue to send the paragraph or read the postings on the class blog. 


Day 2:  In Lab

Students continue to type up their entry into the blog and email it to the teacher. 
The teacher continues to post the entries onto the blog. The remainder of the period is given for students lagging behind in the computer entry process, and for students to read and make notes on the other student’s entries.  By the end of the class, once every student has entered in their post with the url link to the image, every student is expected to read the other entries, and make some small notes on the reading homework of the day.  

Information/images posted on the class blog may be used as part of a unit test.

If some students have completed all the work, they can get a head-start on the homework, which is the textbook chapter reading on Napoleon.  


'''The West and the World   					

Who was Napoleon?  

Student Handout'''

“How do we know who Napoleon was and what role he played in history?”

For this assignment, you are to discover a part of Napoleon’s identity through a variety of visual primary sources.  Every picture each student is going to be assigned to research is unique, from a different part of Napoleon’s life and career.  In your own words, answer the following questions:

1.	At what point in Napoleon’s career was this image created? How was his popularity at that time?

2.	Does this image paint Napoleon in a positive or negative light?  

3.	Does the image focus on his position in politics or his military ventures?

4.	Does the artist take Napoleon’s influence, power, or policies seriously?

5.	Is it propaganda?  How valuable is this image as historical evidence?


Once you have finished making your notes on the image you have been assigned, you will email your response to the following address: makeupanemailadress@gmail.com.  Include in your entry your name, the url link to the image you were assigned, and whether it came from napoleon.org or wikipedia.org.

The entries will be compiled and posted online on a history class website, entitled 
www.createawebsitename.com.  You will be given class-time to read other student’s responses and are required to do so as some information given on the website will likely be used on the final unit test.

How to set up your class’ blog:

1.	Go to www.blogger.com and follow the steps given on the website to make a blog.

2.	You now have a blog, a webpage that can add pictures (jpegs) and text.  Create an introduction and title for your class, and once the students send their information to your email, copy and paste them onto the blog, 
making sure to credit their name and the website where the url link to the image they’ve researched was found.

3.	If this task is too time consuming for you, you may be able to create an email for the entire class that they can all log in and post onto the site either individually or as a group.  You can set up groups around one 
computer, and each group can log into the site and type their entries in one message.  

4.	Remind students to put their name on the entry, however, since if it is not there you will not know who wrote it.

5.	Give extra class-time to the students to read the other entries, and from their entries to make at least 3 point-form notes on each image.  Students are welcome to make comments on the image, as long as they are suitable.

The following url links are from napoleon.org.  They contain an image, as well as a caption (sometimes) regarding the image.  Here are some samples, but you are welcome to get more from the same website… just number them, print them out and hand them to the students.  Every student will keep that slip with the url, tell you their number (to keep track) and type the url address on Internet Explorer or Firefox and begin researching.

----
==='''Thesis'''===

	When discussing teaching for wisdom and compassion, a great number of forms and methods emerge as to the best practice.  One particular organization has developed many strategies and theories to educate teacher and parents on ways to incorporate wisdom and compassion into their practice and everyday lives.  This organization is called Essential Education and has developed out of basic Buddhist principles, which they have transformed into a method called “The 16 Guidelines”.

	These guidelines are divided into four spectrums that encompass everyday life and behaviour and within each of these spectrums are four of the guidelines the will lead to a wise and compassionate way of life.  The spectrums cover: how we think (humility, patience, contentment, delight); how we act (kindness, honesty, generosity, right speech); how we relate to others (respect, forgiveness, gratitude, loyalty); and how we find meaning (principles, aspiration, service, courage). (www.16guidelines.org)  Though, these principles were drawn from Buddhist teaching, Essential Education has made them universally accessible.  The essence of the Guidelines have basis in almost every religion around the world and have been adapted so that they can be applied in every cultural circumstance.

==='''Developmental Assumptions'''===

	There are many developmental assumptions that underlie this approach to teaching for wisdom and compassion.  Essential Education has a strong focus on educating adults to become instructors and in turn, transferring that knowledge to youth through modeling and formal education practices.  Their youth programs and partnerships focus on youth in their concrete operational to formal operational stages of development, based on Piaget’s theories.  Also, their techniques seem to draw from ideas and theories from people like Erikson, Marcia, Kohlberg and Gilligan.

	During the concrete operational stage of development, youth are in the later elementary to middle school years and are beginning to develop their sense of identity.  This would be when Essential Education recommends beginning infusing the practice of teaching for wisdom and compassion into the curriculum.  It is best to begin in this stage of development because as youth move into the formal operational stage, they begin to make firm connections using hypothetico-deductive reasoning; which is the ability of the formal thinker to consider a hypothetical situation and reason deductively. (Woolfolk, page 36)  If the basis for wise and compassionate living has already been instilled by this stage of development, a youth is more likely to put it into their common practice and use the guidelines as basis for problem solving when using deductive reasoning.

	The Essential Education system also has assumptions that relate to Vygotsky’s socio-cultural perspective; especially the idea that higher mental processes are co-constructed through shared activities. (Woolfolk, page 43)  Co-constructed means “constructed through a social process in which people interact and negotiate (usually verbally) to create an understanding or to solve a problem, the final product is shaped by all participants.” (Woolfolk, page 43)  This idea is key to teaching for wisdom and compassion.  If a student is raised and educated in a culture that puts a major emphasis on the 16 Guidelines to a peaceful contented life, this will become part of the natural behaviour of the student.  Using activities and practices that support these guidelines allows the students to incorporate the learning into all of their practices.

==='''Underlying Theories'''===

	Some of the theories that seem to be a basis for the application of the Essential Education are Erikson, Marcia, Kohlberg, and Gilligan.  Though these theories are not directly referenced within the documents relating to the Essential Education System, their principles and applications are more than apparent in comparison.  Erikson’s theory of the Eight Stages of Psychological Development suggests that at various stages of development the individual faces a developmental crisis; “a specific conflict whose resolution prepares the way for the next step.” (Woolfolk, page 62)  These resolutions can be positive or negative and will affect their later stages of development.  The focus on “how we relate to others” and “how we act” have basis in providing positive outcomes to the crises and help to increase the self-esteem of each of the students by encouraging an accepting and supportive atmosphere in the classroom.  This will allow the students to feel free to move through their personal development and feel safe to share with their peers, knowing that everyone is operating under an attitude of cherishing others and making a better world.

	The theory of James Marcia suggests “that there are four alternatives for adolescents as they confront their identity choices.” (Woolfolk, page 65)  These alternatives are identity achievement (“strong sense of commitment to life choices after free consideration of alternatives”), identity foreclosure (“acceptance of other life choices without consideration of options”), identity diffusion (“uncentredness; confusion about who one is and what one wants”), and moratorium (“identity crisis; suspension of choices because of struggle”). (Woolfolk, page 65)  This ties in directly with Erikson’s theory that most adolescents go through a phase of moratorium during that period of life.  Teaching for wisdom and compassion allows the freedom and opportunity for students to safely journey through this phase of their development.  The focus on finding meaning in life within the 16 Guidelines focuses on the fact that everything is changing and anything is possible.  This is especially poignant for students in the midst of their adolescence, when they are being faced with many life altering changes from physical development to choosing career paths.

	The theorists that most closely relate to the principles emphasized by Essential Education are Kohlberg and the developments by Gilligan.  Kohlberg believes that all people move through stages of moral reasoning, which will ultimately lead to “post-conventional moral reasoning” which is guided by social justice and decisions based on the standard levels of individual rights.  Gilligan challenged this idea, saying that studies based on Kohlberg’s theory showed that women did not achieve this higher level of moral reasoning whereas men did.  Gilligan suggested that this upper level of moral reasoning that focuses on “universal principles of justice and fairness” (Woolfolk, page 80) is achieved by the “principles of responsibility and care for all people” (Woolfolk, page 80), which can be achieved by anyone regardless of gender.  Essential Education’s goal is to aide people in moving into this higher level of moral development and through teaching for wisdom and compassion, students have the opportunity to internalize the standards and practices that are being demonstrated to them daily through their teachers and parents.

	Lipscomb, MacAllister and Bregman discovered that children who had been more exposed to caring, generous adult models were more likely to adopt those same qualities and principles and demonstrated greater concern and caring for the rights of others.  (Woolfolk, page 80) This study shows the effect of teaching for wisdom and compassion.  Youth emulate that which they see, and as a teacher, you have a fantastic opportunity to shape the future behaviour of the students you work with.  The Essential Education program gives guidelines and strategies as to how to incorporate this idea fully into life and interactions with youth.  Creating a better world, begin with creating a more compassionate society.

“The tendency for a person to behave morally is largely dependent on the extent to which moral beliefs and values are integrated in the personality, and in one’s sense of self.  The influence our moral beliefs have on our lives, therefore, is contingent on the personal importance that we as individuals attach to them – we must identify and respect them as our own.” (Woolfolk, page 81)

==='''How Teaching for Compassion and Wisdom is used in the Classroom'''===

:Many teachers in the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) are actively incorporating the principles of teaching for wisdom and compassion into their classroom teaching methods. For example, a drama teacher in Toronto implemented a strategy that incorporates many core elements of improvisational theatre to develop wisdom and compassion in his students. Although this strategy informs many elements of his teaching, this section of the essay will look specifically at his strategy for teaching for wisdom and compassion in a grade 10 drama unit, dealing with children’s theatre. While other teachers in the school who were teaching the same unit focused on creating a “hierarchy” for their units, with each student taking clearly defined roles (director, stage manager, script writer, etc.), this teacher actively fostered a spirit of collaboration, allowing students to work together to create all the elements of the play by themselves. There was a lot of preparation that was needed before he could have the students begin work on the assignment, but it was all done with the intention of creating an atmosphere where students could learn for wisdom and compassion. He planned the unit for later in the year, so he had a good sense of which students could work well together, and he also allowed the students to select a myth from any culture in the world to dramatize and stage. This allowed the students to have a proper foundation to begin working on the project. 

: Through the assignment, the teacher incorporated many of the key elements of teaching for wisdom and compassion. At various times through the rehearsal process, the students were required to write a journal, reflecting on their group’s progress, and how they feel they added or detracted from the group, and what they can do to help their group in the future. This is an example of a reflection technique that is designed to help the students develop a sense of compassion, through introspection, and considering how they interact with others. After the students completed the journal assignment, there was a noticeable shift in group dynamics, as students were made more aware of their positive and negative  behaviour within a group dynamic through this assignment. Aspects of improvisational theatre were also actively used by the instructor. Acceptance of ideas is a core principle of improv, and in teaching the students to respond to new ideas with a “yes and …” or a “let’s try it, and see what happens,” instead of refusing the offer, students gained an understanding how the mental environment they create in a group can allow all the group members to function more effectively. In having the students perform children’s theatre assignments, the students had to reflect on learning and development, as they were required to think about to engage a group of younger students with their performances. This idea of understanding learning and development also appeared in the elements of mask and shadow puppetry that were also brought into the assignment. The myths that they were adapting all had fantastic elements that were impossible to stage in a traditional manner, so in having the students think in the abstract, about different ways to represent reality, but to do it in such a way that a younger audience would be able to understand. 

:While this assignment has many aspects that are designed to teach compassion and wisdom, there were still areas where the teacher met some difficulty. The main issue was motivation. Students would often come late to class, or if they were in class, would occasionally “zone out,” and not be active participants in the rehearsal work going on that day. This would happen most often after many days of straight rehearsal, with nothing to break up the rehearsal routine of “come to class, rehearse and leave” over a span of several classes. However, if a new aspect of children’s theatre was introduced to the rehearsal, simple musical instruments for example, a sense of group focus, energy and willingness to work together returned to the group dynamic. This speaks to the value of using variety, and specifically different forms of motivation, to properly engage a class. While the unit plan incorporates elements from the behavioural approach to motivation (preparation for an upcoming performance, the desire to do well on he assignment) and the sociocultural approach (journals, reflecting on one’s role in a group), the inclusion of the humanistic and cognitive approaches might help not only break up monotony in the rehearsal schedule, but allow the activity to “hook” students who are affected by different forms of motivation. Activities using different forms of motivation, for example having students reflect on their cultural and personal connections to the myth in a short written assignment, might motivate students who respond to the humanistic approach to motivation. Bringing in different elements of children’s theatre frequently (for example, musical instruments) that the students can play with, and use in their rehearsal if they choose, would be a good way to attract naturally curious students who respond to the cognitive approach to motivation. Trying different motivation methods throughout the rehearsal process might allow students to become more engaged in the material, and become more motivated to participate in the collaborative aspects of the group activity, and through this collaboration, be in a position to become more open to the opportunities to learn for compassion and wisdom.

:The teacher who designed this unit has a very strong sense of teaching for compassion and wisdom. The idea of collaboration, community, introspection and critical thinking informs all areas of the classes he teaches. Giving students the opportunity to direct their learning, and choose the path they would like to take with the material, and allowing students to reflect on their behaviour, and the ramifications of positive and negative behaviour is a great first step to successfully teaching students the principles of wisdom and compassion. Although there are still areas of this unit that can be improved with some application of a variety of motivational techniques to keeps students interested, there’s no doubt that students in this class are well on their way to learning elements of wisdom and compassion that will benefit them in the future. Students in his classes learn not only drama and performance skills, but skills that will help the students become wise and compassionate individuals both inside and outside of a classroom.

==='''Suggestions for Improvement of the Program'''===


&lt;u&gt;'''Improving Teaching for Wisdom and Compassion through Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development'''&lt;/u&gt;

'''Intro'''

Teaching for wisdom and compassion can be improved by Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development. Although both Piaget’s theory and the holistic curriculum applies to students in all levels, this section will be focused on students in high school level, since there is strong need of teaching for wisdom and compassion in adolescents. Piaget’s theory provides characteristics of adolescents, which enables educators to understand the importance of holistic education, the advantages and challenges in applying the holistic curriculum. 

'''Characteristics of adolescents'''

In Piaget’s theory, there are four stages; and the students follows under the last stage of the four, the formal operational stage. Students in this level have some charateristics that has significant meaning in education. First, they are able to think in abstract concepts. As the name ‘formal operation’ suggests, they are able to do mental tasks involving abstract thinking and coordination of a number of variables (Woolfolk, 35). Also, they are able to identify all the factors that might affect a problem and then deduces and systematically evaluates specific solutions (Woolfolk, 36). This ability of hypothetical thinking enables them to imagine things, and imagination leads them to be very focused the ideas and beliefs that they have. This makes teenagers egocentric; which means that they assume that everyone else is interested in one’s thoughts, feelings, and concerns (Woolfolk, 36). Moreover, adolescents have imaginary audience- the feeling that everyone is watching them (Woolfolk, 36). This explains why teenagers are often sensitive about how they look. How these characterstics of adolescents can be helpful towards teaching for wisdom and compassion?  

'''Importance of holistic education''' 

Adolescents are perfect for holistic education. They have ability to think hypothetically which is a great tool to compassionate with the others, yet their egocentricism calls for the need of teaching for wisdom and compassion. It is important for them to learn how to be thoughful and compassionate about the others in both individual and social aspects. For individual growth, holistic education provides the best way of effective student learning. How do students learn? Piaget’s fundamental insight was that individuals construct their own understanding learning; learning is a constructive process (38). Accodring to him, students have to be actively involved in the learning process, including both physical and mental manipulation of objects or ideas (39). This idea enties with the focus of holistic curriculum- to step out of the plain lectures and focus on building relationship between body, mind, and spirit.
Holistic education fosters individual growth by stimulating the contstructive learning of the students. However, If teaching for wisdom and compassion means to devleop how to be thoughtful of the others, it would be meaningless to think of holistic education apart from the social context. Although the adolescent egocentrism is part of students’ development, they cannot stay in the egocentric point of view for the rest of the lifetime. It is one of the key roles of the education to help them break out from the egocentric view and be able to think about the others; in other words, be compassionate to the others. Teenagers know that everyone has their own thoughts, feelings, and concerns; the educator’s job is to transfer them from knowing to respecting and understanding. 

'''Steps of applying holistic education'''

If holistic education is that important, a teacher must know how to apply them in classroom. There are steps to do so. The first step is to know what it means to be holistic. Miller said that holistic curriculum means to focus on relationship; between linear thinking and intuition, mind and body; various domains of knowledge; and individual and community (Miller, 73). The second step is to know some characteristics that can be used toward the holistic practice. For example, Miller suggested to use visualization and metaphors to help the students explore the relationship beween linear thinking and intuition, and this is where teenager’s ability of hypothetico-deductive reasoning, which is the ability to generate different possibilities for a given situation can be useful (Woolfolk, 36). With this, a teacher can easily lead them to visualize or to imagine ‘what if I were this person’, which is the first step of forming compassion for the others. 
The next step is to be aware of the challenges in applying holistic practices and find strategites for them. There are various challenges, and the first one is that although Piaget divided stages according to the ages, it is not necessarily that everyone is in the classroom are in the formal operational stage. Piaget suggested that his theory is not universal, and even adults can use formal-operational thought in only a few areas where they have the greatest experience or interest (Woolfolk, 37). A teacher may find some students having difficult times when a problem involves hypothetical thinking. In this case, the teacher needs to help the students to develop the formal operational skills. Woolfolk suggests some strategies to help students to use formal operations such as using visual aids, or teaching in broad concepts using materials and ideas relevant to the students’ lives (Woolfolk, 37). 
Another challenge is the case where students refuse to participate in holistic practices. For instance, Miller suggested meditation, yoga, movement, and dance to build the relationship between mind and body. However, students might not concentrate, interrupt the class flow, or making fun of the others who is participating. This can be explained with the teenager’s imaginary audience; feeling that everyone is watching what they are doing. It is natural for them to refuse to participate in something that they think they might look silly. Therefore, the teacher has to make sure that the degree of the activities is on the level that everyone feels comfortable participating.

== From The Student's Perspective ==

There are various branches of educational philosophy and perspectives incorporated into holistic teaching.  They each existed prior to the definition of holism, conceived at various points during the twentieth century.  It wasn’t until the 1970s, however, that different strands of the work of educators such as Montessori and Steiner, among others, were woven together under the name of holism, a belief in fostering the development of the student as a “whole person with body, mind, emotions and spirit” (J. Miller, ascdnetwork), not just a brain with a memory centre.  Robin Ann Martin has asserted that teachers choosing to work in a holistic manner are finding opportunities to act as community leaders (2000).  In fact, those who teach for wisdom and compassion are practicing what they preach by becoming wholly involved in educating their students instead of simply functioning as an information conduit.  So what can the student on the receiving end of holistic education expect?

First of all, there is no one type of child to which teaching for wisdom and compassion applies.  Any student would benefit from having a teacher who encouraged them to have opinions about their course material, who showed them the interconnectedness of all parts of the world, and who accepted that creative thinking is equally important as analytical thinking.  One necessary trait for the student is openmindedness.  Depending upon the cultural and family background of the student, breaking away from the transmission model (R. Miller 2004) of learning could be difficult.  However, it is an approach which can be learned.  Given the emphasis on process in holistic teaching, one individual’s need to take the time to adapt their mode of thinking would be accepted and not penalized.  On the other hand, an immigrant student adjusting to the traditional Ontarian educational setting would not be treated differently as they adapted to those parts of Canadian education that are different from that in their native country.  However, if the student is not open to change, their success with this style of learning will be limited.  Without their commitment, the teacher is stuck reverting to the traditional methods of “I talk.  You listen.  You memorize.  I test.  You regurgitate.”  While entrenched within the system and successful to a certain point, the transmission model does not encourage holistic growth and will not result in the creation of fully engaged young citizens.  Teaching for wisdom and compassion will.

If a holistic teacher can convey to their students that “who [they] are, what they know, how they know it, and how they act in the world are not separate elements, but reflect the interdependencies between our world and our selves” (Martin 2000), they have succeeded.  The range of development for students exposed to teaching for wisdom and compassion becomes nearly infinite.  So long as the intrinsic motivation of both teacher and student remains at a high level, the end result of the school year becomes fluid.  Classes would need to strike a balance between the more freedom-based educational philosophies (allowing children to set their own learning paths) and critical pedagogy, with the teacher taking a leadership role and provoking students into realizing the moral perspectives related to their field of study and viewing the world through a critical eye.  A child experiencing a combination of critical pedagogy and Montessori philosophy, where the aim is “to explore and experiment according to their own pace and interests” (R. Miller 2004), learns to value their teacher’s input and guidance of the educational experience while simultaneously building confidence in their own thoughts and feelings as well as trust in the reliability of their motivations.

To make a more specific point, the range of development for students taught for wisdom and compassion would have to vary depending on the individual.  After all, this is an educational philosophy that highlights the developmental process of each individual student.  Especially during their teens, people develop the different aspects of their selves at different rates.  One Grade 10 student might gain great benefit from learning to view ideas from the perspectives of others but not make the connection that this learning tool applies to personal growth as well while one of their classmates does.

Ron Miller has stated that a holistic approach to teaching “aims to cultivate the emotional and spiritual life of the growing human being, and to deepen the young person’s awareness of his or her place in nature.”(R. Miller 2005) and that education as an entity should strive to be “dynamic, spontaneous, self-organizing and emergent” (R. Miller 2005).  Those four adjectives sound suspiciously like a description of an ideal life where people respect one another and support each other’s development.  On a cognitive level, the biggest advantage gained by students who experience teaching for wisdom and compassion is learning the skill of critical thinking.  Because of holistic education’s focus on questioning and discussion combined with experiential learning, students learn to reflect on both their own thoughts and actions and those of others.  This skill is often sorely lacking in traditional school systems that focus on rote learning.  On an emotional level, students experience twofold development.  The focus on discussion forces students to listen to the opinions of others who may hold very different opinions or simply come from different family structures or cultural backgrounds.  With equal respect given to all sides of a topic (hopefully modelled by the teacher), students start to empathize with those who are different from them and also get the chance to start developing critical distance.  Put bluntly, it is okay to hate the idea but that does not mean you hate the person putting that idea forward.  Not only does teaching for wisdom and compassion provoke compassion for others, it also encourages emotional self-development.  The encouragement to develop critical distance applies to one’s own thoughts and feelings as well.  A student who can start operating at this level of emotional maturity while still in their teens has a great advantage over their traditionally-schooled peers.  On a spiritual level, the ever-present push to reflect on their own thoughts and feelings and to learn through questioning encourages students to really get to know themselves, to define their own beliefs (fluid though they may be), and to recognize how they connect to their evolving world.  The “flowing interrelatedness of all life” (R. Miller 2007) becomes clear as these three levels of development intertwine, creating a whole student and a whole human being.

[[Image:CR desyuno.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical Costa Rican Breakfast consisting of ''gallo pinto'', fried plantains, an egg, and orange juice]]

'''Costa Rican cuisine''' is known for being tasty, yet fairly mild, with high reliance on fresh [[Cookbook:fruit|fruit]]s and [[Cookbook:vegetable|vegetable]]s. The main staple, known as ''[[Cookbook:Gallo Pinto|gallo pinto]]'', consists of [[Cookbook:rice|rice]] and [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black bean]]s, which in many households is eaten at all three meals during the day.

''Gallo pinto'' is also known in some Southern Areas of Costa Rica as ''burra'', though still recognised the name is rarely used as it is mostly referred to as ''gallo pinto''. Also, Costa Rican ''gallo pinto'' is made with black beans, while [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]]ns use [[Cookbook:Red Bean|red bean]]s traditionally.

For lunch, the traditional national dish is called a ''[[Cookbook:casado|casado]]''. It again consists of rice and beans, though this time they are served side by side instead of mixed. There will generally be some type of meat (''[[Cookbook:Carne Asada|carne asada]]'', fish, pork chop or chicken) and a salad to round out the dish. There may also be some extras like fried [plantain]s, a slice of white [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]], and/or corn [[Cookbook:tortilla|tortilla]]s in accompaniment.

Fresh vegetables are a primary ingredient in most main dishes, and members of the [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]] family are particularly common. These include varieties such as [[Cookbook:zucchini|zucchini]], [[Cookbook:zapallo|zapallo]], [[Cookbook:chayote|chayote]], and [[Cookbook:ayote|ayote]]. [[Cookbook:Potato|Potato]], [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], and [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|red pepper]] are other common ingredients.

[[Image:Costa_Rican_Cuisine_Dinner.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Costa Rican dinner consisting of egg on chicken with rice and beans, vegetables, fried plantain, and cooked bananas]]

[[Cookbook:Coffee|Coffee]] and [[Cookbook:banana|banana]] are the two main agricultural exports of the country and also form part of the local cuisine. Coffee is usually served at breakfast and during traditional coffee breaks in the afternoon, usually around 3:00pm.

The Plantain, a larger member of the banana family, is another commonly used fruit and can be served in a variety of ways.  Ripe plantains have a sweet flavor, and can be fried in [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] or baked in a [[Cookbook:honey|honey]] or a [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]-based sauce. Green (unripe) plantains are boiled in soups or can be cooked, mashed into small round cakes and fried to make ''patacones''. [[Cookbook:Corn|Sweet corn]] dishes are common traditional meals like ''pozole'' (corn soup), ''chorreadas'' (corn pancakes), etc.

Other Costa Rican food staples include corn tortillas, white cheese and ''picadillos''. Tortillas are used to accompany most meals. [[Cookbook:Tico|Tico]]s will often fill their tortillas with whatever they are eating and eat it in the form of a ''gallo'' [direct translation: ''rooster'', however, it resembles a soft Mexican taco]. White cheese is non-processed cheese that is made by adding salt to milk in production. ''Picadillos'' are meat and vegetable combinations where one or more vegetables are diced, mixed with beef and garnished with spices. Common vegetables used in picadillos are potato, [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green bean]]s, squash, ayote, chayote and [[Cookbook:arracache|arracache]]. Often, picadillos are eaten in the form of ''gallos''.

==Drinks==
The traditional breakfast drink, besides [[Cookbook:coffee|coffee]], is called ''agua dulce'' (&quot;sweet water&quot;) and is made from ''tapa de dulce''. Sugar cane juice is boiled down in traditional ''trapiches'' and put to solidify in molds in the form of conical sections with the top cut off called ''tapas'' which can literally be translated into &quot;lids&quot;. Then some of this ''tapa'' is scraped off and dissolved into boiling water or milk to make the sweet delicious ''agua dulce''.

The traditional drinks for lunch are called ''refrescos'' or ''frescos'' for short, and consist of liquefied fruits diluted in either water or milk and sweetened to taste. They come in many varieties such as [[Cookbook:melon|melon]], [[Cookbook:blackberry|blackberry]], [[Cookbook:strawberry|strawberry]], [[Cookbook:watermelon|watermelon]], [[Cookbook:mango|mango]], [[Cookbook:tamarind|tamarind]], [[Cookbook:Passion Fruit|passion fruit]], [[Cookbook:guanabana|guanabana]] and [[Cookbook:cas|cas]].

Another popular drink is known as a ''granizado'', a [[Cookbook:slush|slush]] drink made of finely [[Cookbook:shaved ice|shaved ice]] and flavored [[Cookbook:syrup|syrup]]. The most popular flavor is ''kola''. This is not the cola usually associated with carbonated soda but a fruity [[Cookbook:cherry|cherry]] flavored syrup. It is sometimes served with evaporated/condensed milk on top depending on the preference of the drinker.

The national liquor of Costa Rica is made from [[w:Sugarcane|sugar cane]] and is called ''[[w:guaro|guaro]]''. Ticos drink ''guaro'' as a shot or mixed with juice or soda. The cost of ''guaro'' is very cheap compared to the ''cerveza'' (beer) in Costa Rica which is run by a monopoly. ''Imperial'' is the most popular and is an American style lager; the ''Pilsen'' is a Bohemian style [[w:Pilsner|pilsner]]; and ''Bavaria'' is offered in Light, Dark or Gold. The Dutch beer, [[w:Heineken|Heineken]], is also produced in Costa Rica but tastes a little different.

== History ==
[[File:Reino de los visigodos-en.svg|thumbnail|The Visigoth Kingdom before the move of the capital to Toledo]]
The Middle Ages borned in Spain with the creation of the Visigoth Kingdom in the 5th Century. It would last until 711, with [[History of Spain/Spain Divided|the conquest of Spain by the Umayyad Caliphate]]. In 409, the Roman Empire was very weak and was invaded by German People from the north. Some of these people, like Vandals, Alans, Swabians and Visigoths, settled in Spain and Portugal. The Visigoths arrived to Spain from the Pyrenees and settled in the middle of the Peninsula. The Visigoths founded a kingdom, with capital in Toulouse. Later, the capital was translated to Toledo. Between the Visigoth Kings highlighted Leovigildo, Recaredo and Recesvinto, who conquered the entire Peninsula. The Visigoths divided their kingdom in five provinces (''provincias'' in Spanish), named ducats (''ducados'' in Spanish). The kingdom was ruled by a king and each duchy was ruled by a duke. The Visigoth Kingdom disapeared in 711, when the king Rodrigo was defeated by Muslims in the Battle of Guadalete river.

== Society ==

The Visigoth society was made up by nobles and farmers. The nobles had the political and military dominion, they were the owners of the lands and they had many riches. The farmers were the majority of the population. A few were the owners of their lands, but the majority tilled the lands of the nobles in exchange of food and housing. The Visigoths adopted the Latin language, the Catholic religion and Roman laws. They lived in villages and their houses were simple. Their jobs were the agriculture and animal husbandry and they were experts in the production of objects with stones and metals.

== Visigothic Inheritance in Spain ==

The Visigoths have bequeathed to Spain their constructions and their goldsmith works. The Visigoths built simple and small romanic churches, made of stone. They producted many jewels with metals and stones.&lt;ref&gt;http://cplosangeles.juntaextremadura.net/web/edilim/tercer_ciclo/cmedio/espana_historia/edad_media/los_visigodos/los_visigodos.html&lt;/ref&gt;
